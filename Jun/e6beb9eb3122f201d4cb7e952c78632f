Nairobi county targets supermarkets, private parking and gambling to fund its Sh32 billion 2018-19 budget. Acting Finance executive Charles Kerich yesterday said the county has introduced a levy on supermarkets selling carrier bags. Private entities offering parking and gambling and lotteries will pay tax. “I will introduce a certain fee to supermarkets because it is unfair for shoppers to buy commodities adding to a certain amount and also pay for the bag,” said Kerich when he read the county budget yesterday. The new revenue measures are aimed at financing the budget which will heavily be funded by allocation from the national government. About Sh16.5 billion or 51 per cent of the budget will be funded from the exchequer. The remaining Sh15.5 billion will be generated locally. The county has since 2013 failed to hit its internal revenue target.
