In Tanzania, it is illegal for anyone to post naked or half-naked photos on social media. Well, a popular Tanzanian songstress, Nandy, was in trouble after a video of herself and another artiste identified as Billnass went viral. The half-naked Nandy and her bae are seen in bed as they share intimate moments. Magufuliâ€™s government has previously arrested video vixens for posting half-naked photos of themselves on Instagram. Talking to Word Is, Nandy has for the first time spoken about the issue and apologised to fans. She says she learnt a lot after being summoned by the police. "I apologise for the video that was leaked.The police treated me [as any normal person]. Ilikua lazima niwe chini ya polisi kwa sababu ya kitendo kilichotokea ili kulinda sheria. Lazima ningehojiwa. Mimi mwenyewe nilishukuru kua chini yao ili wadhibitishe kile ambacho walikua wanataka kudhibitisha kwangu ili niwe huru niendelee na maisha yangu. "The person who leaked the videos was found." When asked whether the person who was trying to sabotage her career was linked to WCB, Nandy said it was a celebrity but refused to reveal their identity. "No comment. Yameshapita. I forgave the person. I've moved on. Yeye anajua kwamba nimejua na polisi wote wanajua." Nandy was arrested alongside Diamond Platnumz. So, is she in love with the person she was with in the leaked video? "No. I'm not dating. Me and him aren't together. I love a man that fears God and is a hard worker." She was in the country for a media tour to promote her hit songs Ninogeshe, Kivurunge and Wasikudanganye, among others. She is set to release a collabo with a Kenyan artiste whose identity she refused to reveal. "I've already recorded with a Kenyan artiste and the video is coming soon." Nandy was spotted hanging out with singer Willy Paul in his studio Saldido records.
