Lazy road contractors in Tharaka Nithi risk losing their tenders, DP William Ruto has said. Speaking in Chuka town on Saturday, the DP said he will revoke the tenders of contractors who are too slow in completing their work. "There is a contractor who was given Chuka-Kaareni road to do and after three years he has only done three kilometers," Ruto said. He said road contractors in the county were slowing Jubilee initiated road projects. "We are also putting the contractor of Weru-Iriga road on notice. We are going to revoke his contract," Ruto warned.
