Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos will continue living in the neighbouring county, after MCAs yesterday rejected plans to build a governor’s residence. Earlier this month, the county assembly Budget and Appropriation committee proposed to allocate Sh100 million to build the official residences of the governor and assembly speaker. But the assembly declined to allocate the funds ahead of the tabling of the 2018-19 budget tomorrow. Deputy speaker Christopher Kibor said the money will be allocated in the 2019-20 budget. He said the postponement will give the assembly time to conduct adequate public participation and consultation. Plans to build a Sh50 million governor’s residence near Kamariny in 2015 hit a snag after residents rejected the project. They cited lack of consultation, saying the land was earmarked for the Kamariny Stadium expansion. Reports at the county’s finance department showed Sh6 million was spent on putting up the stalled building. “We agreed to construct the residences for the governor and speaker to cut costs on daily movement from Iten to Eldoret, where the governor lives,” Kibor said. The Arror MCA said the county will look for alternative land if residents continue opposing construction at Kamariny. Tolgos and county executives travel to Eldoret town every day. The county is said to spend at least Sh50 million annually on transport since the officers use their official vehicles. Kibor said the county assembly will amend the Equitable Development Act ( 2014 ), which provides for 60 per cent of funds to be shared equitably among the 20 wards. He said ward reps want the funds increased from Sh813 million each year to Sh1 billion in 2018-19. “The cost of construction materials and fuel has gone up and so ward allocations should be increased,” Kibor said. Two weeks ago, Budget committee chairman John Yator tabled the county’s Annual Development Plan. He said the county will stop paying rent for the governor and speaker on June 30 next year.
