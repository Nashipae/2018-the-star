A new product by Commercial Bank of Africa will help suppliers receive their payments in 12 hours as opposed to the traditional three-month waiting period. Reverse factoring will also eliminate chances of SMEs incurring debt borrowing for capital. It targets suppliers of corporate institutions and SMEs. Launched in partnership with the African Guarantee Fund and Ennovative Capital, the solution will entail having corporate buyers approve and submit their supplier invoices to CBA through an open online platform. “After submission, the bank will facilitate immediate payments to the respective suppliers,” CBA chief executive officer Jeremy Ngunze said. The financing will be 100 per cent of the outstanding invoice amount and will attract nil security. It will be processed in a maximum of 12 hours, and will be available in four currencies. Ngunze said the solution will spur growth among SMEs by availing working capital faster to enable them finance new projects.
