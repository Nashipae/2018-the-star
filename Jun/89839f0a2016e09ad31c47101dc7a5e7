Kiambu leaders will today attend a breakfast meeting called by Senator Kimani Wamatangi to address crises in the county government. Deputy President William Ruto on Friday urged Governor Ferdinand Waititu and his deputy James Nyoro to solve their problems amicably. He also urged them to work closely with woman representative Gathoni Wamuchomba and Wamatangi for the sake of county development. “You should not spend all the time to bring shame. If you continue, I will come back with a whip. The boss asked me to keep checking on you,” Ruto said.

We shall discuss the differences we may be having by asking ourselves how we can improve,” the senator said on Friday. “We must respect each other, including the roles each one of us is playing. We want to show we have done something to our county by 2022 when the President’s term will be ending.” Kabete MP James Githua urged the leaders to reconcile for the sake of the county’s needs. He spoke on Saturday when he also urged leaders to work hard to ensure President Uhuru Kenyatta’s big four agenda is achieved. “We cannot afford to frustrate our voters and the Jubilee government’s promise to Kenyans. They have a lot of trust in the government,” Githua said. Limuru MP Peter Mwathi urged the residents to pray for leaders, saying they need one other.
