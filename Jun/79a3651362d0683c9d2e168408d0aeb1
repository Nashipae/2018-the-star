Balambala MP Abdi Shurie has urged KenGen to help residents affected by spillage from dams. At least 2,000 families were affected by floods and the spillage. Shurie spoke in Balambala town when he issued bursary cheques to secondary school principals. He said one month after the spillage, KenGen is yet to help the victims, mostly farmers. “I am worried by the silence. They need to be bold enough, admit responsibility and come to the aid of the farmers,” Shurie said. In May, Masinga Dam, Kenya’s largest hydropower dam, overflowed after it reached full capacity. The Kenya Electricity Generating Company had warned that the dam was nearing full capacity and would overflow. Shurie added, “It is unfair for you to destroy people’s lives. The company should compensate the farmers.” The spillage spread hundreds of kilometres, destroying farmlands and causing losses worth millions of shillings. Maize, cow peas, onions, tomatoes, sukuma wiki, paw paws, watermelons and bananas were destroyed. Kenya Farmers Federation vice chairman Dubat Amey said if help does not come fast, the farmers will suffer greatly. Shurie urged the national and county governments and aid agencies to help. Last week, county commissioner Joshua Chepcheing’ said the national government is working with the county government and Red Cross to give farmers seeds and farm input.
