Several regions will receive heavy rain above 40mm, the Meteorological Department said yesterday in an advisory. The rain was expected to start yesterday evening until tomorrow. Central, Northern Rift Valley and Northern and Central highlands will be affected. Counties expected to receive heavy rain are Nairobi, Nakuru, Baringo, Bungoma, Uasin Gishu, Turkana, Nyeri and Kirinyaga. Others are Murang’a, West Pokot, Marsabit, Trans Nzoia, Isiolo, Nyandarua, Elgeyo Marakwet, Tharaka Nithi and Meru. Director Peter Ambenje said the rain, which will range from ‘moderate to severe’, is likely to cause flash floods in urban areas. He urged residents in those regions to be cautious. “Keep to safer ground until the flooding subsides,” he said. Heavy rain hit the country earlier in the year, leaving a trail of destruction and death in its wake. Thousands of people were displaced. The most devastating incident was the Solai Dam tragedy in Nakuru that left 48 people dead. A multi-agency report that was prepared following the May 9 incident shows the walls of the dam had cracked but the rain worsened the situation. Traffic disruptions were also experienced on major highways as a result of the rain. Ambenje warned residents in mudslide-prone regions to keep off hilly areas to avert disaster. “Residents in landslide-prone areas in Murang’a county should be on high alert,” he said. Kenyans have also been warned against walking or driving through floodwaters, sheltering under trees or near grilled windows due to the risk of being struck by lightning. Objects in open fields, trees and good conductors of electricity are highly susceptible to lightning. On March 2, a 66-year-old woman in Voi was killed after being struck by lightning as she was digging a trench near her house during a heavy downpour.
