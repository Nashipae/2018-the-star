Likoni is a crime hotspot and many residents are constantly on the exodus, looking for more safer residential houses in the island and other parts of Mombasa. The two are suspected to be members of notorious Wakali Wao and Wakali Kwanza youth gangs which steal households and personal valuables in broad daylight. In a bid to tame the gangs, police shot dead scores of the gang members in March and April this year after escalated cases of knife stabbing, murder and stealing.
