It might only be three matches into Sabastien Mignes tenure but national team Harambee Stars are quickly getting an impetus of chalking up wins. Today, they will have to do so again for the third time in a row when they face hosts India in their second match of the invitational Hero International Cup. Against many expectations, Stars came from behind to beat New Zealand 2-1 in their opening match of the four-nation tournament that also has Chinese Taipei. New Zealand were the first on the scoresheet through a strike by Sarpreet Singh in the 42nd minute. However, Cliffton Miheso restored parity at the stroke of half time. Ovella Ochieng, who starred in Kenya’s 1-0 friendly win over Equatorial Guinea the first of Mignes tenure, delivered the important goal in the 68th minute to see Kenya snatch all three points. Stars are second in the four team log behind hosts India, who edged out Chinese Taipei 5-0 in the opening match of the event. The two will face off this afternoon in a match that will decide which team temporarily occupies top spot ahead of Kenya’s final match against Chinese Taipei on June 8. Migne is expected to be on the bench for today’s tie, having arrived late for Saturday’s clash that saw Francis Kimanzi take charge. He is unlikely to tinker with the winning team for such a crucial clash that will go along way in deciding if they will be in the finals on June 10.
