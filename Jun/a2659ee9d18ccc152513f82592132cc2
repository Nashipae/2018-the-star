Nyamira County Term 2 games start today through to Friday at various grounds. The games, initially planned for Kiendege Mixed, will now be held at St. Mary’s Ekerubo, St. Paul’s Gekano and Nyambaria Boys, according to Nyamira County Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) Nyamira County secretary Okerio Nyauma. “The fields at Kiendege are in a very bad shape that is why we have decided to have all the girls games at Ekerubo, rugby 7s at Gekano and the rest of the games at Nyambaria,” he said. In rugby 7’s, defending champions Nyambaria are tipped to retain their title. Nyambaria are in Pool ‘A’ alongside Nyansababwa and Ntaba. Pool ‘B’ has Nyansiongo, Nyagokiani, Gesiaga and Gesure. In the boys’ football Under-19 category draws, former champions Kiendege have been handed an easy draw. They will fight it out with Riomego and Bonyunyu in Pool B while Rigoko, Misambi and Nyankoba will battle it out in Pool ‘A’. Pool ‘C’ has defending champions Nyansiongo, Nyagokiani, Gesiaga and Gesure. In neighbouring Kisii, the county championships will be staged at Cardinal Otunga, Mosocho from today to Saturday, according to secretary Geoffrey Nyantika. Holders Gesero start their title defence against Ibacho and Keberesi in Pool ‘A’ while Nduru, Machongo and Tambacha are drawn in Pool ‘B’. Pool ‘C’ has Mogonga, Ndonyo and hosts Cardinal Otunga. Nyabimwa, Sameta and Gianchere Friends will face off in Pool ‘D’. National boys’ volleyball champions Sengera SDA have a seemingly easy task at the county level. Sengera play Mogonga Mixed and Eramba in Pool ‘A’. Gesero, Moremani and Nyaimera will battle for a quarter-final place in pool ‘B’ while Nyakegogi, Itare and Kisii School are in Pool ‘C’.
