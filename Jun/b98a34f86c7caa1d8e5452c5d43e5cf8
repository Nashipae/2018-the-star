***** The marriage of an MP from Upper Eastern region is running into major headwinds. A mole has told Corridors that a fortnight ago, the MP and his wife had a furious row at a hotel in Embu town. It is not clear what the issues were, but the wife, according to the mole was overheard saying "I also know how to deal with you". Moments after the verbal war, the woman, who was dressed to kill, took away the car keys from the MP and drove to an unknown destination. It is rumoured that the woman may have been spending her nights in another man's home as the Toyota Prado was seen parked outside the man's compound for three days. The MP is now said to be suspecting that the man he helped arrange a wedding is the one wrecking his marriage. ***** Remember the Woman Representative from North Eastern Corridors who we told you had not been seen in public after the August 2017 election? She has finally surfaced. According to sources in the county, the politician last weekend showed up for a public event and played a major role at a secondary school. However, while the residents appreciate her resurfacing, a section have accused herÂ of discrimination, saying she only visits her strong holds and most of the projects implemented are in her rural home. ***** It is not a matter if but when. Danger is looming next to Deliverance Church Langata, where a trader has opened a pub right next to the road that leads to Nula Estate. The premises have no parking and the revellers occupy one of the lanes leaving other motorists and pedestrians to struggle to manoeuvre on the other lane. Head on collisions are imminent especially in the evenings and Saturdays when the revellers take control. Residents are now threatening to take the law in their hands unless Langata Police Station Traffic boss or the county government act fast and restore sanity. ***** Click here for
