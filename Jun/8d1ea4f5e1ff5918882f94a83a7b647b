Bungoma Woman Representative Catherine Wambilianga has threatened to lead women in a demonstration if defilement cases are not effectively handled. She said there are many defilement cases reported and the slow pace in which victims get justice is worrying. Wambilianga said many victims live in fear in the area as some of the suspects are still walking free. “We need proper justice for our girls and the punishment should be severe,” she said. Wambilianga said teachers who have been found defiling their students should face stern action. She said it is wrong for teachers to take advantage of the students they are supposed to protect in schools. “Teachers are supposed to take care and protect our daughters when they are in school, not lure them into sexual relations. Proper action needs to be taken against them,” the Woman Rep said. Wambilianga said there are two cases in which teachers have been accused of defilement but they are still in hiding and police have not traced them. She said the National Government Affirmative Action Fund has set up a rescue centre for girls in Ndengelwa, Kanduyi constituency. Wambilianga said the centre will help girls who have been rescued from forced marriages, defilement and rape. Victims will also receive counseling. “We have rescued some girls who had been married off to old men, some as third wives,” she said. Last month a Bungoma primary school teacher was charged with defiling a pupil. The teacher denied the charge before Bungoma principal magistrate Stephen Mogute who heard the case in camera since it involved a minor. The teacher was accused of defiling an 11-year-old girl on March 8. “I only learnt about it after my daughter told me about the ordeal this month,” the girl’s mother said. Medical examination showed the minor’s private parts were badly injured, the mother said.
