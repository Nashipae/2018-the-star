Bungoma education officials are on the spot over Sh54 million meant for scholarships and issuance of bad cheques to needy students. The department is unable to account for Sh180 million meant for bursary of secondary school students. The MCAs on Thursday summoned Education executive Beatrice Mayeku and chief officer Fedha Monica to explain the scholarships and bursary cash. The two were unable to table documents showing the beneficiaries or how the money was spent. They did not produce banks statements. The motion had been sponsored by Kibingei MCA Aggrey Mulongo and his Khalaba counterpart Majimbo Okumu, who sought a list of beneficiaries and how the money was spent. It emerged the cheques given to some students had bounced. Trouble started when Mayeku told the assembly she had no documents to back transactions and she had not gone through those her chief officer Fedha was carrying. “I’m praying for more time because I’m not ready with the documents. My chief officer has the documents here, but I have not gone through them,” she said. The MCAs accused the officers of trying to hide the documents. “These officers are taking us for a ride. How can they come before this house with documents then change at the last hour, saying they don’t trust their own documents?” Mbakalu MCA Bethwel Mwambu asked. The debate went on for several hours and the officers admitted they could not account for Sh54 million transferred from an account of youth polytechnics to a scholarship account. Mayeku admitted she could not account for another Sh180 million allocated for bursary in secondary schools. Speaker Emmanuel Situma directed that the officers present proper documents on Tuesday.
