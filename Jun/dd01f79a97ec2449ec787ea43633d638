The Law Society of Kenya has filed a case challenging the new cyber bullying law, making it the second such matter in court in one month. LSK says the law is targeting whistleblowers and amounts to censorship of information on runaway corruption in government. The first case was filed by the Bloggers Association of Kenya (BAK). An order suspending the law was granted by court. Yesterday, the LSK joined the association in war against the law. It said it would curtail whistleblowers and reporting of corrupt activities. The LSK said Section 14 of the law in question limits freedom to receive information or ideas as well as academic freedom and freedom of scientific research through unauthorized access to computer systems. “Whistleblowers, hacktivists, bloggers and media’s freedom under Article 34 ( 2 ) (b) not to be penalised for opinions, views or the content of any broadcasts, publications or dissemination is also infringed. “The section makes them liable to be punished for accessing or publishing leaked documents including on corruption in government,” says the society.
