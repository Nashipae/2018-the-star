A Nairobi-based trader from Othaya has distanced himself from importation of contraband sugar. Wambugu Wainaina, popularly known as Mt Kenya, yesterday said he does not trade in sugar. This came after claims one of his companies was named by the authorities. Wainaina said people have been confusing a firm implicated in the illegal trade with his firm. He said some of his friends sent him text messages to sympathise with him over his ‘problem’. “There are people who claim I’m one of those who were importing contraband sugar. The correct position is that I do not sell sugar. My company is known as Mt Kenya Hardware, not Mt Kenya Stores,” he said at Othaya CDF Hall in Othaya town, Nyeri. Wainaina was elected chairman of the Kikuyu Council of Elders Othaya chapter. “I’m a God-fearing man and like earning a living through legal means.” Wainaina urged the government to intensify the crackdown on contraband goods and the war on corruption. “If you are a public officer ensure you safeguard public resources,” he said. Wainaina warned Kenyans against condoning corruption. He said the government must be supported to end the scourge and ensure looters are brought to book. This will benefit wananchi, especially after services are improved, he said. Wambugu unsuccessfully ran for the Othaya MP seat in last year’s election.
