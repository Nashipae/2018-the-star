Several MPs and his supporters have been spending the better part of the weekend camping at the station as they demanded he be released. Among them were Nakuru Town East MP David Gikaria, Kuresoi South's Joseph Tonui and nominated MP Sammy Seroney and Nakuru County branch Secretary Mtumishi Cheruiyot. The leaders said their efforts to secure bond for the MP flopped after officers holding him said they were waiting for orders from the DPP. The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji confirmed that he had approved the charges against the lawmaker. “This is as a result of investigations by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) after a complaint from a resident was received in relation to the manner in which Arama acquired a plot in Nakuru Municipality,” the statement added. According to the detectives, the MP and four others, including the lawyer, conspired to defraud Ahmed Muhammad Nisar by means of dispossessing him of plot 6/95 on diverse dates between August 3, 2015 and August 11, 2015.
