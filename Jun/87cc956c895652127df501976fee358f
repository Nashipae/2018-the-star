The mighty fell one after the other at the World Cup on Saturday night. It was as if they were two halves of an old couple, neither of whom could live after the other had gone. First, it was Lionel Messi, vanquished by the teenage brilliance of Kylian Mbappe who scored a brace to help France see off Argentina 4-2. And then a few hours later, 1200 miles to the south at the Fisht Stadium, it was Cristiano Ronaldo, who tried extravagantly to drag his team past Uruguay and failed. Edinson Cavani demonstrated just how devastating he can be as he scored twice to send Uruguay into the quarter-finals of the World Cup. Cavani fired Uruguay into a 1-0 lead after seven minutes after he linked up brilliantly with Luis Suarez's before heading past Portugal goalkeeper Rui Patricio. But Uruguay conceded their first goal of the World Cup after Pepe header. However, Cavani struck again seven minutes later in the second half to send Portugal packing from the world football arena. This could certainly be Ronaldo's last appearence at the global soccer stage. Ronaldo will be approaching 38 years by the time Qatar comes round in 2022. Uruguay who put up a robust defensive performance in the game will now meet France in the quarter-final match. Click here for the latest political news
