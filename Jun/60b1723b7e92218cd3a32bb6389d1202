Alicia Keys has finally recognised the sweet voice of
Gracious Amani, the talented girl from Githurai who took the Internet by
storm singing to the star’s song ‘Girl on Fire’. Alicia shared the video on Instagram and wrote: “Look at this beautiful soul, shine!" Amani was first recorded by a visiting tourist, Britt Chantel, who was blown away by her melodious voice. “So before I
came to Kenya I decided to try and limit my social media usage to be
present and really take in this amazing experience with our
Influence But we’re coming to an end and I had to post this
beautiful moment!! While
finishing up one of our service projects with Fountain Youth this little
girl came up to us as we were leaving and asked to sing a song. Then
she blew us away #undiscoveredtalent. Share, share, help us make her viral!” Britt wrote on Facebook. Thomas Kwaka aka ‘Big Ted‘ is set to give a helping hand to the girl to nurture her talent after she finishes Standard Eight.
