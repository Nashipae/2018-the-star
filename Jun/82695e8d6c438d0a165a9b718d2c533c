Public Service CS Margaret Kobia and her predecessor and current Health CS Sicily Kariuki (pictured) are today expected to appear before the National Assembly Public Accounts Committee over the Sh9 billion NYS scandal. Chairman Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja) yesterday said the committee had invited the two CSs to shed light on the scam. Wandayi said the committee has also invited Planning PS Julius Muia to respond to queries raised by Auditor General Edward Ouko for financial years 2014-15 and 2015-16. “These matters being investigated by my committee are weighty. We will establish who takes responsibility between the PS and CS as far as management of public funds is concerned,” Wandayi said. “Our investigations are not related at all to what other state agencies are probing.” Wandayi said the committee will not be swayed by politicians while probing corruption scandals. “A lot of politics is going on out there, but we are not concerned. My committee has a mandate to fulfil and we will deliver because the public has a lot of expectations of us,” the lawmaker said. “My committee is not answerable to anyone out there but the House through the speaker. We only get directives from either the speaker or House plenary. The fight against corruption concerns all of us,” Wandayi said. Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru, former PS Peter Mangiti and former director general Nelson Githinji were recently dragged back to the multibillion-shilling NYS scandal. Public Service and Youth PS Lillian Omollo who is currently facing graft charges earlier told the committee her department paid Sh9 billion to suppliers as pending bills from her predecessors. Omollo told the committee her office paid the suppliers Sh6.2 billion in the financial year 2016-17 and Sh2.8 billion in 2017-18. She said she paid an additional Sh6.6 billion to cohorts, an amount that had accrued for three years before she assumed office in December 18, 2015.
