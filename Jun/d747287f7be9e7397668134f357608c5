More than 500 bags of sugar have been seized in Kajiado in the widespread crackdown to rid the market of illegal and contaminated products. The 500 bags of sugar packed in 50kg sacks were seized in wholesale and retail outlets. Security agents led by county commissioner David Kipkemei on Wednesday raided outlets in Kitengela, Isinya, Il Bissil and Kajiado towns. Tonnes of unlabelled sugar, cooking oil, biscuits and rice were seized. Four people found repackaging sugar at a store in Kitengela town were arrested. “We have impounded thousands of kilograms of sugar and contraband goods. These goods are from Brazil, Zimbabwe and Uganda and are repackaged here in Kenya. I want to warn those selling contaminated sugar that they will be arrested and charged,” Kipkemei said.
