The hearing of Embu Governor Martin Wambora’s appeal against the nullification of his win has been adjourned to July 3. This was after Justice Sankale ole Kantai recused himself from the case on Tuesday. He said someone called him in an attempt to influence the outcome of the case. "I am withdrawing from this case because one person approached my friends concerning this case. I am personally aware of the sensitivity of this matter." "Please senior counsels, advise your clients to keep off judges," Sankale told lawyers. He sent the same message to the litigants in the case saying, "Please tell your wives and daughters to keep off judges." The Appellate Judge was hearing the case alongside Justices Patrick Kiage and Fatuma Sichale at the Court of Appeal in Nyeri. This is the second time the case has failed to kick off for lack of quorum, the first being on May 21 after lawyer Wairimu Rugatia, representing Deputy Governor David Kariuki in the case, was unable to appear in court. The court was informed she had broken her leg and was schedule to undergo surgery on the same day the hearing was to start. Lawyer Lucy Mwai, who Rugatia had sent to represent her in the case, sought for more time to familiarise herself with the case. Wambora’s win at the August 8 polls was nullified by the High Court on February 22 after a successful petition filed by former Senator Lenny Kivuti. He appealed the ruling on March 20 and sought orders from the second highest court to set aside the ruling and strike off the petition. Wambora faulted Justice William Musyoka of the Embu High Court for ruling that the governorship election in the county was marred by massive irregularities that compromised the integrity of the electoral process.
