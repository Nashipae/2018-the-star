Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia has asked the national government to devolve disaster response operations to counties. He said on Friday that most counties lack capacity hence the poor response to incidents such as the FlySax plane crash. The county spoke at the Lee Funeral Home where families of the ten FlySax plane crash victims gathered to view the bodies of their loved ones. The bodies will be released to the families for burial after pathologists conclude DNA tests on them. They were transported from Njambini on Thursday evening after a standoff over payment of youths who assisted in the recovery mission. The lot demanded payment saying they manoeuvred the dangerous Aberdare hills in order bring the bodies to an area where they could be transported. Kimemia lauded the rescue team for the operation which took three days saying that it was a dangerous and uneasy task due to the weather. He said that over 1,000 youths braved the steep area, dangerous wildlife, and bad weather to get the bodies to an area where they could be transported.
