A nine-year Standard Three girl from Baringo North who is reported to have been defiled by a 24-year-old man on June 9 has fallen sick. This comes a week after her father got depressed and is admitted to hospital for mental illness at Baringo County Referral Hospital. He was frustrated after failed attempts to have his daughter’s attacker arrested. “My daughter is sick at home. Her condition worsened on Sunday,” the mother told the media at their home on Monday. According to an earlier medical report, the girl’s health condition was fair. The minor said she was defiled by a person known to her. Baringo North police boss Ndiema Chemongis said officers are looking for the culprit. The suspect dropped out of primary school two years ago, and residents said he has been terrorising young girls in the village. The man is also accused of defiling another minor in the vilage last year. His family pleaded for the matter not to be reported to authorities. The subcounty DCI has been blamed for laxity after failing to arrest the suspect.
