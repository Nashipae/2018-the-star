   Abuses against children are on the increase in the North Rift region. Most cases are in Eldoret town where at least eight cases are reported every week. Nick
Omito from the Center Against Torture (CAT) yesterday said many children were
exposed to child labour and sexual abuses. Omito
asked police to arrest culprits, saying most cases were unreported. Uasin Gishu county commissioner Abdi Hassan (pictured) said perpetrators will not be spared. "We have given firm instructions to chiefs and police to ensure that all cases are handled with the seriousness they deserve," Hassan said. Police in the town are still searching for a suspect who defiled and killed a two year old girl at Fly Over area last week. Mother
to the child Esther Chepkorir says she caught the suspect who is a boda
boda operator on a bed in house where the child had died. Chepkorir says the suspect who is well know in the attacked her before escaping in darkness. Police
in the region are also searching for a pastor accused of defiling and
injuring his step daughter for several month at Kapsoya Estate. Kapsoya area police boss William Adung says the pastor had gone underground after learning he was being sought. The girl is admired at a hospital in the town for treatment. Omito
police officers and members of the public should be sensitized to take
seriously cases of abuses against children in the region "We have
gone out and met with senior police officers to impress upon them on the
need to handle the cases professionally so that we protect children
from such abuses", he said.
