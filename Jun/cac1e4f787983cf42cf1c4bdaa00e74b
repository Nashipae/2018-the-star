The 10 people who had been on their way from Kitale to Nairobi when their plane crashed died from similar injuries. This was the finding by Government Pathologist Johansen Oduor who conducted postmortems on Friday. "The bodies had similar injuries to the heads, chests and limbs, a clear indication that the deaths were as a result of the crash," he told a press briefing. He said, however, that some samples were taken for further analysis. Oduor said he conducted the examinations with the homicide team from the DCI, officers from the Government Chemist, Red Cross, National Police Service and a team from FlySax which operated the ill-fated plane. He added that all the bodies had been identified and that families could collect them from Lee Funeral Home for burials. The  5Y-CAC aircraft took off from Kitale airstrip in Trans-Nzoia county at 4.05pm on Tuesday. It was expected to fly for an hour and 15 minutes and touch down at the JKIA in Nairobi at 5.20pm. It was last seen on the JKIA radar at 17.20 pm, according to Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCCA) and FlySax. The wreckage was sighted on Thursday morning by an aerial search team. President Uhuru Kenyatta mourned the dead and condoled with their families and friends, promising them full government support.
