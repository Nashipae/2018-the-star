The government has partnered with the World Bank to open five centers of excellence for youths in Technical Vocational Education and Training institutions. The six-year project will cost Sh6 billion. The first batch of trainees will start training in January next year. Vocational training PS Kevit Desai said trainees will be equipped for employment and entrepreneurship. The centres are based in Thika, Kiambu, Naivasha, Kakamega and the Coast. “In Naivasha, KenGen will handle renewable energy training, including geothermal. We plan to have an automotive plant in Thika, food and beverages in Kiambu, a construction plant and a maritime centre in Coast for the blue economy,” Desai said. One centre is at Olkaria geothermal spa in Naivasha.
