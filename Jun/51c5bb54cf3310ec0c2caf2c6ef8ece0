Tana River Woman Representative Rehema Hassan has threatened to move to court and stop the multi-million construction of Garissa subcounty office in a disputed land in Bura. Rehema said the land in question belongs to a widow, who inherited it over 50 years ago, but land cartels in the Garissa government want to grab it. She told reporters at the site of disputed land that leaders from from the two counties must convene an urgent meeting to iron out the differences "before they get out of hand". “Land is an emotive issue and if not addressed with a sober mind, it might result in lose of lives,” Rehema said. “This kind of dispute has resulted in the loss of lives for our youths in the past. We are not ready to go that route again,” she said. The MP cautioned the contractor against commencing the job until the issue is conclusively addressed. “I am disappointed with some legislators from Garissa county, whom we had agreed to work together. They are insincere,” she said. Ali Umuro, a local headman said his community owns the parcel of land on both sides of the river contrary to what Garissa county maintains — that the River Tana is the boundary between the two counties. Umuro said security officials are siding with the "grabber" by providing protection whenever an issue about the land arises. "They recently arrested the son of the widow, even after being attacked by six men over the issue,” he said. But in a rejoinder, county secretary Abdi Muhumed and Lands executive Mohammed Shale dismissed the claims, saying the parcel in question was right in Garissa county.
