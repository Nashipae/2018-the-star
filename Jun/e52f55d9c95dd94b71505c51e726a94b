Police in Mombasa have arrested two people in a rice syndicate. The two, who are suspected owners of a godown in Shimanzi area of Mombasa, were found repackaging the allegedly expired rice. The Weight and Measures state department working together with police raided the godown. Weight and Measures national director Michael Onyancha yesterday said the two, who are of Somali origin, will be charged with trying to misinform consumers. “What is happening here is illegal. We found these people repackaging the rice. The original bags said the rice was to expire in September 2017. They have now changed it to read September 2018,” he said. “We are going to invite other state departments in charge of quality and anti-counterfeit to come and investigate this consignment further.” The over 1,000 bags of rice were intercepted. “This is not a one-day exercise. We shall be moving to all godowns to ensure consumers are protected. We cannot allow these people to cheat Kenyans into buying expired products.” Urban OCPD Eliud Monari said the godown will be cordoned off.
