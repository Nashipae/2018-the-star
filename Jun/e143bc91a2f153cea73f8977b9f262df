Kakamega Homeboyz’ new head coach Paul Nkata’s first assignment is to ensure the Kenyan Premier League side grabs regional accolades at the next month’s SportPesa Super Cup tournament. Kakamega open their campaign against Tanzanian giants, Yanga this weekend. Team manager, Boniface Imbenzi, confirmed that the Ugandan tactician has taken over from Mike Mururi, who resigned earlier this week. Mururi, who was suspended alongside his assistant Peter Okidi, technical director Alfred Imonje and medical assistant Crispinus Mukanzi, decided to call it a day at the club. Imbenzi said Okidi’s suspension is being reconsidered and he might be assigned lighter duties on the technical bench. Imbenzi appealed to Homeboyz fans to give the new coach time to see what he has up his sleeves. He will be working with his Ugandan assistant Hamza Kalanzi and Imenzi believes the two have enough experience to catapult the team to greater heights. “Mururi led us to a fifth-place finish last year and this season, he has pushed us to joint seventh which is a very good show. We really appreciate his efforts and wish him well wherever he goes,” said Imbenzi. Mururi said he resigned to look for greener pastures. He said he would have left earlier but he put the interest of the players first. He said he is happy he is leaving the team in a better state than he found them.
