The fight against corruption requires urgent enactment of a law to protect whistle-blowers, Transparency International-Kenya has said. The group proposes amendment of the Bribery Act 2016to ensure all government institutions and private companies have a whistle-blower protection system. Executive director Samuel Kimeu yesterday said the Act’s provision limits whistle-blowers’ protection mechanism to law enforcement agencies, leaving out other stakeholders. He spoke during the launch of the TI-Kenya Business Integrity Country Agenda report (BICA-Kenya) in Nairobi. Kimeu said, however, the Office of the Attorney General is finalising a draft Bill seeking to protect whistle--blowers in mega scandals.
