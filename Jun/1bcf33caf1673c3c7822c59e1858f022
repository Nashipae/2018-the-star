Suspects in the National Youth Service scandal have been denied bail so they will remain in remand until the end of their trial. The Tuesday decision by the Anti-Corruption Court concerns the loss of Sh468 million. Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti noted that the economic crimes the suspects have been accused of committing are serious. Among the 41 people who have been remanded are Public Service PS Lilian Omollo and NYS Director General Richard Ndubai. Omollo and Ndubai are accused of approving fraudulent payments of millions of shillings to several firms involved in the scam. Four members of the Ngirita family in Naivasha, whose companies were allegedly paid more than a half of the NYS cash in question, have also been in remand. The DPP pushed to block the suspects’ bail application, saying they were flight risks and would likely interfere with evidence. The first batch of suspects - 23 - was charged on Tuesday last week while another 20 were charged on Monday. The charges range from abuse of office, conspiracy to commit economic crimes, willful failure to comply with applicable laws and theft of public property.
