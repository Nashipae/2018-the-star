The Busia assembly's Budget and Appropriations Committee was disbanded on Wednesday following a demand by MCAs. The committee had been under the stewardship of Nangina MCA John Obwogo. It was disbanded in a notice from Speaker Benard Wamalwa. MCAs complained that the team accused them of demanding bribes of Sh1.5 million each to allow the tabling and passing of the 2018/1 budget. Last week, Obwogo issued a statement accusing MCAs of demanding the amounts. He also alleged that some assembly committee chairpersons had been lobbying and getting bribes to increase departmental budgets.  Busia County residents participate in a protest following the disbandment of the Budget and Appropriations Committee, June 20, 2018. /JANE CHEROTICH The MCAs said they were not fully involved in the budget process.Â They and Governor Sospeter Ojaamong refuted the allegations that were raised by Obwogo. During celebrations to mark the International Day of the African Child on June 16, the Governor said the claims were figments of bloggers' imaginations. "I had a meeting with the 53 MCAs to discuss programmes to be included in the budget, which will benefit residents as per their demands in the revised County Integrated Development Plan," he said at St Benedict's Budalangi High School. "MPs elected in the last election are learned and have no lust for wealth. The MCAs I have know their work. We are working together for the benefit of residents." A group of residents staged protests, some in support of Obwogo and other in opposition to the alleged demands for bribes.
