Nyamira woman representative Jerusha Momanyi has promised Deputy President William Ruto the region will support his 2022 presidential bid. Speaking in Nyamira county on Monday, Jerusha said the region has faith in Jubilee governance. “We are your sycophants and you should never be afraid at all. This region is strongly deep into your leadership and we promise that you will be our leader come 2022,” Jerusha said. Kitutu Masaba MP Shadrack Mose said the government has done visible development projects and should be given another opportunity to serve Kenyans. “The Deputy President has demonstrated that he is able to lead this country. We, therefore, have every reason to support him and ensure he is President come 2022,” Mose said. He lauded the DP for his efforts to ensure the campaign promises Jubilee made are accomplished. Other leaders who accompanied the Deputy President are North Mugirango MP Joash Nyamoko, Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, his Nyamira counterpart Amos Nyaribo, Nyamira speaker Moffat Teya and a number of MCA’s from Nyamira. Ruto was in Nyamira to commission a radiology lab at Gucha Level 4 Hospital in Keroka and Nyangori water project in Kitutu Masaba. He addressed a gathering at Rigoma market. Maangi said the only way the Gusii region can win in 2022 as a community is to follow Ruto for he is the right candidate for the top job, and warned those who will not follow him will "lose terribly". “Whoever who will not follow Ruto will be lost, and that is a fact. As the Gusii community, let us follow this man, who has demonstrated leadership at this stage. I promise you our community will benefit more if we follow him in the 2022 race,” Maangi said.
