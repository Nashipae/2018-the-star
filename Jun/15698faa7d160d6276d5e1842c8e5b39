Five GSU officers were killed and three others seriously injured yesterday after their vehicle ran over a landmine in Harhar, Liboi. The 8am explosion occurred when the officers were on patrol a few kilometres from the Kenya-Somalia border. The vehicle was ripped apart and rolleD several times. The injured were treated at the Liboi KDF camp. Garissa county commissioner Joshua Chepchieng said they would be airlifted for specialised care if their conditions worsened. The bodies were ferried to Nairobi for identification by their families. Security officers said al Shabaab militants must have planted the explosive. “We have lost our officers. Kindly give us more time to piece information together,” Chepchieng said on the phone. Dadaab deputy county commissioner Harun Kamau said reinforcements had been sent to pursue al Shabaab. Chepchieng urged residents to help with investigations so attackers can be punished. The attack comes barely a week after Liboi leaders and residents voiced concerns over the disappearance of about 10 people. They accused the police of being behind the kidnappings. Security forces deny the accusations.
