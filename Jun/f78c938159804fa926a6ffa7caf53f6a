A chief in Kitui has said a Sh10 million water project in the his area will help curb sexual harassment of girls. “This project will save me the headache of handling frequent cases of rape of girls from Kyalamoko Primary School. It is a sorry state of affairs,” chief Wambua Mbiti said. The Umba location location administrator in Mwingi Central said the Kyalamoko borehole project is a godsend. The project is done jointly by the county government of Kitui and Amref. He spoke during the launch of the project on Friday. Mbiti said he receives many complaints of rape by girls going to fetch water from Enziu River.
