A former Embu governor candidate has denied agreeing to step aside for Governor Martin Wambora if fresh elections are held for the seat. Kithinji Kiragu, who came third in the 2017 poll, said he hasn’t met Wambora after the election. He said a photo being circulated on social media showing him and Wambora in an office was taken in 2015, not recently as purported. Kiragu said he has not said he will run again because no fresh election has been announced. Wambora’s election was nullified on February 22. He appealed against the ruling and the hearing is scheduled for next Tuesday in Nyeri.
