STEPHEN ASTARIKO/ Residents of Madogo in Tana River have issued a 21-day ultimatum to Tana Water and Sewerage Company to restore supply or have their offices closed. Led by civic leaders Webo Abadiba abd Salat Garacha, the residents accused the company of neglecting the town. They said such neglect contributed to a recent cholera outbreak that left 78 people hospitalised. Residents said they did not understand why the firm has not paid its staff for six months. They said the Madogo office was remitting a minimum of Sh400,000 per month. “The interest of TAWASCO is to fleece the residents of Madogo. They do not to improve water services,” Wedo said. He said staff salary amounted to Sh150,000. “Where is the money collected from Madogo going if not to individual pockets,” Wedo said. Wedo asked Governor Dhadho Godhana to sack TAWASCO managers, saying they were the stumbling block to improvement of services. “The governor should personally visit Madogo to have a firsthand glimpse of what is happening in the town. Residents are suffering because they lack clean and safe drinking water,” he said. Residents of Madogo pay a fixed rate of Sh1,700 for domestic use while those in Hola, Garsen and Bura pay Sh500 for the same service.New water connection cost Sh10,200 in Madogo. The charges are Sh2,500 for other towns. Wedo asked the company to harmonise the rates. Garacha said seven boreholes meant to serve Madogo were still supplying water to Garissa town.
