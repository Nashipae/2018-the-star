Detectives in Nakuru on Tuesday rescued an eight-year-old child who was abducted five days ago. Five people were arrested in connection with the abduction of Patience Waweru at Pipeline estate in the outskirts of Nakuru town. Unknown people waylaid the girl after she was dropped by a school van. News of the missing child was widely shared on social media prompting a sting operation by DCI officers from Nakuru. The two main suspects - Ann Kimani, 32, and Elizabeth Mugo, 35, had asked for Sh300,000 as ransom to free the girl. "After abducting the child, they took her to one of their friend's home in Kabatini and put her under house watch," a source close to the family said. Elizabeth went to a family friend under the guise her husband had chased them away with 'her daughter'. Oblivious of the plan, a friend, who is also under investigations, housed the two. Elizabeth asked for a ransom from parents of the child and transferred the money to Ann who stays in Pipeline. Bahati OCPD Edward Wafula said the suspects, that is Ann and Elizabeth, will be arraigned on Wednesday. Wanjiku’s parents could not hold back tears after they were informed of the successful operation. The pupil was taken to Nairobi Womens’ hospital in Nakuru for medical check-up.
