Regional airlines are expanding to new routes and increasing their fleet in a move likely to shake Kenya Airways’s dominance. Yesterday, Reuters quoted Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni announcing plans to revive the defunct national carrier. “We have already booked slots for the manufacture of medium and long– distance planes,” he said. Budget airline Jambojet is also likely to be affected having introduced double daily flights to Entebbe in February. On Tuesday, the Ethiopian government announced it will privatise Ethiopian Airlines among other state owned corporations as it aims to expand its economy. COMPETITION FOR US FLIGHTS The airline - a close competitor of Kenya Airways - acquired its 100th aircraft (Boeing 787 dreamliner) this week becoming the first African airline to reach the milestone. Kenya Airways operates 40 aircraft within and outside the region. While Kenya is preparing to make its maiden nonstop flight to the US in October, RwandaAir announced yesterday it has received a nod from Washington to fly to the US through a code-share agreement. This makes competition for direct flights to the US between the two airlines stiffer. This is ahead of a final audit of the Kigali International Airport by the US Federal Aviation Administration scheduled for September. The administration conducted a final audit on Jomo Kenyatta International Airport last month as Kenya Airways ahead of KQ’s October flights. Kenya Airways yesterday began its four times a week flights to Mauritius. “This is part of our strategic intent to expand our footprint across Africa. We expect to grow tourism for both countries,” chief operating officer Jan De Vegt said. KQ last month announced 26 new weekly routes from JKIA, across Africa and Europe. In Tanzania, Julius Nyerere International Airport is set to receive a new terminal by end of this month, as Air Tanzania plans to add more flights to Kenya and other East African nations.
