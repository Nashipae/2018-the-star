The first group of Cuban doctors is expected to in the country at about 10 pm on Tuesday and the second on Thursday. They will fly KLM from Amsterdam and land at the JKIA in Nairobi at 9.50 pm. Their facilitation will be through Terminal 1A. The 100 doctors will fill gaps in the delivery of special services in all counties, which will get equal numbers. County governments will take care of their housing and transportation costs while the government will pay their salaries. Meanwhile, a case has been filed in court for the government to be compelled not to import the doctors. Petitioner Samson Miango said the government did not conduct a survey to establish that Kenya has a shortage of specialists. The doctors will need to be cleared by the Kenya Medical and Practitioners and Dentists Board. They will work hand-in-hand with their Kenyan counterparts to roll out a range of medical services that are expected to radically change how a large number of life-threatening diseases are managed. Universal healthcare is one the four pillars that President Uhuru Kenyatta has prioritised in his second term. Details:Â Inside the Kenya-Cuba doctors deal Click here for the latest political news
