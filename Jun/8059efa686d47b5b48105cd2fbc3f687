The Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital has increased its ICU beds to 20 from six. It will also receive two Cuban doctors to boost health services. CEO Wilson Aruasa yesterday said the new ICU includes four units put up by the Uasin Gishu government. He said they have state-of-the-art machines that will handle patients effectively. “We are developing this hospital for the future so it continues offering the best services to patients,” Aruasa said at the hospital during the opening of a modern kitchen for the facility. Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago presided over the event. Cherangany MP Joshua Kuttuny also attended. The team also inspected the new units and a new microwave incinerator built for Sh100 million in partnership with the Belgium government.
