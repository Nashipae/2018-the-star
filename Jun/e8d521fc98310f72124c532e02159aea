Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko on Wednesday treated Muslims in Nairobi to the first-ever Iftar hosted by a public figure at the City Hall. “The contribution by the Muslim community to this county and our country at large cannot be disputed. For this reason, my government is proud to be associated with it,” Sonko said. He invited Deputy President William Ruto and NASA co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka to the event as a show of unity after the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga.
