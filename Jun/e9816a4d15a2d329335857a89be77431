Former Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has said the political fight between the incumbent Ferdinand Waititu and his deputy James Nyoro was a shame to the county. Kabogo said in an exclusive interview with the Star that the two leaders should focus on service delivery. “It’s a pity that the leaders have chosen to wash their dirty linen in the public,” Kabogo said. "People want good leadership, service delivery and peace." Waititu and Nyoro have engaged in an open fight that has seen the local complaint of poor services from the county government. His remarks come five months after the governor publicly lashed out at Nyoro. County officials told the Star that Nyoro’s office has been closed on numerous occasions leaving him to operate from outside. “Waititu has been holding meetings and making key decisions without consulting or including me,” Nyoro said yesterday during an interview in a local radio station. Nyoro has blamed Waititu for making key county policies without consulting him. Nyoro singled out the Delmonte and Drunkards rehabilitation projects as part of the programs he has locked him out. Kabogo asked the two leaders to sort out their differences so that they can focus on building county and addressing issues that affect the people of Kiambu. He told the two county bosses that voters were interested in service delivery and not sideshows. “They need to work and deliver for Kiambu. There are high expectations,” he said. Kabogo who has focused his eyes on a national seat has avoided getting entangled in the county politics. “It’s sad that we wake up every day to issues reported on social media like the pathetic state of the hospitals, lack of meds and bad systems,” he said. On Monday, the DG said he will not tolerate the frustrations any longer. “I will not resign or step down,” he said.
