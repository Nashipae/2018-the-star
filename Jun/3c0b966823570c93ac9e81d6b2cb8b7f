Lilian Muli is really enjoying her pregnancy journey. The sexy TV lass is expecting her baby number two any time now. In a recent interview with Word Is, she talked about her experience with this second pregnancy, saying she had neither had any complications nor morning sickness for the entire journey. "The only craving I have is for Oreos and Ribena," Lillian said. Well, the popular TV presenter and anchor has not shied away from showing her growing baby bump to her numerous fans. Lilian, who is in her third trimester, is currently on a baby moon at the Swahili Beach Resort. "This baby moon was so important to me because I needed time to reflect. I’ve been up and down and just felt so exhausted all of a sudden. I also needed time to think about my future plans, bearing in mind I am carrying my second child. Securing my children’s future is my top priority," she told Word Is. She went on to talk about the pregnancy photoshoot that has broken the net, highlighting what inspired it. "My pregnancy photoshoot was inspired by the fact that I didn’t do it during my first pregnancy and have always wondered why I did not. Pregnancy changes a woman. You may not believe this if you are pregnant, but it is such a beautiful season for a woman, and you need to embrace it and celebrate it." In one of her recent baby bump photos, she wrote: "Loving yourself is an important way to learn how to Love others. Self-love means feeling good about yourself and having the compassion to embrace your flaws. So take yourself on a nice date and know you are enough."
