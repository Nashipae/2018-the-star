Tottenham midfielder Victor Wanyama was among Kenyans on Twitter who turned up on Friday for the #KOT5Aside football tournament at Ligi Ndogo grounds. Wanyama, who is in the country following the Premier League season break, arrived at the venue around 4.40pm, accompanied by media personality Shaffie Weru and Royal Entertainment CEO Juma Maulindi. Wanyama said he was pleased to have joined other tweeps in the tournament, and congratulated Theeka FC for emerging victorious. The 5-aside was also attended by media personality Sheila Mwanyigha. The tournament was organised by Alex Kyalo and sought to bring together all Kenyans on Twitter to have fun through playing football. “We just wanted to have fun, exchange banter, make new friends. I didn’t expect the turnout and support to be this huge when I first talked about the tournament, but I am glad tweeps came out and we enjoyed ourselves,” he told Word Is. “Of course I would love to host another 5-aside. It's fun so we are looking forward to the next edition and hopefully we can have more ladies in the team.”
