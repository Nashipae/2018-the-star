A patient who underwent the first Kidney transplant in Embu county has died,doctors at Embu level five hospital said. The deceased, 39 year old Anthony Njiru Ndwiga , a teacher at Karurumo Primary School, died a few hours after receiving the kidney from his brother, Moses Muriithi on Friday. The delicate procedure that took more than five hours was done by a team of ten specialists from Moi Teaching and Embu level Five hospitals. Renal surgeon Philip Cheptinga said one of the recipient’s blood vessel had a clot which hampered the flow of blood from the heart to the Kidney. "After completing the procedure the patient was moved to the Intensive Care Unit where he was recuperating."Cheptinga said. Cheptinga said a post-mortem would be done on the deceased's body to establish the cause of death. Muturi Mwombo who chairs the county assembly's Health Committee said they would summon the hospital’s CEO Moses Njue and County health executive Jamleck Muturi, to explain if the hospital had the capacity to carry out the procedure.
