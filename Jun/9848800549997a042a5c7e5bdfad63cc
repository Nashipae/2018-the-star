Cotu has threatened to move to court to oppose the decision to kick them out of the National Hospital Insurance Fund board of trustees. Secretary general Francis Atwoli on Thursday said they will mobilise workers not to make contributions to two State agencies – NHIF and National Social Security Fund (NSSF) – if they are not represented at the boards. Appearing before the National Assembly Health committee, he opposed the amendment to the NHIF Act, terming it “illegal”. “If they say Cotu will not be included on that board, we will move to court because you cannot go to somewhere where there is traditional brew and start enjoying with those old men if you were not invited,” Atwoli said. “I assure you we will source for a good attorney and pull out of NHIF. So long as we are not in those boards, they will not see a single cent from us. I’m sure about that.” The amendment seeks to axe five directors that represent Cotu, the Federation of Kenya Employees, the Kenya Medical Association, faith-based organisations and teachers’ union. They will be replaced by nominees fronted by the Health Cabinet Secretary to the agency, which collects more than Sh30 billion from workers annually. The amendment states, “Delete and substitute therefore the following new paragraph… five persons appointed by the Cabinet Secretary based on relevant knowledge and experience in the subject matter.” The amendment is sponsored by the government through National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale. “Appointments to the NHIF board should be done at the constituency level,” Atwoli told the committee session chaired by Kesses MP Swarup Mishra.
