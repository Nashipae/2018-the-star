Saboti MP Caleb Amisi wants the government to set aside Sh400 billion annually for unemployed youths. Amisi plans to table the motion on the funds in Parliament.  “The population of unemployed youth is approximately 10 million. If every youth receives Sh10,000 in every quarter, or after every three months, we will address many problems,” he said. The Saboti lawmaker wants the Social Assistance Act amended to accommodate his proposal to cushion jobless youth. He adds that the amendment will allow youths to access government stipend that will, in turn, reduce crime.
