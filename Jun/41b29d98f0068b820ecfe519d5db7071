Employers and employees will have extra time to file tax returns without any penalty if MPs pass the Finance Bill 2018. Kenya Revenue Auhority domestic tax assistant manager Jeremiah Kinyua yesterday said the proposed change repeals Section 25 of the Tax Procedures Act 2015 and replaces it with the new provisions. The proposed amendment states that a person required to submit a tax return may apply in writing to the commissioner for an extension. He spoke during a public sensitisation forum in Mombasa. However, this must be done 15 days before the due date for monthly returns, which is the 20th of every month for employers, and 30 days before the due date for annual returns, which is June 30 for employees. The deadline for this year is on Saturday. Kinyua said the extension applies only once, meaning one cannot apply for an extension twice in the same month or year. “If successful, this removes the responsibility of having to pay the penalties for late submission,” he said. The commissioner may grant or reject the application depending on whether or not they are satisfied that there is reasonable cause. Under the new proposals, the commissioner shall then notify the applicant at least five days before the due date. “In case there is no communication five days before the due date, the application shall be assumed to have been granted,” Kinyua said. He, however, said failure to file returns even after the extension will attract a penalty of five per cent of the tax payable or Sh10,000 (whichever is higher) for monthly taxes. For annual taxes, the penalty will be five per cent of the tax payable or Sh20,000 (whichever is higher). KRA head of corporate policy Morris Oray said, “The amendments are meant to address, for example, areas of inequity in terms of taxation.” Local companies that charge demurrage charges are required to file returns and pay taxes at the end of every year, while payments made to non-resident persons are not subject to tax, he said.
