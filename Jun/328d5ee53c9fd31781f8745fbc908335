A Kinangop man has been arrested for allegedly defiling his two daughters aged 12 and 14 for about three years. Area chief Magdalene Kariuki confirmed the incident saying the suspect will be arraigned once investigations are complete. The father of six was arrested on Monday at his home in Mikaro village following a tipoff by family members. According to police, the suspect would threaten the minors with unspecified action if they reported the abuse. “The two minors have been taken to hospital where tests will be conducted to ascertain whether they were abused before the suspect is taken to court,” Kariuki said. According to a resident Simon Muraya, the minors had on several occasions shared the ordeal with their classmates. “They have been living in fear for long but his proverbial days have come and he will have to spend the next part of life in jail,” he said. Meanwhile, shock and disbelief gripped residents of a Naivasha estate after a newborn baby was found dumped by the roadside. According to a resident Magdalene Wanja, residents were alerted by screams from the infant who had been hidden in a bag. “We took the minor to Naivasha sub-county hospital where he is recuperating and we are asking members of the public to report any woman who may have delivered but does not have the baby,” she said.
