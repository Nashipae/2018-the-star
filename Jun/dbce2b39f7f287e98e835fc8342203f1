Yesterday EACC bosses were in Parliament defending their track record (see P6). The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has been under fire for not doing enough to fight corruption. Powerful forces are saying it should be disbanded, probably so they are no longer monitored. Activist Okiya Omtatah filed a case to strip the EACC of its investigative powers. That would make it a toothless bulldog. There are many other government institutions that have done little to fight corruption. Is anyone saying the DCI or Director of Public Prosecutions should be disbanded? The EACC argue that they have been providing files to the DPP which have not been acted upon. We have entered a new era where the state appears to be actively cracking down on corruption. New leadership at the DPP and DCI is playing a part. Let's also give the EACC a chance to show what it can do in this more responsive political environment. If it fails now, then its critics will have a right to demand for change.
