More than 800 vulnerable children and orphans whose parents died during the Pokotâ€“Turkana conflict have been awarded Sh3 million bursaries. Benefiriaries live in the Turkwel belt (pictured), West Pokot. The Northern Rangelands Trust and Tullow Oil Company, through Pello and Masol community conservancies, came to the rescue of the children whose education was on the line because of frequent attacks. Many students dropped out, they said. Rangelands Trust North Rift coordinator Titus Peghin said education will end backward practices such as cattle rustling.
