â€‹A businessman facing forgery charges and criminally possessing 504 bullets, has been acquitted after forensic experts failed to testify. The experts were to take to the stand and admit that Noor Mohamed forged his sister's signature to acquire her Sh100 million property. In his judgment, Mombasa chief magistrate Julius Nang'ea ruled that there was no need for key witnesses to testify in the matter in which Zahara Pote is the complainant, thus acquitting Mohamed. In 2009, titles of three of Pote's properties were altered to reflect her mother as the "owner". She reported to police. However, three years later, a Kadhi's court in Mombasa ordered Mohamed to get two-third share of their late "mother's properties". The court said Pote should get a third of the total share. The forged signature that made mother Shuni Haji the "owner" triggered the order. "The manager of the Barclays Bank of Kenya, Digo Road branch, Mombasa should release the amount in the deceased's account to this court in favour of 'Judiciary-Mombasa' for distribution to their heirs in the above mode," Sheikh Athman said the January 16, 2012 order. In 2016, Mohamed schemed to have his sister and her husband, Allen Pote, a former US soldier, deported. He planned to plant 504 bullets in their house near Coast Provincial General Hospital. The plot was thwarted and DCI detectives arrested him with the ammunition. Deputy DCIO Francis Kipsang told the court in April this year the accused wanted to frame her sister so she would be arrested. Forensic document examiner Martin Kitavi concluded the signature giving Mohamed the lion’s share was not Pote’s. On Tuesday, Nang’ea called the evidence woefully inadequate to place him on his defence. “He is hereby acquitted of the charge under Section 210 of the criminal code. The cash bail deposited may be refunded,” Nang’ea said. Click here for the latest political news
