Amos and Josh are back to doing music and have dropped two new songs. The incredible pair is still soaring high. During an interview with Adelle Onyango on Kiss FM's breakfast with the stars, the duo said it has not been easy. Amos and Josh were thrust into the limelight thanks to their endearing show of talent on Tusker Project Fame 6 in 2013. They have since grown into recognisable brands in Kenya and East Africa. "First people think that we got money from TPF, but we actually went home with experience. We had to hustle like any other artiste to create our foundation," they said. "The first time we heard our music played on radio we were in church. Imagine we could not believe that our song was already on radio? Then when we released our next single, Baadaye. This time we got people tweeting about the song and then Maina Kageni heard it and he started playing it on Classic 105. I mean it has been hard but we thank God we are somewhere now." They are working on an album, which will be released in August. "We have never broken up, but we have been quietly working on our album...We took a break from music but now we are back." What have they learnt since they last dropped a song? "The break was necessary, we can say that for now, but we will try and explain it through our album. In the music industry there are a lot of voices telling you to do this and that."
