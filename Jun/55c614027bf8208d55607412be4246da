The government has asked Moi Girls' school students to soldier on as measures are being put in place to ensure their security. Kibra deputy county commissioner Nyamumbo Sese asked the students to forget what had happened and move forward. He told the learners that "the challenges such as the one they had faced should strengthen them." Sese said the government has put in place measures that will ensure students are secure in their learning environment. "Trust the government's resolve to make sure that they learned in a safe and secure environment,"Sese said. Sese made the remarks when he addressed more than 1,000 students at the school's compound on Monday. The students reported back to the institution, which was closed for one week over a rape incident, on Sunday.
