The government should assign armed police officers to guard all boarding schools, a teachers' union official has suggested. Nyeri Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers executive seretary Patrick Mwangi blamed the government for poor security in schools. He said teachers are often blamed when things go wrong. Speaking to the Star in Nyeri town yesterday, Mwangi said the state is quick to point fingers when fires, deaths and attacks happen in schools. He cited the incident at Moi Girls School in Nairobi in which intruders entered the school and defiled a student. Mwangi said "teachers are innocent. He said their names have been spoiled, and have been portrayed in bad light. Mwangi said teachers are role models and should be given respect. He said just the way politicians are given armed security, students equally deserve protection. “It is unfortunate that people wait for a disasters to happen and then they start looking for solutions. It is not right to have untrained security officials guarding schools,” he said. “When you go to the homes of politicians, you will find armed police officers, yet the same services are not provided for students who are our future leaders,” he said. Mwangi said schools do not have good fences because the government put a limit on how much fees schools charge. As a result, many schools are insecure, he said. Mwangi said since the state promised to giver subsidies to parents, it should fence schools.
