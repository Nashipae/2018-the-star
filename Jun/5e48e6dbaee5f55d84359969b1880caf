A man has been arrested after he allegedly strangled his 64-year-old friend to death over Sh50 debt. Charles Ogutu, 42, from Ndegwe village in Gem sub-county was arrested on Saturday night by irate villagers who then handed him to police. According to area Chief Barrack Opondo, the deceased Peter Awinja is said to have sold timber for Sh1,200 after which he invited Ogutu for a drink at a busaa den at Sirembe trading centre. The duo spent about Sh200 at the drinking den before they moved to another one within the village. It is at this one when Ogutu turned against the old man demanding for his Sh50. The chief said Awinja who had a Sh1,000 note, told Ogutu that he did not small cash or change to pay him. This irritated Ogutu who jumped on his neck and strangled him to death. While confirming the incident, Opondo said that the old man’s body has been moved to Yala sub-county hospital mortuary to await post-mortem. Click here for the latest political news
