Kenyan Premier League new boys Wazito FC have signed four players as they seek to keep their top-flight status. The Frank Ouna led side confirmed the signing of Derrick Onyango, Ferdinard Wanjala, Tyron Owino and Simon Mburu. Onyango was a free agent while Wanjala joined from KCB, Owino was previously at Sony Sugar while Mburu was attached to Posta Rangers. Wazito had recently lost some of their top talents including prolific striker Piston Mutamba, Joe Waithira and Haron Nyakha. Team Manager Bramwel Makotsi added that the club is still focused on adding a few quality players when an opportunity comes by. “We have signed Derrick Onyango, he was a free agent, we have also managed to bring on board Ferdinand Wanjala from KCB, Tyron Owino from Sony Sugar and Simon Mburu. They are players with experience and I believe they will add quality to the team,” said Makotsi. “If we get more good players, we will definitely sign them, we want to be better.” Meanwhile, Ulinzi Stars head coach Dunstan Nyaudo has faulted his striking department for their 2-0 loss to champions Gor Mahia over the weekend. The Soldiers started the match brightly, creating chances which put the defending champions under pressure, but lack of composure in front of goal came to haunt them. Nyaudo has promised to work on their weaknesses going into the next match. “I blame my strikers for this outcome. They had many chances to score but they did not take them. The pressure, as a result, turned to my defence and we ended up losing the match,” said Nyaudo.
