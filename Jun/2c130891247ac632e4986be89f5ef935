President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday has led the nation in mourning Migori Senator Ben Oluoch, saying he was a true patriot. Oluoch, a former KBC and Ramogi radio presenter died on Monday night at the MP Shah Hopsital in Nairobi. The 52-year-old was battling throat cancer. In his message of condolence to the family and Migori residents, Uhuru said Kenya has lost a great leader who served his country with commitment and devotion. He said Oluoch preached peace throughout his career as a journalist. He never shied away from standing for what was right, President Kenyatta said. “Indeed, Senator Oluoch was keen on uniting Kenyans. That’s why when he joined politics, it was easy for the people to elect him," Uhuru said. NASA leader Raila Odinga said Oluoch "remained cool" despite the pain of cancer. Raila told Ramogi FM yesterday the senator showed bravery in his battle with the disease. "He was focused and loved his community, with a firm belief in the welfare of the electorate," Raila said. Oluoch was elected on the ODM party ticket. "We've lost a dedicated life member," Party secretary general Ediwn Sifuna said. Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja, MPs Babu Owino, Alfred Keter, Esther Passaris, Samuel Atandi, Mark Nyamita and Tom Odege also mourned Oluoch. "He facilitated my election," Odege said.
