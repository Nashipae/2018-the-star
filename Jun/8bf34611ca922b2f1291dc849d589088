Hundreds of people were locked out of the venue of Madaraka Day celebrations in Kinoru Stadium, Meru county on Friday. The terraces reserved for members of the public were filled up by 6am. Area MP Rahim Dawood said the space cannot accommodate residents eager to follow the proceedings. "We hope the gates will be opened after the military parade ends," he said adding that even MPs from the county missed the chance to sit close to the president. He said they have been reserved seats behind those of Cabinet Secretaries. Dawhood said the county, despite the space constraints at the stadium, is grateful to host this year's fete.
