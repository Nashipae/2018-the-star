Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja has asked DCI Director George Kinoti to speedily find the root cause of fires at Gikomba market. In a letter to Kinoti on Thursday, Sakaja noted that many fires have been reported in the city. "I am writing to request your office to institute immediate thorough investigations and form a special team to find out the actual causes of these fires," he said. "The manner and frequency of these fires is suspect and the number of lives and value of property lost cannot be assumed or wished away." The Senator said those responsible should face the law if investigations unearth foul play. He said his office was willing to offer support. Meanwhile, Governor Mike Sonko's silence on the fire has raised eyebrows. It is not clear where the Governor is but the people want answers as several leaders have condoled with the victims and called for through investigations and measures to prevent recurrences.
