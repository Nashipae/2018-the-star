Several MPs have criticised DP William Ruto for saying he is investing in heaven when questioned about tours and harambees, especially for churches. Led by Tiaty MP William Kamket and Kisumu Central's Fred Ouda, the lawmakers said Ruto should be in the lead when government officials undergo lifestyle audits. "There are leaders running around the country and unfortunately getting quoted saying they are investing in heaven. If they are investing in heaven, then by God's grace when we get there we will find them. But knowing what they are doing on this earth, some of us will rather go back to hell," Kamket said. While Ruto has previously said he acquired his wealth by what he describes as hustling, questions regarding his wealth have persisted in the recent past. Earlier on Wednesday, the Deputy President said he was ready for the audit.

"We cannot have people amassing wealth in dubious manners and within a short times they think they can buy everything and everybody. We shall make laws very soon," he said. On the crackdown on contraband goods, Ouda said investigators should narrow down to the owners of the companies in question before presenting reports to the house. "We are not interested in the companies but the faces behind the companies. We have no problem with those in clean deals. We shall hunt down the orhers," he said.
