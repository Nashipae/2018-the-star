The insurance industry is on a rebound after last year’s poor performance, latest data from the sector’s regulator shows. General insurance firms recorded significant growth during the first quarter of this year backed by a decrease in claims and higher premiums. Data from the Insurance Regulatory Authority shows profits in the general business category rose to Sh1.2 billion reversing a Sh986.75 million loss over the same period in 2017. Gross premium income increased 4.21 per cent to Sh43.31 billion while underwriters paid Sh13.97 billion in claims. This is a 4.31 per cent drop from claims incurred over the same period last year. Insurers have over the years suffered huge losses as a result of high claims coupled with increased management expenses and commissions for the acquisition of new business. Commissions from general business policies grew 4.5 per cent to Sh1.63 billion, while management expenses rose 6.89 per cent to Sh7.18 billion. The biggest gainers in the general life business were the motor commercial PSV insurance class which grew 27.4 per cent with premiums worth Sh1.1 billion followed by the personal accident class growing 14.6 per cent to rake in Sh1.28 billion worth of premiums. The medical class remains the top performer in general business with premiums valued at Sh15.31 billion collected during the review period. Underwriters are still struggling to fully exploit benefits of marine cargo insurance which grew 8.7 per cent with premiums worth Sh1.13 billion. Marine cargo insurance business is estimated to bring in Sh2.2 trillion. Insurance premiums collected for the review period stood at Sh65.24 billion during the review period, 66.4 per cent of which came from general insurance business. During the first quarter long term insurance business which constitutes life insurance suffered net losses of 64.08 per cent due to increased benefit payments and management expenses. Gross premium incomes grew marginally by 1.29 per cent to Sh21.93 billion. Payments to beneficiaries of life policies grew by 15.17 per cent to Sh11.71 billion while management expenses increased by 15.34 per cent to Sh3.45 billion. Bima Intermediaries Association of Kenya chairman Washington Ndegea told the Star a reduction in commissions especially in the long term business was cause for alarm as there is no direct sale of policies in the life insurance line of business. “We need to find out why commissions are going down especially because agents are the ones who handle life insurance. Firms don’t sell these policies directly,” he said.
