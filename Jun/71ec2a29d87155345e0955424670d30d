Uriri MP Mark Nyamita yesterday said the national government should close down all private millers involved in supplying contraband sugar. Nyamita said recent police swoops that have seen tonnes of sugar impounded is a clear indication the industry has been neglected. The contraband sugar impounded in the county has no mercury, but high content of Copper and lead, Kebs said on Thursday. The new revelations deepen the controversy surrounding the “poisonous sugar’ already flooding the Kenyan market. “The private sugar millers mushroomed without due diligence. They are to blame for the collapsing government millers,” Nyamita said. He said it is unfortunate that unlicensed sugar penetrated into the market, to kill the industry. South Kanyamkago MCA Graham Kagali urged the government to stop protecting sugar barons. He said irregular traders should have their licences withdrawn, especially if they have not invested in cane growing. They spoke at a funeral in Owich village, Uriri constituency. Nyamita said, “There was no budget allocation for the sugar industry, compared to coffee, tea and miraa.” He said farmers and workers at Sony Sugar Company go for months without pay, while contraband sugar is impounded. “private millers have been poaching cane from government firms and directly importing and repacking the product,” Nyamita said. The legislator appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta to declare the sugar crisis a national disaster. There is need to facilitate the mopup of all imported sugar out of the local market, Nyamita said. “The President should push for sugar sector regulations and stop importations that hurt local companies and farmers,” he said. The two said it is unfortunate that police in Migori on Wednesday impounded nine trucks ferrying 4,720 bags of sugar to a private miller before being repackaged and sold. Rongo subcounty commissioner Joseph Satia said traders told the police where the sugar was being taken.
