Harambe Starlets captain Wendy Achieng have exuded confidence that the national team will overcome visiting Equatorial Guinea in an Africa Women Cup of Nations second round qualifier at the Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos, tomorrow. David Ouma beat against Football Kenya Federation women’s Premier League leaders Thika Queens 5-1 in a build up match on Saturday and it is from this showing that Achieng is deriving all the positives. The Spedag defender observed that winning at home will be crucial in furthering their chances of advancing into the next round of the championship. “We have prepared well and a win against the league leaders ­Thika is a boost heading into the match against Equatorial Guinea. We are keen to start the campaign with a home win as that will ease our chances away. I want to urge our fans to come out in large numbers and support us,” noted Wendy. Ouma added: “All the department’s are working in unison. However, we want to ensure the midfielders are able to cover wide areas but all in all we are looking forward to a good match and better result.” Should the East Africans win the two legged fixtures, they will return to the event for the second time having made a debut last in 2016 in Cameroon.
