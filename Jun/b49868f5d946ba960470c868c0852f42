A man accused of killing his brothers’ three children has confessed to the murders and asked for forgiveness. Enock Onsane, 28, has been charged with killing Clifford Nyambane, Dan Nyamweya and Glen Ongagi on May 13 last year. The children were aged six, five and three, respectively. Onsane has been remanded at the the Eldoret GK prison. His brother James Ratemo on Wednesday told Eldoret High Court judge Stephen Githinji that Onsane called him and pleaded for forgiveness. “He confessed that he was involved in the murder of my children,” Ratemo said. The bodies of the slain children were found dumped at River Nzoia near Moi’s Bridge in Eldoret West. They were buried in May. Onsane made his confession a week after the burial, Ratemo said. He told the court that the suspect had quarrelled with his wife Ebby Esaji prior to the tragedy. Ebby had accused Onsane of sleeping with the househelp and getting her pregnant. “He sent threatening messages to my wife after he knew that I was aware of the pregnancy,” Ratemo said. Githinji was forced to adjourn the hearing to June 27 after Esaji was overcome with emotions. She had narrated how the children went missing shortly after she escorted them to church in Kapsoya. “I was to join them later. When I arrived, I found them missing. A cousin told me that their uncle had taken them to town,” Esaji said.
