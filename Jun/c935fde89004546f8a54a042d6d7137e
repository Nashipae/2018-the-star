Pressure continues to pile on Governor Mike Sonko to nominate a deputy after his attempts to front lawyer Miguna Miguna apparently flopped. The seat fell vacant in January following the resignation of Polycarp Igathe. He said he had failed to earn Sonko’s trust. Yesterday, some residents of Mukuru slums demanded he nominates former senator aspirant and Taj Mall proprietor Ramesh Gorasia to the position. They said the county is grappling with many challenges due to lack of a substantive deputy governor, as Sonko has a lot in his plate. Mukuru residents said services have almost ground to a halt in the area. They said Ramesh understands their problems. “There are many problems here including garbage, poor drainage and lack of water. We believe if he appoints Ramesh, some of these problems will be solved,” resident Isaiah Omweri said. Three days ago, Woman Representative Esther Passaris said she is ready to relinquish her seat and take up the deputy governor post. “If we do not fight poverty in this city and other critical issues, then we are all doomed. The state of hopelessness is too high and the governor needs an able deputy,” Passaris said on Tuesday. On May 16, Sonko nominated Miguna as his deputy, sparking a backlash from some Jubilee members and MCAs. They argued he was not a member of Jubilee Party and has not regularised his Kenyan citizenship.
