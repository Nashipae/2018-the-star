The National Transport and Safety Authority has begun a nationwide refresher course for matatu drivers to reduce road carnage. Already 20 Saccos have benefited from the training being carried out by NTSA and the traffic police department. Coordinator of the training Samuel Nyaribo said the three months exercise targets all PSV drivers in registered Saccos and seeks to end unruly behavior in the sector. The senior NTSA official spoke during the training for New Naivasha Nairobi United Services Sacco drivers at ACK church hall in  Naivasha. He praised the NNUS for the initiative it has undertaken to keep drivers disciplined.
