Former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo yesterday testified in a case in which an elderly woman is charged with trespassing on his land in Eldoret. Mary Muya, 70, is accused of refusing to move out of the land since 2015. The prime land measuring about 10 acres is estimated to cost Sh300 million. The land – Eldoret Municipality Block 141167 – is registered under Kuza Farms. Jirongo is the chairman. Njoki has denied the charges. Through her lawyers, she said she owns part of the land. Jirongo told Eldoret chief magistrate Charles Obulutsa the title was charged at the collapsed Post Bank Credit where his firm has a Sh1.2 billion loan. He wants to sell the land to repay the loan.
