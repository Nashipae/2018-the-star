The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission now says
the 2022 elections might delay due to timeline constraints. Chairman Wafula Chebukati said on Tuesday that this follows the lack of quorum at the commission
which does not allow them to make any key decisions. Of key concern, the polls body boss told MPs, is their incapacity to make recommendations on the
boundary review, "which might affect the 2022 election." The chair said this when he appeared before Parliament's Constitutional
Implantation Oversight Committee. Chebukati told the Jeremiah Kioni-led committee that the
commission currently comprises of three commissioners as opposed to required quorum of five. He said that though the commission has made some progress
on the boundary review, they are stuck between whether to use the 2009 census or
wait for the 2019 population count. According to the Constitution, the commission is mandated to
review the boundaries after every 8 years. Click here for the latest political news
