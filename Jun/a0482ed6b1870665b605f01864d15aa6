According to AK Baringo County chairman, Barnabas Kitilit, the youngsters will be flying the county’s flag ahead of next week’s Central Rift regional championships to be staged at Moi University School of Law, Annex. “Baringo is well known for nurturing talent and we expect a big turn up,” said Kitilit. Elgeyo Marakwet, also known as ‘Home of Champions’ will stage their championships at Iten grounds while Uasin Gishu will host their show at Moi University School of Law, Annex. Nandi County athletics family converge at Kapsabet Show ground. Rhonex Kipruto and Mathew Kimeli are expected to highlight the Elgeyo Marakwet county meet after impressive performances in New York Road Runners Marathon on April 29. Kipruto clocked 27:08 to smash a 27:35 course record set by Leonard Komon in 2011. AK Keiyo North official Kiprop Simba said event will take place at the Lorna Kiplagat high altitude training field. Simba said Iten sports ground is still flooded after heavy rains. “We have settled for high altitude training field because Tambach TTC grounds will host school games,” he said.
