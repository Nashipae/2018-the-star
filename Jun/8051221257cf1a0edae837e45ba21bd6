Five officers who made final contact with Alexander Monson before he was killed will be charged with murder, the court has said. Alexander, the 28-year-old son of British peer Lord Nicholas Monson, died from blunt force trauma to the head after he was arrested in a car outside a nightclub in the Kenyan beach resort of Diani in May 2012. Senior principal magistrate Richard Odenyo said officers Naftali Chege, John Pamba, Charles Munyiri and Ismael Pamba should be held responsible for the death. Odenyo said the officers tried to cover-up their deeds which were however contradictory to their written statements. He noted that the officers tried to bring up a narrative that he died from drug overdose, a fact that was contested by pathologists and post-mortem reports. The judge said even if Alexander was a drug addict or a criminal, he did not deserve to die. "Alexander's death was not a natural death, his life was cut short by the police, therefore, DPP should prosecute the officers," he said. Alexander died on May 2012 while under police custody at the Diani police station in Kwale county. He had developed breathing problem before he was rushed to Palm beach hospital where he died.
