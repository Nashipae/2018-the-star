Media guru and former Ngewa MCA Karungo Wa Thang'wa, known for his eloquence as well as his love for country music, has been nominated to attend the Swaziland annual country music festival in July. "My love for country music started way back when growing up," he said. "We were brought up where the radio belonged to the father, but being a cheeky child, we would take it when my parents were away. That is how I came to learn about Kenny Rogers and other country music artistes. "Presenting country music for me came as sheer luck at a Kikuyu radio station. The person who was doing news at that particular time was on leave, and I sat in for him for one day, which later turned out to be permanent. "Kenyans love country music, and so when I joined Gukena FM to do the show, they really listen. In Swaziland, I am going to learn more about country music. I think I am the best in country music presenting in Kenya, and I can invite anyone we do a marathon. Others chipped in when I left media." Media life for Karungo started when he was in college. "I applied in several English stations but probably my diction was not good. The moment I went to a vernacular station, they gave me the job that same day. It is a hobby and that is why whenever I go back, I fit in wherever I am. I have been in radio for over 15 years."
