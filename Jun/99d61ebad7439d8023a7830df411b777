Wajir MCAs yesterday promised to put aside their differences that have crippled business for the past few months. The MCAs said they are following in the footsteps of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga’s handshake. Led by Mohamed Abdullah of Malkagufu and Hussein Yaqub (nominated), they said the differences have hurt development. “We have decided to lead by example. These wrangles have gone on for far too long and are not helping matters. We are now reading from the same script,” Abdullah said. He said they want to regain the trust of the people who elected them by action, not mere words. Yaqub said the MCAs will pass a supplementary budget of Sh300 million tomorrow to handle emergencies. “All the 48 MCAs are ready to pass the supplementary budget without any conditions,” he said. They spoke to the press in Wajir town. Leaders and residents have time and again expressed concern over the prolonged standoff between the MCAs and the executive. At some point, some residents threatened to move to court to have the assembly dissolved. They accused the MCAs of failing in their mandates of legislation, representation and oversight. In February, Wajir assembly staff recorded statements with the police following chaos that erupted in the chambers. Members from Jubilee and NASA engaged in fistfights. It is alleged the MCAs were unhappy with the executive’s decision to interfere with party affairs. It was claimed the executive replaced names on the public service board with their cronies.
