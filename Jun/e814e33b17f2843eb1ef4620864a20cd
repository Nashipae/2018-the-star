“We urge that Kenya’s
Judiciary take swift action, consistent with the rule of law, to ensure fair
trials and justice,” the said. This rather
condescending statement suggests they have bought into the view it is the Judiciary
that lets “criminals” off the hook. The Judiciary can only try the cases
brought before it.  They can only convict
on the basis of the evidence presented. The DPP says he has “watertight cases”
against 64 NYS suspects. To get people convicted, he must convince the court
beyond reasonable doubt â€• not some far-fetched imaginative doubt, but a
reasonable doubt. The last time there was a major NYS prosecution, the court
said the evidence was just not good enough. Far too many people
assume if a person goes to court, they must be guilty and the court should
convict. But lawyers will tell you of the many times DPP lawyers come to court
ill-prepared, or the police have simply not done their work properly. Sometimes
people suspect that the “incompetence” is actually deliberate. BUT WHAT ABOUT
‘ANTICIPATORY BAIL’? Some people have been
saying they are pleased to see the suspects at least spending several nights in
Industrial Area prison before trial because they fear they will never be
convicted. It’s understandable. Remember
the pleasure many people felt when those MPs and a senator had to stay a night
in Muthaiga police station? What happened about that? Well – the DPP said there
was not enough evidence and dropped the cases. So did the police do a bad job,
arresting people against whom there were no charges or did protests in Narok
persuade the authorities not to proceed with prosecutions? Anyway, it is not
surprising that ordinary people think that important people do not get
convicted, or even prosecuted. Some problems come
because the police, as Justice Mumbi Ngugi once put it, sometimes “arrest
first, and seek to investigate later”. The normal sequence of events ought to
be the police investigate, decide the evidence points to a suspect, seek the
advice of the office of the DPP as to the strength of the evidence, and only
then arrest the suspect. They are supposed to be in a position to inform the
suspect at the time of arrest why they are being arrested. Courts ordering bail
even before arrest is allowed in India under the Criminal Procedure Code. But
it should not be necessary in Kenya. Under our Constitution, accused persons
can be released on bail when charged for any offence. In fact, they should be
granted bail unless there are “compelling reasons” against it. And the DPP’s
office must convince the court not to grant bail, not the accused persuade it
otherwise. I, therefore, first
wondered why the NYS suspects, charged in court on a Tuesday, were still locked
up by the weekend. The media said their applications for bail would be decided the
following Monday. But if they were still in prison, their applications had been
refused. On what basis? Then this week, the magistrate refused bail, lecturing
them on the gravity of the offences for which they have not been convicted.
What happened to innocent until proved guilty? The issue was well argued before
the court, and the magistrate ignored the official guidelines on bail, which
clarify that the seriousness of the offence is relevant because it may affect
the likelihood of the accused disappearing. It does not justify detaining
accused to punish them when they have not been found guilty. Some guarantee of their
turning up is supposed to be achieved by asking them to deposit what may be
substantial sums of money as security. The most important guarantee is probably
the difficulty of disappearing. Bail can also be refused because they are
likely to interfere with witnesses, or commit another crime (both of these hard
to decide if they have no record of crime, and are really treated as innocent
until they are proved guilty). And bail can be refused if the police still need
to carry out investigations and releasing the accused may interfere with
this.  This really ought to be rare
because, as we said, the police are supposed to investigate before they arrest,
not after. The Miguna case showed
how determined the police can be not to comply with court orders. The problem
is that neither the police, nor, it seems, some magistrates, can be relied upon
to apply the Constitution correctly. If this were not the case, the High Court
would not find it necessary to grant anticipatory bail. When they do so, the
courts will usually also say, “You must respond to the police request to
interview you”.  HOW ABOUT COURTS
STOPPING PROSECUTIONS? Similarly, if the police
and the office of the DPP followed correct procedures, high courts would not
find themselves asked, and sometimes feel compelled to agree, to stop
prosecutions. One problem has been the reluctance of magistrates to listen to
constitutional arguments. High courts have stopped prosecutions for various
reasons including that a criminal case seemed to have been used to put pressure
on a party to a civil case about the same matter, or that the accused person
had been led to believe that he would not be prosecuted, an understanding that
had been violated. Or it might be because the law creating the offence is
unconstitutional. The High Court declared
in 2015 that provisions of the Security Laws Amendment Acts creating new crimes
were unconstitutional because, for example, they violated freedom of expression
or fair trial rights. Again, sections of the new cybercrime law were recently suspended;
they too are challenged for unconstitutionality. In these cases, no particular
person had been charged with any offence. But if a person is actually charged
with an offence that may be unconstitutional, and the magistrate’s court is
unwilling to listen to arguments to that effect, it makes practical sense for
the accused to go to the High Court. The alternative is to wait to be convicted,
then sentenced, and maybe a year later get the appeal heard and perhaps succeed
in arguing that there should never have been a conviction at all because the
offence was all the time unconstitutional.  THE NYS SAGA Around 30 people are
arrested and taken to court at the same time, having been dragged from their
beds in the middle of the night the way one imagines happens in fascist states. I hope the DPP is right
that he has watertight cases. If so, how come it dovetails so neatly with
what’s in the media and the President’s protestations about dealing with
corruption? It is very worrying when the criminal process seems to be used for
political advantage. The DPP is an
independent officer, and makes the decision whether to prosecute, and cannot be
directed by anyone else. It is also a matter of concern when a newspaper says:
“With Uhuru’s support, DPP Haji goes for big fish”. The DPP should not seek the
President’s support. Do the Western envoys realise this? And the President has
other things to do: He needs to be considering how government policies and
actions may be encouraging corruption, and how to change this. Too often, grand
gestures are made about dealing with crime, especially corruption. But
convictions depend on painstaking and detailed investigations, and presentation
of the evidence, with all the t’s crossed and i’s dotted. If that has been done
then the courts will surely play their part. But playing their part does not
mean ignoring the constitutional rights of accused persons, including to bail,
perhaps trying to show how tough the courts are being. It is at times like this
that the judges need especially to be independent and to be seen to be so.
