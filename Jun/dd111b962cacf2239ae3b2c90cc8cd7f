Citizen TV pair Kanze Dena and Lulu Hassan have TV chemistry. But unfortunately, Kanze Dena is leaving Citizen TV for a job at State House. The mother of one was appointed deputy State House spokesperson yesterday by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Lulu Hassan has shared the best memories spent with her co-host and narrated their life journey. "I remember us sitting and giggling nervously when the news was broken to us that we were the top anchors in the country, 4 years in a row. 4 years of holding our breath, perusing through news of the day before going on air, holding frantic conversations and arguing on random things. Nobody knows what it is like to be an anchor like those who have to go through the process."
