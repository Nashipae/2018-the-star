The Kisii government will review its Bursary Fund policy to align it with guidelines to match implementation of free day secondary school education. Bursary Fund Board chairman John Onyiego said orphans and people with disability will be given priority. Governor James Ongwae said only deserving cases will be allocated funds. He launched the disbursement of Sh135 million in bursaries to more than 40,000 students. In previous disbursements, students in day secondary schools benefitted from the County Bursary Fund. In January, the government scrapped the Sh9,374 paid by students in public secondary schools each year, paving way for complete free day secondary education.
