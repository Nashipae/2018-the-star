President Uhuru Kenyatta will not attend the 31st African Union Summit in Mauritania to attend to "urgent state matters". Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma will represent him in Nouakchott, State House Spokesman Manoah Esipisu said a statement issued on Friday. The summit will be the culmination of South Sudan peace talks. Early this month, Uhuru travelled to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the IGAD-led South Sudan peace negotiations. He and other regional leaders met South Sudan President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar. Kiir and Machar met last week in Khartoum, Sudan, for their second round of talks, hosted by President Omar al-Bashir. The communique of the 32nd Extra-ordinary Summit of IGAD heads of state indicated that the two will have their third phase of face-to-face talks in Nairobi. Details: Uhuru to host Kiir, Machar in peace talks The South Sudan leader signed a peace agreement Wednesday including a ceasefire to start in 72 hours, Sudan's foreign minister said, but rebels rejected other parts of the deal. The framework agreement came ahead of a final settlement and will allow access for humanitarian aid, prisoners to be freed and a transitional unity government to be formed after four months. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the civil war that broke out in late 2013 when troops loyal to Machar, the former Vice President, launched a rebellion against the government. All sides in the now complex and multi-faceted war stand accused by the United Nations and other bodies of committing atrocities against civilians.
