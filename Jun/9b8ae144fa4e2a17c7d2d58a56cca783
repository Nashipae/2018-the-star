Embu senator, woman representative and the Majority leader have expressed concern over rampant rape, defilement and murder cases. Senator Njeru Ndwiga, Woman Rep Jane Wanjuki and majority leader Michael Njeru said they are saddened by the reports, especially those involving children. Some elderly women have been raped and killed. The three leaders spoke separately, condemning the perpetrators of the crimes and asking the police to arrest them. They urged residents to share information that will lead to the arrest of suspects. Families have been known to hide family members who are criminals. Ndwiga warned that they may be attacked by the criminals they seek to protect. He accused the police of laxity and criticised short sentences imposed by the courts. The senator added that those found guilty of sexual offences, sale of drugs and illicit alcohol should be punished harshly. “These crimes are not ordinary. Consumption of illicit brew and drug abuse have turned youth into criminals,” Ndwiga said. He added that illicit liquor and bhang are sold in Embu, while the police, chiefs and their assistants do little to prevent it.
