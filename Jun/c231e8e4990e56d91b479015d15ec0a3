The removal of Catherine Mturi from the helm of the Kenya Ports Authority is a clear indication the government does not have the Coast at heart, Kilifi North MP Owen Baya has said. Speaking in Kilifi on Saturday, Baya said none of the parastatals at the Coast are led by a local. “These parastatals manage Coast resources but look who is managing them. The only parastatal which was being led by someone from this region was KPA and she was asked to step aside,” Baya said. Mturi was sent on compulsory leave over ‘failed leadership’. She was the first woman to head the authority but was abruptly removed on Wednesday last week. Daniel Manduku replaced her.
