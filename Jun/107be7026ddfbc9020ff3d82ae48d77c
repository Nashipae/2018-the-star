The phone in your hand is most probably fake, this is according to the Communications Authority. Director general Francis Wangusi yesterday said close to 70 per cent of all phones in use are are fake. The fake phone dilemma coupled with the use of unregistered SIM cards, according to Wangusi, pose a massive security problem. He directed mobile operators to immediately suspend the use of all SIM cards whose registration status is incomplete. The DG said while it is unclear how many unregistered SIM cards are already in circulation, there are an estimated four million others in the custody of mobile operators.  DETECTION DEVICE NOT USED He said the authority has so far arrested 62 SIM card hawkers, charged 34 who were fined while arrest warrants have been issued for others. Nairobi, Siaya, Nyeri, Mombasa and Limuru were identified as the trouble spots. Hawking of SIM cards attracts a Sh500,000 fine, a one year jail term or both. Mobile subscribers using unregistered SIM cards will be fined Sh100,000 or imprisoned for six months for providing incorrect information. Wangusi said efforts by CA to detect fake phones through a new Device Management System has stalled for one year after this was challenged in court by those who termed it a spy tool on subscribers. At a media conference yesterday, Wangusi denied claims that the DMS was established to capture mobile users information. “DMS is meant to facilitate denial of service to counterfeit devices, and therefore protects consumers from the dangers of using substandard devices and ensuring that ICT users get value for their money spent on mobile devices,” he said. The device was purchased at Sh400 million, but has never been used because of the ongoing court case. The system previously used by the regulator is outdated and can not track fake devices. Wangusi said CA will the appeal the High Court ruling terming it a National security concern.
