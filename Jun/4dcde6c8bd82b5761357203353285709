The Kikuyu community has no preferred candidate for the 2022 presidential election, elders have said. Kikuyu Council of Elders chairman, Nyeri chapter, David Muthoga yesterday said the community will negotiate with all presidential candidates and support whoever will give them a better deal. He criticised politicians pledging the community’s support for Deputy President William Ruto in 2022. “We shall not rely on any politician to negotiate on our behalf, because most of them will be after their own personal interests,” Muthoga said. He said the community has not sent anyone to negotiate with the Deputy President.

He spoke in Othaya subcounty, Nyeri county, yesterday during a meeting with Kikuyu elders from the subcounty. The community, Muthoga said, owes no one and will welcome any candidate seeking to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta for negotiations and support the one who will offer the Kikuyu better terms.

Ruto is a good person and very supportive to our President and we love him. He is one of the candidates we expect to negotiate with during the electioneering period.” Muthoga urged area politicians to stop politicking and focus on development. Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu has been of the same view, but this is the first time elders from the area have spoken on the issue.
