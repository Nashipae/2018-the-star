Nominees to the Kisumu County City Board will be vetted today even though some residents are unhappy with the list. According to an advert in the local dailies, the nominees will be vetted today and tomorrow. The exercise will be conducted by the Committee on Appointment before the names are forwarded to the assembly for approval. Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o during his campaigns promised to form the board since his predecessor Jack Ranguma failed to do so. In a letter dated April 12 to the clerk and signed by acting county secretary Olang’o Onudi, Nyong’o nominated 11 people to the board for vetting and approval. The nominees in the individual member category are Lawrence Gumbe, John Ombija, Kennedy Akoko, Charles Ochome, Elijah Adul and Rose Olende. Peris Ochola was nominated to represent professionals. Former nominated MCA Salim Ahmed was nominated to represent the private sector. Former Kisumu mayor Samuel Okello was to represent an association of towns. Sheila Okal was named to head a cluster of registered neighbourhood associations. Sagar Navichandra was nominated as a representative of registered associations in the informal sector. Mid-last month, a section of residents said the nomination was skewed. They said there was nepotism and favouritism. Kisumu Residents’ Voice Association chairman Audi Ogada claimed some represented sectors in which they were not shortlisted for interviews. He said the youth were once again left out. But on Friday, Nyong’o expressed confidence in his nominees, saying the team will help to complete the relocation of the Kachok dumpsite to Kajulu.
