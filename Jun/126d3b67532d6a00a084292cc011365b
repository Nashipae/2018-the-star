Heavily armed CID officers raided the Ngirita family home in Naivasha on Sunday. It is not clear what they were looking for. The officers opened up manholes and sewer lines, leaving the family shaken. Five companies are linked to the Sh9 billion National Youth Service scandal. They previously received millions of shillings from the government in flagged transactions. Lucy Ngirita, the mother of Ann Ngirita, who received Sh59 million from NYS without delivering anything, received Sh5.4 million for supposedly supplying canned beans.

They later left in a hurry after learning the raid had been reported to the local police. A relative who declined to be named said the officers arrived in three vehicles. They broke down the gate to gain entry. The relative said the officers seemed like they were looking for something specific. They went from one manhole to the next and tried to get inside the main house. “There was no search warrant. We came to learn from neighbours that the officers were already in the compound and we suspect something sinister,” the relative said. The detectives left in a hurry after the family started calling lawyers. The family criticised what they termed harassment from the authorities. A source at Naivasha police station confirmed the raid but said they were not involved. “We are yet to know what they were looking for at that time of the night,” the officer said.
