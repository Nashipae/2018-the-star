West Pokot teachers have accused politicians of interfering with education. Knut secretary Martin Sembelo said politicians issue blanket condemnation of teachers whenever one of them was at fault. He cited Ortum Boys High School which was closed after students went on strike demanding to be given KCSE exam leakages. Politicians have condemned the incident. “Politicians should stop tarnishing names of other schools where everything is working smoothly. They should stick to development,” Sembelo said. He spoke to reporters in Kapenguria on Tuesday. He asked heads to enhance security.
