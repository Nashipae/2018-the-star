A 25-year-old woman was on Saturday arrested on allegations she stabbed her husband to death in
Kangema sub-county, Murang’a county. Dorcas Waigwe is said to have killed Julius Njuguna, 25, at their home in Gacharaigu village during a domestic squabble. Njuguna died while receiving treatment at
Murang’a General hospital where he was rushed. Kangema DCIO Peter Wahome said neighbours
heard a commotion in the young couple’s home and responded, only to find the man lying in a pool of blood. He said a neighbour, who is also a relative,
called for a taxi and together with his wife, they rushed Njuguna to the
hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. Wahome said after Njuguna died, those who took him to hospital reported the matter to Murang’a police station after which the man's wife was
arrested for questioning. He said Waigwe will be arraigned on Monday. Neighbours reported that the young couple has been
having constant quarrels. The incident followed barely a month after Gatunguru principal
Samuel Mbogo was murdered in his home in Gakurwe. The principal's wife Alice Mugechi is facing a murder charge over the same.
