Diamond Platnumz is still heartbroken after parting ways with his estranged wife Zari Hassan in February. Zari told Kiss FM Diamond disrespected her and no matter how she tried to save their marriage, the singer continued to cheat on her. In a previous interview with BBC, Zari said she had had enough of the Tanzanian crooner's bad behaviour but was not going to restrict him from seeing his children. "If he wants to support his children he can do that, but if he doesn’t want to, it's still okay. I can manage on my own," she said. Early this week, Diamond travelled to South Africa for the first time after breaking up with Zari to visit his children Princess Tiffah and Prince Nillan. Sources say he was also trying to reunite with Zari, but she refused to get back to him after all she went through with him. Well, Diamond is back in Tanzania and it seems he's going to do anything to annoy Zari and his family, who are against his relationship with Hamisa Mobetto. The Tanzanian socialite posted a video of her son playing with toys in their house, and Diamond Platnumz commented: "Hope you like the house daddy." Hamisa was quick to respond and her response left many speculating that they were an item even after Diamond's mother beat her. "Diamond Platnumz we looove it! Thank you so much. May God keep on blessing you abundantly." According to our source, the house Hamisa is staying in is a rental and not bought, as Diamond Platnumz claims.
