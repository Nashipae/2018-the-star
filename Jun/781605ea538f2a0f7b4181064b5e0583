Nzoia Sugar cane farmers want President Uhuru Kenyatta to appoint former Internal security assistant minister Alfred Khang’ati as the board chairman. Khang’ati is a former Kanduyi MP who contested for Bungoma Governor on an ODM ticket but lost to Wycliffe Wangamati of Ford Kenya. Led by Samuel Wafula, the farmers said the ex-MP is up to the task and that they trust he will improve the company. Wafula further termed him "an experienced, seasoned, down to earth cane farmer who understands the predicament farmers and factory workers are facing". Addressing the press at Bukembe market on Friday, the farmers further warned county leaders against interfering with Khang’ati’s possible appointment. “Some Bungoma leaders met in Nairobi on Thursday and wrote a memorandum that stops politicians from heading the board. They want to appoint a technocrat yet this is an ill-advised plan," Wafula said. During an interview on Sulwe FM on Friday, Bungoma's Agriculture executive Mathias Makanda said some county leaders were opposed to the appointment of a politician. “Let the President appoint a technocrat, not a politician. Politicians caused the collapse of the factory," he said. Nzoia Sugar farmers and workers have gone without payment for close to three months and machines have not been taken for their annual maintenance. The farmers' media briefing followed the expiry of the term of the former board of directors that was chaired by former Webuye MP Joash Wamang’oli. In April, Wamang’oli threatened to open the lid on corruption deals at the firm located in Kanduyi. Top managers have pointed the accusing finger at each other as graft claims threaten to cripple the firm. Acting MD Michael Kulundu dared Wamang’oli to spill the beans.
