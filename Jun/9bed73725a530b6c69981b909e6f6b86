The Nyeri government has rubbished claims Governor Mutahi Kahiga has travelled to the US for prostrate cancer and diabetes treatment. County communications director Carol Nderi said Kahiga is in good health. A Facebook account for one Daniel William had said Kahiga had collapsed four times in his office since taking over as governor. “Our attention has been drawn to a false post circulating on social media, emanating from a Facebook account that has previously spun outright lies and is seemingly at it again,” Nderi posted in a Nyeri journalists’ WhatsApp group. “We would like to assure the people of Nyeri county that Governor Mutahi Kahiga is well and is in the US together with a section of senior officials to meet investors.” She said the delegation visited Reston City in the US on an exchange programme to revive relations between Nyeri and the city.
