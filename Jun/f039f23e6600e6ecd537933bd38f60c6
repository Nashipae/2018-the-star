The Employment and Labour Relations court has allowed IEBC CEO Ezra Chiloba to go back to work. This is until the hearing and determination of an application of his application against the compulsory leave he was forced to take. Chairman Wafula Chebukati sent Chiloba on leave in March to pave way for investigations into the procurement of elections materials. Chiloba challenged the decision in court saying the move was wrong as he was not given a chance to defend himself. On April 13, Justice Stephen Radido declined to suspend the forced leave pending the hearing of the petition challenging it. In his ruling on Thursday, he said: "In the view of the court, it would not be proportionate and in public interest to uphold a decision taken without legal or contractual foundation by an employer."
