Trufoods has said its products seized in a raid last week were not fake and “only lacked the Kebs standardisation stamp”. “Whereas the said goods lacked the standardisation marks, the same were not declared as fake by the multi-agency conducting the exercise,” Rajan Malde, the director of Trufoods, said in a written response to the Star. The state agencies carried out a series of raids on businesses, seizing goods worth millions of shillings. Twenty tonnes of consumables - including peanut butter, tomato paste and Choco primo products - were seized during the Friday raid. A Kenya Bureau of Standards officer declined to comment on the matter.
