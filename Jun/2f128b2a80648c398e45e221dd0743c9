A 20-year-old man has died of the Rift Valley Fever at a Siaya hospital. Siaya Health director Owino Omondi said the patient was admitted to Siaya County Referral Hospital on Tuesday. He had been bleeding profusely and died hours later under treatment. Omondi said tests of his blood by the Kenya Medical Research Institute returned positive for the Rift Valley Fever virus. “Test for Ebola and Marburg virus conducted from the specimen proved negative,” he said. Omondi urged residents to take precautions and report whenever they or their animals show unusual sysmptoms. He said the recent downpours and flooding could have created the breeding ground for mosquitoes. The name of the vitim was not immediately disclosed but he came from Uriri village, Kaugagi sublocation in Alego-Usonga subcounty. The body was taken to the Siaya County Rferral Hospital mortuary. Omondi banned feasting on meat and slaughtering animals that have not been inspected by health officials. In Wajir, five people have died of the disease this month. RVF is primarily a disease of the livestock, sheep and cattle, but also infects humans. It is transmitted through mosquitoes and contact with infected animals. Patients show symptoms of muscle pains, headache, fever and liver abnormalities. About one per cent of patients die. In livestock, death rate is significantly higher. Pregnant livestock infected with RVF usually abort.
