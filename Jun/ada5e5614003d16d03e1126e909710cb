Kirinyaga County has acquired 10 brand new lorries, five graders, two rollers, two excavators and other road work machines at a cost of Sh250 million. While flagging them off on Friday, Governor Anne Waiguru said feeder roads will be fixed. Waiguru added that the county intends to work on 217km of murrum roads in the next six months. She said her vision is to open up Kirinyaga's economy through a sound transport system as this is key for development. She also noted that agricultural production and marketing, "the backbones of the county" will improve. "During campaigns, I went around and saw that the roads were a big mess. I have made my pledge to fix the problem," she said. Waiguru further said that the road upgrade programme will lead to the employment of many youths. She noted that herÂ government is intact and that she has the full backing of MCAs and opinion leaders. "Seeing MCAs here tells you that we are working together with a single agenda - to improve the lives of residents in line with the Mountain Cities Blue Print Vision 2032," she said.
