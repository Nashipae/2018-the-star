The country has barely turned a corner from the traumatic
events of the last election. The catharsis brought about by the
celebrated truce between President
Uhuru Kenyatta and his opponent Raila Odinga was to cover the
country, but it has all but fizzled out. The opportunity for healing and focussing on pressing
needs is being frittered away in another round of premature
political
shadow-boxing. Either politicians are irredeemably confused about
the national agenda or too obsessed with their own survival
to see the obvious. This country is in dire need of focussed leadership to steer
it toward development. The President has called the nation to order severally
this year, but that has not deterred politicians
across the divide from obsessing about his succession. This is more pronounced
in his own Jubilee Party — where urgent housecleaning is needed — than in the opposition. As a consequence, the all-important fight against endemic
corruption is at risk of being compromised by partisan interests and personal
ambitions. But a country’s destiny cannot be tied to anyone’s fortunes, however
mighty. All Kenyans must support the President’s resolve to carry through
the mission of ridding our system of corruption, however disruptive it
may be to some careers and fortunes.
