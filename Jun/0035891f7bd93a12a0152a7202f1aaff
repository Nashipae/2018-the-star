Police have arrested former Olkejuado Teachers’ Sacco Chairman Bernard Kool over the embezzlement of Sh21 million. DCI officers from Kitengela police station raided his home in the area on Friday morning. They acted on a warrant issued last week by the Cooperative Tribunal Court in Nairobi after the suspect jumped bail. Kool will be arraigned in the same court on Monday to explain why he should not surrender documents such as land titles that were deposited as sureties. Current Chairman Isaiah Katampoi accompanied the officers to the police station and told journalists that the case has been going on for 10 years. He said Kool had been skipping sessions. Kool and four other former officials were accused of stealing the money. Katampoi reported that the sacco recovered Sh4 million from the other former officials. “We used to have more than 1, 500 members but the number came down to 250 because we can no longer meet the financial obligations of teachers," he said. Police only allowed Kool to make a phone call before locking him up. He did not address journalists. Click here for the latest political news
