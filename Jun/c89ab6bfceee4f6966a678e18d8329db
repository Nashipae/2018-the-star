An Anglican bishop in Bungoma has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to honour his pledge to support DP William Ruto for the top job in 2022. Milimani Bishop George Mechumo said on Monday that there should be no dispute between the President and the Deputy President. He apparently was responding to reports that some of Ruto's allies considerUhur's ordered vetting of all top officials to be a witch-hunt directed at Ruto.Some Jubilee officials and members also are unhappy about Uhuru's the March 9 handshake with Opposition leader Raila Odingas. ‘As a man of God, I am happy that Ruto has been able to fully support Uhuru in his two terms as President and we would like Uhuru to clearly give back as they had agreed,: he told a press conference i n Bungoma town. ‘As a church we advise President Uhuru not to allow any dispute between him and Ruto when it comes to 2022 and it is Ruto's turn to take charge of the Jubilee Party," he said.
