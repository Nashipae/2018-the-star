The National Assembly Parliamentary Accounts Committee has threatened sanctions against Health PS Peter Tum for ignoring summons to appear before it over audit queries. PAC chairman Opiyo Wandayi yesterday put Tum on notice for snubbing the committee to explain multibillion-shilling procurement deals flagged by Auditor General Edward Ouko in his reports. The warning came after Tum sent senior administrative director Ibrahim Malim to represent him. Tum wrote to the clerk saying he was out of the country on official duty up to next week. Wandayi was, however, not convinced by the explanation and demanded he appear to explain the audit queries.

Is this not an official duty?” Wandayi said. “We insist and direct that the Principal Secretary appears before this Committee on Thursday to respond to audit queries. Wait on Thursday and see what will happen. We shall start with this one as an example to the rest.” Under the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act, the committee has the power to order any person to appear before it to give evidence or produce any paper, book, record or document in his or her possession or under the control of that person. Failure to attend is an offence, punishable, under the court of law, by a Sh2,000 fine, or a jail term of one year or both. Rarieds MP Otiende Amollo, also a member of the committee, expressed disappointment in PSs who fail to honour PAC invitations and instead send junior officers who are unable to respond adequately.
