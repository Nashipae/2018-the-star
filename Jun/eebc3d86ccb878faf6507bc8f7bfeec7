Nyeri MP Ngunjiri Wambugu has said corruption should be made a capital offence and those found guilty hanged or jailed for life. Speaking in Nyeri town, Wambugu said people die for lack of medicine in hospitals because of corruption. “We must stop making corruption a special crime. It should be in the same league as murder, armed robbery or treason,” he said. The lawmaker added there should be a law that allows government to conduct lifestyle audits on people who acquire sudden wealth after getting government jobs. He said those who cannot explain how they acquired the wealth should be investigated. “This will ease the fight against corruption,” Wambugu said. “If somebody had Sh100,000 when he started working and in six months that money has multiplied to Sh10 million, the government should be allowed to investigate,” he said. Wambugu said if one cannot explain the source of their wealth, the assumption will be that it was acquired through illegal means. He said to make investigations easy, the country should do away with the EACC and use the police. In less than a month the DCI investigated corruption cases and action taken on cases the anti-graft watchdog had been probing for years.
