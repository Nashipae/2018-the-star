Embu leaders have urged police to strengthen security after seven people were killed in a fortnight and 15 shops broken into. The leaders said the security situation in the county is appalling and hopeless. They included Embu assembly minority leader Masters Mwaniki, Embu Chamber of Commerce chairman Samuel Kanyi, and MCAs Muriithi Kiura of Mbeti South and Morris Collo of Kirimari. Mwaniki and Kiura said robbers have been terrorising residents in their wards in Mbeere South. “I urge security officers to intervene because in a fortnight we have lost seven people and we don’t want to lose more,” Mwaniki said. On Friday, during Madaraka Day celebrations at Embu Stadium, Kiura said residents are arming themselves with bows and arrows and patrolling the village at night. Kanyi said the thieves break into shops from the back to avoid being seen by police and residents. He urged police to patrol dark alleys. Embu county commissioner Esther Maina said security measures are being put in place to restore order. She urged residents to give police information leading to arrests. Maina also said illicit liquor has made a comeback and said the government will crack down on brewers. On March 1, Interior CS Fred Matiang’i launched a crackdown on drugs and illicit brews. He warned administration officials against being compromised. The drive aims to enforce the ‘Mututho laws’ that banned bars 300 metres from schools. “A 2016 survey showed secondary schools are increasingly becoming centres of alcohol and drug abuse,” he said. Matiangi warned that any government officials and police officers producing, transporting or taking illicit alcohol will be sacked immediately. He said those in the trade “are not from a different planet but are people of sound mind who know what they are doing is wrong.” Matiang’i said it is more frustrating that some of the businesses are supported by leaders expected to be responsible.
