Nairobi assembly speaker Beatrice Elachi has asked MCAs to go slow on her impeachment. She said ward reps should wait for an investigation report before impeaching her. “We want a truce in Nairobi because it is the engine of Kenya. You saw there was a lot of turmoil last week, but it has cooled down and we hope the probe will end this matter,” she said in Kakamega on Saturday. “Our problem in Nairobi is not fighting. It is just a report on lack of following the process and managing the process.” Elachi said the report will help the assembly move forward and it should not be used to wage wars. She spoke at a funeral in Viyalo village, Sabatia subcounty. Elachi said confrontations within the assembly will slow development. An MCA had prepared an impeachment motion to remove Elachi from office on abuse of office allegations. The county assembly service board on Monday asked Elachi and clerk Jacob Ngwele to step aside following issues in the procurement of the speaker’s residence. Majority leader Abdi Guyo said the speaker’s husband was allegedly recorded pushing for the contract, but Elachi denied any wrongdoing, saying she had nothing to do with the tender. Meanwhile, Elachi said investigations over importation of contaminated sugar should be left to relevant agencies to unearth the truth. She said the matter could be politicised. Elachi also asked opposition leader Raila Odinga not to attack Deputy President William Ruto for campaigning for 2022 race.
