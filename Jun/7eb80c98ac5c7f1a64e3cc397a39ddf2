Most of the public believe it is no longer safe to take sugar. But minute quantities of copper ( 20 parts in a million) are not enough to cause injury when someone has sugar in their tea. Only prolonged use would cause complications. The government has panicked, locking up warehouses of sugar before testing, and allowing police to enter supermarkets and confiscate any sugar on sale that is not marked 'manufactured in Kenya'. Around 140,000 tonnes of sugar has been imported by 50 different companies on special licences since the last election. Around 40 percent comes from Brazil, 20 percent from Comesa, and the rest from different countries. Not all of this sugar is bad. Indeed government has only released the test from one warehouse in Eastleigh that showed excess copper. The Webuye sugar was due for re-processing by West Kenya Sugar factory before going on sale. It is possible that virtually all the sugar in the market is fine. The government has created unnecessary panic by its precipitate actions. Quote of the day: "Insane people are always sure that they are fine. It is only the sane people who are willing to admit that they are crazy."
