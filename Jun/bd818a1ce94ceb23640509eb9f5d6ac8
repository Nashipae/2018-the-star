After a pause in the Kenya National Rally Championship series caused by torrential rain, rallying resumes on June 9th with the Athi rally. This event will be held by the Rallye Sports Club with Phineas Kimathi as event director and Hellen Shiri as the clerk of the course. The 385km route features 176km of challenging competitive rallying which will all be on private land. The official start will be at the Stoni Athi Resort at 7am and the event will finish at the same place in the afternoon with the prize giving scheduled for 5:30pm. Only three points separate championship leader Baldev Chager in his Kabras Sugar sponsored Mitsubishi Evolution X from Carl “Flash” Tundo who will be at the controls of his Top Fry Mitsubishi Evolution X. The championship contenders will be driving at ten tenths through Kunkur, Konza and Machakos ranch in a bid for victory to earn vital points. The battle in the navigator championship is even more intense with both Ravi Soni and Tim Jesop on fifty three points. Tuta Mionka is in third place in a Menengai Cream Subaru Impreza N12 with a score of 30 points. Bearing in mind that Ravi Soni navigates for Baldev Chager and Tim Jesop for Flash Tundo, rally fans are guaranteed an action packed day. The current warm weather indicates that the route will have a few muddy situations but the roads will be passable and dust free. The publication of the provisional results will be done at 4:30pm, followed by the presentation of awards one hour later .
