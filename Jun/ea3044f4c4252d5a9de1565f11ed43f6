Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has called for lifestyle audits of top government officials and politicians. Civil servants submit wealth declarations every year yet corruption remains rampant. When a scam is exposed, suddenly it emerges that an official has two houses in Runda or is building a mall on Thika Road. That property should have been a red flag well before the scam was unearthed. The Public Service Commission does not have the capacity to scrutinise every wealth declaration it receives. The solution is to make wealth declaration forms openly available, at least for senior government officials, ministers, judges and MPs. When senior officers are being vetted, they publicly declare their wealth but after that we never hear about it again. If wealth declaration forms were freely available online, citizens could check if their leaders were fully declaring their assets. Kenyans know who owns what. Mutua is right but it is the public who should check wealth declaration forms to make certain that leaders have fully declared their assets.
