Kwale International Sugar Company Ltd will from next month repackage sugar in small quantities to target local customers. The firm’s public relations manager Mathias Mutua yesterday said they will start packaging 500gm and one kilo of sugar to expand their market. “We have been selling our sugar to our distributors in Nairobi, Eldoret and Mombasa in 50kg bags, but now we want to directly aim retail customers in Kwale,” he said. Mutua said the crackdown on contraband sugar by the government has been a boost to their business. “On a daily basis, we can sell a variation of up to 20,000 bags of sugar when the market is good. Our factory produces at least 8,000 bags daily, but has a capacity of 10,000 bags,” he said. Mutua said their productivity has increased since 2015 to 20 per cent annually. He said the company has about 400 out-growers of sugarcane and 7,600 acres of cane plantation.
