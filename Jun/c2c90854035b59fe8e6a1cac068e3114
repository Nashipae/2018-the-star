The Murang’a government will establish coffee demonstration farms in each of the eight subcounties to boost production. Agriculture chief officer Peter Njangi has said the demonstration farms will be used to train farmers on the best coffee farming practices. Njangi said although coffee farming is still robust in the county, it is being hampered by poor yields per coffee bush. He spoke during a meeting with agricultural officers in Murang’a town. He said it is paramount for them to work together in improving the coffee sector, which supports close to 500,000 homesteads in the county. The farms, he said, will further help the county government establish coffee cells that will ensure close supervision of individual coffee farms. “The coffee cells will help individual farmers improve the quality and quantity of their coffee with the help of our extension officers,” Njangi said. He said the programme will complement the ‘Kahawa Bora’ programme launched by Governor Mwangi wa Iria last year to rehabilitate 50 coffee bushes in every coffee farm in the county. In the programme, farmers are assisted to boost their coffee production to 40kgs per bush annually. The county government adopts the 50 coffee bushes in small scale farms and enhances them to produce more and high quality coffee using organic manure and pesticides.
