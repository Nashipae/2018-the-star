Kenya Urban Roads Authority has distanced itself from the insecurity at Taj Mall roundabout in Nairobi. Communication officer John Cheboi said on Monday that crimes were being committed before Kura started upgrading Outer Ring Road. The authority has been on the spot over attacks on drivers and pedestrians in the area. The victims say streetlights would have been helpful. "Our contractors have not put up lights because of the same matter," Cheboi told the Star. "Had we installed the streetlights first, the thugs terrorising people would have stolen them." He said poles have been erected but that the installation will take place once the road is completed.

"We are working to end the project by July 14. The project is more than 90 per cent complete," he said. The Sh8 billion expansion, launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta in January 2015, was to be completed in September last year but there were delays in compensation and relocation of services such as water supply. Kura has marked lanes, planted grass and flowers along the road, constructed walkways and put up signs. The road has been upgraded to a dual carriageway to ease traffic congestion in the populous Eastlands area, which has about 2.6 million residents (60 per cent of the city's dwellers). It is Nairobi's most active workforce. Click here for the latest political news
