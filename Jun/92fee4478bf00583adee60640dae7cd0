A nurse was charged in Nairobi on Friday with being a member of ISIS, a terror group that operates in the Middle East. Abdikhalif Mohammed Adan, who works in Isiolo, faced four other counts of having sim cards with videos that had information for use in a terrorist act. The court rejected a fifth account that stated he was accused of collecting information and being in possession of an article connected with the commission of a terrorist act. The magistrate said it was defective and did not show the nature of the charge he was facing. According to information in the court file, police found Adan with a Samsung phone fitted with two sim cards – one from Safaricom and the other Airtel. Police said Adan was arrested on June 11 in Isiolo. He denied all the charges. Adan pleaded with senior principal magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot to give him lenient bail terms. The prosecution, however, asked the court to remand him for five days. “We oppose the accused being released at this time as investigations are not complete and he is facing a serious offence. If released, he might abscond,” the prosecution said. magistrate terms bail fair Adan in his defence said he is innocent. “I would like the court to release me on favourable bail terms because I earn little money being employed as a nurse and I’m a law abiding citizen,” he said. Adan was ordered released on Sh1 million bond or Sh200,000 bond. The case will be mentioned on July 12. The magistrate considered the accused’s application and said since he is a nurse not a pastoralist he can be able to raise the bond terms. “I have considered that the Constitution stipulates that an accused has a right to bail and in this case Sh200,000 is lenient considering you are a professional,” Cheruiyot ruled.
