Kenyan-born Australian Senator Lucy Gichuhi has agreed to pay back Sh216,000 taxpayers' money she used to fly two relatives for her birthday party. Gichuhi, 56, held a '50th birthday plus GST' in Adelaide last October, the Sunday Telegraph reported. According to the publication, her travel records show she billed taxpayers Sh216,327 ($2,139) for two return airfares. The flights were from Darwin to Adelaide on October 26 and departing on October 31. The claim was made as part of the Gichuhi’s family traveller allowance. This allowance is a fund MPs can use to pay for family members to join them on ­parliamentary, electorate or official business at Commonwealth expense. However, the rules state that the entitlement is provided to allow senators and members the chance to balance their work and family responsibilities. Gichuhi has since agreed to repay the full amount and an ­additional 25 per cent penalty. "Regarding the media reports about my travel expenses, this was an administrative error involving misunderstanding of travel rules," she said via twitter on Sunday. "I’ve raised an invoice from the department to pay the costs in full." Click here for the latest political news
