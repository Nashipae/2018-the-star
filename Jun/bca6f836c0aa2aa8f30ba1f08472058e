Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has drawn criticism for kissing an overseas Filipina worker on the lips during a live event. Duterte was speaking to a crowd in South Korea when he called the woman on stage then convinced her to kiss him. The scene drew cheers from the crowd, mostly made of up other Philippine workers. But it was described as "disgusting theatrics of a misogynist president" by Philippines rights group Gabriela. The woman involved later said that there was "no malice" in the kiss. It is not the first time Duterte has been accused of inappropriate behaviour towards women.
