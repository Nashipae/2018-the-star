Sakwa said the consignment, belonging to Mt Kenya Distributors Limited, included cooking oil illegally imported from Tanzania. "We found when some of the bags were being offloaded from a lorry for storage in the said warehouse. Police have taken charge of the two lorries and the godown." Sakwa said the security team resolved that Kebs officials take samples of the sugar and oil for further tests in Nairobi to ascertain if they are safe for human consumption. KRA will also conduct investigations ascertain whether duty was paid before the products were allowed into the country. "It is not possible to know whether the consignment is good or not with the look of necked eye," the county commissioner said. "It is important that we know where our products come from. Traders should engage in genuine business. People who bring in products into the country should know what products they are buying," she added. Read: 'Does Rai Paper deal with sugar?'
