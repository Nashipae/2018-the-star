A Nakuru man has been sentenced to three years in jail for selling cat meat to samosa vendors in Nakuru town. James Kimani has been in the business for about seven years. Yesterday, he pleaded guilty before principal magistrate Bernard Mararo. He butchered more than 1,000 cats since 2012 and sold their meat to unsuspecting samosa retailers, including hotels. “The accused is sentenced by his plea. He is to serve two years on the first count with a Sh200,000 fine, and on the second count a fine of Sh50,000, or an imprisonment of one year,” Mararo said.

He said he had been offered a job to deliver the cat meat at higher prices. “I was not aware it was wrong to slaughter the cats in an open ground,” he said. He said he could have killed the animals in the forest. The court also heard that on June 25, Kimani willingly slaughtered a cat with an aim of selling it for human consumption. He did this at an undesignated open place in violation of Section 2 of the Meat Control Act. The law says it is dangerous to eat unsuspected meat and that from non-food animals, including cats. Kimani had also exposed the carcase of the cat, which is unfit for human consumption. He said he started the business after identifying a gap in the market. He however admitted his customers did not know it was cat meat. He had a market for cat skins and earned at least Sh500 for every cat he slaughtered, he said.
