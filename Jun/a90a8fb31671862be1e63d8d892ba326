Here are five books based in Kenya, Ethiopia and Malawi that I have been reading lately. I got these to help me plan a trip to these parts of Africa, and would therefore recommend them to any travel enthusiasts.  Email from Ngeti: An Ethnography of Sorcery, Redemption, and Friendship in Global Africa by James Smith, Ngeti Mwadime The story of a friendship between anthropologist James Smith and his researcher Ngeti Mwadime, a charismatic young man from the Taita Hills. Blaming family members and sorcery for thwarting his efforts to make it rich, Ngeti seeks answers from unusual sources, embarking on a journey that takes him to local diviners, witch-finders, Pentecostal preachers and prophets.  The Girl and the Sunbird by Rebecca Stonehill This has an epic sweep beginning with a feisty young girl’s arrival in East Africa in the early 20th century to marry a man she has never met, and who quickly turns out to be a poor match. She strikes up a friendship with a local teacher, and they embark on a forbidden relationship with devastating consequences. The story takes the reader on a journey from early colonial Kenya to the time of the Mau Mau rebellion in the 1950s where the heroine makes an unexpected discovery.  Where Giants Trod by Monty Brown For anyone heading north to Turkana, this is a great handbook to take. The first section explores the diverse tribes sharing the area - and is an invaluable guide to understanding their traditions, many of which still exist today - before moving onto gripping tales from the first European expeditions to this region, starting with Count Samuel Teleki. Thoroughly interesting, deeply researched and well-written account of early attempts to explore this region.  Ethiopia on a mule: Dervla Murphy. The gripping journey of a doughty Irish woman who sets off across the Ethiopian highlands with just a mule for company in the late 1960s. She chronicles the joys of simple travel, sharing morsels with impoverished villagers and dealing with shifta. A travel account at its most thrilling and rawest form.  Venture to the Interior, Laurens van der Post Classic and compelling account of van der Post’s explorations in Nyasaland (modern-day Malawi) after being tasked by the post-war British government with finding out more about two mysterious mountainous regions. So begins an exploration into the massif, where weather patterns are unpredictable and calamities can arise in dramatic fashion. Beyond the gripping outward exploration aspect, the book is also an exploration of van der Post’s inner journey, switching from his time as a Japanese prisoner of war, to his reflections on race, progressive for their time, in colonial Africa.
