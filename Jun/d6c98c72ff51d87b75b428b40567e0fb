Police in Kerugoya have arrested a 23-year-old woman for drowning her son in River Rutui. Nancy Nyawira is said to have thrown the five-year-old boy into the river on Friday evening. Kerugoya police boss Yawa Chome said Nyawira’s neighbours alerted police after realising the boy was missing. Police moved in and arrested her on Saturday. “She confessed that she threw the kid in the river upon interrogation by detectives,” Chome told the Star on the phone. Detectives have launched investigations to establish the motive of the murder. Chome said Nyawira will be taken to court today. Neighbours have condemned the killing. “Although she looked stressed up and became aloof in recent weeks, we never imagined she could kill her son,” a neighbour identified as Muthoni told the Star. The body of the child was retrieved from the water by Nyandarua county disaster management team and taken to Kerugoya Level 4 Hospital mortuary. Two weeks ago, a six-year-old girl drowned in the river which passes through Kerugoya town. The girl was with her mother when the tragedy happened. Her body was immediately retrieved and taken to the mortuary. Earlier last month, a two-year-old boy drowned in the same river after he was swept away by the raging waters following heavy rains. In February, a woman was charged  with attempting to kill her son  so she could marry her new lover. Terry Muthoni was accused of lacing her son’s food with poison.
