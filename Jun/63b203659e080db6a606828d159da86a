Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana was on Wednesday treated to a rare birthday surprise by Kibwezi hawkers who bought him a new brand shirt. The governor, who turned 64, had first met with the hawkers at a hotel in the town to address complaints of land grabbing. The hawkers sang a birthday song for the governor as he walked in the streets of the town before he proceeded to inspect public land allegedly grabbed by tycoons. As he stopped in one of the clothes stalls to speak to a vendor, the hawkers who were trailing him quickly contributed money and bought him a shirt. The melody was followed by a treat of tea and mandazi at a hotel as they discussed the issue of tycoons who have encroached into public lands in the area. Kibwana later posed for photographs with the hawkers at the matatu terminus. Touts also joined the photo session. "Got a surprise of my life on my 64th Birthday! These Kibwezi hawkers sang me a Birthday melody and even bought me a shirt," he posted on his twitter page. Click here for the latest political news
