Samsung has launched four new devices for mid-range spenders. They are Galaxy J4, J6, J7 Duo and A6+. They are integrated with features from the premium models of the ‘S’ series to ensure middle income customers access quality phones that deliver every day convenience without compromising style. The phones will sell between Sh19,000 and Sh39,999. The prices target the younger generation which has sought Chinese-manufactured devices due to their affordability. “Samsung Electronics is always striving to ensure our customers have the most advanced products on the market. These latest devices are a testament to this,” Charles Kimari, head of mobile division at Samsung Electronics East Africa, said. “We integrated our unique approach to the design as well as features Galaxy customers have come to love to provide performance without compromising style.”
