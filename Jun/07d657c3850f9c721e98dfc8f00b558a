Agnes Kiunga, the latest internet sensation, wants to teach the Commander-in-Chief Uhuru Kenyatta how to odi. The video vixen, who has showcased some brilliant and eye grabbing dance moves in the new Sauti Sol's song Shot N Sweet, is the talk of town. In an interview with Word Is, Agnes said, "I have performed for the President many times but I have not met him one on one. I would really want to teach him the new swagged up Odi dance. I would also want to teach Margaret Kenyatta and Ida Odinga the dance as well and see who would do it best. They all have a different feel and they represent different audience." Agnes's striped jumpsuit has become her signature look. "I am a business lady as well. I bought a few sets of jumpsuits but I chose to wear this one and fortunately it is the one that was meant to bring me all this recognition and fame. I bought it for a thousand bob." Agnes urges the society to not only look at women choreographers as 'twerk' masters but to consider their dancing skills and techniques as a professional form of art.
