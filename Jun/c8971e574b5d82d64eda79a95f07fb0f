Raymond Karago is a UK-educated Kenyan who has been living in Los Angeles for the last three years, pursuing his dream career as an actor. His biggest milestone so far was the short film Stand Up. Despite facing the adversities that many productions face, the project has been a success. Having just started its festival run, Stand Up was screened at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival on May 18 to many positive reviews. It has also been accepted into the LA International Film Festival, winning the Bronze award for best film. His other credits include the upcoming web series Gangsters (available on YouTube), which itself has premiered at the Indie Night Film festival, an appearance in the music video of country star Willie Jones, two feature films (Ashes and Apathy Equals Death) and an upcoming pilot that has a large name attached to it (more to be revealed with time). “I have dealt with a lot of people trying to tell me what is possible in my life, to be realistic. With everything that is going right so far and everything that is to come, I just want to be a testament to all that it is possible to achieve what you want by going for it, no matter where you come from or what your imperfections are,” Raymond says. “I was teased for my different life as a child, but now those same people from school message me all the time to tell me how well I’m doing. Please don’t ever let anyone tell you what is possible. Trust in yourself, be your greatest version.”
