Uasin Gishu county has unveiled a Sh8.4 billion budget for 2018-19. This marks a Sh500 million increase from last year’s estimates. Despite healthcare being one of the national government’s Big Four agenda, the county allocation has been reduced by 80 per cent — Sh1.8 billion last year to Sh363 million. Finance executive Julius Ruto has forwarded the proposal to the county assembly. It includes Sh5.9 billion from the National Treasury. The county will collect the Sh2.5 billion deficit from local revenue — projected at Sh1.2 billion — and the rest from development partners. “We’ve tightened our revenue collection channels to meet our targets,” Ruto said. MCAs will discuss the budget. Governor Jackson Mandago’s administration targets key projects in the water sector to increase supply and livelihoods. It will replan Eldoret town in readiness for city status. Sh5.2 billion has been set aside for recurrent expenditure. This represents a four per cent increase from last year’s Sh4.9 billion. Development projects will get Sh3.2 billion. Last year it had Sh3 billion. The Uasin Gishu assembly has been allocated Sh637 million — a 12 per cent increase from last year’s Sh568 million. Mandago’s office will have a 28 per cent budget cut. It will get Sh115 million compared to Sh160 million last year. The public service will get the largest share at Sh3.3 billion, up from Sh420 million 2017-18 cash. Under the development allocation, physical planning and urban development will have the biggest sum at Sh710 million. Last year it had Sh60 million.
