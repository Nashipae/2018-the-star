Kenya Hockey Union champions Kenya Police will be out to redeem themselves from last weekend’s 2-1 loss to Butali Warriors when they play USIU-A’s Mashujaa tomorrow at City Park. Police bitterly succumbed to their nemesis, Butali Sugar Warriors, at the MCHA National Indoor Hockey festival held in Mombasa and their head coach Patrick Mugambi, wants to use the match to correct the costly mistakes they made. Police sit second in the log with 18 points, three shy of the on-form Butali, who are yet to drop points this year and Mugambi has called for total concentration from his players ahead of the match. He has termed Mashujaa as a technically gifted team with youthful players who should not be underrated. He said: “We lost to Butali last weekend in the finals and we want to use this weekend’s match to redeem ourselves. We want to revenge that painful loss which also highlighted a number of areas we need to improve on. Mashujaa is a technical side with young players who should not be underrated. It’s unfortunate I lost Robert Masibo and Richard Birir to injuries in Mombasa and may not feature in the match. We hope to close the three point gap and correct the mistakes we made in Mombasa.” Should Police arrest the students, they will move level with Butali at the top of the table with 21 points. Today, Nakuru Hockey Club host Strathmore University Gladiators seeking their second win of the season. Nakuru are 10th with four points while Gladiators are fifth with seven. At City Park, third-placed Greensharks begin their weekend double against, Mashujaa while Parkroad Badgers, ninth on the log, play bottom-placed Parklands. Greensharks will play their second match of the weekend against fourth placed Wazalendo tomorrow.
