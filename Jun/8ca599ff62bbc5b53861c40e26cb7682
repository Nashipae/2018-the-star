People living with disability in Murang’a have received equipment worth Sh2 million from the National Fund for the Disabled of Kenya (NFDK). The equipment, including wheelchairs, tricycles, crutches, artificial limps and white canes, were distributed by the funds officer Tabitha Mihari on Friday. NFDK also distributed sewing machines, barber kits and welding machines. Mihari said the machines will boost incomes of small scale traders. “We donate equipment every year. Those living with disability should pick forms from their chiefs and apply for the equipment,” Mihari said.
