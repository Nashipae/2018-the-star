"In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 4 of the Kenya Ports Authority, the appointment of Michael K. Maina as a member of the Board of Kenya Ports Authority has been revoked," the notice reads. Michael attended the board's 345th meeting held last week where the members voted to sack the KPA boss and have her replaced by Daniel Manduku. The Mombasa High Court temporarily blocked Manduku's appointment in an acting capacity. "The board observed that the above situation can only be explained by lack of effective leadership," Michael said earlier. Michael was appointed director of the board in a gazette notice of January 2, 2015 replacing Ian Karanja whose three-year term had expired. Click here for the latest political news
