Mpeketoni residents are accusing KDF soldiers undertaking the Linda Boni security operation of harassment them. They say the soldiers have been humiliating them during their patrols especially at night. Area MCA James Komu has asked Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to intervene and have the soldiers stop harassing locals for no reason. “These guys beat you if they encounter you on the road from 8 pm onwards yet as far as we know, there is no curfew here or law that prohibits one from moving around at that time," Komu said. Simon Kimani said he was forced to drink dirty water in a ditch when he came across the soldiers as he headed home at around 8.30pm days ago. “They asked me where I was from and I told them I was from work heading home. That was 8.30 around. They just laughed loudly and asked me to lie flat in a ditch and drink the dirty water there. I thought they were joking but I know them too well, they derive pleasure in harassing and so I did what they asked. It was the most humiliating thing in my entire life,” Kimani said.

It was very humiliating. All we want to know is if there is any law we are breaking. That kind of treatment is unnecessary. They should stick to their job and let us live peacefully,” Mwangi said. When contacted for comment on the matter, KDF spokesperson David Obonyo denied that the KDf was harassing locals and insisted that the soldiers believe in cultivating a good relationship with members of the public so as to ease their operations. Obonyo said during a meeting on Wednesday only complaint on police were made and no one raised any issue against the KDF.
