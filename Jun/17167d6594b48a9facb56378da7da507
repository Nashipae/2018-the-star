A leader and two members of a controversial Kwale church have been arrested in a raid for illegal operations. The Good News Missionary Church in Ukunda town was started six years ago. It has 40 members. The church forbids members from going to school or seeking medical care. The cleric’s son dropped out of school in Form Two. Police on Thursday said church doctrines violate the law. Msambweni child rights officer Ziporah Nyawira, Diani police and education and health officials led the raid. “By law you can’t tell a child to drop out of school to serve God. This should be punished,” Nyawira said.
