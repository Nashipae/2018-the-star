The order suspending the fresh vetting of procurement officers will remain in force until Wednesday when the court will decide on whether to set it aside or vary the same. Judge Onesmus Makau of the Labour and Employment Relations court gave the directive after the government and activist Okiya Omtatah argued before him Monday. This was after the parties failed to agree on resolving the dispute out of court. The government wants the orders issued last week overturned saying the activist failed to disclose crucial facts when he appeared before the court on June 6. Solicitor General Ken Ogeto told the court the government is committed to ensuring the vetting will be conducted within the Constitution and the law. Ogeto said the rights of the public officers to be vetted will be fully protected. He informed the court that as at Friday, 458 public officers had voluntarily submitted to the Office of the President, the information required for the vetting. Omtatah opposed the bid by the government to set aside the orders saying an illegality will be committed if the officers are vetted while out of office. But the court was told that everybody will be given time and that no one will be victimised. "The exercise is not meant to be punitive" Ogeto said. Ogeto told Justice Makau that the vetting being undertaken by the government is an administrative action, which is not meant to victimise any officer. "The orders are prejudicial and injurious to the public in the fight against corruption that is cripplingÂ the country," the judge heard. Click here for the latest political news
