  Kenya Bureau of Standards MD Charles Ongwae has been released from remand after meeting his bail terms. Ongwae was on Monday charged with attempted murder and conspiracy to defraud the state of Sh882 million. His co-accused Martin Nyakiamo was also released. Nyakioma is the Coast regional director
for KEBS. Ongwae was released on a bond of Sh10 million and a surety of Sh3 million. He was also asked to deposit Sh2 million as bail for the offense of attempted murder. He deposited another Sh8 million in surety and Sh5 million in bail for conspiracy to defraud. The two suspects denied the charges. They were charged alongside KEBS director of quality assurance Eric Chesire, inspection
manager Peter Kinyanjui, Martin Nyakiamo, Kilindini Port health officer Pole
Mwangeni, Kenya Revenue Authority supervisor of customs Erick Kariuki and Bollore Transporters clearing agent Benson Ngesa. They were
accused of intending to cause the deaths of people in Narok and Eldoret by
releasing 5.8 million kilograms of substandard fertiliser, which
contained mercury.   The offences were committed between November 13 last year and June 7. They were also charged with aiding commission of a felony and breach of
trust. The court heard
that being in public service, they jointly aided OCP(K) to commit a felony by
releasing the fertilizer which was harmful to the humans. Ongwae and his
co-accused were also charged with conspiring to defraud. It is alleged
that they entered into a contract for supply and delivery of Kebs quality marks
ISM stickers complete with traceability system, yet Madras Security Printers
Private Ltd had no capacity to deliver.
