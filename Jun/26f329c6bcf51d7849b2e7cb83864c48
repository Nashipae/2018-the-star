Former Cabinet minister Eliud Mwamunga's legacy is worth emulating, ex-President Mwai Kibaki has said. Kibaki said this in a statement on Saturday in his condolence message to the family of Mwamunga, who died at a Mombasa hospital on Saturday. He was 83. "I learnt of [his] passing with both sadness and a sense of personal loss," Kibaki said. "Eliud	and	I	shared	memorable	times	in	the	service	to	the
public	during	the	heady days	of	Kenya’s	young
nationhood.	Later,	he became	a	compatriot	in	the
political	arena	and	indeed	an	ally	who	played	a
significant	role	in	my	political	journey." He added that the former Voi MP was strong-willed man of action who was driven by an unmistakable set of public-spirited values. The wealthy landowner served as Voi legislator for 20 consecutive years - between 1969 and 1988 - during the one-party system. Over the period, he served in both founding father Mzee Jomo Kenyatta's and his successor Daniel arap Moi's cabinets. He held the Water Development and Commerce and Industry dockets under Kenyatta and the Information and Broadcasting docket under Moi. Mwamunga's downfall came in January 1988 when he was sacked from the Cabinet and later dethroned by Adiel Kachila as Voi MP during the infamous 1988 'mlolongo' election. He joined Kibaki in January 1992 to launch the Democratic Party after the Constitution was changed in 1991 to allow multiparty politics. President Uhuru Kenyatta earlier mourned the late legislator as an astute politician who greatly contributed to the growth of a modern Kenya. He said Mwamunga served the country with commitment and devotion and that he was a key contributor to some of the most influential policies which saw Kenya become an economic power house in the East African region.
