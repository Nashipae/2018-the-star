The family of a student who died after she was pushed out of a moving bus near Safari Park Hotel last week has accused police of coverup. A witness has said he is being threatened. Peter Kamau rushed Doreen Mwiti to Neema Uhai Hospital but she died on the way. He said yesterday he has been warned to stay away from the case. Doreen succumbed to injuries at 3.30pm on Wednesday. She was pushed out of a moving Zam Zam Sacco bus. A postmortem is scheduled for today. Yesterday, her family dismissed claims she was knocked down while crossing the Thika Superhighway. They accused police of inaction. “The police are not interested in the case. When we went to Kasarani police station, they behaved as if they had not seen us,” Mwiti’s cousin, Catherine Kanyua, told the Star yesterday. “We suspect they are trying to sweep the case under the carpet, but we will continue praying to our God hoping justice will prevail.” But Kasarani police boss Robinson Mboloi said they are investigating and will ensure the culprits face the law. He dismissed allegations the bus belongs to a “powerful Kenyan”, hence their lack of cooperation. Kamau said the officers are not keen to ensure justice is delivered. “They are twisting the story. How come when the incident happened they refused to allow me to record a statement? The only thing they took was my number, then ordered me to leave,” he said. “Even the owner of the matatu called and tried to silence me, but I’ll fight for justice for the lady. Today it is her, who knows, tomorrow it might be me or my relative.” John Mwiti, Doreen’s father, now wants the DPP to take up the case. “The police are hiding something. It’s not possible that my daughter tried to throw herself out of a moving matatu. She was a humble girl who never looked for trouble. My heart is heavy because I had so much hope in her,” he said.
