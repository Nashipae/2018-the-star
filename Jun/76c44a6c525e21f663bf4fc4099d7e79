Ijara MP Sophia Abdinoor yesterday called for severe punishment for convicted rapists. She said rapes of girls and women have become a “normal occurrence” in Northeastern and the majority of victims suffer in silence. Condemning the Friday night rape of a student at Moi Girls School, Nairobi, the MP said Parliament should enact laws to ensure rapists and defilers pay dearly. Two other Moi students said they were assaulted. Detectives from the Serious Crimes Investigations Unit and the Government Chemist have taken DNA samples from some male staff members for analysis. They included teachers said to have been in the school during the time of the rape. Sophia urged the government to provide extra resources to secure girls’ secondary schools. “Whatever happened at Moi Girls is barbaric and primitive. It should be condemned by everyone. It should not be happening in this day and age,” Abdinoor said. “I’m calling on my colleagues to think of how we can come up with laws to protect our daughters, mothers and sisters.” The traditional maslaha system of dispute resolution has been blamed for increased rapes in Northeastern, because it calls for informal payment instead of trials and imprisonment. The system has been in the spotlight after many claims that elders sit down quietly to work out an illegal settlement that bypasses police and the courts. Officials have said that elders who allow maslaha are obstrucing justice and will be punished.
