STARRING: Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Sarah Vowell, Huck Milner, Samuel L Jackson DIRECTED BY:  Brad Bird RELEASE DATE: June 15  Animated films might seem childish and unappealing to grown-ups, but there are some animated films that have become blockbusters because of their universal appeal. And the Incredibles was one of them. Fourteen years after the immense success of the original, Incredibles 2 finally made it to the big screens. Although the film was made after a long time, the story picks up a few months after the conclusion of the previous film. All the superheroes face a major backlash when the Incredibles fail to apprehend a villain from robbing a bank while causing major destruction. The Super Relocation Programme is shut down, which leaves the Parr family jobless and living in a motel. Winston Deavor, a superhero fan and the owner of DevTech, proposes a publicity stunt that will help superheroes regain the public’s trust. He believes Elastigirl is the least destructive of all supers, so he hires her as a vigilante who openly fights crime. This means Bob now has to take up the demanding job of being a full-time dad. Bob finds difficulty in adjusting to life from a coveted superhero to a stay-at-home dad. Especially since the baby Jack-Jack starts exhibiting several superhero powers as soon as Helen leaves for work as Elastigirl. The family, with the help of Frozone, is forced to work together when a new villain hatches a dangerous plot. Making a family work together is hard enough, but when everyone has superpowers, the task proves even more difficult. The film does its predecessor proud. Fourteen years in the making, and the end-product makes it worth the wait. The action-packed story is presented wonderfully in 3D visuals. The film is filled with humorous quips that don’t overshadow the seriousness of the underlying message.  Star Rating: 4/5
