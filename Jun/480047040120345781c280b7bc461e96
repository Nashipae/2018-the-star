A suspected terrorist sought by police has finally surrendered. Last month, police had placed a Sh1 million bounty on Mumina Eroba’s head. They urged members of the public to volunteer information. Eroba is accused of being behind the February attack at Qarsa that left three teachers dead. Eroba surrendered to the authority on Tuesday evening. Northeastern regional coordinator Mohamud Saleh said on the phone her surrender was a “big breakthrough” in the war on terror”. Eroba is the mother of another wanted suspect, Abdiwahab Osman, who is linked to IED attack that claimed the lives of eight officers in Wajir. Security agencies are also looking for Ahmed Debar. Eroba presented herself alongside Osman’s wife Asha Gedi at the Wajir county commissioner’s offices. They were accompanied by their relatives and an assistant chief who had helped in tracking her down. “She [Eroba] was very dangerous. Most of the attacks that have occurred in Wajir are linked to her and her son in one way or another,” Saleh said. “She must have decided to surrender after realising we were closing down on her. Her days were numbered.” He said Eroba was being held by a multiagency term for questioning. Security officers will go after her accomplices, Saleh said. He urged Osman to follow suit before they catch up with him. In March, Saleh read out names of suspected local terrorists, who, he said, were aiding and financing militia activities. He gave them a one-month ultimatum to surrender. Security teams will arrest Eroba’s close relatives who failed to cooperate, Saleh said. Separately, Wajir Governor Mohamud Abdi commended the Eroba for surrendering and urged other terror suspects to do the same. “I appeal to all the others who have been named by the security apparatus to voluntarily surrender.It’s a good move worth emulating. They should not wait to be arrested,” he said.
