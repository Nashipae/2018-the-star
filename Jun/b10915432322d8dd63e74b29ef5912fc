A Kajiado MP has been told to stop inciting chiefs against the law and measures to end illegal child marriages. Kajiado county commissioner David Kipkemei criticised the MP who reportedly said he is ‘mishandling’ chiefs and their assistants suspected to be supporting FGM and child marriages. Kipkemei spoke in Dalalekutuk ward, Kajiado Central, on Sunday during a ceremony of awarding certificates and cash to former FGM cutters. They quit the practice to engage in other businesses. "Any leader worth his salt cannot go public against the government’s resolve to end injurious practices such as FGM." he said.
