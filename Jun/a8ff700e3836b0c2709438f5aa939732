Two school children and a matatu driver died on Wednesday morning in an accident near the Sultan Hamud bridge on Mombasa-Nairobi highway. Peter Mudaki, a witness, said the matatu collided head-on with a trailer as the driver attempted to overtake a number of vehicles at high speed. “Just before the bridge, the driver of the Nissan overtook a matatu. He then overtook a trailer and as he attempted to overtake the second trailer, he collided head on with an oncoming one," he told the Star on phone. “The children, who were seated at the front, died on the spot alongside the driver." The witness said the driver of the trailer had tried to avoid the matatu. “It was a very bad accident. The matatu stalled about 10 meters from the scene. The children who were seated behind the driver were critically injured. They were unconscious when they were pulled out of the wreckage." The injured were taken to a nearby hospital and the bodies to a mortuary. Click here for the latest political news
