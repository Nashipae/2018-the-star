President Uhuru Kenyatta has asked African leaders attending the G7 Summit to align their messages on protecting oceans, expanding regional trade and deepening regional stability. Uhuru met Presidents Macky Sall of Senegal and Rwanda's Paul Kagame (African Union chairperson) ahead of the G7 'outreach segment' on Saturday. At the meeting with Sall, he pledged to open a new embassy in Dakar in four months to boost trade and people-to-people relations. Uhuru and Kagame focused on regional security, trade, climate change and aligning Africa's position ahead of the G7 summit. The leaders also sought clearer follow-up mechanisms for decisions agreed at  the G7, which is key to meaningful engagement. The summit of the seven most industrialised nations started on Friday in the resort of Charlevoix in Quebec, which is in a time zone seven hours behind Nairobi. The President is expected to address the G7 on Saturday on protecting and preserving the oceans under the theme 'Healthy, Productive and Resilient Oceans and Seas, Coasts and Communities'. His discussions will focus on ocean security, the continent’s economic growth and how to prevent, manage and recover from the debilitating disasters caused by climate change. In November, Kenya will host its inaugural Oceans Summit, through which it will push for better and greater exploitation of the seas to ensure the Blue Economy is effectively deployed to improve lives. The country has already won Canada's support for the Oceans Summit. At a meeting with Uhuru in London, on the sidelines of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in April, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau agreed to co-sponsor the Oceans summit and personally invited the President to the 2018 G7 summit.
