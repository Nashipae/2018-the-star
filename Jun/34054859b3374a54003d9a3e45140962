DPP Noordin Haji has put on notice unnamed MPs believed to have given money to bail out NYS suspects. Haji said on Thursday that a letter from the Assets Recovery Agency details how Sh100 million was transferred to an account belonging to a legislator. The letter, which his office has, states that Sh3 million was then withdrawn, before bail was sought for suspects in the alleged theft of  Sh9 billion from the National Youth Service. The Director of Public Prosecution said the money may have been used to secure the release of some of the suspects. On Wednesday, Haji directed the DCI to ensure that securities and funds presented by freed NYS suspects are not proceeds of crime. The 48 suspects in the Sh9 billion National Youth Service scandal were reprieved on Tuesday by the High Court's decision to grant them release pending their trial. Judge Hedwig Ong'udi freed them on Sh5 million bond with sureties of Sh2 million each, with concurrent cash bails of Sh1 million each. Haji noted that the Assets Recovery Agency had raised concerns that "some of the funds intended to be use are not only suspect bus also the subject of current cases".
