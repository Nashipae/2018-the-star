President Uhuru Kenyatta has warned Turkana and Pokot communities against fighting over water and pasture. “Those who will not surrender the illegal firearms will be punished,” he said. Uhuru yesterday ordered Governor Josphat Nanok and his West Pokot counterpart John Lonyangapuo to resolve all the conflicts. The two communities have lagged behind in development due to frequent attacks by bandits. Uhuru told the two governors to ensure the two communities co-exist. “Uhuru will not be there to reconcile you every time. Hold one another’s hand and resolve issues crippling development. We cannot have peace with spears and AK-47s,” he said. Read : Pokots turn to banditry ‘as last resort’ The President spoke at the official launch of the export of crude oil to Mombasa. He said more officers will be deployed in the two counties to restore stability. He said more reinforcement will be deployed in Kapedo to ensure schools are reopened. “Development in neighbouring countries has been crippled due to banditry attacks and conflicts. We aim to be among crude oil exporters, but we can lose all the benefits if we do not eliminate banditry,” Uhuru said. “We must view ourselves as Kenyans, not Turkanas and Pokots. Any disagreement that might arise from the oil should be resolved in an amicable manner,” he said. The government has issued a directive to the two communities to surrender all illegal firearms or encounter the full force of the law. Tullow Oil Plc, the company exploring the resource, says an estimated 2,000 barrels of crude oil will be produced from the Ngamia and Amosing fields per day. The bad state of Kainuk bridge, which is the main link to Turkana, poses threats to the smooth movement of trucks ferrying oil from the mine fields. The mineral will be hauled by road in wait for a 900km export pipeline. Also read : Uhuru to flag off first crude from Turkana oil fields Click here for the latest political news
