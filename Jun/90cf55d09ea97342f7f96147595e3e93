Charles Kamuren will concede defeat if he loses the Jubilee Party nomination for Baringo South MP. The exercise went on peacefully on Saturday despite transportation challenges that delayed ballot boxes. "I am confident and praying that I win but if I don't, I will accept the results and support the winner," Kamuren said. He and his opponent Mark Kiptoo cast their votes at Marigat Primary School. The nominations were held ahead of by-elections on August 17, to fill the position left vacant following the death of Grace Kipchoim. She died from cancer and was buried at Kimoriot in Mochongoi on May 5.

He challenged the results in court when he lost in 2013 but decided not to do so last year, despite claiming he was rigged out. "I will leave everything to God," he said after claiming police beat him up in Marigat and that he was hospitalised. Asked if he will accept the results, Kiptoo said he will state his position after the election. "Let me not pre-empt. I will cross the bridge when I get to it," he said. Other candidates in the race are lawyer Joseph Tarus and Eunice Lepariyo. Shadrack Kiprop, the 30-year old son of the late Kipchoim, and Amos Olempaka withdrew from race. The Jubilee winner will face PaulKimaru (independent), Lewis Migiri (PDR), Edward Tamar (PNU) and Dickson Keis (KANU).
