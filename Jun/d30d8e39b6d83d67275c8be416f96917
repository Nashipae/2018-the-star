President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday sent a message of goodwill to Muslims as they celebrated Eid-ul-Fitr to mark the end of Ramadhan. He thanked the Muslims for their continued support of the government and all citizens. Uhuru said Eid-ul-Fitr is a season of joy and sharing, showing compassion, spreading a message of peace and love as the Muslim faithful conclude their fasting. “Eid-ul-Fitr marks the culmination of our Muslim community’s journey of submission and devotion to the Almighty God of all creation,” the President said. He said it is the prayer of Kenyans of goodwill that all citizens would continue to enjoy their unity in diversity, even as they continue to progress. “We lead all Kenyans in joining our brothers and sisters as they celebrate their inspiring and exemplary devotion to faith,” the President said in his message. “Our prayer is that Allah accepts your ibaada and grants you forgiveness and Jannah InshaAllah.” Uhuru urged them to continue praying for the nation, even as they break the fast. In the spirit of reconciliation and unity, the President earlier extended the handshake to Mombasa county and promised to set aside his differences with Governor Hassan Joho. The leaders shook hands after jointly commissioning the Miritini-Mwache-Kipevu link road at Miritini. Uhuru said a lot will be achieved if leaders work together. In his address to the press after Eid-ul-Fitr prayers at Ronald Ngala Primary School grounds, Joho said, “It is our responsibility as politicians to unite Kenyans.”
