The Anti-doping Agency of Kenya has called on sports federations to adopt anti-doping provisions in their constitutions to help them deal effectively with the menace. Consequently, Adak will embark on a rigorous exercise of monitoring compliance within federations to ensure they meet the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Code threshold as stipulated in the rules with non-compliant bodies facing possible de-registration. Adak chief executove officer, Japhter Rugut, said the agency is empowered by the rules to enforce and monitor compliance of sports federations. He warned that Sports Fund will not finance federations which are not compliant. The purposes of the Wada Code and program is to protect the athletes’ fundamental right to participate in doping-free sport hence promote health, fairness and equality for athletes worldwide. Rugut singled out the doping menace as one of the biggest impediments to the vibrant Kenyan sporting sector. He told the federations to lead by example as the initiative will enable them address the doping problem effectively in a bid to achieve a clean sport. The Adak boss said his organization has reached out to 49,151 people, held 80 workshops and performed 65 outreach programs. Similar sentiments were echoed by the Sports Registrar Rose Wasike who also called on the federations to address issues of doping through amendment of their constitutions. Rugut, however, revealed that lack of proper funding for Adak activities could only lead to non- compliance. The ministry of sports has been allocated Sh 2billion which Sports Cabinet Secretary, Echesa Mohammed, admitted was insufficient. Echesa called on sports federations to also tap from the corporate world by repackaging their sports to attract corpote funding. “Finance cuts will no doubt ail the Adak’s anti-doping campaign and could cripple some key programs for compliance,” said Rugut. He said testing samples overseas costs US$ 700 per sample hence the need to have a laboratory locally.
