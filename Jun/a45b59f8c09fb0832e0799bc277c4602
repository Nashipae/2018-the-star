 Opposition MPs have criticised the budget read out yesterday, saying it was an unnecessary burden on Kenyans. Led b y Minority leader John Mbadi, the lawmakers said the Sh3 trillion budget read out by Treasury CS Henry Rotich will hurt the common man with “petty taxes”.Mbadi (Suba North), Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja), Chris Wamalawa (Kiminini), Godfrey Osotsi (nominated), Adipo Okuome (Karachuonyo) and Samuel Atandi said the government did not explain how the budget will be funded.Mbadi said there is a likelihood of deficit that could lead to non-implementation of the ambitious projects spelt out in the budget.He said he will rally the House to review the budget with key focus on areas likely to burden the taxpayer.Rotich proposed increased taxes on mobile money transfer services and kerosene. He also proposed a repeal of the cap on interest rates,  a move that has irked the opposition.“Without fundamental measures to raise enough resources, we will either not implement the budget or we’ll have a bigger deficit resulting in increased borrowing,” Mbadi said.“The good thing is that this is just a proposal. It will come to us in the House later.”Wandayi said the proposed revenue collection measures were too ambitious and unrealistic.“I foresee the government resorting to more and more external borrowing to bridge the glaring deficits to the detriment of the common man,” he said.Wamalwa said Rotich was engaging in a fishing expedition with the budget. He said the proposals will increase the cost of living.“This is a very below average budget. You can’t purport to tax M-Pesa transactions and increase the price of kerosene. That is going to hurt the common mwananchi,” he said.Atandi praised the increased allocation to healthcare but warned against introducing taxes on basic commodities. “This is an indication the government has no money. They have overspent and are trying to recover the cash by force,” he said. Osotsi said the proposed tax measures were cruel.
