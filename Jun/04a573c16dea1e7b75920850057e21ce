This is, of course, not the way it is supposed to be. The
Constitution makes this clear. One of its principles of public administration
is: “Responsive, prompt, effective, impartial and equitable provision of
services”. And Chapter Six (that leadership and integrity chapter on which we
all placed so much hope) envisages “objectivity and impartiality in decision
making, and in ensuring decisions are not influenced by nepotism, favouritism,
other improper motives or corrupt practices”. Chapter Six includes the memorable statement that “Authority
assigned to a State officer…vests in the state officer the responsibility to
serve the people, rather than the power to rule them.” State officers are
people such as Cabinet secretaries, the President and MPs, but Chapter Six is
supposed to apply to public officers — that very large group of people (some
estimate as many as 700, 000 ) who carry out government policy and make all
sorts of daily decisions that affect Kenyans. The Constitution says something else very important: “Every
person has the right to administrative action that is expeditious [speedy], efficient,
lawful, reasonable and procedural fair” (Article 47).  DECISIONS, DECISIONS Maybe you have never considered how many decisions are made
all the time, especially by public officers, affecting the everyday lives of
people. People’s health, education and livelihood depend on the decisions made
at all levels of the administration. Getting a business permit, asking for a
clearance certificate from the police, for an ID card, a driving licence, to
get your child into school, your pension, or NHIF approval for medical
treatment, all require administrative decisions. So do owning a gun, moving a
cow, importing sugar, exporting flowers, building a house and sinking a
borehole…. The list is endless. And there are many decisions made that people
did not ask for but are affected by: Siting a road, closing a bridge,
vaccinating children, and moving a school principal… Perhaps you have focussed on the fact that you are often
expected to pay a bribe to get something you are entitled to. You might think there
is little that can be done if the person who will make a decision that affects
you wants a bribe — other than paying up, and thus committing a crime yourself.
There is so little faith that bribe seekers will be prosecuted, let alone
convicted, that most people do pay up. And the time spent on trying to get a
decision without paying the bribe seems too great a price to pay in a context
in which respect for the rule of law seems so weak. But if administrators fully understand what they need to do
to make fair decisions, and if the people who need decisions understand what
they have a right to, bribery should reduce. For example, if you are affected
by a decision, you are entitled to reasons in writing. Decision makers won’t write,
“I refused because you wouldn’t pay a bribe”. They will give some other reason,
which immediately exposes them to being challenged.  Proper procedure undermines corrupt practices.  FAIR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION AND COURTS Article 47 is a significant addition to the human rights
protections of Kenyans. The Fair Administrative Action Act was passed in 2015
to give more detail. Basically what it does is to bring into Kenya’s written
law rules and principles developed by judges over many years. Decisions of administrators must follow the law: The right
procedure must be used and the powers given by law must be used only for the
right purposes. This seems obvious. More important, perhaps, are the other
requirements that the courts have developed around the idea of fair procedure.
People who make decisions that affect others’ lives must not be biased: The
decision must be made on the merits and not on the basis of prejudice or
favouritism. Only relevant factors must be taken into consideration. People
must be given fair warning of the possibility of a decision being made against
them and given a chance to make representations. Sometimes they should be allowed to bring a lawyer to
represent them in the decision-making. Decisions must be made honestly with the
right objectives in mind. They must be made in reasonable time, and certainly failing to make a decision is wrong.
Decisions must be rational â€• this means logically connected to the law and its
purpose and to the information available to the decision maker.  And the reasons given for the decisions must
logically justify it. And the decision must be reasonable. If public decision makers say they are going to behave in a
certain way, or even develop certain practices, so that people expect them to
behave that way, they cannot suddenly change the practice â€• people have a
legitimate expectation of being treated as promised.  JOYS FOR KENYA Various countries have prepared guides for the public
service on how to make fair decisions. In several countries it is called “The
Judge Over Your Shoulder” — or JOYS. Katiba Institute took the idea, and has developed what we
hope will prove a suitable guide for Kenyan public officers. This has the
Constitution and the 2015 Act as the starting point, and uses real stories from
the disputes that have been taken to the Kenyan courts, the Commission on
Administrative Justice and other institutons. A few examples: The Council of Legal Education decided not
to accredit a university, even before a provisional period of accreditation had
expired; a court said this suggested the Council was biased. People must be given fair warning of the possibility of a
decision being made against them and the courts have held many decisions to
have been defective because there was no chance for those affected to object
and put their own case. Apart from demolition of a building on a road reserve, the
approach has been applied by the court to cases about eviction of hawkers, non-renewal
of a lease, and cancelling a title to land, 
destruction of advertising hoardings, 
freezing of an NGO’s bank accounts, 
removal of students from a graduation list,  and expelling students and depriving them of
their examination results.  TENSION BETWEEN COURTS AND PUBLIC SERVICE? A government cannot function unless very many people have
powers to make decisions and take other actions and are not constantly
interfered with by the courts. Courts recognise this. They very rarely instruct any public agency
what decisions to take. But they do often say a decision was made in the wrong
way and must be looked at again. They will not say, “We think we know better
than you about the right decision”. If decisions are made systematically, using good procedure
and considering only relevant facts, opinions and law, people will rarely need
to go to court to complain about decisions. The Katiba Institute’s small book is intended to help with
this. It is intended to make it less necessary, not more, to take
administrative decisions to court. If decision makers go about things in the
correct way, they need not worry about the judges over their shoulders. That is
why we did not use that engaging title. The courts are part of a whole structure intended to improve
administrative behaviour. The structure includes also the Commission on
Administrative Justice (the Ombudsman), the Public Service Commission and the
Kenya School of Government that trains civil servants. These agencies have all
been very helpful. Getting decisions right first time is in the interests of
government too: It does not waste money on court cases and on doing over again
something already done (which might hold up important projects). Above all, as the late Justice Louis Onguto said: “A person
facing a decision maker ought not be left dissatisfied and bearing a sense that
justice might not or would not be done.”
