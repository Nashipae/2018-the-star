The United Nations High Commission for Refugees will hand over Sh1.1 billion worth of infrastructure to the Kenyan government and the host community following the closure of two camps in Dadaab. The infrastructure includes fully furnished hospitals and schools. Suleiman Yarrow, the Education associate with UNHCR, said in Kambi Os, the UN agency will hand over three primary schools and three early childhood development centres. In Ifo 2, the Kenya government will receive 10 primary schools, four of them with permanent buildings, one learning centre and one secondary school. Yarrow said each primary school in Kambi Os can hold up to 8,000 learners, while one at Ifo 2 can accommodate 16,000 learners. The secondary school in Ifo 2 has a capacity of 612 students. The hospitals in both camps have 100-bed capacity, a maternity wing, emergency room, a laboratory, two operation centers, adult ward, pediatric wards, stabilisation center and a pharmacy block. Speaking to journalists at Dagahley camp at the weekend, Dadaab subcounty head of operations at UNHCR Dadaab Jean Rushatsi said the assets were left behind after refugees in Ifo 2 and Kambi Os were assisted to go back to their homeland. Rushatsi said a refugee camp is considered closed when the last alien leaves either on repatriation or is moved to another camp. “We are in a constructive dialogue with the county and the national government to see how soon we can organise official handing over ceremony. The refugees were welcomed by the Kenyan people and we are eager to hand over whatever is left behind to them,” he said. Kambi Os was closed oi March last year, while Ifo 2 was closed last month. “These are very important projects the government can use for vocational training for the host community,” Rushatsi said.
