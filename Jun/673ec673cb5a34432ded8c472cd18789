Kenya Cup champions Kenya Commercial Bank will tour South Africa for a two-week training camp in September. The bankers, who bagged their third crown in four years when they beat Kabras 29-23 in the final, will be hosted by Western Province and will have an interactive session with the side as they seek to sharpen their preparations for the start of the Kenya Cup season in November. This will be second visit by the bankers to the country having been there last year. Western Province reciprocated by sending format Springboks’ prop Hanyani Shimange in March and played a leading role as the bankers retained the Kenya Cup title. KCB team manager, Raymond Oruo, expects the training camp to be beneficial to the club’s prospects of the upcoming season. “It will be a good opportunity to for the players to train with the some of the best in South Africa alongside coaches and get the feel of a high performance training camp,” he said. Oruo expects the upcoming season to be tougher than the previous one. “Everyone will come at us hard so we must be two to three steps ahead of everyone as the competition will get tougher,” he added. Oruo said focus in the short term will be to improve their performance in the national Sevens series, which kicks off on July 21-22 with the Prinsloo Sevens. “We have not had success in the shorter versions of the games but hopefully, we can turn it around, ” added Oruo. Elsewhere, Ofafa Jericho qualified for Prescott Cup semis after beating Mangu High 29-3 in the quarters. Ofafa’s fly half and captain Brian Ratilla got his side to the final four with a hat-trick of tries. Overall, he delivered 24 of the 29 points. A converted try and a penalty by Ratilla saw Ofafa open a 10-0 lead. Centre Celentine Otieno’s try and conversion by Ratilla handed Ofafa the half-time cushion. A penalty by Mangu fly-half Brian Ndungu in-between Ratilla’s converted and unconverted tries in the second half ended the contest.
