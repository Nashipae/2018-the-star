Lawyer Miguna Miguna’s nomination as deputy governor and the 2018-2019 budget are among top agendas as Nairobi county assembly resumed business yesterday. The assembly adjourned on May 3, 2018 for a long recess. Majority chief whip Mwaura Chege said yesterday it would be up to the speaker to bring Miguna’s nomination in the house business. The deputy governor’s position has been vacant for four months since Polycarp Igathe resigned in February citing failure to earn the trust of his boss, Governor Mike Sonko. Last month, Sonko nominated Miguna. But county speaker Beatrice Elachi opposed the nomination saying it was unprocedural. Miguna’s lawyer Cliff Ombeta delivered the letter to Elachi on May 17 at City Hall. However, later Elachi stated she had no authority to reject Sonko’s nominee. Majority leader Abdi Guyo said the house would reject Miguna’s nomination as the candidate is neither a Jubilee nor Nasa member. “We (the assembly) cannot vet a person who is not a Kenyan citizen. That is impossible,” Guyo said during Madaraka celebrations in Matopeni last week. The other key agenda for the house is the budget. Budget committee chairman Robert Mbatia said the team on Monday met with the acting executive for finance Charles Kerich over the estimates. “As the budget committee we have a busy schedule ahead in the next two weeks as we are expected to write a comprehensive report for the appropriation bill,” said Mbatia.
