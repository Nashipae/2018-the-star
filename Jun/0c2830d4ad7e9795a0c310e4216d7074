Seven suspects have been arrested following the torching of 17 houses in Suba South, Homa Bay, on claims of witchcraft. The houses belonged to 12 families that lived in Mwikongo, Kisaku and Kitawa villages in Kisaku sub-location. Homa Bay County Police Commander Marius Tum said the suspects were arrested on Thursday evening and taken to Magunga police station. Among the victims was 70-year-old Mambi Oindi who was injured after the mob ignored her pleas. Reports indicated that she was hit on the head with blunt objects and that her leg was cut with a panga. She was rushed to St Camillus hospital in Sori town, Migori county. “Her family members, who had also been targeted by the assailants, ran away. She was unable to run due to old age. No one else was assaulted in the incident,” area Chief Hedmon Okinyi said. Oindi's house and two granaries were burned down. Villager Okeyo Choma lost two semi-permanent houses. The attackers were motivated by the deaths of a 48-year-old man  two years ago and a 10-year-old boy in May. The Chief said nobody reported that the two had been murdered. “Residents recently formed an opinion and accused the families of causing the deaths,” he said. Security personnel held meetings in the area to quell the tension that arose after the arson. “The sub-county security team is working to restore peace in the village,” Tum said.
