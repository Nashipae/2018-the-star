Regional trading block IGAD has ratified a policy regularising informal cross border trade not captured by customs authorities. The Informal Cross-border Trade and Cross-border Security Governance was adopted yesterday by trade ministers from the member states. The policy will be passed to the Intergovernmental Authority of Development heads of state for onward transmission to the African Union. Kenya, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia and Uganda officials attended the meeting held in Mombasa and said the policy is a boost for the African Continental Free Trade Area. On March 21, more than 40 African nations signed a deal to create the area to improve intra-state trade.
