Education CS Amina Mohamed told secondary school principals yesterday to work harder to protect students and weed out rogue colleagues. The CS said the ministry will be strict to ensure there is “no monkey business”, suggesting some principals may be shielding wayward colleagues. “You know who they are,” Amina said. Cases of rape, sexual harassment and abuse, teacher-student sex, violence against students, alcohol and drug use have made headlines. Amina spoke when she officially opened the 43rd Kenya Secondary School Heads Association conference in Mombasa. “Do not let this handful of individuals spoil your image. Root them out,” Amina said. Kenya Secondary School Heads Association chairman Indimuli Kahi said principals and teachers guilty of misconduct should be dealt with individually. He said the entire teaching fraternity has been condemned for the behaviour of a few. Kahi said the safety manual for schools needs to be reviewed because the current one is silent on emerging trends such as radicalisation and gender-based violence. He said the requirement not to have grills on windows is exposing students to security risks as it makes it easier for intruders to get into the dormitories. “Removal of grills has become a security challenge,” Kahi said. Amina said schools usually experience increased security incidents in second terms. She called for a probe. It will result in a review of the ministry’s school safety manual. “We need you to give your suggestions on how to improve security,” the CS said. Amina said principals should not protect any teacher involved in any kind of crime, especially against students. “Help us protect your children,” she told the 8,000 principals. Kahi asked the ministry to enhance the capacity of principals to ensure safety standards are met. The Machakos High School principal said most incidents are beyond the principals’ ability to prevent or address.
