The government will deport 41 foreigners linked to importation of contraband goods and illegal trade in the country. The deportees were arrested from various estates within Nairobi where they have been engaging in illegal trade. Most of them were found assembling illegal gambling machines which are usually imported disguised as motor vehicle spare parts. It is said they did not have work permits or documentation legalising their stay in the country. Matiang'i had earlier own warned foreigners against engaging in illegal businesses in the country reiterating that those found culpable will be deported. The CS, while overseeing the destruction of over 500 gambling machines in Nairobi's Dagoreti, said the machines are a threat to the Kenyan society. The CS maintained the government will not relent in the crackdown on the machines. He said the machines have destroyed the lives of children and families as parents get 'robbed' by the children who need money for gambling. "This business is destroying the lives of our children. Some of them are not going to school. Let us stop pretending. We must stand up and call sin by its name for the sake of our children," he said. Matiang'i added, "It is working against the President’s 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary school. We shall not accept it.” He declared gambling a crime of monumental proportions which must be fought at all levels. The government has already set June 30 as the deadline for eliminating illegal gambling machines across the country.
