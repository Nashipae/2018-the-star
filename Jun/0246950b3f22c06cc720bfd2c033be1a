MCAs are today plotting to storm the office of the Controller of Budget over their delayed May salaries. It has emerged that CoB Agnes Odhiambo declined to approve the cash. The ward representatives protested the delay in the chamber last Thursday. They demanded an explanation from the county assembly leadership headed by speaker Beatrice Elachi. “Every day we are told that revenue collection has improved. If that is the case, where is our salary?” Kilimani MCA Moses Ogeto asked. Yesterday, Nairobi West MCA Maurice Gari said they have found out that the CoB has declined to approve their salaries. “We have confirmed that the county assembly requested the CoB to approve the money but she declined because there were some votes that were included in the requisition that she was not aware of,” Gari said. “We will go there tomorrow [today] so that she can explain to us what was included that made her reject the request.” Both Odhiambo and Elachi did not answer our phone calls. But a senior official at the county assembly confirmed the CoB declined to approve the money requested by the clerk. This comes hot on the heels of Odhiambo’s refusal to approve money for ward projects. She said the ward fund breaches the Public Finance Management Act.
