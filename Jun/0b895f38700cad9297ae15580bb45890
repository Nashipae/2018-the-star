Tigania West MP John Mutunga has warned contractors against hiring ‘foreigners’ to provide casual labour in his constituency. He said such jobs must be reserved for residents. Jobs will motivate the youth and inspire them to support and own the projects so they are completed in time, Mutunga said. He said road projects must involve residents, as bringing in people from outside the constituency would create unnecessary suspicion, hatred, animosity and tensions. Mutunga said his constituents must benefit from the ‘national cake’ like other Kenyans.
