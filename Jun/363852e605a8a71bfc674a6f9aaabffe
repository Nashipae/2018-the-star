Embu MCAs have criticised plans by the Level Five Teaching and Referral Hospital management to convert the mortuary into a funeral home. The hospital asked the county assembly, through the Budget and Appropriations Committee, to allocate Sh3.5 million in the 2018-19 budget. The hospital wants to expand the mortuary building into a higher-capacity funeral home. The hospital needs Sh1.5 million to pave the compound and Sh3 million for cementing walkways of the new funeral home. The hospital was allocated Sh3.9 million in 2017-18 to renovate the hospital’s cold-room. The MCAs yesterday said the upgrade plan is misplaced. The ward reps said the hospital’s main goal is to offer quality healthcare. They said instead of focusing on the dead, the hospital should ask for funds to improve wards and buy modern theatre equipment. Runyenjes Central MCA Steve Munene said the Health department proposed to construct mortuaries in small dispensaries like Kianjokoma and Karaba. Budget and Appropriations Committee chairman Robert Ireri criticised the proposal to buy new hearses for the morgue, when all county ambulances are grounded. The Kagaari South MCA said the Health docket must get its priorities straight. He added that it makes no sense to have a luxurious funeral home when hospitals are in poor condition. But Health executive Jamleck Muturi said the dead also deserve quality services. He said it is wrong to carelessly dump and dispose of bodies. Embu Level Five hospital CEO Moses Njue urged the MCAs to visit the facility to assess the situation before making a decision.
