New KCC is upgrading plants in four counties for Sh1 billion to improve milk processing. The company seeks to regain its position as the top milk processor in Kenya. It said this will increase its capacity and farmers will be able to supply more milk. New KCC managing director Nixon Sigey yesterday said they will have “ultramodern production lines” as part of its plans to transform the dairy sector. He said they spend Sh4.5 billion to buy milk from farmers but will increase that to Sh6 billion to meet the increased demand for processing. This is part of KICC’s commitment to provide quality products and services, Sigey said at the Sotik factory. He was accompanied by Bomet Governor Joyce Laboso. The upgrade and expansion programme is underway in Sotik (Bomet county) and Dandora (Nairobi county). Upgrade of factories in Eldoret (Uasin Gishu) and Nyahururu (Laikipia) has been completed. “Better management and modern equipment have seen New KCC boost its raw milk intake,” Sigey said. Data by the Kenya Dairy Board in 2017 indicated the state-owned dairy firm increased its market share to 35 per cent of the raw milk uptake, up from 23 per cent in 2016, Sigey said. He said the ongoing upgrade of the Sotik plant will cost Sh200 million. This will ensure more production of fresh, long-life and fermented dairy products, he said. The old equipment being replaced was installed in 1982. The factory is in the heart of a dairy farming zone. Once completed, it will receive and process as much as 100,000 litres of raw milk per day, up from the current 60,000 litres. Sigey said the dairy farmers in the area have the potential to earn Sh1.5 billion a year. Currently, they earn Sh850 million. “This programme is bearing fruit. We have created an array of diversified products to meet the local and export market,” he said. New KCC’s products include fresh milk, butter, cheese, flavoured and unflavoured long-life milk, fermented milk and milk powder.
