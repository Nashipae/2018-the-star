Dozens of county vehicles have been grounded over the years because of minor mechanical problems caused by reckless driving. Most of the problems can be avoided if drivers take good care of the vehicles, Nairobi county chief fleet officer James Osodo said yesterday. He said his department will soon come up with disciplinary measures for county drivers. The official said the county government had discovered the fleet department has for many years lost money due to inflated repair charges. Osodo said 30 county vehicles have been repaired and are ready for use. Early this year, the county government found out the department responsible for repairs had been purposely grounded ambulances and fire engines and demanding millions of shillings to fix them. This was discovered when the department sent Governor Mike Sonko a quotation of Sh2.3 million to repair three ambulances at Mama Lucy Hospital. The ambulances had been grounded for close to two years. On January 29, 2018, the county head of the Fire Department, Brian Chunguli, was instructed to submit a handover report to the acting county secretary and proceed on compulsory leave with immediate effect. Chunguli was accused of negligence in handling an incident where four fire engines ran out of water a few minutes after arriving at the scene of a fire.
