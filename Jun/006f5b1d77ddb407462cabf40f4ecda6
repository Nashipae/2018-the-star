Security officers in West Pokot
county have burnt unclaimed gaming machines impounded last week. Police officers impounded the machines after parents complained children are absconding classes and spending the days in gaming dens. The machines seized from Ortum and Chepareria were burnt in Makutano town. “During the raid we never managed to
arrest anybody. The owners got a tip-off. We gave the owners a grace period of one week
to come and claim ownership," deputy county commissioner Khalif Abdulahi
said. "Nobody has turned up that’s why we have decided
to burn them since we want to totally eradicated gambling in this
county.” He said the machines had money and
they expected some owners to claim them. “People go there [gaming dens] and become
addicted. Some learners spend their school fees at [these] machines and
they end up dropping out of school,” Abdulai said.
