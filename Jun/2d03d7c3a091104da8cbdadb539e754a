Google has partnered with Mombasa county to train youths in a bid to reduce the high unemployment rate. Those targeted in the ‘Digital Skills for Africa Initiative’ are fresh graduates, job seekers and small business owners. Five thousand youths will take part. The training will help beneficiaries improve their online marketing skills, identify business opportunities and access target audience easily. The training targets 10 million Africans in the next five years. “As the world becomes digital, the skills that people need to land great jobs or grow successful businesses are changing. The youth make up 60 per cent of Africa’s unemployed, developing digital entrepreneurship and creating new job opportunities for them is critical to Africa’s transformative growth,” Google country manager Charles Murito said on Thursday. “We want to make sure people are able to get an income through being online.” Mombasa Deputy Governor William Kingi said the programme would be a game changer in addressing unemployment. “The current employment status is not as good as we would wish. We cannot employ everyone,” he said, adding the training would open a world of opportunities for the youth. Since Google announced its Digital Skills for Africa programme in April 2016, two million young Africans have been trained across 29 countries. The Google- Mombasa county partnership was the main launch of the Google’s second phase of the training in Kenya.
