Aslay, a fast-rising Tanzanian artiste and former Ya Moto band member, has denied ever dating Prezzo's ex-Tanzanian bae Amber Lulu Lulu sometime back said Aslay was among the men she has slept with. In a radio interview, she said Aslay is a lion in bed. “I have also done it with Aslay. Yeye ni kiboko yao. Kwenye game yuko noma. Aslay kiboko kabisa.” But the Likizo hitmaker has said Lulu was just being controversial. "It's just a publicity stunt to create an unnecessary scandal. Nothing like that has ever happened. Nowadays, people just talk the way they want without much thought to the consequences. If you follow me closely, you know I've never dated her. I have never been together with her because I respect her and she does the same to me." Recently, an explicit video of Lulu giving fellatio to a man who is not Prezzo went viral, forcing her to beg for forgiveness from Prezzo in an interview with Clouds FM. “Tulikua home tuna vibe. It wasn’t love. It was an accident. I thought about Prezzo. He is the man that I’m in a relationship with. I disappointed him. We’ve started arguing even with his friends and family.” Adding, “He is my lover, I thought about him all that time when the video leaked. Imemkosesha raha na amani pia. Prezzo ni mume wangu.” Word Is has tried to reached out to Prezzo a number of times but our calls went unanswered, so did our text message for comment. However, early this week, a photo of Prezzo in bed with socialite and rapper Noti Flow was plastered all over social media.
