There is no CT Scan machine in Mombasa,” Ruto said. The constituency will also benefit from a technical training college set to be constructed at a cost of Sh100 million. Ruto said it is key in fighting unemployment. “Mbogo should look for land where we can put up this institution,” the DP said. And there was more good news for teachers training college students and those about to join the institutions when the DP announced the government will soon start paying fees for them. The government will provide Sh30,000 grants to all TTC students and provide a loan facility for them, just like the university students enjoy the loans from the Higher Education Loans Board.
