Politicians have called for thorough investigations into the raid on Nyeri speaker John Kaguchia’s residence, saying it was politically motivated. Governor Mutahi Kahiga and Deputy Governor Caroline Karugu said there is more than meets the eye in the attack. Majority leader James Kanyugo said the attack was politically instigated. Kahiga questioned why the goons left after realising the speaker and his family were not at home. Nothing was stolen. He said the gang could have been after the speaker or his family. “When they realised he wasn’t there, they bundled the watchman into the vehicle and left with him. That tells us there is something to it,” Kahiga said.
