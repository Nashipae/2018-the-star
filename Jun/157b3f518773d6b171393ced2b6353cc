Five students were injured on Sunday night in a dormitory fire at Waa Boys' High School in Kwale county. It broke out in a dormitory at around 9 pm as the learners attended evening preps. Its cause was not established immediately. "Personal belongings were burnt before it was contained by students and fire fighters from SGA Security," principal Julius Changawa said. He said the 100 students who stayed in the facility would be assigned to others. "All the students are safe. We urge parents to remain calm since the five students were taken to hospital and are stable." County Commander Tom Odero said warned that students will be punished despite their ages should they be found responsible. Matuga MP Kassim Tandaza, who visited the school, asked the students to take their studies seriously as top performances will be rewarded with sponsorship.

At least 31 students were injured at the private Coulson school in February and more than 12 in the Kangemi incident in March. The Lamu school was closed and reopened on June 6 amid investigations into some of the learners. Last week, Msambweni Secondary School was closed for a week after a failed attempt to burn a dormitory. In May, Education Minister Amina Mohamed suspended all meetings planned by principals to ensure effective supervision of students. This was after fires razed at least 10 dormitories at several secondary schools.
