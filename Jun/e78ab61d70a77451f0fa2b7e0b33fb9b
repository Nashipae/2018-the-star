The Senate will summon Health CS Sicily Kariuki and the Council of Governors to clarify Kenya’s deal with 100 Cuban specialists. Senate Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen and his Minority counterpart James Orengo yesterday said the government was not disclosing all the facts. The 100 Cuban doctors are said to have been invited to improve services. Murkomen, who is also the Elgeyo Marakwet senator, said there are claims the Cubans will earn Sh1 million monthly, contrary to the Sh390,270 stated earlier. Murkomen said the Senate was involved in the deal but was only briefed after it was concluded. “While we praise the government for negotiating a deal with the Cubans, major policies touching on counties are drafted without reference to this House,” he said. Murkomen said the Senate has never had a chance to debate anything touching on health, be it counties or referral hospitals. Governors sideline the senators, he said. “Any decision by the CoG must be debated in the Senate. How are we supposed to debate an oversight issue in which we have no say?” Murkomen said. He added, “The governors run to this House when their deals with the national government go sour, but they don’t involve this House in brokering the deals.” The legislator said the Senate Health Committee, chaired by Michael Mbito, must summon the CS and governors to explain the deal with the Cuban government. Last month, while signing an MoU with the doctors, the government said it would spend Sh470 million annually on their salaries. The ministry will pay for their airfare. The Health ministry said the doctors will be in Job Group S, paid Sh390,270 salary. Orengo said the deal might pose a problem. Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr said equipment donated by the national government is only accessible in a few hospitals and county governments are forced to pay Sh200 million in advance for the machines. “Most of these machines counties are forced to purchase at a very exaggerated price,” Kilonzo said.
