The 10 bodies of the people who died in the Aberdare plane crash have been identified amid investigations into the incident. The bereaved gathered at Lee Funeral Home in Nairobi on Friday, when DNA samples were taken and tested, in a process led by Chief Government Pathologist Johansen Oduor. In a statement, the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) said the next step is a probe by the Air Investigation Department (AAID), which will include retrieving the wreckage of the FlySax plane from the crash site. Director General Gilbert Kibe said crucial aircraft components will be analysed and data that might provide critical information extracted. “KCAA's role is now to assist AAID to ensure that the cause of the accident is established as swiftly as possible,” Kibe said. He added that once the investigations are completed, the report will be shared with the authority, the Transport ministry and other relevant parties. The investigations involve US, Canada, Fiji and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), in line with international statutes. It was reported that the plane was serviced regularly and had flown to Homa Bay and Maasai Mara before the crash on Tuesday. Its pilots were described as experienced but it was said that they may have flown into bad weather over the Aberdare Forest in Kinangop area, Nyandarua County. The plane's signal was traced to this area and teams from several organisations deployed. The members included AAID, the National Disaster Management Unit, Kenya Wildlife Service, Kenya Defence Forces through the Air Force, Kenya Forest Service, National Police Service, Red Cross, the national government and the county commissioner's team.
