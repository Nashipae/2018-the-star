Security agents in Mandera have been urged to speed up operations in the border county. Speaking in Mandera town on Thursday, Mandera Deputy Governor Mohammed Arai decried deteriorating security in the region. Four people were killed last month at quarries along the border with Somalia despite security alerts on an imminent attack by al Shabaab. He said despite efforts by president Uhuru Kenyatta to beef up security in the region, there still remained lapses in the security sector in the region.
