It will be another three weeks before the DNA tests on 32 male staff at Moi Girls School are finalised ( see P3). This seems incredibly slow. After the Garissa University College massacre, Chiromo mortuary managed DNA identification of over 100 bodies in a few days. The police have strict protocols concerning possible contamination of evidence but they could move faster. The Moi Girls rapist is still at large. There are many private companies in Kenya offering DNA tests with the results back within five days. But these are testing up to 48 markers for ancestry, whereas police forces typically test only 18 markers in criminal cases. The police should be faster. In the USA, police use DNA machines that give a result in 90 minutes. If the police get a positive, then they can run a more detailed DNA test as well as checking other evidence. The police pathologist needs to get these fast American machines. If the police had them, they could have checked all 32 Moi samples in one day.
