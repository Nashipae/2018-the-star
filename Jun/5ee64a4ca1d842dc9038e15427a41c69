The
alarm clock buzzed at 05h00 as we awoke to a new day and arrived at the gate
just after 06h00. The
masterplan was to spend the entire day in the park and just enjoy all of
creation, from the smallest to the largest creatures. Well, I have to say it was
an amazing day, as our plan manifested into a wonderful reality. As we drove
along very slowly, there were many natural rewards, with wonderful observations
of the many different species that occur in the park. If
you are planning a family day in the park, I believe the following basic tips
could make your day really fantastic. 1.) Try to plan your food and drinks in
advance 2.) Use a cooler box with ice packs to keep food and drinks fresh and
cold 3.) It's worth waking up very early for a game drive 4.) Stop at a picnic site for a meal together
5.) Pack a good set of binoculars 6.) A map and some basic ID books are useful
when seeing various species 7.) Having a decent camera helps to enhance the
experience as you are able to capture some of your sightings in the form of
photos 8.) Don’t travel too much. Take time to sit and relax at various dams and
treed areas 9.) Don’t worry about finding lions first. Rather, focus on enjoying
every species and then, if a lion sighting happens, it will be a special bonus
10.) Slow down to the pace of nature, and relax! The tranquil peace in the park is tangible and
very real. A day in the park is a real “soul tonic”  medicine for the inner being, an escape from
the fast-paced world around us.  The
park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00. For
