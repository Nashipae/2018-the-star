The government's plan to construct 500,000 affordable houses by 2022 is on course. The key design principles for the expansive project includes an open space, smart technology, safety and security. The estates will also have open spaces, sports facilities, gathering places, playgrounds and pocket park. And that is not all as they will be accessible with a treelined avenue, pedestrian-friendly green verge path, well-trimmed lawns among other comforts. Amenities such as schools, community centres, retail centres, clinics will be incorporated in the project that is part of the Big Four Agenda. The government plans to use a frame and in-fill building technology. Infill panel walls are a form of cladding built between the structural members of a building. The structural frame provides support for the cladding system, and the cladding provides separation of the internal and external environments. The government has now released the project delivery and finance framework overview of the process of conceptualizing the housing program. To enhance program segmentation, the housing plan has defined four levels of housing types with only three (3) being the focus of the program. They include the middle to the high-income range of over 100,000, mortgage gap to people earning between Sh50,000 to Sh99,000. Low cost will be for those earning between Sh15,000 to Sh 49,000 while social is for the income of Sh0 to 14,900. The maximum selling price will be Sh600,000 for 1 bedroom, Sh1million for a two-bedroom.
