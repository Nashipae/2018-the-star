The health docket got the lion’s share of Makueni’s budget after the county assembly increased its allocation from Sh2 billion to Sh3.2 billion. Vice chairman of the budget and appropriations committee Harris Ngui said on Tuesday the allocation represented residents needs expressed during public participation. MCAs conducted the public participation last month. They have prioritised health, agriculture, providing- clean water, food security and disaster management in the Sh8.9 billion budget. The health budget will be used to equip Makueni Referral Hospital and improve infrastructure in all the seven subcounty hospitals. MCAs said the funds will also cater for free maternal healthcare. The finance docket received Sh973 million. Agriculture department got the third highest allocation of Sh715 million while water and irrigation received Sh714 million. MCAs allocated Sh10 million for disaster management and mitigation in each of the 30 wards. In the agricultural sector, MCAs want the executive to focus on intensifying extension services and increasing productivity. They also want youth involvement in the sector to boost dairy and fisheries development. Honey was also identified as a key area. The youth, gender and sports department got the lowest allocation of Sh126 million. The county targets to raise Sh608 million from revenue and additional funding of close to 200 million from donors. Members asked the  committee and the finance department to find ways of generating more revenue. They said the targeted Sh608 million was insufficient. Mbooni MCA Alexander Mulemba said departments ought to be tasked with raising their own funds.
