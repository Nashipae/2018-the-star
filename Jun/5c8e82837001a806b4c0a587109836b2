Five ODM politicians from Siaya have told MPs allied to Jubilee party to stop derailing the war on graft. Led by Senator James Orengo, they said some Jubilee MPs are frustrating the war on graft by alleging the country does not have legal mechanisms to enforce a lifestyle audit. A group of Jubilee MPs had said the exercise cannot go on without proper legal machinery. But Orengo (Siaya), Governor Cornel Rasanga, Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja MP), Samwel Atandi (Alego/Usonga), Elisha Odhiambo (Gem) said the MPs should support the move. The leaders said they will block attempts to protect cartels. They spoke on Saturday during the burial of Rasanga’s uncle Julius Ohumo in Barding village. Orengo said the legal basis for conducting a lifestyle audit is pegged on the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Act. “The law allows the scrutiny of property, whose circumstances of acquisition cannot be explained, through lifestyle audit processes,” he said. Orengo asked EACC to use its powers to carry out lifestyle audits. He said even if a legal basis never existed, anybody who has stolen public property should be dealt with. Orengo urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to advance the war on corruption because Kenyans have put their trust in him.  HANDSHAKE Rasanga asked Uhuru to quickly deal with perpetrators of corruption because they will dent his administration and jeopardise his legacy. Rasanga said he cleaned up all sectors in the county and sent home finance officers and the entire procurement office to secure his legacy. “I would like the President to follow suit by pursuing the cartels derailing development in the country and push for their prosecution to safeguard public money,” he said. Wandayi and Atandi told Jubilee leaders not to drag ODM legislators into their internal party wars as that will destruct partners in the handshake from fighting corruption.
