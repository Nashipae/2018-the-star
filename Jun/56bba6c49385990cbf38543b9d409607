Two teams moving in different directions in the battle to avoid relegation — Sony Sugar and Nakumatt — meet up in Awendo tomorrow as things start becoming clear on who will be facing the axe at the end of the season. For the better part of the campaign, it looked like that team would be Nakumatt, but the change in the clubs financial fortunes following an agreement with city politician, Francis Mureithi, has coincided with improved results on the pitch and now they are six points off the bottom and four clear of the two automatic relegation place. Sony, on the other hand, had looked safe by virtue of their pedigree in the top flight league and the formidable home form they have enjoyed down the years. But their infallibility in Awendo has been erased and now, more than ever, points away from home will be pivotal to their survival. Reports that eleven of their players have left the club will only serve to increase the pressure on the 2006 champions in their bid to beat the drop. Taking points from close rivals like Nakumatt will now be crucial if they are to get out of the dreaded zone. Mathare United had to come twice from behind to salvage a point against Nzoia United in a midweek performance that should ordinarily feel like a point gained. But with them chasing for the title and only three points adrift of league leaders Gor Mahia, it will feel more like two points dropped. Tomorrow, they will be at home to struggling Thika United looking to atone for their recent disappointments. Thika are two points off the drop zone as the first half of the campaign draws to a close and their coach, John Njogu, cut a frustrated figure after watching his side have an 80th minute goal chalked off for offside in their 1-0 defeat to Posta Rangers in a mid-week home fixture.
