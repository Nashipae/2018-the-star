A senior public health officer in Marsabit County will spend the rest of his life in prison for defiling a 10-year-old girl. George Lemayan alias Abubakar was found guilty on Thursday of four counts of the crime. Principal Magistrate Boaz Ombewa heard that he committed the offence at Kargi in Marsabit South on the night of November 7, 2015. The girl's aunt left her alone at home on that day. The aunt has been the girl's guardian since her mother died when she was a month old. The court heard that Lemayan threatened to kill the girl by hanging her from the roof of the house if she screamed. He tied her hands to her back and defiled her four times. Lemayan claimed he was framed and that on that day, he hosted colleagues who had returned from field work in Loiyangalani. Ombewa, however, said the prosecution's evidence was credible and that there was no sign of bad blood between the victim's family to warrant the allegation of framing. "The evidence of the child was not challenged. It was solid, reliable and sufficient to warrant a conviction," he said. The Magistrate also noted that a medical report was consistent with witness accounts. "The doctor concluded that the injuries to the child's genitals could have been caused by forceful penetration," he said. Residents asked the court to punish those found guilty more severely and handle cases speedily. Cases of child defilement have rocked several parts of the country in the past few months. On Wednesday, police in Makueni county started searching for a primary school teacher who allegedly defiled a class six pupil. He is among 21 people said to have sexually assaulted the 15-year-old on different dates since 2017. Police said one forced the girl into an abortion that left her near dead.
