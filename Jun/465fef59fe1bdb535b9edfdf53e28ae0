Muriungi said at least 15,000 litres of illicit brew have been nabbed in Mwatate alone since the crackdown started in May. He further warned those involved in the vice that stern actions shall be taken against them. "I want to caution those running these illegal businesses and drug barons that we are coming for them. We won't rest until they are all brought to book," he said. Two weeks ago, County Commissioner Rodah Onyancha directed all administrators to start a crackdown on the illicit brew in the county.
