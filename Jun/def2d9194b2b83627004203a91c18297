Some politicians have criticised ODM party leader Raila Odinga for his open opposition to Luhya unity ahead of the 2022 General Election. Raila has dismissed the plans to unite Luhyas behind a single party, saying it was a tribal plan. Kimilili MP Didimas Barasa yesterday said Raila’s opposition to Luhya unity could jeopardise his handshake truce with President Uhuru Kenyatta. “The handshake was meant to unite the country. It is therefore hypocritical for Raila to talk about uniting Kenyan when he is against Luhya unity," Barasa said in Malava. The Luhya unity drive is being spearheaded by NASA co-principals Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang'ula. They plan to merge their ANC and Ford Kenya parties to form a single party around which Luhyas will consolidate their votes. The two also plan to field a single presidential candidate in 2022. Raila criticised the move on May 28 during the burial of Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya's mother-in-law in Busia. Raila said such groupings were ill-motivated. He said profiling the region on a tribal basis will remain a pipe dream unless the populous block works with other communities. Six Jubilee MPs and former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale on Sunday said Luhya leaders have agreed to work together to decide the region's political destiny. They said they will ensure the community becomes parts of government in 2022. "Whether is will be a Luhya forming the government or partnering with other leaders to form it doesn't matter. We must be in government in 2022," Barasa said. He spoke during a Sunday service at St Teresa's Malava Catholic Church. He was with National Assembly chief whip Ben Washiali (Mumias East), Emmanuel Wangwe (Navakholo), Dan Wanyama (Webuye West), Bernard Shinali (Ikolomani) and Malulu Injendi (Malava).
