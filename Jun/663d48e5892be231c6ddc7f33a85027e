Governor Ali Korane yesterday urged local and foreign tourists to visit the county. He said Garissa is a unique destination with rare white giraffes and antelopes, among other wildlife. “Think of vising my county. You will be surprised by the type of animals that you will come across — very rare to find in the world. You’ll not regret,” Korane said at the Africa Trade and Investment Global Summit in Washington DC, where he delivered a keynote address. ATIGS  is a prestigious biennial conference and exhibition that promotes international trade. Korane dismissed claims nothing good comes from Northeastern and that tourist attraction sites only exist at the Coast and Masai Mara. Korane however said the county has a long way to go to attract many visitors. He said they are improving roads and other infrastructure to transform the sector. He said they have huge potential for farming and will provide measures to support irrigation projects. He signed an MoU with the US African Development Foundation. The partnership will focus on investment in agriculture, off-grid energy and jobs creation.
