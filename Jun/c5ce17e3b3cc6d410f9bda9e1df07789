An oil firm associated with controversial businessman Pankaj Somaia and linked to the Sh44.9 billion Imperial Bank scandal has now lost its bid to stop two other lenders from auctioning its land to recover debts. Metro Petroleum, which has emerged as one of the firms with oustanding loans at Imperial Bank, has lost its bid to stop UBA Tanzania and Family Bank from selling its Riverside Drive property to recover Sh284 million. UBA Tanzania in 2015 won a case in Dar-es-Salaam allowing it to trace and attach Metro’s assets to recover a debt of $2.27 million (Sh227 million) and Tsh600 million (Sh26.5 million). The lender however managed to trace only one asset registered to Metro—the Riverside Drive land which has a house built on it. Reports filed in court indicate that the property’s sale value is Sh120 million. The land was however registered as security to Family Bank, which had already sought to auction the property to recover a Sh31 million debt. The High Court in 2017 ordered Family Bank to sell the property, recover its claim and remit the balance to UBA Tanzania. But Metro filed a fresh application seeking to dismiss the order that allowed UBA to receive any proceeds from auction of its land.
