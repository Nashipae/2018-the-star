There is a shortage of marine researchers, Agriculture Research PS Hamadi Boga said on Friday. Boga asked institutions near the Indian Ocean, including the Technical University of Mombasa and Pwani University, to invest in marine studies. The PS said there was need for government to increased funding for such programmes. “We do not have enough researchers. We need young people who can understand the ocean and marine ecosystem,” Boga said. He was speaking during an Open Day for the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute in Mombasa. Boga said there was need to mobilise resources from the government and donors to fund research by Kemfri. Kemfri CEO James Njiru said they were getting less funding from the Treasury. “What we are getting is only enough for payment of salaries and operations. We need to have more funds for research and purchase of modern equipment,” Njiru said. He said Kemfri requires between Sh10 and Sh15 million for deep sea excursions and research. Kenya is underutilising its marine ecosystem which is valued at over Sh440 billion annually. During the World Ocean Day celebrations observed on June 9, Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri said fisheries account for only 0.5 per cent of Kenya’s Gross Domestic Product. Marine fishing is estimated to have an annual potential of 350,000 tonnes worth Sh90 billion. “However, Kenya yields 9,134 tonnes worth about Sh2.3 billion. It is important to ensure the full economic potential of marine resources is exploited,” Kinjuri said.
