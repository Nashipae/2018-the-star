UHC is one the four pillars that Uhuru has prioritised in his second term. The Government has enhanced investments in the health sector in a sustained effort to ensure that all Kenyans have access to affordable and quality healthcare services. At the core of the Government's renewed approach to healthcare provision is preventive services which make sustained immunization programmes, provision of adequate medical equipment and other forms of primary medicine key interventions. On March 17, while on a state visit to Cuba, Uhuru agreed to accelerate a health agreement signed with Cuba last year to bring in doctors from the Caribbean nation to fill gaps in the county hospitals’ staffing. The doctors will need to be cleared by the Kenya Medical and Practitioners and Dentists Board. The MoU does not say how much the specialists will earn but the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union estimates that the deal will cost about Sh2 billion annually.
