Police have three days to probe two people arrested
with Sh3.7 million ivory. Chief magistrate Julius Nang'ea declined to give
the police 21 days they had requested to investigate the matter. Abdikheir Ibrahim and Abdullahi Adan were arrested
on Saturday at Buxton police road block along Mombas-Malindi road. They were allegedly in possession of eight pieces
of ivory tusks weighing 37 kilogrammes. Also recovered on board the suspects' car was a
hacksaw which is believed to have been used in chopping off of the tusks from
the elephants. The prosecution asked the court to give them more time
to allow them carry out a thorough investigations on the suspects. Hamisa Chuma of KWS told
the court that they have not been able to investigate the matter due to constraint
of time considering that the accused were arrested on a weekend. Chuma said they intend to investigate phone call
communications between the suspects and their could be accomplices. He said the police believe the suspect belong to a
syndicate involved in the trade of wildlife trophies. He further said the suspects were likely to interfere
with the investigations if released on bond or cash bail. The KWS official said the suspects might also interfere with the
potential witnesses and their accomplices. The court was informed that Ibrahim had previously
been charged with a similar offence at the Narok law court where the matter still
pending. Chuma said the suspects' nationality is suspicious much as they have produced their identification card. Click here for the latest political news
