The decision by President Uhuru Kenyatta to order a lifestyle audit
of all senior public servants, starting with himself and DP
William Ruto, is a good step towards fighting runaway corruption. The President is leading by example. Previous attempts to introduce lifestyle audits by the EACC and the Judiciary were fought viciously by people from within. Now, however, there is political will and the President has sworn to eradicate corruption. The
country has been victimised by corrupt officials for a long time.
Once corruption is tackled effectively, everything and everyone will be
required to be transparent. People in high positions must be held
accountable. Lifestyle audits are long overdue because officials
have been living beyond their legitimate means, without having to
explain extra incomes. The audit by outside professionals will set the stage for those who
cannot account for their wealth to be prosecuted, especially if the
audit is seen to be professionally done and its results implemented impartially and across the board. A lifestyle audit would go a long way in exposing the depth of corruption. Subjecting
officials to routine audits, beyond justÂ  vetting, would send the
message that fighting corruption is not an event
but a process. Officials will constantly be on notice. However, it is important that the process and
those given the responsibility of implementing it be impartial to avoid
accusations of selective justice.
