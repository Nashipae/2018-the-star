It is unfair not to renew the Del Monte lease because it could render many youths jobless, Thika Town MP Patrick Wainaina has said. He spoke at a Thika hotel yesterday after meeting clerics. The MP said the firm’s lease will be renewed next year. “The company’s lease will be renewed next year so that the firm can continue giving jobs to more Kenyans and contribute towards the growth of the country’s economy,” he said. The Kiambu government hyas said the lease will not be renewed. The company and the Kiambu government have formed a nine-member committee to assess the land under utilisation and unutilised land. Wainaina said it was ill-advised to decline renewing the firm’s lease without providing an alternative for the locals whose jobs are at stake. He said the company will help achieve President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda by creating jobs.
