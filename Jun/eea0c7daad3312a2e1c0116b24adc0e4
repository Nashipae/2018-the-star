Police in Bungoma North are hunting for thugs who attacked residents of Bilibili village in Tongaren and killed a man on Tuesday night. The 42-year-old man was shot three times on the chest. The thugs, who arrived on a motorbike, raped his wife and demanded money. The attackers struck at about 1am and terrorised residents until 3pm. They went from house to house asking for cash. Resident Meshack Ingabo told the Star the incident occurred while it was raining. He said it appeared the thugs were on a mission to kill the man. His wifeâ€™s pleas to spare his life fell on deaf ears.
