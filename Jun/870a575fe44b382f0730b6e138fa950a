Gospel super producer Dr Eddie is currently admitted at Coptic Hospital after falling from the 4th floor balcony last week. In a press statement, he said: "On Thursday 31st May night, I had an accident at home, where I slipped and fell from my 4th floor balcony and hence by the grace of God managed to narrowly escape death. This however had me sustain several injuries where I had a shattered pelvic bone and other multiple fractures. I underwent a successful reconstructive surgery at the Coptic Hospital, where I'm still hospitalised and getting better by the day." In a video that went viral, Eddie said from his hospital bed that he is likely to be discharged anytime soon. "Thanks to everyone who has come to visit me in hospital."
