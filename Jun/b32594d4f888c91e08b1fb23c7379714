ODM leader Raila Odinga and Governor Hassan Joho are attending the Eid Baraza in Mombasa. The Baraza marks the official end of the month-long fasting and praying Muslims have been undertaking. This is the first time for the Opposition leader to attend such a function. His attendance was closely guarded unlike other events he has graced. Eid Barazas are always marked with reconciliatory messages from the county's wrangling political factions. During the last year's session, the Mombasa Governor embraced his political nemeses Suleiman Shahbal and Hassan Omar. Shahbal and the former Senator lost to Joho in the August 2017 polls. The meeting comes in the wake of a flurry of handshakes as leaders reach to another to end the political enmity which followed last year's general election. Joho recently shook hands with President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto, ending months of friction between the two leaders. This was on Thursday during the commissioning of Dongo-Kundu Southern bypass. Just like Raila, Joho pledged to work with the head of state. At today's meeting, Raila and Joho are expected to talk on Building Bridges subject and definitely, Kenya's political future. Click here for the latest political news
