Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho on Friday led legislators in the county in attending a state function for the first in nearly two years, as the effects of the handshake continue to be felt.Joho and Mombasa MPs have been skipping state functions due to differences between the Jubilee government and the Mombasa government. The last state function that Joho attended was the 2016 Jamhuri Day, where his supporters and those of then Nyali MP Hezron Awiti clashed.Awiti was seen as a darling of the national government and was vying for the county top seat. On Friday Joho called for a truce and shook hands with county commissioner Evans Achoki in a symbolic gesture during this year’s Madaraka Day celebrations at Tononoka Grounds.
