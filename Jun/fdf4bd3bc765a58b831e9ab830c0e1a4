One of the businessmen charged with Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter in a Sh633 million treasury bills fraud case has been charged afresh. Mohan Mahesh alias Madat Saburali Chatur denied 12 counts related to forgery of Sh633 million treasury bills. The prosecution applied to have the accused charged afresh because they had amended the charges to include Mahesh’s other names and one more count. Mahesh is charged alongside Keter and businessman Johnstone Arthur Sakwa. They denied the charges and were granted a Sh2 million bail or Sh5 million bond. In the first count, the three are charged with conspiracy to defraud the Central Bank. The court heard that the accused committed the offence on February 16 at the CBK in Nairobi jointly with others not before court. They are said to have conspired with intent to defraud the CBK by presenting forged treasury bills worth Sh286,000,000 with issue number 1138 dated February 5, 1990. Click here for more political news
