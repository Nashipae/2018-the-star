Fish from China has flooded the Naivasha market leading to an outcry by local fishermen. They now want the national government to take action and ban imports. The move comes amid reports fish stock in the lake has dropped to the lowest levels in years due to overfishing and use of undersize nets. The department of fisheries has ruled out reintroducing a fishing ban in the lake, saying this would hurt the livelihoods of families that rely on it. Lake Naivasha Boat Owners chairman David Kilo said the Chinese stock had flooded the town and were selling for between Sh15 and Sh20. This, compared to local produce which retails at an average fo Sh70. “We have in the past expressed our concern over the dwindling fish stock in the lake, but the county has ignored this and we are now reaping from our ignorance,” Kilo said. He said the lake was in danger due to overfishing, use if undersize nets and failure to restock it for two years. Kilo questioned the rationale for allowing the importation of fish, saying the lake had the capacity to supply enough if supported. “We are calling for support from the county government in restocking the lake and banning the sale of the imported fish which have ended up affecting the local market,” he said. Speaking earlier, director of fisheries Mathew Ngila attributed the drop in fish stock to a rise in water levels and described it as normal. Ngila however admitted there are many challenges including poaching and use of undersize nets which hurt fish production.
