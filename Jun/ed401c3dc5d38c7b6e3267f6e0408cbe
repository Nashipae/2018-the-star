The Court of Appeal yesterday upheld the election of Anyang’ Nyong’o as Kisumu governor. The court threw out a case filed by former Governor Jack Ranguma contesting a High Court ruling that upheld Nyong’o’s August 8 win. Justice Philip Waki dismissed the appeal with costs and said it lacked merit. He said High Court judge David Majanja did not err in confirming Nyong’o’s victory. Waki said Majanja was right in putting the burden of proof on Ranguma, who failed to demonstrate that he had won the election. Nyong’o got 272,127 votes against Ranguma’s 156,963. Waki said there was insufficient factual evidence to shift the burden of proof to the respondents. Ranguma’s lawyer Richard Onsongo had argued that the High Court dismissed the petition unfairly and that it never understood the grounds on which the petition was founded. “The petition was not only founded on contested figures, it was largely based on the fact that there was a systemic failure which culminated in an election that was not free and fair,” Onsongo said.  all the best He said the electoral commission admitted in court that it announced Nyong’o the victor before all votes had been counted, and this affected the integrity of the election. But Waki said failure to include the results from five polling stations in Kisumu East constituency did not affect the entire results or the outcome. He said Nyong’o being declared winner before all the results were in was not in dispute as the tally from the five polling stations would not have changed the victory margin. After the verdict, Ranguma said he was not bitter. In an indication he might not proceed to the Supreme Court, he wished his successor the best and urged him to deliver on the development promises he made. “Even though I know I won the election, I’m an advocate of devolution and would want to see the county continue with offering services.”
