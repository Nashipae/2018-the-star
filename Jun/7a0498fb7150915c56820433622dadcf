Ahadi Kenya Trust CEO Stanley Kamau has called on the government to state whether sugar on sale is safe. Kamau said some people have been hesitant to take sugar donations for fear it is not fit for human consumption. “I have travelled to several areas in the country and people have been asking a lot of questions about sugar. Some have even stopped taking it following reports that the sugar is laced with mercury, copper and lead that are dangerous to human bodies,” he said on Friday.

All we want to know and we are concerned about is the health of our people. They want to know whether they should continue consuming it,” he said.  ARTIFICIAL SHORTAGE Kamau said if there is sugar that is contaminated, it should be removed from the shelves. He called on sugar importers not to play with the health of the people. Starehe MP Charles Njagua, who was present, said Kenyans are confused and should be told the truth. “Kenyans want to know the truth and the traders who are involved even if they are Members of Parliament,” he said. Njagua said the government should revive the sugar sector and keep off cartels engaged in importation of sugar. He said some unscrupulous business people may take advantage of the confusion to hike prices of sugar by causing an artificial shortage.
