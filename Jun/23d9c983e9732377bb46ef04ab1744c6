Bungoma emerged the best revenue collector in this year’s County Own Source Revenue Automation awards. Commission on Revenue Allocation ICT director Joseph Kuria said Bungoma recorded great improvement in the period between 2013-14 and 2016-17. “Bungoma had a revenue collection of Sh182.7 million in the year 2013-14. In 2014-15 it received Sh504.6, 2015-16 it recorded a revenue of Sh630 million while in the following period it generated Sh661.5 million,” he said. Kuria spoke during a ceremony to present the award to the best counties in revenue collection on Wednesday night at Kaskazi Beach in Diani, Kwale. Marsabit was second in revenue collection of Sh111.9 million in 2015-16 and Sh128.7 million in 2016-17 financial years. Nyandarua came third with an improved revenue collection of Sh138.4 million in the financial year 2013-14 to Sh296.7 million in 2016-17. Kuria said the three counties have been able to control and manage their revenue collection processes. He said the award is in recognition of their effort to grow county revenue. Kuria attributed the improved revenue collection to redefined management processes. “The automation of revenue management processes through appropriate technologies and enactment of relevant legislation helped the counties to register a significant improvement,” he said. Kuria said CRA will continue supporting counties to enhance their revenue collection. Commission chairperson Jane Kiringai said they will work with governors to ensure counties meet and improve their revenue collection. Earlier this week CRA praised 33 counties for automating revenue collection. Kiringai said the remaining 14 counties are still collecting revenue manually. She said of the 33 counties, 18 counties have realised an increase in their revenue collection. “Use of ICT will enable counties to achieve accelerated growth and development through efficiency and effective use of limited resources,” Kiringai said.
