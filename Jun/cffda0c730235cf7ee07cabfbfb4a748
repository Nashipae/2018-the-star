The county government will renovate roads and toilets to improve Kisii town’s image ahead of two major events, Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi has said. The works include construction of pedestrian walkways, paving of backstreets, renovation of public washrooms and other facilities. He said the government is addressing congestion in the town ahead of the  forthcoming Kenya Inter-County Sports and Cultural Association and County Assemblies Sports Association (CASA) games. “The face of this town has changed completely and we shall continue doing it even after Kicosca games,” Maangi said. The deputy governor said more than 10,000 guests are expected attend. Last week, the county hosted a breakfast meeting to woo stakeholders in the town to support the games. “As the local organising committee chair, my team is working round the clock to ensure the success of the event and I am confident that we have what it takes to host the games,” said Maangi. Governor James Ongwae (pictured above right during the meeting) and Maangi assured Kenyans the county had prepared well for the games. Ongwae thanked the business community for their support and commitment to make the event a success. He urged them to take advantage of the large influx of visitors to do business.
