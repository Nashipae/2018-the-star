The High court has stopped the intended demolition of eight houses at Green Park Estate in Athi River pending hearing and determination of a boundary dispute case. Justice George Odunga sitting in Machakos issued the orders following an urgent application filed by developers Superior Homes after the Water Resource Management Authority ordered the demolition. Superior Homes, through lawyer Philip Nyachoti, said the enforcement order issued on May 31 could not be complied with because the time was inadequate to ascertain the concreteness of the boundaryunder dispute. “The intended demolition or removal of residents is halted until the court makes its decision on the dispute between the company and (Warma),” Odunga said yesterday. The lawyer told the judge the decision by the authority was illegal and unlawful as its contravened the applicant’s legitimate expectation and is motivated by extraneous purposes other than those recognised by law. Nyachoti submitted that Warma purported the houses are on riparian land bordering River Athi, adding the decision goes against Warma findings contained in a letter dated September 3, 2013.
