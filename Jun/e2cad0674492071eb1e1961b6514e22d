A section of Coast leaders have agreed to form alliance with Deputy President William Ruto ahead of the 2022 general election. Ruto is expected to run for President as Uhuru Kenyatta is serving his second and final term. The Coast leaders, led by Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi, said they were ready to partner with the DP to form the next government. Kingi was categorical about the alliance - he said it should be based on terms favourable for the region, away from the Coast's culture of leaning on political parties without agreements. "Stop endorsing the DP and focus on uniting the region, then sit down with him and agree on how to work together," he told the leaders. Jubilee Party and Nasa leaders have been meeting and making deals following the March 9 handshake between the President and Opposition leader Raila Odinga. Kingi said they will work with the Jubilee administration as they have "Baba's goodwill" as he took the lead with the handshake, so going against it would be a betrayal. He dismissed ODM leaders terming Kilifi politicians rebels for taking Ruto's side ahead of the poll. “The union was easy because of the handshake. We should thank Raila for saying Kingi should not fight Ruto if he comes to Malindi. I welcome them because of the handshake." The Governor further noted that it was time to plan for the next election and that the best option was for Coast residents to unite and plan. “Since independence, we have listened to a voice from outside the region. This time round, we shall not listen to anybody from outside. The decision on where Coast will go will be made by the people," he said. He spoke on Saturday in Malindi during an Iftar dinner and fundraising for Malindi Education Development Association Foundation (MEDA-F) at Sai Eden Roc Hotel. Among those present were Ruto, Majority Leader Aden Duale, Devolution CAS Hussein Dado, Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa and Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya. Lawmakers from Kilifi and Lamu counties have endorsed Ruto's candidature. Those at the dinner included Owen Baya (Kilifi North), Paul Katana (Kaloleni), Gertrude Mbeyu (Kilifi Woman Representative), Christine Zawadi (Nominated Senator), Lamu Woman Representative Ruweida Obbo and Stanley Muthama (Lamu West).

On March 21, Mvita lawmaker Abdulswamad Nassir said talks were taking place for the DP to drop his presidential bid in favour of Joho. Nassir told The Star that the agreement would endear Ruto to the Coast and foster national unity. Days later, Ruto dismissed the reports while Joho said he will go for the presidency in 2022.

"Organise yourselves and be faithful as I am well-prepared to take over the presidency after the expiry of Uhuru's second term," he said. Ruto pointed out that the Coast region sides the Jubilee government when it comes to money matters but votes for the Opposition. While emphasising strategic partnerships, he said the era of 'tibim' and 'tialala' was gone. Duale said Ruto is the only candidate fit for presidency in 2022 as he has the energy to serve Kenyans. “We need to join hands and form the government. Ruto is a candidate for the minority Coast and North Eastern,’’ he said. Duale, who is also Garissa Town MP, told Kingi that he should venture into national politics after finishing his second term as Governor. Mvurya asked Coast people to back Ruto’s bid while Jumwa said the era of being in the Opposition was over. "Leaders want to be in government," Jumwa said, adding Kingi should not be threatened by anybody. More than Sh8 million was raised during the fundraiser, with Ruto giving Sh2 million.
