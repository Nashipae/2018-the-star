Meat dealers and abattoirs in Wajir continue counting losses following a ban on trade in animal products. Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi met Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa yesterday to ask for relief food until the ban is lifted. The county and national government imposed the ban last week because of Rift Valley Fever.  PROPER INSPECTION Wajir Health executive Abdihakim Billow said five people have died of the disease. He spoke at a press conference in his office yesterday. Some butchers have condemned the blanket ban. Instead, they want veterinary officials to do proper inspection and allow them to continue with their work. We depend on this business to support our families. Meat should be inspected well after animals are slaughtered before being distributed for sale,” businessman Ahmed bin Omar said in Wajir. More than 40 camels and goats have died of the disease. The epidemic has affected mainly Eldas and Wajir West subcounties. A task force of technical staff from public health and livestock departments has been formed to monitor the situation. Wajir veterinary director Dr George Kiprono said virus was first identified in 1931 during an outbreak among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley. “Since then, outbreaks have been reported in Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa. In 2000 there were more cases of the disease reported in Yemen and Saudi Arabia,” he said.
