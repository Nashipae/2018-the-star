A court is today expected to pass a sentence on two West African businessmen found guilty of being in possession of Sh112 billion fake dollars and euros. Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi yesterday fixed the date. Mohammed Sani alias Dr Mustafa and Ousman Bako asked the court to be lenient. In their mitigation, the two apologised, saying they are remorseful and will be good teachers in society. They told the court they are family men with young dependants. Andayi had earlier found them guilty of obtaining Sh25 million from businessman Omar Abdisalaam by pretending they had deposited millions in US dollars in a brief case at De La Rue Global Lab Company. They were also charged with forgery, being in Kenya illegally and engaging in employment without authorisation. Andayi said the prosecution, led by senior state counsel Daniel Karuri, proved the two committed the offences.
