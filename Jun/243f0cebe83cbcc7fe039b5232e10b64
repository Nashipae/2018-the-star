A Catholic priest has been suspended for one year after rapping in church. Paul Ogallo, 45, based in Rapogi Parish tried to revolutionize sermons by using rap music and drama to attract youth to the church. After the daily masses, Ogallo would change from his vestments into a white shirt, black shorts and a red bandana in which he could begin rapping for the congregation. Not left behind, the congregation also danced along to the tunes. According to the Catholic Herald, Ogallo said the rap music is taking care of the interests of youths in our churches. "We need to change the way we do things," he said. The church had been closely monitoring Ogallo's new found style of attracting the youth and was not pleased with his dressing code. Judicial vicar of the inter-diocesan tribunal of Kisumu, Father Charles Kochiel said Ogallo's rap music brings mixed signals to the congregants. “People could be looking at it from the social point of view, like bringing people on board, gathering and entertaining people. But people could also be looking at this from the spiritual point of view: Does it promote spiritual values or is it sending a wrong message?” Kochiel said.
