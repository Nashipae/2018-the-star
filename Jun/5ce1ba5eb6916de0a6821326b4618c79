The Nyamira government will spend Sh10 million to renovate county markets. The move will improve the condition of poor markets that threaten traders’ health. The dirty markets have instilled fear in the traders who sell their wares outside. Those who sell food in kiosks inside the market protested that the filth hurts their business as no customers come to eat. The traders have been protesting against the filthy conditions for more than a year, asking the county to take action. Traders who sell their goods by the road have said they fear disease outbreaks, especially with the ongoing rains. The county government will renovate markets through Ministry of Roads, Public Works and Urban Development. A pineapple trader said, “We fear contracting diseases since there is a =heavy downpour. We have suffered a lot and this is enough. The county government has neglected us, but they are usually punctual in collecting revenue.” The traders at Ikonge Market on Thursday attended the launch of the market cleanup. Roads executive John Omanwa said the county government will move the traders to developed sheds. The modern stalls were constructed a year ago by the county government. They are not operational yet, despite being completed. The traders say the market stall is only opened on Sundays, the market day, and closed the rest of the week as they operate by the road. MCA Thaddeus Nyabaro said it is not safe for traders to sell their wares by the road.
