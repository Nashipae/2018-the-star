The IEBC will relocate its headquarters away from the Nairobi CBD to avoid disruption of business when politicians organise demos. The poll agencyâ€™s offices are at Anniversary Towers. Chairman Wafula Chebukati yesterday said they will acquire their own premises. It would cut recurrent costs and save taxpayer money, he said. In the run-up to the August 8 election, NASA held anti-IEBC protests claiming the commission was biased in favour of Jubilee. The protests were concentrated on the University Way that runs in front of the IEBC offices. Chebukati said the relocation was among the reforms they are undertaking.
