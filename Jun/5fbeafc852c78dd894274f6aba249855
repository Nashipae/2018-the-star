Westlands MP Tim Wanyonyi on Wednesday declared that he will be contesting the Nairobi governor's seat. He made the declaration at Loresho Primary school where he disbursed cheques worth Sh27.5 million to over 3,000 students. The learners are drawn from various secondary schools, colleges, and universities. The MP will be seeking to remove GovernorÂ Mike Sonko from office
and is likely to face stiff competition from the incumbent and Senator
Johnson Sakaja. He said the desire to take over from Sonko is driven by "numerous complaints" he receives over bad roads and uncollected garbage "yet he is not responsible for them". "I am only in-charge of CDF which takes care of education and security
development but people are asking me about things that don't fall in my
mandate like poor roads." "Therefore, in 2022 I will be in City Hall where such services should be delivered from," Wanyonyi said. The disbursed salaries will see beneficiary High school students get Sh5, 000 each while those in colleges and universities were apportioned Sh10, 000. Wanyonyi urged the parents to deposit the cheques immediately so that they are not returned to the National Treasury at the expiry of the current fiscal year. The current financial year ends on June 30. Wanyonyi further said CDF will pay full school fees for 160 needy students in four new schools in the constituency. They are Loresho, Vetlab, Farasi Lane and North Highridge secondary schools. Wanyonyi said other students will have half of their school fees paid by the constituency fund.
