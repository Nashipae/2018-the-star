North Mugirango MP Joash Nyamoko (pictured) has criticised threats against Interior CS Fred Matiang’i over his move to curb illegal sugar importation. Speaking on Friday in Nyamira, Nyamoko said the CS should be respected as he performs his duties, especially in the fight on poisonous sugar in the market. “We are facing problems like corruption and contraband goods. As leaders ensure the matters are addressed, some politicians are proving to be a block in the invesigations,” he said. The lawmaker added that some MPs and senators only pretend to support the President’s war on corruption and contraband. “These are the same leaders who are threatening the CS.” The North Mugirango lawmaker said Kisii politicians will not allow any leader to threaten Matiang’i. He urged those with information that would speed up the illegal sugar probe to come out. “Some of the politicians fighting the CS might be involved in such scandals.” He supported the move by DPP Noordin Haji, President Uhuru Kenyatta and DCI boss George Kinoti, saying they should ensure all those behind the illegal sugar importation are punished. Police on Saturday intercepted a lorry carrying 240 bags of brown sugar near Emali with documents indicating it was imported from Egypt. The documents showed the sugar was to be delivered to Kakamega although the truck was heading towards Loitokitok.
