Embu Level 5 Hospital chief executive Moses Njue yesterday denied stealing a heart during a post mortem to hide evidence. He appeared before Meru chief magistrate Lucy Ambasi. Njue was charged with stealing, removing and destroying a body part of a deceased person. He was released on Sh500,000 bail or Sh2 million bond. Njue was accused of stealing the heart during the postmortem of Benedick M’Nchamaru on March 12, 2015, at Consolata Hospital in Imenti South, Meru county. He is also accused of destroying the heart, knowing it might be required as evidence in judicial proceedings. Njue’s lawyer Victor Adande requested the court to release him on reasonable bail. “I ask the court that the accused (his client) be supplied with prosecution statements and documents in the matter. I wish to apply for the reasonable bond term, he is a CEO Embu Level 5 Hospital and therefore in the interest of justice I ask the court to grant him a personal bond,” Adande said. State prosecutor Claire Muriithi did not object to the bail terms, but asked the court to release the accused according to terms of the law like any other citizen. The hearing of the case is on August 6. In May, Njue had denied allegations of stealing the heart of Timothy Mwandi at Lee Funeral Home while performing an autopsy on June 25, 2015. He had then filed an application at the High Court, seeking to stop the criminal proceedings against him.
