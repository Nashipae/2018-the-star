The leaders led by Wajir East MP Rashid Kassim, area senator Abdullahi Ali women representative Fatuma Gedi and a host MCAs had taken issue with the manner in which the police were carrying out the operation Kutulo,Boji Garass,Konton and Qarsa in Wajir East constituencies ‘under the pretext of fighting terror. Three people who were allegedly picked by security agencies in konton and their shops burnt by security officers while a third one was arrested from Qarsa center. But according to Saleh, the security officers were doing ‘targeted operation that is only aimed at arresting those involved in the insecurity ‘. Speaking to the press in Garissa town, Saleh further refuted allegations that the security apparatus had burnt down several houses and shops in the localities rendering several families homeless. “I want to make it very clear that no innocent citizen is being harmed or targeted in this operation. allegations of razing down of houses and shops are also unfounded. Politicians should stop whipping emotions of the people because they are not helping matters by doing that,” said Saleh.
