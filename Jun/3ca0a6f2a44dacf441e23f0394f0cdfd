Kenya Power's disconnection of electricity supply to City Hall was in bad faith, two Nairobi officials have said. City Hall and the adjacent City Hall Annex used generators for the second day on Wednesday as Kenya Power cut electricity supply over a Sh732 million debt. Details: Kenya Power leaves City Hall in blackout over Sh732 million debt At a press conference later on Wednesday, County secretary Peter Kariuki claimed that the supplier disregarded an agreement between the parties. Kariuki noted that a joint task force was formed to establish the exact amount owed by each party and that it had not yet proposed ways to offset the debt. “The amount they claim we owe them is an estimation. That is why the team was formed,” he also said, placing the figure at Sh990 million and adding that it disputed a Sh543 million amount in court. “Out of the balance of Sh447 million, Nairobi recognises Sh215 million obtained from actual meter readings but has expressed reservations on the balance of Sh232 million which was also based on estimated readings." He addressed the press alongside acting Finance and Lands executive Charles Kerich. The Secretary further argued that the firm owes City Hall Sh816 million for way leaves for its distribution networks and installations. He said Nairobi was willing to pay the debt and had already released Sh15 million. “In short, the county has no problem paying what it owes. We only request that the task force be given time to reconcile these debts,” he said. “One practical way to deal with this would be a debt swap where we net off. The balance should be paid [by the party] with the larger figure." The official reported that operations at the county headquarters had not been affected as the county has generators. But the Star found that most offices at City Hall and the Annex did not have lights. Click here for the latest political news
