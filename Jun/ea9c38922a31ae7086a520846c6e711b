City officers yesterday demolished around 15 illegal structures along Kiambu Road in an operations aimed at giving Nairobi a face lift. According to City Hall's director of operations Peter Mbaya the structures were illegally erected on the wall of Muthaiga Police Station causing insecurity. Speaking to the Star yesterday, Mbaya said the structures were also built on reserved road. “These structures cause a lot of insecurity within the area and it is against the law to build on road reserves, “said Mbaya. He however said the traders had been given a written notice of evacuating the place, with the last one being a 24 hour notice. Mbaya said unlike other demolition operations, there was not resistance buy the traders. “If one knows they have done an act against the law, they don’t fight back. We are pleased at least the traders are showing a positive attitude towards the operations, “said Mbaya. In previous demolitions, traders faulted the county pulling down their structures without giving a notice or even relocating them to somewhere else. He urged traders who have encroached on road reserves and built on pedestrian pavement to bring down the structures before they are demolished by the city officers. “We will not relent in our operations and we will ensure that open spaces meant for other activities and road reserves are not interfered with ,”said Mbaya. Earlier this week, the city officers had demolished illegal structures and buildings along Nairobi River in Kariokor. Also the demolitions have expanded across bus terminals including Ngara, Muthurwa and the Nairobi Bus station in the city centre. The exercise is aimed at restoring the original space allocated to public bus terminals in order to allow for free flow of traffic. All the demolitions are in attempt of Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko’s Government to restore law and order within the city of Nairobi
