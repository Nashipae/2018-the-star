Catholic Bishop Joseph Obanyi has said people behind importation of the allegedly poisonous sugar must be prosecuted. Obanyi said said the government must be serious about protecting the lives of Kenyans. “If contraband sugar can enter the country and be supplied for use by Kenyans without the governments’ knowledge and its top officials engage in blame-game about its entry and suitability for use, it means that we are not safe as citizens,”said the Kakamega bishop. He spoke yesterday at Malinya village in Ikolomani sub-county kalata, the mother of Catholic two. Cabinet secretaries Henry Rotich (Treasury), Aden Mohammed (Industrialisation) and Mwangi Kiunjuri (Agriculture) have given conflicting information on how the sugar found its way into the country and its suitability for use. The imports also threaten the stability of the already ailing sugar sector in Western Kenya. Obanyi said the government should have impounded all the sugar whose origin was suspect, to protect Kenyans. He demanded that those behind the imports are arrested and prosecuted for endangering lives of Kenyans. “This is not a joke. It is about the lives of people and we want to see action by the government against those who care little about lives of others for personal gains,” he said. Obanyi asked Christians to stand up against corruption. He said the sugar saga should not be used to divert attention from the corruption in government. The prelate said there was too much talk in the government without results.
