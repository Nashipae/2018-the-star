The four tankers with crude oil, that President Uhuru Kenyatta flagged off at the Ngamia 8 site in Turkana County, have reached Mombasa. They left Lokichar on June 3 for a three-day journey of 1,000 kilometers to the plant of Kenya Petroleum Refineries Limited (KRPL) in Changamwe. The trucks with two small Kenyan flags and police escort arrived at about 3pm on Wednesday. Explorer Tullow Oil said 2,000 barrels will be produced from the fields daily. Seven thousand are in tanks in Turkana. The oil will be stored at the Changanwe refinery ahead of exportation early next year. Government officials, media and other stakeholders will officially receive the tankers on Thursday. Among them will be Petroleum and Mining Engineer Chief Administrative Secretary John Mosonik, Tullow Oil Managing Director Martin Mbogo, KRPL Acting CEO Charles Nguyai and Kenya Pipeline Company CEO Joe Sang. While flagging off the tankers, Uhuru noted that Kenya made history by becoming one of Africa's resourceful nations. He cited the discovery of oil and gas in Uganda and Tanzania and exploration in Ethiopia and DRC. Kenya is using the Early Oil Pilot Scheme, which will soon be followed by the Full Field Development phase, to establish itself as a crude oil exporter in the region and provide valuable information for future exploration and development. The President said: "This flag-off and the anticipated implementation of the EOP Scheme marks the beginning of a long and fruitful journey." The revenue-sharing agreement states that the public will get 75 percent through the national government, Turkana 20 percent and the local community five percent.
