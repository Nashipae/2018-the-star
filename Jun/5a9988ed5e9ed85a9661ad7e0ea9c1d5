Gabriel Andika has joined Kakamega Homeboyz from AFC Leopards. Homeboyz announced the acquisition of Andika, who has found playing time hard to come by since Rodolfo Zapata took over from Dennis Kitambi at The Den, with the Argentine preferring Ezekiel Owade and Jairus Adira. “We are delighted to announce that the club has agreed on personal terms with Ingwe goalkeeper Gabriel Andika,” Homeboyz said in a statement. Andika is yet to put pen to paper, though Homeboyz remains hopeful that the deal will finalize in the coming days. “Hopefully, we shall finalize the deal very soon.” Andika, who joined AFC Leopards now moves to a Homeboyz side still recovering from a shock 6-1 defeat at the hands of Nakumatt on Sunday Elsewhere, Thika United and Sofapaka home matches against Ulinzi Stars have been moved to Kinoru Stadium in Meru. Thika United was scheduled to host Ulinzi Stars at Thika Sub County Stadium on Sunday, but has since moved the match to Meru. Sofapaka also moved their home game against the soldiers, that was initially scheduled for July 5 at Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos to Meru. “It is okay. I hear the Meru pitch is great, just like we like it so it will be a good experience playing two matches there,” Ulinzi Stars coach Dunstan Nyaudo said about the venue change on the club’s official website. Ulinzi Stars drew 0-0 with Thika at Afraha Stadium then went on a four-match winning run that was stopped by Sofapaka in a 2-1 defeat at Afraha Stadium.
