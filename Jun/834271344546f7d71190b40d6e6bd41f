The newly appointed KPA managing director Daniel Manduku assumed office a day after Catherine Mturi-Wairi was sent on compulsory leave. He reported to office on Thursday after the Kenya Ports Authority Board announced a change at the helm of the organisation. Manduku will serve in an acting capacity for two months pending the Board’s further direction. Read: Mturi’s tenure at KPA was doomed from start Transport Principal Secretary Paul M. Maringa says the new MD has been properly briefed on his assignment. "We have given the new MD a clear command structure of all agencies working at the Port," he said. "We expect collaboration from all the agencies involved in driving efficient services at the facility," Maringa said. The PS added that key performance indicators (KPIs) are set to ensure smooth evacuation of cargo by both the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) and trucks. "We are starting operating the sixth train in June and by December, we will have the 12th train," he said. He said based on KPA’s key performance indicators, the board will sign a performance contract with the managing director. Manduku, in turn, will sign the contracted with the General Managers and other managerial staff. The PS said containers which will not fit the SGR capacity must be released to Container Freight Stations (CFSs) immediately. The Port of Mombasa receives at least 1,900 containers daily, the same hauled by five freight cargo trains ferrying 540 boxes to Nairobi. "In the next seven days, we will have a fully integrated system. In addition, we are opening up a portal at KPA that will allow all players to interface," the PS added. Maringa further said the gates at the Port will be automated to eliminate the current practice of stamping forms. "The automation will enable information to be available at the click of a button," he added.
