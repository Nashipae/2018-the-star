Students joining technical institutions in need of school fees will from July 1 pay Sh56,420 annually, education principal secretary Kevit Desai has said. The directive which was sent to all principals of technical institutions is aimed at increasing access and and equity in these schools. Desai said that Sh30,000 will be disbursed directly to the institution as capitation by the Ministry. The remaining amount, Sh26, 420 will be paid by the student's parents or HELB if the student is eligible for the loan. Students who have already cleared their fees, or are being sponsored by NYS, AFDB, county governments and any other sponsor will not benefit from funds. "Principals of all public TVET institutions should ensure that all new and continuing students who have challenges in paying their fees are registered on the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service portal and a copy to the ministry for information and record keeping." Desai said. The service will then forward the lists of registered trainees of individual institutions to the ministry which will used in disbursing the funds.
