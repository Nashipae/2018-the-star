Nyambare trading centre's drainage system has been rehabilitated. Lari Kirenga MCA Joseph Karichu on Friday said residents have always faced the risk of contracting diseases from stagnated water. “Poor planning of a town results in stagnating water since its drainage ends up being blocked. We had to talk, to hold meetings, plan with county planners and we came to unblock and in fact to improve what was there,” he said. Karichu praised Kiambu Governor William Kabogo for visiting the area to inspect the rehabilitation. “Cleaning them would be simple. Initially, they were just dug, leaving water to flow on them. These are now cemented and culverts have been fitted, making them easy to clean. Water will also flow freely,” he said.
