Legendary Tanzanian singer Sam Wa Ukweli is dead. The musician, famous for the song Sina Raha, succumbed to death on Thursday night after suddenly falling sick. At the time of his sudden sickness, the singer was in studio, about to release a single. His producer Steve was with him, but Sam died on the way to hospital. His body was taken to Mwananyamala. Steve said the singer died of HIV-Aids, but the artiste believed he had been bewitched. "I was with him in studio. He came and told me he was sick. He said he was ailing from HIV-Aids but didn't believe it was the actual disease. He said he had been bewitched, it wasn't normal. “Sababu ninayosema nimerogezewa ukimwi ni kwa sababu dawa za hospitali hazifanyi kazi. Akasema nataka niandike nyimbo za kinachoniuma. Nyimbo inahusiana na Ulimwengu. “Alianza kusikia tumbo ikiuma. Usiku akataka kuenda chooni lakini nguvu hana, sisi ikabidi tumpeleke chooni. Naomba mnifunge Pampers. Akasema anasikia kama anashindwa kuhema. Tukampeleka clinic.Alifariki saa sita hivi,” he said. Celebrities including Diamond Platnumz have sent their condolences. “Mbele yako nyuma yetu Sam. InshaAllah Mwenyez Mungu ailaze Roho yako na za wote walotutangulia Mahala pema peponi Amin," Diamond wrote.
