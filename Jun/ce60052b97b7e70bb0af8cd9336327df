â€‹The new Kenya Ports Authority managing director Daniel Manduku has responded to critics questioning his qualifications. Manduku was the National Construction Authority CEO before replacing Catherine Muturi-Wairi, who was sent on compulsory leave late last month. “Coming from another sector, I have no personal interest. I’m not a clearing agent, I don’t own a ship, neither do I have relatives working here. So, I’m coming with a mindset that is neutral and objective,” Manduku said on Monday during an interview with KTN. Manduku will serve in an acting capacity for two months pending the Board’s further direction. However, some politicians at the Coast who don’t want him at the helm have cast aspersions. They claim during his tenure at the NCA, there was “unprecedented” collapse of buildings in Nairobi. “My question is, if he could not manage the NCA, will he succeed in handling KPA? My advice is, let the MD be selected from within,” Jubilee Mombasa secretary general Ali Mwatsahu said on Monday. But Mandaku, who topped the interviews for the MD slot in 2016, said he is highly qualified to lead KPA. Coast politicians have said the replacement of Mturi-Wairi with a non-native made them non-committal to the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition Leader Raila Odinga. Manduku, however said, just like any other Kenyan, he should not be discriminated against for seeking employment. “If one calls me an outsider, sooner he will realise I’m a local like anyone else. I have a home here and my family is moving in next week,” he said. The MD said his focus is to make KPA “efficient and effective”. Mturi-Wairi was send on compulsory leave over what the board termed as lack of effective leadership and non-responsive work culture. The suspension followed the collapse of Kenya Revenue Authority clearing system resulting in congestion. In addition, the board cited consistent failure to implement resolutions and the absence of explicit performance targets, and the failure to implement them. Manduku said business will be enhanced and best practice in terms of competitiveness achieved. “We’ve had meetings running into the night for the last couple of days. The next meeting is with shippers, shipping lines and CFS owners. We are trying to ensure everything is done as a team,” he said. Manduku said his office has been moved from headquarters to the container terminal where “the real action is”. He said this will make him accountable for production. “I can actually witness the numbers myself. I have seen positive commitment from the staff, who have realised they have an MD who is a team player and recognises individuals’ abilities,” he said. Click here for the latest political news
