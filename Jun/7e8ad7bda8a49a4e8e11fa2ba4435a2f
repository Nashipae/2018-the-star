An international fashion chain, LC Waikiki, has opened its first store at the Kenya coast. This is the third store of the brand since getting into Kenyan market in February 2017. LC Waikiki Area Manager Kremena Pencheva told journalists that they have invested around USD1 million (Sh100 million) in each of its stores in Kenya. Last year February, the Turkish retailer opened its first sub-Saharan Africa store at the Two Rivers Mall and the second one came in October at the Hub Mall in Karen. Speaking during the launch of the third store at City Mall in Nyali, an upmarket residential area at the port city of Mombasa, Pencheva said Kenyan market has been favourable for them. “This is our third store and three more are coming up. We have invested about USD 1 million in each store and we are so glad that we have positive response,” said Pencheva. LC Waikiki is one of the fastest-growing retailers in Europe with a turnover of USD 3 billion. They have more than 850 stores in 38 countries of the world. “We shall now be moving to South Africa and Ghana,” said Pencheva. According to the Area Manager, they have over 150 staff, all Kenyans, for their three shops in the country, which signifies that they have been able to provide employment for the youth. The next coming three shops will also provide employment opportunities for Kenyans, she said. She said they settled on Kenya due to its stable economy, low market saturation, a fast-growing retail oriented middle class and rapid urbanization. LC Waikiki begun recruiting staff for the Mombasa branch August last year, when they announced the search for a store manager to be based in Mombasa. According to LC Waikiki, they are targeting 1,500 stores in Africa by the end of 2023.
