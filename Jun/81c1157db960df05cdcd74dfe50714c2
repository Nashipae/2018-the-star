The disconnect between the county and the national governments when implementing the Nyeri County Alcoholic Drinks Control and Management Act has frustrated the war on illicit liquor. Karatina magistrate Florence Macharia accused the county government of irregularly issuing bar licences, making it difficult to sentence those violating the law. She spoke on Thursday during the county Court Users Committee launch at the Nyeri law courts. “We see many bars next to learning institutions and the Act says no premises should be granted a licence if it is within 300 metres of learning institutions,” Macharia said. "When the owners are taken to court; the court cannot take action against them as they are approved."
