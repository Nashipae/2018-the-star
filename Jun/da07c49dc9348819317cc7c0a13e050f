A man who climbed on a telecommunication mast in Embu and urinated on residents was charged yesterday with attempting to commit suicide and trespass.
Antony Murimi, 23, was accused of attempting to kill himself by jumping from the mast on June 10 in Embu. He faced a second count of trespassing on private land. Murimi pleaded guilty before resident magistrate Jean Ndengâ€™eri. The case will come up next Monday.
