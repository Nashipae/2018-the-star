It is a good time to stock up on shares as the markets rebound after the dividend season in May. According to Central Bank of Kenya weekly Statistical Bulletin, the equity turnover on the Nairobi Security Exchange rose to an 11th week high last week as investors converted dividends while new ones rushed to benefit from better deals. Overall equity prices increased across counters as reflected in the gains in Nairobi All Share Index and the NSE 25 share indices, an aspect that saw equity turnover for the week rise 46.82 per cent to Sh4.23 billion compared to Sh2.88 billion the previous week. "The volume and number of shares traded rose significantly, pushing the equity turnover up by 46.82 percent and shareholders’ wealth by 2.21 percent as measured by market capitalization. The bullish performance indicates profit-taking as companies pay dividends and most stocks are traded ex-dividend,’’ CBK noted. Shareholders wealth grew by almost Sh100 billion as the market capitalisation grew to Sh2.62 trillion up from Sh2.55 trillion a week before. The number of deals for the week rose 16.6 per cent to 6,557 up from 5,623 the previous week. Both NASI and NSE25 grew by 2.21 and 1.77 per cent respectively with the largest counters of NSE20 dropping marginally by 0.1 per cent to settle at 3349.77. Some of the attractive buys are mostly in the banking sector, with the listed lenders offering appetising deals. I&M bank for instance sustained a daily Sh5 growth within the week to push its share to Sh120 on Friday, gaining 9.09 per cent. HF Group and Dimond Trust Bank Kenya gained 1.9 and 1.6 per cent to push shares to Sh8.10 and Sh194 respectively. Cooperative Bank, Equity Bank gained and Barclays Bank also gained marginally by 1.16, 0.51 and 0.42 per cent respectively. National Bank however dropped 8.89 per cent to trade at Sh6.15. All counters in the construction and allied segment blinked green on Friday, indicating increased activities in the country’s construction sector. Athi River Mining, Bamburi Cement and E.A Portland Cement which started the year on a low gained 5.77, 4.82 and 9.09 per cent respectively.
