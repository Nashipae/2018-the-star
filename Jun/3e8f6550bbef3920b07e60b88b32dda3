There was drama along Nairobi-Nakuru highway on Thursday evening when EACC officers arrested three traffic police caught taking bribes from motorists. Two of the officers, who had run into nearby bushes, were eventually apprehended with the help of residents. Hawker John Kiragu narrated how more than 10 EACC officers dashed from their vehicles and cornered the third officer. "The fleeing police officers were arrested a few meters from the scene and bundled into the waiting EACC vehicle," he told reporters. “They were caught redhanded and several Sh100 and Sh50 found in their pockets." Transport along the busy highway was temporarily paralysed as motorists stopped to watch events unfold. The EACC officers said they had been on their way to Nakuru for a sting operation when they caught the traffic police taking bribes near Naivasha town. They recovered Sh2,000 in Sh50 and Sh100 notes before whisking the offenders to the area police station and later to Nairobi. Speaking on phone, EACC spokesperson Yassin Amaro said the three would be arraigned. Amaro said they had received tens of complaints from members of the public about officers manning the roadblock on that section of the highway. “Our officers found these traffic officers openly collecting cash from motorists,” he said. He noted that they will arrest corrupt officers regardless of their ranks until the vice is a thing of the past. Click here for the latest political news
