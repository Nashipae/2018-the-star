Four Kajiado MCAs have told East African Portland Cement to rescind its decision to retrench workers. They are Henry Kimiti (Poka/Kenyewa), Joshua Olowuasa (Kaputiei North), Dickson Nkaloyo (Matapato North) and Francis Kaesha (Oloosirkon). The leaders said the company gets raw materials from their wards. In a joint statement read by Olowuasa, the MCAs said that casual workers from their wards have been ‘targeted’ in the ongoing retrenchment at the company. The Kaputiei North MCA issued the statement in Kitengela town. EAPCC said on Friday it had sent out 120 letters to the targeted workers. But EAPCC CEO Peter ole Nkeri through a spokesman said confirmed the company is targeting to lay off 400 workers by the end of the month through the direction of the board. “What is happening here is that we have a bloated workforce and the company will close shop if we retain the whole lot,” said. He went on; “There are those whose retirement period is about to lapse, those with pending disciplinary cases and a big number serving in the contractual arrangement will have their contracts ended. “The company has seen its cement production halted, cement stocks depleted and staff salaries delayed over the last 8 months,” said the manager. He added that; “Our Company reported a loss of US$9.58 million in the second half of 2017 from a loss of US$2.45million in the same period in 2016. This has forced the MD, Peter ole Nkeri, to act on orders of the board to cut down the number of worker in the company.” But the MCAs insisted that the company has sacked all the casuals from the county, and warned that for EAPCC to continue operating in Kajiado it has to re-employ they have sacked. “We cannot be given a raw deal in this and yet this company benefits immensely from our raw materials. There has to be some civil way of doing business here or they close shop permanently.” Also read: Portland Cement retrenches 320 staff in turnaround plan - sources Click here for the latest political news
