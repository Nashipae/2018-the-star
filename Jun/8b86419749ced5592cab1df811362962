assaulting a county askari. Hussein was accused of causing bodily harm to Mayasa Hassan at Majengo area in Mvita, Mombasa county. She pleaded not guilty to the charges which followed the May 11 incident. Hussein, through her lawyer, requested the court to grant her

all the terms, including attending the court proceedings. Chief magistrate Julius Nange'a released her on Sh100,000
bond with an alternative of Sh50,000 bail. Hussein is alleged to have assaulted Hassan while at her
