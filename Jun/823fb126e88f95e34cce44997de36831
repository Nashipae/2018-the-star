Following a tumultuous 48 hours at Kenya Rugby Union, the Simbas start their World Cup qualifying campaign against Morocco in Casablanca tonight. The Simbas arrived in Casablanca on Thursday following an eight-hour flight and immediately headed to the training ground to sort out jet lag issues. The team held a captain’s-run yesterday afternoon as they put final touches on their preparation for the clash. The Simbas and Morocco have met three times with Kenya winning once on home soil 23-16 in 2007. In the two other meetings in Morocco, the Simbas lost 29-11 in 2009 and 26-3 in 2006. Head coach Ian Snook expects a tough match from the hosts, who played to a creditable 23-23 draw against Zimbabwe in Morocco last weekend in Harare. Snook said: “We saw their match against Zimbabwe last week. They are a physical side with very big forwards and we face a tough battle upfront. We want to play the game at pace and start the game by pinning them in their own half and execute well in attack.” Snook said the conditioning of the team has improved following the 34-16 win over Uganda in the first leg of the Elgon Cup. “I want the boys to play an intense game for 80 minutes. We don’t want to give the Moroccans a chance. We need to see the game until the end,” added Snook. Snook will bank on Patrick Ouko, Coleman Were, Oliver Mangeni, George Nyambu and skipper Davis Chenge in the forwards with a half back pairing of Darwin Mukidza and Samson Onsomu alongside Leo Seje, Edward Anya and Biko Adema in the backs. The hosts will rely on top stars Mehdi Boudjema, Hocine Arabat, Adil Achabar and Bryan Birchet.
