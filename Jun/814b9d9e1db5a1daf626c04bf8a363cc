A voter has moved to court seeking the removal of IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati and the three remaining commissioners. Isaiah Biwott says in his suit that the commission is not properly constituted owing to the exit of three commissioners and the resignation of Dr Roselyn Akombe. "The commission lacks the requisite quorum to conduct or carry any business," Biwott says in court papers. He wants the court to stop the commission from conducting any pending by-elections as well as boundary reviews. Three commissioners resigned from office on grounds that Cebukati has failed to give proper leadership. The three are vice chair Consolata Nkatha, Paul Kurgat, and Margaret Mwachanya, but it remains unclear whether they formally resigned as required by the law.
