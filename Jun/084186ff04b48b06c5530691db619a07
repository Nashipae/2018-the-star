 Maasai Girls Secondary School was closed indefinitely yesterday after parents stormed the institution to condemn an alleged sexual affair between a student and a teacher. More than 100 parents arrived at the school at about 5am to enquire about the relationship. They also demanded to pick their daughters. A crisis meeting held by Narok county director of education Samuel Sankale, principal Rose Oteko and the board of management agreed to indefinitely close the school. All the 1,300 students were asked to go home. “We
have decided to close the school to pave way for investigations after a teacher
tried to force a girl to love him and have sexual intercourse with him,” Sankale told reporters. Oteko said the incident occurred on Monday. The students threatened to desert the school. “We went round the maize plantations and found some girls on their way home. We recalled them to school. Some are still missing and we are looking for them," Oteko said. She said parents were calling to establish their whereabouts of their daughters. Oteko said a former teacher at the school might have
incited the students to walk away. Parent John Partungas said the government to investigate the matter, saying it ought to be taken seriously. “The
other day, it was Moi Girls School in Nairobi a student was raped. It is sad the same incident is being reported here in Narok,” Partungas said. Triza
Nadupoi called for the
arrest of the teacher involved. “It
is scaring that a teacher can keep a student like
his wife,” Nadupoi said. She
claimed the said teachers was facing a similar matter in court. "I wonder why the principal is keeping such a teacher in school," Nadupoi said.
