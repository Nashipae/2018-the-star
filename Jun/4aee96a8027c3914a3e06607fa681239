Police in Baringo are looking for a man accused of defiling a nine-year-old girl. The 24-year-old suspect dropped out of primary school two years ago. He has been accused of terrorising young girls in the village in Baringo North. He allegedly dragged the minor into a forest, defiled her and ran away. The offence was committed last Saturday. Examination at the Kabartonjo Subcounty Hospital were negative but a second test at the Baringo County referral Hospital was positive. Area assistant chief said the suspect had previously been arrested for a similar offence. He was released after families involved requested to settle the matter out of court. "He has repeated the offence. I have notified police in Kipsaraman and they are hunting for him," the administrator said.
