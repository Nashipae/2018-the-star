Bahati has always had love for Tanzanian women. Yes, even after he married the love of his life, Diana Marua. In his recent visit to Tanzania two weeks ago, the Barua Kwa Mama singer told media pundits he would have married a Tanzanian woman, if Diana Marua hadn't caught his eye. "Tanzania ni kama nyumbani kwangu, hata nafikiri nitafute shamba nijenge. Ningekua sijaoa ningetafuta mke kutoka Tanzania." In the past, he confessed his love for actress Elizabeth Micheal. “Nikawezampata Lulu Elizabeth Michael ni kama nitakua nimetulia kabisa," he said. Bahati was in the 255 shooting a video to a collaboration with WCB's Mbosso. While at it, he fell out with another Tanzanian star, Aslay, after they released a collabo together. He described Aslay's management as unprofessional.
