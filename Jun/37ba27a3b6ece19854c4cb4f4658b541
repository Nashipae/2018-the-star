Land surveyors and valuers have been deployed to sites along the SGR's Nairobi-Naivasha route to fast track the land acquisition and compensation process. The professionals will be on ground for the next two weeks to facilitate awards and final payments to owners with official and proper documentation. Increased land disputes by groups and families in Mai Mahiu, Naivasha, had delayed the extension of the Standard Gauge Railway from Nairobi to Olkaria. Sub-county Commissioner Isaac Masinde said a group of farmers and herders wanted to be compensated but did not have legal documents to prove land ownership. This step follows a directive by President Uhuru Kenyatta for the process to be finalised by end of July to pave way for completion and the launch on May 31, 2019. Uhuru recently inspected SGR Phase 2A at the DK2 Project Site andÂ noted key areas for immediate improvement. Top on his list was the land acquisition issue which he stressed should be fast-tracked and all Project Affected Persons (PAPs) compensated within a month. The compensation will enable the contractor, China Road and Bridge Corporation, undertake activities unhindered by the unavailability of land. Uhuru also challenged the contractor to stick to the completion timeline as he expects to board the train next year to Kajiado for Madaraka Day celebrations. The rail will pass through Nairobi, Kajiado, Kiambu, Nakuru, Narok and Naivaisha. Five stations will be built at Ongata Rongai, Ngong, Mai Mahiu, Suswa and Nachu. The 120-km Nairobi - Naivasha SGR stretch, which is 49 percent complete, will cost Sh150 billion.
