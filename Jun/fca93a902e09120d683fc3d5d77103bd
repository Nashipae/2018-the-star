Kisii director of Education William Sugut yesterday warned teachers, especially the men, from sexually abusing students sexually. Sugut singled out an incident where two teachers were found in a "compromising situation with primary school girls" in a lodging in Nyamache subcounty. He said the police are looking for them. “It is saddening teachers, who are supposed to be role models, are showing moral decency by engaging in sex with young girls,” Sugut yesterday told the Star in his office. “We have since suspended them from service. They should understand they are not going to hide forever,” He added. He said such individuals taint the image of the teaching profession by engaging in sexual affairs with minors. The director said such an act should be condemned by all. He said his department will convene a meeting with teachers from the country to discuss the issue and the way forward in curbing such incidences/ “I want to assure parents and guardians serious actions will be taken against the teachers who were involved to an example to the rest,” Suguti said. Kiogoro MCA Samuel Apoko condemned the act and said the two teachers should be jailed. “I wonder why teachers are turning their swords on young girls who are their grandchildren. They should be in jail by now,” Apoko said. A parent John Ondieki said such incidents have instilled fear in them because they no longer have trust in those who should shape the morals of their children.
