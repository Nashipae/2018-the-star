The meeting which was attended by MD Daniel Manduku, chair Joseph Kibwana, discussed partnerships between the new board, management and port stakeholders. The board was also expected to hold it's first meeting separately yesterday. They agreed that the entire region depends on the efficiency and performance of the port and were urged to focus on port efficiency. Manduku urged stakeholders to work together to simplify port operations and processes. "The chair is well conversant with the port matters, having been here before. It is up to all of us to have the port charter as our guiding tool, and its targets are clear and achievable," he added. Kibwana on his part asked the stakeholders to support the new MD. The meeting was attended by the shipping agents, Kenya International Freight and Warehousing Association, Container Freight Stations officials, Kenya Revenue Authority, Kenya Maritime Authority, transit countries, police and other port users.
