The state has increased surveillance after the outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in three Northeastern counties. Four people have died of the disease in Wajir county and four others are hospitalised. Chairman of the Kenya Livestock Marketing Council Dubat Amey said officials are on high alert in Garissa, Wajir and Mandera. He spoke to the press in Garissa town yesterday. “We sounded the alarm after floodwaters started receding. The outbreak in Wajir is a warning that the disease may spread to other counties. Livestock moves across these counties freely in search of pasture,” Amey said. He said farmers are worried. They want the government to act fast to stop the spread of the disease. “I urge President Uhuru Kenyatta to mobilise resources. Governors should provide emergency funds as we do not want a last-minute rush. We are fed up with press statements about the things being done, yet there is nothing happening,” Amey said. Health officials have banned meat and milk consumption, as well as restricting movement of animals in the affected areas.
