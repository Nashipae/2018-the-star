Already eliminated Peru got their first World Cup win in 40 years and their first goal in 36 to deny Australia a chance in the last 16. The Socceroos needed to win to have any chance of progressing but missed every chance that came their way. Andre Carrillo put Peru ahead with an 18th-minute volley before Paolo Guerrero doubled their lead five minutes into the second half with a hooked shot from close range. Meanwhile, already-qualified France played out to an uninspiring goalless draw with Denmark in their final Group C match at Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium, enough to ensure both teams advanced to the knockout stage. It was the first goalless match of the tournament after 36 games, with France coach Didier Deschamps resting several key players including Paul Pogba, Corentin Tolisso and Blaise Matuidi, who are all at risk of suspension. The French rarely threatened against the equally toothless Danes, who were happy to sit back and earn the point that puts them in the next round, as thousands of fans jeered and whistled both teams. France will next face the runner-up of Group D, which includes Croatia, Nigeria, Iceland and Argentina, while Denmark will take on that group’s winner in the round of 16.
