Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori has resigned as ODM deputy national organising secretary. He has held the position since 2014. In a letter dated June 5, Dori quit to have time for his constituents. He however assured the party he remains loyal to leader Raila Odinga, Nicholas Zani, Kwale ODM vice chairman, said. On Monday,  however, the legislator publicly declared his support for DP William Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid. “I have been in opposition for over 20 years but still my constituency benefited from construction of at least 10 roads. A friend in need is a friend in deed. There is no need to waste time but support Ruto, “ he said. This angered some ODM leaders. Zani proposed that there be disciplinary measures within the party to ensure elected leaders don’t take the electorate’s trust for granted. “Voters feel so much insulted by leaders who claim to be loyal to the party but take advantage of the handshake to campaign for Ruto, “ he said.
