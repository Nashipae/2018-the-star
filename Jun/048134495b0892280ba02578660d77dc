Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda through the CDF office has renewed payment of NHIF cover for 320 village elders. The programme was enrolled last year at a cost of Sh1.9 million per year. Ochanda said elders have been going through a lot of difficulties in accessing proper healthcare services hence the reason to put them under the medical cover. The MP was speaking during the renewal exercise at the CDF hall in Bondo town on Sunday. Ochanda said it was unfortunate the elders have been doing great work in enhancing the provision of national government services at the grassroots level but nobody cared about their welfare. He said that they took the move as a way of appreciating the good work that the village elders have been doing. The legislator added that they will pay Sh6,000 for each of the village elders to cater for their whole year subscription. "We also plan to upscale the programme to reach up to about 600 village elders in the next financial year," added Ochanda. Click here for the latest political news
