The lifestyle audit of public servants should be devolved to the counties, two legislators have said. Rongo MP Paul Abuor and his Nyatike counterpart Tom Odege on Sunday should not leave out any officer serving the public. “We embrace the calls by the President. He said he is ready to have a lifestyle audit. We want it replicated in the counties and constituencies,” Abuor said at St Emmaus Catholic Church in Rongo town. “We know of civil servants in the counties who used to walk on foot. Suddenly, they are buying fuel guzzlers and high-rise buildings. We need to have them audited.” He said he will ensure those serving at the constituency level are included. “I can’t just buy a helicopter worth Sh400million without my constituents raising the eyebrow,” Abuor said. Odege said corruption has been devolved to counties. “We know of people in county governments whose salaries do not match their wealthy lifestyles,” he said. Sony Sugar Company chairman Charles Owino said the audit will put pressure on public servants to help end corruption. He said it was unfortunate the calls have rattled some politicians.
