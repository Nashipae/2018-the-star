A court has ordered the Teachers Service Commission to present a list of all retired teachers it has paid in a pension case. Some retirees have said they were paid less than they were entitled. Justice Janet Mulwa told TSC to deliver the documents with names identified for payment. The case will be mentioned on July 24. The suit has led to a blame game between the commission and Director of Pensions on the processing of forms and payments. Director of Pensions Shem Nyakutu was earlier summoned to explain his failure to honour a promise to disburse Sh1.5 billion to teachers who retired from 1997. Nyakutu said his office had discussions with the TSC on how to rollout the payments. But Dominic Kimata, who represented 52,000 retirees, said the payment process has been frustrating.
