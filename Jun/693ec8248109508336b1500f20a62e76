Bahati is currently in Tanzania, where he and WCB's Mbosso are about to drop a collabo. The father-of-two has narrated to Mbosso how he spent millions because of actress Elizabeth Michael, a woman he has had a crush on for a long time. In a past interview, Bahati said he was ready to marry the Tanzanian star. “Nikawezampata Lulu Elizabeth Michael ni kama nitakua nimetulia kabisa…Ni kama mtaacha kusikia niko single tena…Siwezi mind,” he said. The gospel singer wanted to use Elizabeth as his video vixen in the song Maria. He flew all the way to Tanzania to seal the deal with her. To his shock, Bahati was stood up. He spent hours in a Dar es Salaam hotel waiting for the slay queen. He says he lost money because of his 'love' for the actress. "Imagine niko kwa Hotel 8am nimeingia na flight ya asubuhi sana. Meeting inafaa iwe saa tano. Aliniambia saa tano. Saa tano ikafika, saa saba...Simu haipokelewi." Afterwards, Bahati found another Tanzanian star, Jokate Mwegelo (Ali Kiba's ex-girlfriend), whom he used in his video Maria.
