Samburu woman representative Maison Leshomo on Friday caused a stir when she publicly lamented over protocol hitch during the Madaraka Day celebrations at the county. Lamenting over the seating arrangement, she asked Governor Moses Lenolkulal to take his protocol staff for orientation. The ceremony was attended by hundreds of residents, county leaders, and administration officers. "Next time tell them how to arrange seats for leaders, or I can take them through the lesson," she said amid laughter from the crowd. The woman representative noted that seats should be arranged and labelled in a way that she should seat next to the governor. "I am next to the governor so I should sit next to him followed by the senator then other MPs," she said. The county MP also asked the police commander to rein on police officers who have turned into 'tax collectors'. She cited cases of police officers who go round the streets of Maralal town extorting bribes from traders. County commissioner John Korir said the county security committee will investigate the officers in question and take the necessary action. "What the woman rep has said about our OCS is a small issue which we will deal with," he said. Click here for the latest political news
