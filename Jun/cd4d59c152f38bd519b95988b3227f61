An Indonesian woman has been killed and swallowed whole by a 7m (23ft) long python, say local authorities. Though such incidents are incredibly rare, this was the second python death reported in Indonesia in just over a year. Wa Tiba, 54, went missing last Thursday while checking on her vegetable garden on Muna island in Sulawesi province. A huge search was mounted by local people. Her sandals and machete were found a day later - a giant python with a bloated belly was lying about 30m away. "Residents were suspicious the snake swallowed the victim, so they killed it, then carried it out of the garden," local police chief Hamka told news outlet AFP. "The snake's belly was cut open and the body of the victim was found inside." Gruesome footage has been circulating on social media in Indonesia showing the woman's body being recovered intact in front of a large crowd. The python in Sulawesi is believed to have been a reticulated python. They can reach lengths of more than 10m (32ft) and are very powerful. They attack in an ambush, wrapping themselves around their prey and crushing it - squeezing tighter as the victim exhales. Click here for the latest political news
