Russian tourists have arrived in Malindi for a two-week holiday, giving tourism in Kilifi a major boost. The 86 tourists from Moscow first arrived in Nairobi and connected to Malindi in a Tri Star flight. Kilifi Tourism executive Nahida Mohamed and Kenya Hotel Keepers and Caterers Association North Coast chairman Phillip Chai welcomed them. Mohamed said they expect another charter flight from Moscow to land in Nairobi this week. Traditionally, Malindi and Watamu relied heavily on tourists from Italy but the number of Italians has declined significantly in recent years.
