Five people accused of trafficking drugs on a yacht later blown up have a case to answer, a court has ruled. Chief magistrate Julius Nange’a said the five, who were arrested in 2015 at a boat yard in Mnarani, Kilifi, will be placed on the defence. They are Ahmed Said, British tycoon Clement Serge, Mohammed Bakari, Sharrif Mzee and Ahmed Hussein. The five will have to call witnesses to defend themselves against accusations of drug trafficking. They are accused of conveying 2kg of heroin on April 29. The drugs worth Sh6 million was concealed in a traveling bag. They were also charged with smuggling 7.6kg of heroin worth Sh22 million concealed under the water tank of BABY IRIS yacht on April 20 at Kilindini. They denied the charges and three of the accused were released on Sh5 million bond each. Defence counsel Jared Magolo said the accused will be giving a sworn testimony and will not call any witness. But Serge said he had one witness who will testify in his favour. The hearing has been set for July 13. The five accused were arrested while allegedly trying to traffic the heroin on the yacht. The boat was later destroyed in August 2015 by the Kenya Navy following President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive in the fight against drugs. It was the second vessel to be blown up in the fight against drug smuggling through the Coast. In 2014, MV Alnoor was blown up in Uhuru’s presence and other top government officials. The boat was said to belong to Bill Ndechumia who had gone into hiding after the seizure. However, US anti-narcotics traced him where they arrested him before deporting him to Kenya, where he was charged with trafficking heroin. The charges said Ndechumia alongside other persons trafficked the 2kg of heroin worth Sh6 million. He allegedly committed the crime on April 9, 2015 in Kilifi, where the heroin was allegedly concealed in a black suitcase. Ndechumia denied that on April 20, 2015, at Kilindini port in Mombasa county, he trafficked 7.6kg of heroin.
