The Nandi-Kisumu border dispute will be solved amicably, Nandi Governor Stephen Sang has said following talks by leaders from both sides. Sang said this on Tuesday and asked residents to keep the peace and wait patiently for solutions. “We have been neighbours and we will remain so. This is a matter that will be dealt with as per laid down procedures. There is no need for panic or worry," he told the Star. The Governor said the National Land Commission (NLC) was investigating historical land injustices in the region and that its findings would be binding. Nandi County claims that part of its land was hived off years ago and given to Kisumu without adherence to procedures. The areas allegedly hived off include parts of Muhoroni and Kisumu East Constituencies. Nandi leaders say Miwani, Kibos, Kibigori, Kopere, Chemilil, Fort Tenan and Muhoroni towns should be in their county, Read: Historic clashes: Why there is violence on the Kisumu/Nandi border Also see: Sang to push for Nandi-Kisumu border review Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has held talks with leaders from the two counties on ending the dispute.
