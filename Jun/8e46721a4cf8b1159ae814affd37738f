 A Kisumu mob yesterday lynched a man found with the body of a woman stuffed in a suitcase. The body had stab wounds in the neck and thigh and the throat was slit. The murders took place at Car Wash, Manyatta estate. Residents rushed to the man's house when they heard a commotion and found blood oozing from a suitcase. They opened it and found the body inside. The residents raised the alarm and other wananchi cornered the man as he tried to flee. The building's security guard, Michael Odhiambo, said the
man and woman came home at 3am. “The
two were not talking when they arrived. They got into the house and [started playing] loud
music,” he said. Odhiambo had never seen the woman
before. He said the man usually comes and leaves at night. “When I heard the commotion I locked the gate
and alerted police but the suspect attempted to escape through the backdoor
before being cornered by the mob,” Odhiambo said. A source said the
man picked up the woman at a nightclub in Kondele. She said the woman was a commercial sex worker. Kisumu county
police boss John Kamau said
they have launched investigations.
