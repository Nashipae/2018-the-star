A Sh236 million maternity complex at the Nakuru Level 5 Hospital will be opened in August. The facility is aimed at reducing congestion at the existing maternity wing. It will serve five neighbouring counties as well. Medical Superintendent Dr Joseph Mburu said it will have an additional 48 labour wards on top of the existing nine wards. “Nakuru Level 5 Hospital has embarked on a major facelift in response to the increased number of patients seeking services at the facility,” he said. “This will go a long way, considering Nakuru is one of the leading counties in infant mortality rates.” Mburu said the current maternity wing is stretched beyond its capacity, forcing pregnant women to share beds. “Our maternity wing has a total bed capacity of 500 but as we speak, we are talking of 750 mothers occupying the ward and this is something we are working on to correct as soon as possible,” he said. Mburu said between 30 to 40 babies are born at the current facility every day. “...that’s a huge number going by our capacity,” he said. MODEL FACILITY The hospital plans to build four theatres to carry out pregnancy related operations. Moses Migwi, the CEO of Marimo Construction Limited, said 98 per cent of work at the new maternity wing has already been completed. “We started the project 35 months ago and it was to end in August this year but now, we will have it completed by June 30, two months ahead of its scheduled time,” he said. Mwigi urged the national government to give them more chances to carry out similar contracts. “Given a chance, we can do far much more than the Chinese companies. We urge the government to utilise local talent,” he said. Governor Lee Kinyanjui, who inspected the project, said the hospital would be a model referral facility upon completion. “Most of the projects are in completion phase and we are looking forward to their official launch,” he said.
