Nyamira ward representatives on Tuesday rejected budget estimates brought before the assembly. Some members of the Budget Committee disowned the document, saying it had been doctored. County assemblies are have until today to present their budgets to the Exchequer. The budget was to be returned to the assembly for debate yesterday. Magombo Ward MCA Richard Onyinkwa, who is the chairman of the Budget Committee tabled it a week ago. However, leader of majority Denis Kebaso fired the first salvo when he said the document lacked the appendix of pending bills. "I am a member of the committee. I want to disown this document because it does not have copies of computer generated lists of pending bills. That is a condition I gave for me to support the budget estimates in the house," Kebaso said in the floor of the assembly. Itibo ward rep Samuel Nyanchama supported Kebaso. He said Kebaso was a whistleblower. "Having been in the assembly for a second term, I have learnt that whistleblowers should be taken serious. When you see some committee members disowning their colleagues, it raises suspicion. This should not be taken lightly," Nyanchama said. Ekerenyo ward rep Thaddeus Nyabaro said a few members of the committee expunged some items in the budget without consultation. Nominated MCA George Mosiori told speaker Moffat Teya to defer, until the contentious issues are resolved. Onyinkwa defended the document. He said he was not happy with the manner in which some members were fighting scuttle the process. He threatened to expose "some dirty deals" surrounding the contention. Speaker Teya referred the matter to the committee of the house. "Owing to the deadline, we have to pass the budget estimates. It is important that we play our role. I therefore refer the motion to the Committee of the House, and I expect the report to debated tomorrow [Wednesday] afternoon," Teya said.
