Kisumu MCAs have demanded the immediate sacking of Finance executive Nerry Achar for allegedly derailing the budget making process. They accused Achar of sabotaging the process which is to be subjected to public participation. The Finance boss is accused of failing to provide funds to facilitate public participation on budgetmaking at ward level which was scheduled to start on Thursday. Led by Majority leader Kenneth Onyango, the county legislators also accused Achar of failing to honour summons by the assembly. “We have summoned him several times, but he has bluntly refused to obey the House,” Onyango said. The ward representatives said they will not debate and approve any financial document prepared by Achar for lack of respect to members of assembly. “We have unanimously resolved that we have no confidence in Achar and we shall not be obliged as an assembly to honour or transact any business that emanates from the finance departments for as long as he still holds the office,” Onyango said. Addressing the press at the assembly premise on Thursday, the county legislators vowed to impeach the executive member if he is not removed. “We have already started the impeachment process and very soon he will not be in that office,” Budget committee chair Steve Owiti said. The executive was summoned by the House to shed light on the delay of bursary disbursement to the needy students. But Achar denied the allegations saying the MCAs have personal vendetta against him. “I have not disobeyed the summons. Let them show you the summon letters,” he said on the phone.
