Two MPs from Murang’a have supported the government’s push to have corrupt officers prosecuted. Joseph Nduati (Gatanga) and Woman Representative Sabina Chege yesterday said corruption has tainted the image of the Jubilee administration and swift action has to be taken to end the scourge.They warned suspects against politicising the war on graft. “No one steals for his or her community and suspects must carry their own cross,” Nduati said at Gatunyu market in his constituency. Chege said only stiff penalties will deter others from stealing. Looting denies Kenyans vital services, she said.
