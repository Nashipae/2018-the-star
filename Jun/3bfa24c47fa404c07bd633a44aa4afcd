Nigerian singer Davido performed in Dar es Salaam last Saturday before he flew to Nairobi for the exclusive pool party at Kilimani’s B-Club. During his show in Tanzania, he pulled a surprise on fans when he invited Diamond Platnumz on stage to perform together during Tanzania’s 30 Billion Concert in Dar. Diamond was not slated to perform at the concert but the two singers performed their collaborative hit single ‘Number One’ remix to the delight of fans. Speculation has since risen that Diamond’s surprise performance at Davido’s concert had been planned and that he was paid to perform. Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, Diamond said Davido begged him to perform at his show. "Davido alinitext kwenye instagram akiniuliza kama nitakua Tanzania tarehe 16, nikamwambia nitakua na akaniomba nije kuperform kwenye show yake. "I delayed replying the message because I wanted to ask my manager first about it. My manager, Babu Tale, akaniambia ni sawa kwa sababu hatukulei kuwa na matatizo na watu ila uwe rafiki wa watu. "Kama ameomba ukampee surport, nenda. I told Davido not to inform anyone about it. "I confirmed my availability on that same day at 2pm that I was going for his show. Davido begged me to actually go for his show. "I am happy that everything went smooth, but niliondoka punde tumemaliza hiyo nyimbo yetu kwa sababu niliona nikiimba wimbo mwingine ningeharibu show ya watu."
