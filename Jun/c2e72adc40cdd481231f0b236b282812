No funds have been allocated for the Nandi county multimillion-shilling headquarters completion. The project was initiated in 2014 by former Governor Cleophas Lagat. It has already consumed about Sh100 million. It was suspended in 2016-17 for lack of funds. Building experts have warned of dangerous wearing off as many parts are exposed. Others cited poor workmanship ocassioned by separate construction companies. The Nandi budget estimates tabled at the assembly last week allocated Sh165 million for the completion of the ultra-modern county assembly. The 2018-19 budget ignored most of the projects initiated by Lagat. They include the stalled office complex that requires about Sh40 million to complete and the Kipchoge Keino Stadium that requires Sh60 million.
