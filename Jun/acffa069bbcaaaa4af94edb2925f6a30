A group contractors and suppliers in Nandi have opted for dialogue to recover the Sh800 million the county owes them. The group, under the Nandi Federation of Contractors, also voted out chairman Isaac Sang on Sunday, replacing him with Mathew Mutwol. The AGM was held at King Solomon Garden Restaurant. They also withdrew a court case filed at the High Court to compel the county government to pay them. Governor Stephen Sang last week said the county has no money. “We are seeking a middle ground so that contractors and suppliers don’t run into losses,” Mutwol said.
