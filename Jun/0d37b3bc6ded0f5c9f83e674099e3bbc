The swollen River Daua on the Kenya-Ethiopia border has interrupted travel between the two countries. The river, whose source is the Ethiopian highlands, has burst its banks and flooded the Ethiopian side, halting travel by Kenyans to Suftu. Traveller John Ndung’u on Monday told the press that raft owners have hiked their prices. The rafts are used to transport people and goods across the river. “We pay Sh30 when the river is not full but the charges have increased to Sh100. Then when you cross to the Ethiopian side, you pay an additional Sh100 to donkey cart operators to reach Suftu in Ethiopia, because you cannot wade in the water,” he said. Revellers are also facing tough times as they are unable to cross over to Ethiopia to buy their favourite drinks at low cost. The cost of a Tusker beer in Kenya is Sh170, compared to its equivalent Castle Lager in Ethiopia, which goes for Sh100. Many Kenyans visit Suftu for leisure, but the cost of reaching the border town has reduced visitors. Customs officers at the border town are now collecting minimal revenue. Mandera revenue collector Abdullahi Mohammed said they are getting little from the raft operators compared to when the river is not full. In March, flash floods from Ethiopia wreaked havoc on farms along River Daua in Mandera. The floods destroyed crops, water pumps and washed away fertile soil in Mandera, which had been suffering drought for the past two years.
