Two pupils died when a vehicle hit the boda boda on which they were travelling on Monday evening. The rider and another pupil were injured in the accident at Mulot area in Narok county. They were taken to Longisa Referral Hospital in Bomet county. The 5 pm accident occurred near Mulot trading centre on Mulot-Sogoo road. The car hit the boda boda from behind as the rider tried overtaking a lorry and a pick-up. Mulot Assistant County Commissioner Jimmy Karisa said the children were both 10 years old and that they were heading home from Kilusu Primary School. Karisa warned boda boda riders against overloading, saying such incidents can be avoided if they adhere to this and other traffic rules. “The rider had three passengers, which is against traffic rules. More worrying is the fact that most of them have not gone to driving school," he said. The administrator asked motorcycle owners not to hand them to people without licences, and motorists to respect each other. “We need to develop a national road culture where those flouting traffic rules are condemned by all," he said. The bodies were taken to the Longisa hospital mortuary and the wreckage to Mulot police station. Click here for the latest political news
