Muslims begun fasting on May 17, which marked the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadhan, with a call for unity among Kenyans. Ramadhan is the ninth month of the

calendar. Dates of the
start of the month keep moving every year in the lunar calendar, which
explains the varying starting and ending of fasting dates. Read: Muslims asked to be tolerant, peaceful during Ramadhan Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims chairman Yusuf Nzibo on his part wished all Muslims good tidings for the month. "Letâ€™s
