Students of Moi Girls' School in Nairobi have started reporting back amid protests on insecurity. The institution was reopened at 8am on Sunday and all the learners are supposed to have checked in by 4pm. Education CS Amina Mohamed order the one week closure of the school following claims that a student was sexually assaulted. Some parents have threatened not to take their children back without a detailed report on what happened. They have accused the school's management of covering up the matter and asked for copies of the report on the fire that left 10 students dead in September last year. "It is unfair that parents and stakeholders get reports from the media. If you try to inquire your child gets victimised. We are yet to come to terms with the fire incident. The rape allegations will be swept under the carpet," one said.
