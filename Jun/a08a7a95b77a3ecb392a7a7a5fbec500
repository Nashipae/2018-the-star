A family in Mayowe village, Kilifi county, is living in fear after their father was attacked and burnt to death. Six of their houses were also torched. Chivatsi Mzungu, 70, was attacked on Sunday by thugs after the burial of a relative who was also hacked to death. He was killed at 11pm in the presence of family members. According to Jackson Chai, Mzungu’s firstborn, his father was killed after neighbours linked the murder of a relative called Loice Ndaa to his family. “My aunt Loice was hacked to death by unknown people on the night of  May30. During her burial on June 2, one of her sons said she will not be buried until her killers are brought to book. A neighbour confessed to have killed Loice and claimed he had been paid by our family,” Chai said.
