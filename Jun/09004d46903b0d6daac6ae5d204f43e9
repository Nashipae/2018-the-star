Four officers linked to the death of Briton Alexander Monson have been summoned by the court to take a plea to murder charges. Police officers Naftali Chege, Charles Munyiri, Ismael Baraza and John Pamba have been directed to appear before the high court on July 4. Judge Erick Ogola said the four will answer to the charges of murder of Alexander, who died while in police custody in 2012. On Thursday, senior principal magistrate Richard Odenyo implicated the officers to the death. Odenyo said the four suspects should be held responsible for the death of Alexander, the son of a British aristocrat, Nicholas Monson. Odenyo said the officers tried to cover-up their deeds which were however contradictory to their written statements. Earlier today, Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji had directed IPOA to ensure the officers are arrested and prosecuted. "The DPP gave directions after perusing & studying today's ruling by Msa SPM Richard Odenyo recommending that Naftali Chege, John Pamba, Charles Wangombe & Ishamel Baraka be charged with the murder," the DPP's office said in a tweet.
