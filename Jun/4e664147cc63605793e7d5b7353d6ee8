World Under-18 2,000 Steeplechase champion Leonard Bett is now gearing to conquer the world on foreign soil when the U20 championships go down in Tampere, Finland, next month. Bett ruled the shorter version of the age category race in Nairobi last year but he is now bracing for the 3,000m steeplechase race, with a national trials’ challenge next week his immediate headache. The soft-spoken youngster observed that he wants to keep to the country’s global steeplechase dominance when he parades in the July 19-14 championships. “My main aim is to make a smooth progression to the junior ranks before I can think of competing in the senior category,” said Bett. “I have trained well ahead of the trials and I remain hopeful that everything will turn out as planned.” He said his coach, John Kimetto, has been influential in his preparations and expects to handsomely repay this faith with an U20 world title. “Coach Kimetto has worked really hard to make sure I am in a great shape ahead of the trials and even though I’m sure it will not be easy, I’m confident of making the team to Tampere,” he added. Meanwhile, Athletics Kenya (AK) Youth Committee secretary Barnaba Kitilit expects a huge turnout for the trials as the catchment pool is wider than that of U18. “Most of the runners who were at the WU18 are expected to show up at Kasarani, alongside their younger counterparts as we seek to raise a formidable team,” said Kitilit. Athletes born between 1999 and 2002 are eligible for competition and Kitilit observed that they will be conducting thorough verifications on Sunday at Riadha House. “We will only be entering athletes from the various affiliate regions, Kenya Secondary School Sports Association and Kenya Primary Schools Sports Association,” he revealed, adding that all the runners must carry their original birth certificates for the verification exercise. Runners will compete in all the track and field events save for pole vault (boys and girls) and 10,000m (girls).
