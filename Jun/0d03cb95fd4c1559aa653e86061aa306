He thanked the Nasa principal in his short statement. Kalonzo said: “It was great. We feel blessed that we got the chance to spend time with His Eminence the Archbishop. He was a crusader of justice in this country. "I am so grateful, particularly that the Catholic Church is taking this great care of the Archbishop in his retirement. He looks amazingly happy and healthy. This is great." Retired Archbishop Sulumeti joined the politicians later.
