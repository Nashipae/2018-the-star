Singer Diamond Platnumz is grateful to be alive. He was involved in a minor accident on his way to his hotel room on Saturday night after performing in Oakland, California. The Utanipenda singer was with his 'brother' Rommy Jones and two other men when the incident happened. The man in the co-driver's seat was snapping, and before he had finished taking the video, the car crashed. Diamond took to social media to thank God for another chance. "Dah!!! Was almost dead last night!... But god gave me another chance to breathe and continue inpiring and creating more future for my fellow youth!!!"
