The high rate of cancer cases in Meru could have been caused by illicit, contraband and counterfeit goods, Meru Deputy Governor Titus Ntuchiu has said. He said cartels have no room in Meru and all entrepreneurs, traders and investors need to be vetted before they are licenced to operate. “So, Meru leads in cancer because our people are fed with bad, expired and illegal products? We won’t allow such cartels to continue killing our people,” Ntuchiu said. Ntuchiu spoke when he launched Milk Cooling Plant at the Katheri Dairy Farmers Cooperative Society in Imnti Central. He urged police to ensure all those involved in the contraband sugar seized in the county are prosecuted. “We won’t allow licensing of traders or investors operating illegal businesses, at all costs,” he said.
