A lobby has criticised the government for not implementing policies to ensure pregnant students and adolescent mothers get educated. Research by Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Forum for Africa Women Educationalists (FEWA) shows the government has not protected these groups against discrimination. The two organisations conducted a survey and wrote a report on the state of affairs for the 2016-17 period, ahead of the International Day of the African Child that will be marked on June 16. The aim of the research was to determine whether the government has taken steps to help these groups return to school. “It is unfortunate that available policies [to ensure they] learn and live happily have not been implemented,” said FAWE Coordinator Teresa Otieno. “I request the government to quickly implement these laws and sensitise the masses to save them from discrimination.” Related: 378,397 girls pregnant in year, what can we do?
