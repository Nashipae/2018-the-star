The first born son of the late former Baringo South MP Grace Kipchoim has joined the race to replace his mother in the by-election. Shadrack Kiprop, a 30-year-old medic, wants to fight out for the Jubilee Party ticket with Joseph Tarus (lawyer), businessmen Paul Kimaru and Mark Kebenei. Others who have expressed interest in the seat are Dickson Keis (formerly of ministry of education), Charles Kamuren, and activist Amos Ole Mpaka. Also bidding is a 63-year-old retired teacher Edward Tamar who says he is confident his meagre income will not stand in his way to win the seat. The Baringo South seat fell vacant following Grace's death after a battle with colon cancer.

"We shall ensure we support you in any way together with the entire family even in absence of your departed parents," he said in Mochongoi. During her time, the late Kipchoim was known for her fight against insecurity and was hailed for prudent management of CDF funds. The Jubilee party has set August 17 for the party's nominations for the by-election whose date is yet to be set by IEBC. Apart from the Baringo South MP, the party will hold primaries for MCA North Kadem (Migori) and for Bobasi Chache MCA (Kisii).
