Early one recent morning near the Kingfisher picnic spot, we suddenly observed a small bird emerging from the long grass next to the road. It was identified as an African crake, WOW!!! This is a species that is rarely seen in the Nairobi National Park. It is very rewarding to park in a wetland area like a dam and watch and wait a while, you will see many less often seen species in marshy water areas such as Purple Swamphen (aka Purple Gallinule), African jacana, African rail, Painted snipe, African skimmer, etc. The African crake (Crex egregia) is seasonally common in most of its range other than the rainforests and areas that have low annual rainfall. The African crake is a partial migrant, moving away from the equator as soon as the rains provide sufficient grass cover to allow it to breed elsewhere. It feeds on a wide range of invertebrates, along with some small frogs and fish, and plant material, especially grass seeds. It may itself be eaten by large birds of prey; snakes; or mammals, including humans, and can host parasites. When watching birds it is always useful to have a good pair of binoculars, and if possible a good camera and a recommended bird identification book. The park is looking very lush and green at the moment due to the recent rains and many bird species are thriving at the moment. It is always a joy to see birds when driving in the park. God has created such amazing diversity. So remember when we go on into the Nairobi National Park with the attitude of “bird watching”, all too often the larger species like rhino, buffalo, and even lions, just “get in the way!"  The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00 . For more information on the park you can link to the following websites www.kws.org or www.nairobigreenline.org or on Facebook.
