Pastor Andrew Young Muiru, son of Maximum Miracle Centre founder Pius Muiru, is on honeymoon with his wife Edna Wairimu. Last Saturday, Young Muiru walked down the aisle with his longtime girlfriend Edna in a colourful ceremony at Citam, Karen. They were then flown in a helicopter from Wilson to New Rain, the luxurious getaway situated along Kenyatta Road, Juja, for their wedding reception. The couple later flew to Mombasa, where they’re currently enjoying their honeymoon. Young Muiru shared photos on social media captioned: “It’s been work work throughout the years but now I thank God for deserved rest before embarking on the great assignment with my beloved wife.”
