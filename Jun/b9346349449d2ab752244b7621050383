Nyali MP Mohammed Ali has denied publishing defamatory or false information about Kirinyanga Governor Anne Waiguru. Ali responded on Friday to Waiguru's threat to sue him for allegedly linking her to the new Sh9 billion NYS scandal.

They gave inserts of the report in their response to Waiguru's threat and said their client had called for its implementation. "Our client is an MP duty-bound under article 95 of the Constitution to exercise oversight over state organs and resolve issues of great public concern," the lawyers also noted in their statement. They added that he did not make conclusions on the culpability of those he mentioned in the statement he issued on June 19. "The statement referred to is privileged and is accordingly immune from legal proceedings under applicable laws," the advocates stated. Waiguru said the MP’s statement lacked basis as he did not establish facts. She demanded a written, unconditional and unreserved apology as well as an immediate admission of liability that would be followed by the question of damages.
