Boda boda operators in Tigania, Meru, have urged the national government to investigate businesses selling motorcycles to ascertain whether some collude with criminal gangs in theft and killings. The operators said cartels in the sector may be behind the increasing theft of motorcycles in the county. “We want thorough investigations and an audit detailing sale of motorcycles. Most of the motorcycles being stolen are those bought recently,” a boda boda operator said. Four riders have been killed and their motorbikes stolen in Mikinduri in four months. Area police boss Samuel Kosgey said they have arrested one suspect in relation to the killing of rider Ibrahim Tharamba. On May 5, angry residents burnt to ashes a house belonging to a suspected gang leader after he was arrested by police officers. A car that was in the compound was torched and other property destroyed. The suspect, Stephen Mugambi, was arrested in the presence of Tigania East MP Gichunge Kabeabea. Tigania Central deputy county commissioner Patrick Muli has urged residents not to hide criminals and give information that may lead to arrests. He put criminals on notice, telling them to surrender, get saved and start preaching or face the full force of the law. “We need your support by giving us information about criminals. If you hide them, they will turn against you one day,” Muli said. On May 27 boda boda operators held protests over killings of their colleagues. They urged area leaders to set aside funds to help the families of boda boda riders killed by criminals.
