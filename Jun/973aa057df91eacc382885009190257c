Sofapaka sailed to the SportPesa Shield Cup round of 16 with a 3-0 win over minnows Baba Dogo United at Camp Toyoyo. The trio of Umaru Kasumba, Stephen Waruru and Pistone Mutamba lived to their billing as one of the fiercest combination in Kenyan football with a goal each. The match marked a debut for new goalkeeper and former Kenyan international Wycliffe Kasaya who was shipped in from Mathare United to replace regular and skipper Mathias Kigonya, who returned late from Uganda. Donning black armbands in memory of the late former centre half Johnson Bagoole, who passed on last week, Sofapaka showed intentions of clinching their place in the next round as Kasumba missed an open chance seconds into the game. Waruru also came close four minutes later but made amends in the 18th minute with the opening goal. Six minutes later, Kasumba doubled the scores to hand his side more composure as they dominated the remaining minutes of the half. Former Wazito hitman Mutamba netted the third and his second goal for the club in the 52nd minute to put the game beyond reach for the minnows. At Karuturi grounds, Dennis Wafula netted a brace as Vihiga United ran over Vegpro 4-0 to advance. The skipper of the day, Bernard Ochieng broke the deadlock in the opening minutes of the first half before Patrick Okullo made it 2-0 at the stroke of halftime. Wafula bagged the third goal in the 67th minute before converting from the spot in minutes added on to complete his brace. Following the win, Vihiga joined Tusker who edged out Bandari 2-1 in the last 16. Kariobangi Sharks also booked a place with a 4-2 post match penalties win over Wazito while Posta Rangers also registered a 1-0 victory against Kisumu Hot Stars to sail to next round.
