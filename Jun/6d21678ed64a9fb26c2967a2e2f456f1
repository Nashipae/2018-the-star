Bungoma residents have been urged to lynch killers and robbers terrorising them. Deputy Governor Charles Ngome on Saturday said no one should “laugh with lazy people whose work is to reap where they have not sown”. “We don’t have time to waste. A thief is a thief. If he finds you, you are gone. Let’s deal with them on the spot. Lynching them is the best option, they should pay for their sins,” he said during the burial of Robinson Wafula — one of the victims FlySax plan that crashed in the Aberdare Forest. On Monday last week, three residents, including a Form Three student at Sitabicha Bridge, Sirisia, were murdered. They were on their way home after watching a Fifa World Cup match. A Makhonge trader is nursing wounds after he was attacked. A Bilibili farmer was shot dead and his wife raped. Residents accused the security officers of colluding with killers — a claim denied by state officers. Public Service deputy boss Wanyama Musiambo said the government is after three criminals behind killings in Mt Elgon. He said 14 suspects have been arrested. Ngome said residents should deal with insecurity because security agencies take time to respond. “We can’t allow thugs to be roaming our villages and causing fear. Let them pay if caught,” he said.
