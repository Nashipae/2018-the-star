A 34-year-old Uber taxi driver was shot dead by thugs at his Chunga Mali home in Limuru on Tuesday night. Alphaxad Kinyanjui bled to death before arrival at Tigoni Subcounty Hospital. The motive was not immediately clear. His father Naphtaly Boro yesterday said he had a chat with his son, before he left for his house at 8pm. Kinyanjui found four men standing at his gate. He called his father who escorted him armed with sticks. "One of the men shot my son. They ransacked his pockets and took his phone and cash. They took mine too. My son bled as I watched helplessly," he said.
