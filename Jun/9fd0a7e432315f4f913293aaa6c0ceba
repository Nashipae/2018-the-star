The clinic in which a botched breast enlargement operation was performed on a 33-year-old patient who later died has been closed. June Wanza visited Surgeoderm Health Care, located inside a former residential house on Theta Lane in Kilimani, Nairobi, last week. Relatives said the surgeons harvested fat from her lower abdomen and filled her breasts to firm them up. However, they allegedly punctured her intestines in the process. A family member said the intestines leaked waste into her blood stream, causing a life-threatening infection called sepsis. Days after being discharged, Wanza complained of abdominal pains. She was admitted at the Nairobi Hospital Intensive Care Unit, where she died last Thursday. Wanza was married with three children. The Star visited Surgeoderm yesterday and found it locked. A security guard who did not want to be named said it was closed on Wednesday. “They even put a sign on the door indicating they have closed till Monday. Unfortunately, that sign is no longer there,” he said. Leading plastic surgeon Stanley Khainga, who reportedly owns the clinic, did not respond to calls to confirm when they would reopen. Another guard told the Star they had simply closed for the Ramadhan weekend and would open next week. Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board CEO Daniel Yumbya yesterday said Surgeoderm will submit its testimony and surrender Wanza’s medical files next week. The board will form a preliminary inquiry committee to look at its submission and that of Nairobi Hospital before delivering its verdict. Nairobi Hospital submitted its report on Wednesday.
