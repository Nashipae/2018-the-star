Kenya National Chambers of Commerce Embu branch has asked the government to remove the extra taxes small-scale traders are paying after introducing the new presumptive tax. Chairman Samuel Kanyi and director Bernard Kinyua said they appreciate the government wants to collect more revenue to fund development and other services but said traders should not be overburdened. They cited the catering levy, which is imposed on hotel owners, among other taxes that the small traders pay. “It will be unfair for a small hotel owner to pay a catering levy after paying the presumptive tax, as this will be detrimental to his or her business, and may lead to its collapse,” Kinyua said. Kanyi and Kinyua said the government should clarify whether they will need to pay the levies they are currently remitting after the presumptive tax. “After paying the presumptive tax we would not like at the end of the year to be told that we have not filed our returns for other taxes,” said Kanyi They spoke to the Star in Embu Town yesterday. In his budget speech last Thursday, Treasury CS Henry Rotich said informal traders licensed by county governments will from next year start paying a presumptive tax of 15 per cent based on their single business permit charges.
