President Uhuru Kenyatta today will travel to Addis Ababa to discuss security and stability in South Sudan. State House deputy spokesperson Kanze Dena yesterday said the President will join other regional leaders to discuss South Sudan insecurity. “Regional security remains an important factor to national peace and development,” Dena said. Kenya on Monday rejected fresh calls from the United States to seize the properties of South Sudanese leaders. The wealth was allegedly acquired with proceeds from corruption, money laundering and arms sale. Sigal Mandelker was recently in Uganda and Kenya, where he said the two countries must seize assets of the South Sudanese leaders. Mandelker is the US Undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the Treasury Department. Dena said, “In the continued search for peace for our northern neighbour, Kenya will continue to support the Igad-led process on South Sudan.” President Salva Kiir yesterday met rebel leader Riek Machar in Addis Ababa in their first face-to-face engagement in almost two years. The meeting came after intensive shuttle diplomacy by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development under the high-level Revitalisation Forum, which Kenya has been a key player through Foreign Affairs CAS Ababu Namwamba. The meeting was hosted by Prime Minister Abey Ahmed of Ethiopia, who intervened after IGAD hit a snag with the rejection of a power-sharing deal proposal last month. Machar arrived at the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport from South Africa in the morning accompanied by close allies from the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-In the Opposition. There were doubts whether the meeting would go on after President Kiir’s spokesperson on Friday said the South Sudanese government had only pledged to consider Khartoum.
