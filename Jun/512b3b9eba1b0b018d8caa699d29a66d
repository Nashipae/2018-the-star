Kenya will field a women’s seven-a-side team at the 50th anniversary of the Special Olympics scheduled for Chicago, USA between July 21 and 23. The team, the only women’s side from Africa, comprises of 11 members. They are currently training in Taita under the tutelage of Nicholas Kai, a teacher at Konjora Primary School who is well versed with Special Olympics unified sports. “In Africa, we have a hidden population that needs to be included in the community. We are targeting more unified sports activities to curb discrimination and I believe the inclusion of youth is the best way to go,” said Special Olympics Africa president Charles Nyambe at a recent workshop that hosted respective Special Olympics youth leaders and National Directors from Africa in South Africa. In a bid to attain this SOK has made a step to engage the youth as a way of empowering them to lead a dignity-oriented revolution and change social norms besides creating a lifetime of acceptance, appreciation and inclusion for people with disabilities. “By drawing young peoples’ attention to the gifts of people with intellectual disabilities through sports and other activities, misperceptions are broken down, negative attitudes are tackled and their tremendous potential is highlighted,” said SOK national director Susan Masila. “The Special Olympics Global Youth Plan focuses on achieving these and as Kenya we want to work closely with the youth to achieve our goal. We can only tap on the energy, curiosity and openness of the youth to breed true transformation and build a unified generation.”
