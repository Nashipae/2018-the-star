The Vetlab Sports Club will host of the third edition of the Victoria Cup on July 17-25. The event, which pits Kenya against Uganda, will see the two countries fight for top honours. Some of the best players from the two neighboring countries will feature in the event organised by the Kenya Golf Union in partnership with the Uganda Golf Union. This is the third edition of the rotational event, whose inaugural tournament was held in 2016 at Muthaiga with Entebbe staging the second edition last year. Kenyans won on both occasions by beating the Ugandans with a single point and 2016 and two points last year. Whether the Kenyans will continue with the winning streak and lift the trophy for the third time remains to be seen. Newly elected KGU chairman, Lucas Maraga said they are all set to host the four-day tournament. “At KGU, we have a capable team that has been working round the clock to ensure we are well prepared to host the Uganda team. The course at VetLab Sports Club is a perfect venue for the Victoria Cup and we look forward to a great match with our neighbours,” he said. The format of the event, just like in the last two years, will be a combination of foursomes, four-ball better-ball and singles with each country fielding a team of 10 players. KGU are yet to name the players to represent the country at the tournament, which has witnessed some of Kenya’s best golfers notably Alfred Nandwa (turned pro), Samuel Njoroge, John Karichu and Edwin Mudanyi.
