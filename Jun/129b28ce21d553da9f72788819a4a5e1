Judge William Ouko pledged that integrity will guide the Court of Appeal when he was sworn-in as its President on Tuesday. Ouko, who was elected on March 9, officially took over from Kihara Kariuki, who is now the Attorney General. He said: “We have warned those who may be tempted to tempt us that we will make them an example to others by not only exposing them but also by reporting them to anti-corruption agencies."

court's main challenge is the backlog of cases, which currently number 4,349. He also cited a small number of judges. "Judicial work comes with numerous restrictions and pressure," he said, but praised the court for disposing of 138 election-related appeals out of
the 151. Only 13 are set for hearing. On the limited office space area for the court, the new President said land had been identified in Milimani area. Chief Justice David
Maraga, who swore-in Ouko, termed him a well-experienced judge who will bring invaluable contributions, by way of new insights and perspectives, to the
Judiciary. He promised support while acknowledging a shortage of judges, a constrained physical
space and limited use of ICT. Maraga said the
Judiciary should address case delays so cases are concluded accordingly and would help in sustaining and promoting
economic development of Kenya. “The concerns of backlog and delays led me to direct
each court to ensure that all cases older than five years are
concluded by the end of this year,” he noted. The CJ thanked Kariuki for laying a good foundation for the court. Ouko is the second
Court of Appeal President under the 2010 Constitution. Also read: Maraga hails reduced case backlog over six years, decries low funding Click here for the latest political news
