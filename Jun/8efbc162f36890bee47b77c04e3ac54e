A legislator has mooted a proposal for political parties to let people living with disability pick the people to represent them in the county and national assemblies. Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga said the disabled have special interests, which only they understand best. She said most major political parties face a challenge in nominating people with special interests. Wanga said she will approach the ODM leadership and have the party change its rules on nomination of the disabled. "People living with disability should be accorded an opportunity to choose the person they want to represent them in the legislative Houses," she said. Wanga, who is the ODM Homa Bay county chairperson, said the disabled have complained that political parties nominate their friends who do not represent the PWDsâ€™ interests. She said it is high time political parties let PWDs have a hand in choosing the people they want to represent them. "I believe ODM will adopt this new way of identifying suitable persons to represent the PWDs in the legislative Houses," Wanga said. Speaking to journalists in Homa Bay town on Friday, she said she will draft a motion and table it in Parliament for debate. "I call upon my colleagues in the National Assembly to support the motion so that political parties are not accused of imposing leaders on some people," the woman rep added.
