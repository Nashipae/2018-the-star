A political debate has emerged in Lamu after the county was recognised for its financial dicipline. Lamu is one of 18 counties that have been awarded Sh6.3 billion by the Commission for Revenue Allocation for financial discipline. Governor Fahim Twaha has taken credit for the award, despite being in office for less than a year. This has angered supporters of former governor Issa Timamy, who said he maintained financial discipline during his tenure. The feud over who deserves to take credit started on WhatsApp and Facebook. User Mathai Zebed posted on the Lamu County Politcs Facebook page on May 31, congratulating Twaha for his great leadership. He said the governor has portrayed, in less than a year in office, he has great resource management skills. Zebed added that the new administration wiped out corruption and overpriced contracts. However, Timamy’s supporters were offended and told Twaha’s backers to recognise the former governor’s efforts. They said it was during Timamy’s tenure in 2016-17 that money was spent prudently. Nominated MCA Amina Kale, who has served for two terms, congratulated Timamy for his good work and questioned why Twaha’s supporters were claiming credit. “The current regime is yet to begin work,” she said. An information officer from the governor’s office dismissed the debate, saying Twaha deserves the credit because he is the one in office. A former county executive under Timamy said the formula used by the CRA on fiscal discipline checked previous years, when Twaha was yet to take over.
