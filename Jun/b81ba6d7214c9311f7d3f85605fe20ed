Counterfeit goods valued at Sh37 million have been destroyed in Athi River. The goods were destroyed yesterday at the Export Processing Zone Authority on Mombasa Road. The event was witnessed by head of the Anti-counterfeit Agency Elema Halake, deputy head of Public Service Wanyama Musiambo, chairman of parliamentary committee for Trade Kanini Kega and Trade PS Chris Kiptoo. The goods included electronics, mobile phones, electrical gadgets, clothing, detergents, stationery and motor vehicle spare parts. There were beauty products, lubricants, tonus, cartridges, alcoholic beverages and hardware. The leaders declared war on counterfeit products, saying Kenyan consumers must be protected. “We have remained key players in this, dealing with primarily counterfeit goods,” said Halake. He said ACA has nabbed Sh1.7 billion worth of counterfeit goods and made over 840 arrests since the agency was launched. Fake products detroyed so far are worth Sh800 million while the rest are exhibits in ongoing court cases. MP Kega said Parliament is ready to amend laws to give the agency more powers to deal with counterfeiters and those involved in illicit trade. “Enough is enough. Destruction of counterfeit goods worth Sh37 million is a good move but not enough. Tell us what laws to change. We are ready to amend all the laws you want within two weeks as Parliament,” said Kega. Musambo said there are no gaps in law as far as dealing with illicit trade and counterfeits are concerned. “The multi-agency team that I am coordinating is basically an enforcement and operational team. We have the laws and regulations, we do not lack any law in terms of what we are doing,” said Musambo. He said the agency’s first focus was the country’s entry points which are the main centres of illicit trade. The official said government officials who have overstayed in their stations should be re-deployed. “The people involved in this counterfeiting business should stop it immediately,” Musiambo said.
