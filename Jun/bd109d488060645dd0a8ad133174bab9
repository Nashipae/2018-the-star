Families displaced by recent floods as a result of Kindaruma Dam spillage around Garissa have appealed for help. Their houses have been submerged and valuables washed away. The displaced families are camping in Hyuga Girls, Tumaini Primary and Young Muslim schools and college grounds. They criticised the national and county governments for ignoring them. The families at the camps need food and other items like mattresses, mosquito nets, utensils and blankets. Sahara Mohamed, who has 10 children, said, “My house collapsed after the floods and we were forced to come to the school, where I erected a makeshift tent. I spend nights here with my children.” She said when they fled they received a little help from the government but it was soon over as there was no clear way to identify genuine flood victims. Mohamed is among more than 100 IDPs at Hyuga Primary School compound. Since Wednesday last week, victims have been spending nights at the school and college grounds following spillage from the dam. Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter three weeks ago warned those living close to the dam to consider moving. Abshiro Hussein said she has given up on receiving any help from the government. “We have been appealing for help but nothing has been forthcoming. Local politicians only come looking for us during election campaigns. When we have problems, they are nowhere to be seen,” said Hussein, who has nine children. The flood victims have disrupted classes and smooth learning since schools are in session.
