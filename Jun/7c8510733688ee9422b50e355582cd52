Vedick Cheruiyot held off a stiff challenge from Cyrus Rutto to win the men’s 5000m as the Kenya Defence Forces athletics championships ended at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani yesterday. Cheruiyot held off the fast-finishing Rutto to clock 13:46.4 with his challenger a close second in 13:47.2 as Eric Kiptanui, winner of the 10,000m on Wednesday, finished third in 13:47.8. Charles Karanja set the pace early in the cloudy conditions as the athletes went into a single file by the start of the fourth lap. Cheruiyot and Rutto bid their time in the pack with the lead changing hands between Franklin Ngelel and Kiptanui. Cheruiyot surged to the front in the seventh lap with Rutto following closely as the likes of Karanja and Ngelel began to tire. Cheruiyot and Rutto kept tabs on each for the remainder of the race and at the bell, Cheruiyot engaged second gear, increasing the space and opening a gap on Rutto. Rutto tried to close the gap on the home straight and looked on course but Cheruiyot held on to bag victory in an entertaining race. Cheruiyot has now set his sights on being part of the Kenyan team to the African Senior Championships in Nigeria in August with the trials slated in a fortnight at the same venue. “This was a good race. I knew Rutto was very fast so I kicked ahead of him and I was able to hold on and win the race,” said Cheruiyot. Cheruiyot, however, expects competition to be fierce at the trials. “I am relishing the challenge. The race today was a good warm up for me and I will intensify my training ahead of the trials,” added Cheruiyot Former world junior cross country champion Pauline Korkwiang stamped her authority in the women’s 10,000m, clocking 32:06.0 The experienced athlete controlled the race from the halfway point and held on to clinch victory.
