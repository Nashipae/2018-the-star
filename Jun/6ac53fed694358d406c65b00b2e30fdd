Thomas told ITV's Good Morning Britain that he was sad to have missed the ceremony, but also proud of his daughter and grateful to Queen Elizabeth's oldest son Charles for stepping in. "Watching it was difficult for me, because I wasn't there, but at the same time I'm watching my daughter being watched by the entire world. Everybody was watching my daughter. I couldn't have been more proud," he said. "How could I have asked for a better replacement than Charles?... I just wish it had been my hand holding my daughter, not his.
