Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga yesterday launched a Sh30 million facelift of the County Referral Hospital. Key departments are set for refurbishment. Kahiga said the works will be completed in 21 days. The renovations include tiling, replacement of asbestos roofs, repainting, plumbing, fixing electrical works and extension of the customer care and NHIF service desks. The mortuary will also be renovated. “We believe the facelift will create a more patient- friendly environment at the hospital,” Kahiga said. He said they will build a structure for an incinerator to manage waste. “The machine is already in here. We’re just waiting for the completion of the house,” Kahiga said. The governor said the county will construct an outpatient department at Mt Kenya Hospital to decongest the referral facility. A supplies store and a special unit for new-borns will be built at Karatina Hospital. “We have bought equipment that will be distributed to the hospitals to support these developments,” the governor said.
