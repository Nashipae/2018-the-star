Meanwhile, it has now emerged an
excess of over one million tonnes of sugar were imported into the
country last year through the port of Mombasa. According to KRA, Treasury CS Henry Rotich issued a gazette order
exempting sugar and milk powder from paying duty on May 11, 2017. This gave sugar importers
a window period to import sugar duty-free, whereby over 1,060, 630 metric
tonnes of sugar were imported, which is an increase of over 211 per cent
compared to 2016. KRA Southern Region Commissioner
Nicholas Kinoti on Wednesday told the joint Trade and Agriculture Committees of the National
Assembly that in 2016 only 341,444 metric tonnes of sugar were imported. “In 2017, KRA cleared 941,
164 metric tonnes of brown sugar (ready for human consumption) and 119,466
metric tonnes of industrial sugar totaling to 1,060, 630 metric tonnes,” said
Kinoti.
