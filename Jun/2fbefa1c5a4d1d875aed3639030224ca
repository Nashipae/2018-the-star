The South Sudan government has dismissed claims some of its senior officials in Juba are investing illegally acquired wealth in Kenya. The political and military elite in the oil-rich country has been accused of
corruption in a hard-hitting report by US-based NGO The Sentry. Sentry co-founder John Prendergast said that the report has already been presented to Kenyan government officials. The US on Wednesday asked the Kenya to put sanctions on
corrupt South Sudanese officials who have invested in Nairobi. Among the sanctions recommended are freezing accounts of the officials linked to illegal investments, mowing down of networks associated with the officials and visa restrictions among others. The
US believe the sanctions will block money laundering and restore peace and stability in South Sudan. US secretary for terrorism and financial
intelligence Sigal Mandalker said the South Sudan individuals led by President Salva Kiir, rebel leader and former vice president Riek Machar and army generals are using Kenya and Ugandaas a safe havens for proceeds of
conflict in South Sudan. Yesterday, South Sudan through its Kenyan embassy, denied the claims. Deputy ambassador Jimmy Makuach said the allegations were intended to damage the image of South Sudan abroad. "We are in a process of restoring peace in our country and this has been facilitated by the good relationship between South Sudan and Kenya. The claims by US are ill-motivated and do not reflect willingness to end the conflict," Makuach said. The Sentry said South Sudan
leaders have accumulated wealth in form of assets and money
which is not equal to what they earn. Kiir and Machar allegedly own
properties in Kenya. They also own private residencies in Lavington, Nairobi. Makuach said economic cooperation between Kenya and South Sudan allow individuals to freely work and own property in both countries.
