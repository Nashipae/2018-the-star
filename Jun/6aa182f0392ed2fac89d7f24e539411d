The war between matatu operators and boda boda riders in Kisumu escalated on Saturday when about 10 motorcycles were burnt. The retaliation came after a matatu was razed by boda boda operators on Friday. The driver of the vehicle had tried to flee after hitting one of them on Kakamega highway. The Saturday attack took place in Kondele area. Anti-riot police who went to the scene hurled tear gas canisters to disperse the groups but tension remained in parts of Kibuye and Kondele. Motorists who spoke to the Star said they could not risk transporting people to the two areas. "What we have witnessed in Kondele area ... I can't risk going back there ... it doesn't matter how much a customer offers. I can't," one said, adding that some of the operators did not want to see motorcycles in the area. Nelson Odire, chairman of the Kisumu County Boda Boda Riders Cooperative Union, said they tried in vain to talk to the rowdy boda boda riders on Friday. "It's high time we got rid of rowdy people because only a few take actions that affect the entire sector and businesses in the town," Odire said. He urged the matatu and boda boda operators to seek help in resolving disputes. "We want peace so we will ensure this does not happen again," he said, adding some of the riders were arrested. Kisumu Central OCPD Meshack Kiptum said he would issue a statement after his meeting with boda boda riders. Click here for the latest political news
