There's nothing more satisfying than indulging in your favourite comfort food - but you've probably been eating pizza wrong all along. The right way to eat a slice of the Italian dish has been an age-old debate among pizza connoisseurs - do you pull a slice away by the crust and eat it? Or fold it in half? Here, Stefano Cirene - whose restaurant was crowned Australia's Best Pizza in the 2017 Pizza World Championships in Italy - revealed the correct method to eat a traditional Neapolitan pizza - and it may surprise you. To ensure your toppings don't slide off, the owner of Verace Pizzera in Sydney said we should actually tuck into pizza by first folding it into a wallet shape. "Basically you need to pinch the edge of the pizza, the left and right sides should touch - and it must be soft - that is the rule of the pizza Napoletana - it must never be crunchy," he told News Corp. Mr Cirene said folding the pizza is how people eat it in Naples. "It was a street food to be eaten on the go, almost like a sandwich or portafoglio (meaning wallet)," he said. Folding the pizza using this method instead of slicing into perfect segments means the toppings stay in their rightful place, and there's no leaky sauce. So put away your pizza cutter - and your knives and forks - all you need to do is fold the pizza in half once, and then a second time. Then you have the perfect pizza slice a la Naples to go.
