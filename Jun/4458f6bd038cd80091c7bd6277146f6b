A court in Maralal on Thursday sentenced a 30-year-old man to life imprisonment for defiling a 12-year-old boy. Julius Labasha was convicted after he pleaded guilty to the charge before Maralal senior resident magistrate Abraham Gachie. According to the charge sheet, the accused sodomised the boy on March 24, 2018 at Nairimirimor location, Samburu East sub-county. The court further heard that on the material day, the minor was herding his father’s goats while in the company of other children. The court heard that the accused pounced on boy after chasing the other children away. The prosecution informed the court that the accused forced the minor to lie down and sodomised him, turning a deaf ear to the boy's cry for help. He then used leaves to clean himself after finishing the act leaving the minor bleeding profusely. The minor was taken to a health facility in Wamba by his mother where a health officer confirmed that he had been sodomised. Labasha confirmed that the facts read against him by the prosecutor were true. In mitigation, he asked the court to give him a lenient sentence after the prosecutor urged the court to treat him as a first offender. "The act of defiling a minor is grievous in nature, Section 8(1) as read with Section 8(2) provides him imprisonment for life," Gachie ruled. "The accused person is hereby sentenced to imprisonment for life." The accused can appeal the court’s decision in 14 days. Click here for the latest political news
