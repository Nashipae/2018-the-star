Elgeyo Marakwet leaders have asked villagers living on the glades of Kerio Valley to flee the landslide-prone area as the heavy rain intensifies. Fault lines stretching at least 10 kilometres formed along the rocky escarpment last week, triggering panic. Keiyo South MP Daniel Rono urged residents to move to safer areas. Senator Kipchumba Murkomen said there was need for a comprehensive policy on landslides and mudslides. Elgeyo Marakwet is among the counties in Central and Rift Valley that the Met department said will receive heavy rainfall this week.
