Parents and pupils yesterday stormed Nyatike subcounty headquarters to protest against an AP officer they accused of sodomising 13 schoolboys. They also protested against OCPD John Masili and police officers whom they accused of shielding the officer. They said he roams around primary schools near Macalder town. The initially peaceful demonstration turned chaotic when police threw a beehive at the demonstrators to disperse them. Masili fled his office. Business came to a standstill. Subounty commissioner Andrew Mutua was left to address the furious crowd. He said investigations were ongoing. Members of the public said some police officers threatened Nyatike children’s officer Joyce Anyango who was collecting evidence from victims. St Gabriel Primary School headteacher Elizabeth Amollo said she noticed a problem with three boys. “We grew suspicious of the officer who roams around the school and always calls boys aside,” Amollo said. She asked the pupils to write anonymously about their encounters with the man. The accounts were consistent. “He always used his laptop and money to entice the boys, some as young 12 years. We fear the ring involves older boys from nearby secondary schools,” Amollo said. The  victims were taken to Macalder district hospital for treatment and to aid for investigations. Macalder-Kanyarwanda MCA George Duro and his Got Kachola counterpart Willis Okoth called on the National Police Service and Independent Police Oversight Authority to ensure the officer and his colleagues don’t undermine the investigations. “Demonstrations will not end until the officer is brought before a court of law. We will not have a monster among us. Police who threatened the children’s officer and threw bees at pupils should be brought to book,” Duro said. Okoth called for transfer and investigation of all security chiefs for shielding a predator.
