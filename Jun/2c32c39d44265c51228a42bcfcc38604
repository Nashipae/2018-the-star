A doctor is recuperating at Thika Level 5 Hospital after thugs raided his home, shot him and murdered his wife. Dr Kimani Kagimbi, an ENT specialist at Murang’a Level 5 Hospital, was shot four times in the head, chest and arm by the thugs. Earlier, the thugs fatally shot Kagimbi’s nurse wife. The couple was accosted by the assailants as they were entering their Ngoingwa Estate home in Thika at about 1am. Residents said the thugs took off with valuables, but Thika OCPD Willy Simba disputed the claim. Simba said the motive behind the attack is still unknown and police are investigating. “We will leave no stone unturned until we apprehend the culprits and ensure justice takes its course,” he said. Kiambu Health executive Joseph Murega said the four bullets that hit Kimani didn’t touch any vital organ and he is now in a stable condition. Murang’a Governor Mwangi wa Iria visited the doctor and called upon the police to deal with rising insecurity. He said although security agencies have put effort to end burglaries, there is a need crack down on the criminals still at large. “We are saddened by the ordeal that befell our doctor and we are urging our security agencies to ensure that the criminals are apprehended,” Wa Iria said. “We want such cases - which are on the rise in Ngoingwa Estate and other areas - to be curbed,” the governor said. The body of Kimani’s wife was taken to General Kago Funeral Home.
