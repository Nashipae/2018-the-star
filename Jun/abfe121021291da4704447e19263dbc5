The Judiciary has reiterated its commitment in the fight against corruption, Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilku has said. Mwilu on Sunday said as long as there is evidence persons found culpable will be jailed. "We will jail corrupt government officers if there is enough evidence and good prosecution before judges." Mwilu said. She spoke after Church service at St Patricks Catholic Church, Kya-Matheka in Kilungu Sub-county. Mwilu also challenged the office of the Director of Public Prosecution to ensure there is proper investigation and sufficient evidence against suspects to prevent cases been thrown out of court for lack of evidence. She also questioned why judges are keen on taking a long time in delivering ruling on cases. "Most of us were lawyers before we became judges and magistrates and so if there is anyone who can detect delaying tactics, let us know because such an officer should not be part of us." Mwilu said. Mwilu was accompanied by Makueni Deputy Governor Adelina Mwau and Kaiti Mp Joshua Kimilu. Mwau and Kimilu decried the raising cases of defilement in Makueni county. They urged the judiciary to protect young girls against the such inhuman acts. However, Mwilu blamed the society for protecting suspects who need to be apprehended. "The law gives you the power to arrest suspects and hand them to the police, but you play a role in protecting them when you remain silent on matters of rape." she added.
