Kenya sailed to the Euro Africa Group II qualification match following a 3-0 win over Algeria in the final preliminary match of the Davis Cup played at Nairobi Club yesterday. Second seed Sheil Kotecha recovered from a nervous start to send Kenya ahead in the first singles when he floored Nazim Makhlouf 6-4, 6-3 before top seed Ismael Changawa doubled the lead with a 6-3, 6-0 win over Mohammad Hassan in the second. Siblings Ibrahim Kibet and Kelvin Cheruiyot sealed a 3-0 win in the doubles where they dispatched the duo of Youcef Ghezal and Hassan Mohammed 6-2 and 7-5. Kenya finished second in Pool ‘B’ with three points, one shy of the unbeaten Namibia. With the winner and the runners up of either pools assured of a slot in the qualification match, Kenya set a date with Pool ‘A’ winners Benin while Namibia will play Nigeria who finished second in Pool ‘A’ today. History favours the West Africans as they won the 2012 edition 3-0 before extending their dominance in 2016 with a 2-1 win. However, Kenya managed to half the deficit with a 2-1 win last year in Egypt and will be looking to make it 2-2 today besides qualifying for the Euro Africa Group II. Ahead of the must-win encounter head coach Rosemary Owino has expressed confidence with his boys in qualifying to the Group II stage. “It has been a great run in the preliminaries. The boys have performed well and we are really looking forward to the final match. I am confident the boys will rise to the occasion, fight to qualify for the next stage and make Kenya great,” said Owino.
