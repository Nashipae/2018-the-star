Some 2,474 prisoners have petitioned the Power of Mercy Advisory Committee (Pomac) to recommend their release by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The inmates are at facilities across the country. Pomac vice chairperson Janet Kirui said the committee will review all the files and interview the petitioners to obtain required information before making decisions. "The interviews are case by case. We are giving each of them adequate time to give us all the information we need," Kirui said. "After that, we will go through each petition and [approve] if satisfied. By Mashunjaa Day we will have a list of some people." The chair noted that their work is to isolate those who deserve mercy, ascertain transformation and forward a list to the President. Such a person must be positive, harmless to society and ready to reintegrate into his or her community. "Parameters and regulations are clearly spelled out. We stick to them," she said at Kamiti Maximum Security Prison on Friday, during a visit by Pomac. The committee started the visits at Langata Women's Prisons Kirui said they interviewed 10 inmates on Thursday and others on Friday ahead of a visit to another correctional facility. "It is a continuous process because inmates have different timelines. We have to go through the process diligently. That is the determining factor," she said. "Our work is to make sure that we go to all facilities and [treat each applicant fairly]." Click here for the latest political news
