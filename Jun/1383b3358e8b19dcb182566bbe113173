Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu on Sunday said the county is not the place to dump contraband products. She promised to stop cartels out to flood Kitui with products that threaten residents’ health. Ngilu (pictured) on Saturday criticised the discovery of sugar laced with mercury in Kitui. The governor cautioned the residents against buying and consuming such products. “I would rather buy from well-known brands like Mumias and Sony,” Ngilu said at the Holy Family Catholic Church, Kabati, Kitui West subcounty. She attended a funds drive to buy a bus for the Catholic Women’s Association. Ngilu visited a store in Kitui town where the contaminated sugar was impounded by police. She warned shopkeepers against working with unscrupulous dealers risking people’s lives. The governor said the campaign against illegal products will be extended to brews. She said the national government seems to have relaxed measures to stop sale of illicit alcohol. “I would rather have my people take tea without sugar or use our honey instead of poisonous sugar,” Ngilu said. Ngilu said she is committed to deliver her pre-election manifesto on providing water and ensuring food security. She said she will improve healthcare, education and women and youth empowerment.
