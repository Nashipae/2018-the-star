Kenyans will pay Sh3.10 more for kerosene from midnight following an addendum to the June review by the Energy Regulatory Commission. A litre of kerosene will cost Sh87.21 in Nairobi, up from Sh84.10. The pump prices for super petrol and diesel will remain as announced in June. Director General Robert Oimeke gave an explanation in a statement on Saturday. “In the pump prices published on June 15, the ERC did not factor the increase of Sh3.10 per litre in excise duty for Kerosene as proposed under the Finance Bill 2018,” Oimeke said. “As a result, the commission has recalculated the maximum pump prices for kerosene." The rising cost of energy was among key drivers of inflation from the 3.95 percent recorded in May, according to data released on Friday by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS). KNBS said the price of a litre of kerosene rose by 28.78 percent year-on-year to Sh85.05. Poor, rural households were the biggest losers in the June fuel price review when the ERC announced that they would pay Sh5.88 more for kerosene. The costs of super petrol and diesel also went up, by Sh1.64 and Sh4.96 respectively.
