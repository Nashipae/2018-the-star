Muslim for Human Rights organisation (MUHURI) has blamed the manner successive governments have been handling graft cases, claiming it emboldened suspects. Referring to the TJRC report that touches on injustices triggered by fraud, MUHURI said its implementation has remained a pipe-dream. “The President in his 2014 State of the Nation address apologized to Kenyans. He agreed money will be set aside for the implementation of the report. To date, nothing has been done,” executive director Hassan Abdille said. The officials said reports for mega scams from commissions of inquiries are gathering dust. Read: Lifestyle audit first step in detecting corruption Last week President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered a lifestyle audit for senior government officials. Uhuru said he ready to have his wealth scrutinized. This call was supported by NASA chief Raila Odinga who said he is also ready to be audited. However, Deputy President William Ruto’s allies have demanded a review of the first family’s wealth as it was inherited by the President. Despite the approach, MUHURI is concerned that just like other incidents, this new step might be jeopardized and intended purpose lost. “If these processes of fighting corruption are the same, then I don’t think we can support it. But if the President ensures there is an affirmative and implementation will be done, we will support it,” he said. He spoke on Tuesday at Baobab Hotel during the training of newly recruited civic educators. Abdille said the government lack of a follow-up strategy on corruption cases has crippled efforts curb it. The executive director further noted the proceeds of corruption should be diverted to development projects.
