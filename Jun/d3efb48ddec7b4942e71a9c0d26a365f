A woman poisoned her four children before committing suicide in Rongai, Nakuru county, on Thursday. The body of the 28-year-old was found floating in a nearby dam. Three children aged eleven, seven and three months survived as they were rushed to a nearby dispensary and then to a hospital. One aged two died before she was taken for treatment. A neighbour said he immediately alerted others after finding the children unconscious. The woman's mother-in-law said she added rodenticide to juice and then served her children, alongside a loaf of bread. "She attempted to strange the three children after realising the other one had died. She fled following the incident at about 2 am after her husband emerged from a different room." The mother-in-law said the woman had been having an affair with a local herdsmen and that this had angered her husband. She said the couple had been sleeping in separate rooms. “She was known in the village as a troublesome woman. She has been having frequent quarrels with her husband. It's unfortunate that she extended her frustration to her innocent children." Another neighbour said: “It is very unfortunate that the woman killed children who were oblivious to her issues." The survivors were discharged while the bodies were taken to Nakuru county mortuary.
