Kenya will send a 5-a-side hockey teams (girls and boys) to the African Youth Games planned for July 19-28 in Algiers, Algeria. Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) secretary general, Wycliffe Ongori, said training is ongoing at three different centres across the nation. The centres include St. Cecelia Misikhu under the guidance of experienced Telkom player Glennis Namasake; Musingu High School under Michael Malungu and City Park Stadium with KHU chairma Nashon Randiek in charge. Ongori said the three centre are open for any player to undergo training but observed that there will be overall trials at the City Park stadium on June 16, where the squad will be selected. “Generally why we settled on the two schools is because of their massive talent in the region. The training is conducted daily but we intend to have national trials on June 16, where the squad will be picked as they prepare to book slots to Youth Olympics in October in Argentina,” noted Ngori. Two top boys and three girls teams in the African Youth Games will proceed to Olympic Games. Reached for comment, Namasake said the players were improving by the day. “In the initial stages, I have been introducing games rule and so far so good. The players are now aware of what is expected of them and we can only hope for the best going forward,” said Namasake.
