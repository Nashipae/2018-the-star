Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi has warned over impending clash at the Kitui-Tana River border over grazing land. He said the government should prevent violence before lives are lost and property destroyed. The MP yesterday toured volatile areas of Mwangeni, Ngooni and Kathungu. Mulyungi said hundreds of camels have been spotted coming from Tana River. “Bandits who pose as herders come to kill the residents,” he added. Mulyungi urged Interior CS Fred Matiang’i (pictured) and IG Joseph Boinett to take action. Clashes with Somali herders in the past have led to the destruction of 50 homes, the MP said. He called for the setting up of a police post in the area.
