Male teachers and workers at Moi Girls High school have been ordered to undergo DNA tests following claims of rape at the school last Friday. The Star has learnt that detectives are particularly interested in a certain male teacher whose identity they said cannot be revealed at the moment. DNA evidenceÂ is a useful and neutral tool in the search for justice. The guilt or innocence of a person who is investigated for a crime can be determined using DNA tests owing to its vital clues to identifying a perpetrator of a crime. The probe follows claims a Form 2 girl was accosted by a knife-wielding attacker who raped her in a washroom at around 2am.
