A farmers’ lobby has accused governors of aiding gang-like operations in the sugar industry. Kenya Sugarcane Growers Association (KESGA) chairman Ibrahim Juma yesterday asked the Council of Governors to withdraw a court case blocking the gazettement of regulations to guide the industry. “We are asking the council to sit with the national government and agree on the best way out, because their action is hurting farmers,” he said. The CoG is against the national government licensing millers and importing sugar. It argues that agriculture is a devolved function and these operations should be transferred to the county governments. Juma said, “The fight over control of functions between the national and county governments has left the sugar industry like a football match without a referee, where the millers are doing as they wish in disregard of farmers’ welfare.” He said it is sad the government has allowed excessive importation of cheap sugar at a time when the local industry is a mess. Juma said the state allowed over-importation of cheap sugar into the market by 700 tonnes. “We needed only 300 tonnes to stabilise the market demands but the state has allowed importation of more than one million tonnes,” he told the Star on the phone. “This means the cheap sugar will remain in the market for a long time and hurt the sale of the locally manufactured one. This will affect payment to farmers because they have to be paid from the sales.” Juma said imported sugar can sell at Sh30 per kilo, while local sugar is expected to retail for between Sh80 and Sh100. He said the government could be out to cripple the economy of Western counties, which rely heavily on sugarcane farming.
