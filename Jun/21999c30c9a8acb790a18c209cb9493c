The wreckage of the missing FlySax plane has been spotted south west of Aberdare forest two days after it went off radar, Transport PS Paul Maringa has said. The development is likely to ease the frantic search and rescue mission which was put off due to bad weather and poor lighting in the forest. By close of business Tuesday, FlySax, the airline that owns the A 5Y-CAC Cessna Caravan aircraft, said the search team had not sighted the plane. The 12-seater aircraft had 10 people on board - eight passengers and two crew members. It went off the radar minutes after taking off from the Kitale airstrip. Families of those involved in the crash expressed their frustration with the gruelling wait for the outcome of the rescue operations.
