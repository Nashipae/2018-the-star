A Safaricom IT expert was charged on Friday with stealing more than Sh3.7 million from his employer. Dennis Njagi denied the charge before Milimani Principal Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot. The prosecution requested the court to order Njagi's detention for five days at Kilimani police station for police to complete investigations. "Being an IT expert, he is likely to interfere with witnesses and the Safaricom system from outside," the court heard. The magistrate granted the request. Njagi is accused of stealing Sh3,745,000 between June 20 and 24. Click here for the latest political news
