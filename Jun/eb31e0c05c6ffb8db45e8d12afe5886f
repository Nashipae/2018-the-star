 Nairobi lawyer George Kithi now wants the court to bar the Director of Public Prosecutions from charging him in relation to forgery of land documents to secure five loans of Sh449 million from Commercial Bank of Africa. He also sought an order prohibiting the DPP from carrying out any further investigations, intimidating him in relation to matters touching on the legality of titles of several plots in fraud case. In his petition, Kithi said he was instructed by CBA to register security documents including charges and deed of rental assignment over the subject properties in question. “My firm is one of the external lawyers for CBA, that receives instructions from the firm’s legal department to register security documents including charges, mortgages and deed of rental assignment,” reads the court documents. Kithi says on receipt of documents from the bank, his firm conducted due diligence at the Lands registries and an official search was done. “Despite this, it has been reported that the investigations over the matter continued and a report by the DCI recommended prosecution of firms of valuers, advocates and other professionals including me,” Kithi says. The advocate says his imminent investigation and arrest over legality of the land in dispute between interested parties is unreasonable, illegal, and irrational.
