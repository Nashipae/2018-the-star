Kanu suffered a big blow yesterday after it’s key leader in Baringo county Charles Kamuren defected to Jubilee Party. Kamuren, who until today belonged to senator Gideon Moi’s outfit was expected to be Kanu’s candidate for the Baringo South by-election expected in the last elections. He said Jubilee had a national outlook, focused on unity, peace and development of all Kenyans. "I am happy that I am declaring here today that I have ditched Kanu for Jubilee with all my supporters. We have realized that Jubilee Party is committed to peace and stability of all Kenyans including this region,” Kamuren said. He added: “It is impressive that the Deputy President has been more than committed to peaceful coexistence among all communities living along the Kerio Valley.” ODM also suffered the same fate as Kanu when its key leader in Baringo Amos Olempaka ditched the party for Jubilee. Olempaka said it’s only Jubilee Party that had the capacity and commitment to transforming the lives of Kenyans. Addressing the function, Ruto assured all candidates wishing to contest for the Baringo South parliamentary seat left vacant following the death of MP Grace Kipchoim that Jubileehad no preferred candidates for the seat. “It’s the voters who will decide and the peoples’ choice is the God’s choice." Ruto said.
