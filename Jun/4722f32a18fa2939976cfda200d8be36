Singer Fena Gitu, whose long dreadlocks have become her trademark, has said it would take huge sums to convince her cut them down. "I wanna keep them as along as am live and I have promised myself to keep them for twenty years because they are like my crown. Even after the twenty years, I think I will still keep them but If someone was to offer me three hundred million, then I would cut them," she said. Fena has a new jam, titled Ndigithia, which she premiered today on Kiss 100 during the breakfast show with Adelle and Shaffie. Speaking to Word Is, she talked about the new jam, saying it is inspired by real life. "It is about the real life, like do not mess with my life and what I am doing. Respect me and I will respect you, too," she said. Fena also talked about trolls, saying that haters are always there but she does not give them time to interfere with her business. "Like I have sang in my song, Miss me with that, I rarely give haters my time. There is someone who asked me why I am wearing a hat, adding that women should stick to their place. That really bothered me."
