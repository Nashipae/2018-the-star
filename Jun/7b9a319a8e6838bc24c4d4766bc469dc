Judge Onesmus Makau has given the government and activist Okiya Omtatah time to come up with a way forward on the vetting of procurement officers. The judge gave this directive on Monday morning after Solicitor General Ken Ogeto informed the Employment Labour and Relations Court that they were willing to follow the law. The government representatives said they did not intend to violate the Constitution. Omtatah opposed the proposal and said he wanted the matter to proceed to full hearing as scheduled on Wednesday. The judge asked the parties to try to reach an agreement and return to court at 11.30am. He gave them an hour. Makau will set a date for the hearing should the disagreement persist. On June 6, the court temporarily suspended the enforcement of the circular on the fresh vetting of procurement officers following a suit by Omtatah.
