Radio Africa failed in their StarTimes Inter-Media Mini World Cup title defence after falling to national broadcaster KBC in the quarterfinals at Upper Hill School over the weekend. The holders succumbed to a 1-0 defeat in the event that was won by Nation Media Group. The tournament was a partnership between pay TV providers StarTimes and the Sports Journalists Association of Kenya ahead of the Fifa World Cup later this month. Fifteen media teams and hosts StarTimes took part in the tournament. “Journalists have forever been critical of professional players in their match reports and reviews. This tournament gave them a chance to put their skills on display so that they too can be critiqued. We hope to have a wonderful Fifa World Cup where we are broadcast all the matches live on our various platforms,” said StarTimes marketing manager Japheth Akhulia. Meanwhile, Minnows showed experienced giants scant respect while dominating the three-day Busia County secondary school games at Kamuriai Secondary in Malaba North Ward over the weekend. Newco Kamuriai emerged winners after beating Mabunge 1-0 in a nail-biting final with striker Caleb Wasike netting the lone goal in the 48th minute of a final officiated by Fifa referee Agneta Itubo. They beat pre-tournament favorites Mwari 1-0 in the semifinals while Mabunge knocked out John Osogo from Budalang’i 5-4 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in regulation time.
