About 5,040 kilogrammes of suspected contraband sugar (pictured) was impounded yesterday from two stores in Othaya town, Nyeri county. It was the latest raid in a countrywide crackdown on illegal and substandard sugar. Some has tested poisonous for mercury and other substances. Othaya subcounty assistant county commissioner Fredrick Mulei said the sugar raids followed a public outcry. “We raided the supermarket and wholesale store and seized the sugar,” Mulei said. The subcounty security team, public health officials, Kenya Revenue Authority and Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs) officials were involved in the operation. He said Kebs and public health officials will verify whether the sugar is fit for human consumption. Samples of the sugar were taken for testing. “KRA will ascertain if the dealers were tax compliant,” Mulei said. The traders were taken to Othaya police station where they recorded statements. They were ordered to provide documentation to the sugar’s origin. Mulei said the drive will be conducted across the subcounty to ensure no contraband sugar is on sale. “We will comb everywhere. All stations and post commanders have been instructed to conduct raids,” he said. Mulei said the swoop would cover other contraband commodities and products.
