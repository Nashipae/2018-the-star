P-Unit have declared that they are back to reclaim their place in the music industry. This has come with the release of their latest song, Chocha. The trio, comprising Frasha, Bon Eye and Gabu, each took a hiatus of three years to focus on their solo careers as well as learn new ideas in the industry. Gabu says he took time to nurture upcoming talent and establish his label, Kompakt Record. Frasha, who is also a doctor by profession, ventured into politics, while Bon Eye says he has been busy running family business. "Some of us have been taking care of our families and also learning. We are better than we were and we have more content. We did not break up as a group but instead, we decided to take a break from the industry. This has helped each member of P-Unit to grow and also get new ideas that we are now going to instill in our future work," they told Word Is. "It is a good break to be away and learn what is lacking in the industry. The song is to educate people to go back to our morals and stop bragging so much on social media. Besides working together, we have been friends since class five, and even now with families, we are unbreakable friends." Bon-eye said: "We were not in a relationship with each other, so we just took a break from music." As a group, they face different problems, and this could have been the reason they took the break or rather disagreed. "The main challenge a group such as ours face is when one member of the group misbehaves out there, and the whole group carry the whole mess. Also, sometimes some members want to outshine the rest of the members in the group, especially when the money starts coming in." They also had a message to the upcoming artistes. "Please work hard, be responsible and follow your dreams. But don't imitate us. Look for your own cake, don't try to eat what is ours."
