At least 1,279 people have died as a result of road accidents since January. The traffic department yesterday said 1,293 people died in a similar period last year, meaning the deaths have reduced by 14. Of the casualties, 489 were pedestrians and 275 passengers. Another 242 were motorcycle riders with 107 pillion passengers joining the statistics. Twenty-five cyclists also died in road accidents. The commissioner in charge of operations in the traffic department Mary Omari attributed the deaths to reckless driving and speeding. “We are concerned by the number of fatal accidents, most of which are caused by careless drivers,” Omari said. She said 5,104 accidents have been reported since January. Some 1,683 resulted in serious injuries. “The government is spending billions of shillings every year on treating those involved in road accidents. This can be reduced by changing the attitude of road users," she said. Omari spoke in Naivasha during a meeting with boda boda riders. The riders were sensitised on safe use of roads. Omari who was accompanied by National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) officials urged motorists to be disciplined. "It is time they [motorists) stopped driving when drunk, overlapping and speeding. Those three are the biggest contributors to road accidents," Omari said. Traffic chief inspector Boniface Otieno said a majority of boda boda riders killed were youths. He urged the riders to ensure their motorcycles are insured.
