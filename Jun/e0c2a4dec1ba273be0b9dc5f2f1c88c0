Throughout his career, Wyre has been one of the most consistent artistes in the industry. He's probably among the last few pioneers who are still giving the music scene the grit it deserves. His early adoption of the dancehall sound helped him solidify his place as one of Kenya's top hitmakers and he is still counted as a key contributor.  As one half of Necessary Noize, he and Nazizi gave us Bless My Room and Kenyan Girl, Kenyan Boy - two tunes that revolutionised the Kenyan music pop culture. Wyre has gone on to have a very prolific career, releasing an extensive catalogue and working with top reggae-dancehall artistes such as Cecile, Alaine, Peetah and Gramps Morgan.  He knows how to keep his music current and his fan base entertained. A keen scrutiny of what he has offered shows that his drive goes beyond making hits: It's all about passion. He has preserved his personal image and tried to keep it simple over the years.  To that end, he has been on an endless mission to produce dancehall hits destined for the club. It has always been this way: Wyre has been the life of the party, making tunes to keep crowds radiant and contented. It's been long since he revisited his days of introspective, when he released tunes such as Chuki. That's something we would love to see again.  We wouldn't really rank him among the top artists right now, seeing as the game has taken quite a drastic turn. New styles and artists with state-of-the-art drops keep emerging. But the truth is, Wyre certainly acts as a reference point that most upcoming artiste should look up to for inspiration. And, most importantly, Wyre continues to do what he enjoys best.
