Residents of Mwireri in Kaimbaga ward, Ol kalou, on Monday held a protest over the bad status of Mwireri-Ndemi road. They accused Nyandarua county of being insensitive to their problems and taking them for granted after it used clay soil instead of hardcore to fix the road. The residents said the road is in a worse state that it was before the county repaired it. They waved twigs and maize stalks chanting ‘haki yetu’ and blocked the road before planting twigs and maize. Pleas by Gichungo chief Benson Mathenge fell on deaf ears as the residents were unmoved. “We have decided to plant maize because the government has turned the road into a garden. Instead of using the rocks we have here to repair this road, they have brought manure”, Ngugi Gichuhi said Bishop Francis Karara said Governor Kimemia should inspect the roads himself and see how roads are being done to decide whether the money he is paying for the work is justified. Nyandarua executive for roads, Stephen Mbugua declined to comment on the matter, while Kaimbaga MCA, Gabriel Gathure said he is not aware of the state of the road. “I am not aware that mud, instead of hardcore was ferried to the road. You media people find gratification in fighting me but I will overcome”, Gathure told the Star on Monday evening. Click here for the latest political news
