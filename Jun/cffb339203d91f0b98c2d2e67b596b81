The Kirinyaga government will from August start the construction of a Sh1.2 billion sewer system that will be connected to all the major towns. According to majority leader and Kerugoya MCA Kamau Murango, the tendering will be done early next month. Murango toured Kerugoya open air food market on Wednesday with Baragwi MCA and budget committee chairman David Mathenge. Murango said the project has been factored in the 2018-19 budget estimates. Traders have been complaining of dilapidated and blocked toilets and blamed the county for failing to maintain the two toilets at the market.
