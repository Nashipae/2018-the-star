A memorial event to celebrate the lives of lawyer Willie Kimani and two others will be held today (Saturday) at Dandora Community Justice Centre. This is going to be their second anniversary since the human rights lawyer was murdered alongside his client Josephat Mwenda and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri in June 2016. Organised by International Justice Mission, the event will take place from 2 pm to 4 pm at Dandora phase 2 social Hall. Kimani worked at IJM. "Giving victims of extrajudicial killings a voice #Machoziyajana. Two years later we still remember the sacrifice they made in fighting against police impunity and holding the police to account," IJM said via Twitter on Saturday. Since their murder in 2016, 38 witnesses have testified in court and eight more are expected to testify when the case resumes on October 1, 2018. Four police officers and a civilian are in custody after they were charged with their murder. Kimani, Muiruri and Mwenda were abducted while leaving Mavoko Law courts on June 23, 2016. Their bodies were found dumped in Ol Donyo Sabuk river on July 1, 2016.
