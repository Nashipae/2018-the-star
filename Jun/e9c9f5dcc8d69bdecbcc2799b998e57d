Some 1.4 million children are at risk of contracting waterborne diseases following the heavy rains. Some 332,000 people were displaced and 183 killed by floods. A flash flood update by Unicef shows 3,272 schools reported having no access to safe drinking water, exposing children to diseases. The Ministry of Health has warned counties to be on high alert for outbreaks in view of the ongoing rains, flooding and gaps in sanitation. The diseases include cholera, malaria, dengue, chikungunya and Rift Valley Fever. Unicef has recommended enhanced hygiene activities in camps to promote sanitation. The organisation further says a mobile SMS survey showed 6,612 schools reported damages to their teaching and learning materials, affecting learning for more than two million children. It listed Garissa (including Dadaab refugee camp), Tana River, Wajir, Turkana (including Kakuma refugee camp and Kalobeyei settlement), Mandera, Kilifi, Homa Bay, Siaya, Busia, Taita Taveta, Nakuru, Kitui, Narok, Marsabit, and Isiolo as the most affected. This yearâ€™s March-May long rains have been four times above the normal average. The meteorological department has warned rainfall may continue in parts of the country until August as end-May normally marks the end of the long rains.
