Nairobi residents will pay Sh30,000 in legal fees to acquire title deeds, county Lands executive Charles Kerich has said. He told the Star on Friday that the fee goes to law firms processing the titles. “Earlier in the year we said the county government had contracted five law firms to assist in preparing the leases. The fee is for processing of the deeds,” Kerich said. The county only waived survey and rates fees, the executive said. Some MCAs are telling landowners, however, not to pay the legal fee even after meeting Kerich who explained to them about the law firms involved in process. On Wednesday some Eastlands residents stormed City Hall demanding answers about the Sh30,000 fee. They accused county officers and lawyers of colluding to extort them after the President and Governor Mike Sonko said tittles deeds would be free of charge. “It doesn’t matter from which part of Nairobi we come from, we should be given the title deeds for free,” Geoffrey Madiga said. “We cannot afford Sh 30,000 to pay lawyers. We had been told the title deeds are free,” Margret Njoki said. Last month, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Sonko issued 50,000 title deeds in Eastlands. Out of the 50,000 titles, 30,000 were on county property. The rest were for land allocated by the national government to individuals and groups in the 1970s and 1980s.
