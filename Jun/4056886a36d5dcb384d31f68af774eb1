Waiguru said the words used by Ali sought to describe her as a common thief, an embezzler of public funds, and someone who is not fit to hold office. "Our client instructs that the defamatory words are actuated by extreme malice and calculated to cause [her] to be ridiculed and treated with contempt and disclaim," Muigai said.
