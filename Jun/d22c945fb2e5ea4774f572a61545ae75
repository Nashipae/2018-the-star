A Fijian missionary who perished alongside his son in a plane crash two weeks ago was buried at Standard area, Kitale, on Friday. Sakaria Mataka, 56, and his son Paula, 16, were among eight passengers who died when a FlySax aircraft crashed in the Aberdares on June 5. The plane was flying to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport from the Kitale airstrip. Captain Barbra Wangeci and co-pilot Jean Mureithi also perished. Mourners eulogised Mataka as a hardworking servant of God who spread the gospel in Trans Nzoia, Mt Elgon and West Pokot.  His widow, Seraphina, said he was a loving husband whom she treated as a “gift from God”. Seraphina, who was overwhelmed with grief, said their son was a bright boy who was committed and hardworking. In attendance during the funeral service at the Kitale showground were Fijian Ambassador Mosese Tikoitonga, Saboti MP Caleb Amisi and Trans Nzoia Health executive Christine Tanguli. “Their death is a big loss to Fiji because they were great servants of God. The country’s leadership has sent condolences to the family,” Tikoitonga said. Amisi asked the government to hasten investigations into the cause of the accident. “I understand it was an accident but it doesn’t mean that in every plane crash all lives must be lost. I will be directing my questions to the Transport CS to explain to us what caused the crash,” Amisi said.
