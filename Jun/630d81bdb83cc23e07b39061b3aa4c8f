Legendary rugby player Humphrey Kayange has called it a day in his international career in both the 7s and 15s rugby series. Kayange said in an Instagram post on Saturday that he has been trying in vain to get back to the field for the last two years. "My turn to say ..........goodbye. It has been about two years now that I have been trying to get back to the field for Kenya and run out with the brothers one last time." "Guess it wasn't to be. It is time to say goodbye to my international career in both 7s and 15s," he said. He said the "last 12 years have been an unbelievable experience". "I enjoyed and loved every minute of it serving in the national team." "I have been blessed to play the game for more than a decade and to explore my talent and abilities while injury free for the better part of it," the 7s player said. Kayange said his employers KEBS have been supportive through it all having allowed him to go out and explore his talent. "Over 12 years, I have been coached by several guys who've made me better so thank you very much. I will always remember some of those painful sessions but it was all worth it," he said. He thanked his team Mwamba RFC and Kenyans who he said: "have made it all worthwhile and special through the joy and the tears." "The experiences shared will never be forgotten. The critics made us work harder so thanks to each and every one of you," he stated. He also extended his gratitude to the rugby community, including World Rugby, KRU, and Samurai International players. "Now itâ€™s time to focus on the next chapter, I have a few hats on already that have been keeping me busy." "In between my research duties at KEBS, getting my Level 2 coaching accreditation and my Athletes Commission responsibilities at the Olympic Committee, I look forward to many more opportunities where I can give back to the sport that has given me so much. Asante Sana," he said. Click here for the latest political news
