Moi Girls High School, Nairobi, is in the news yet again for all the wrong reasons. Only eight months ago, the school, a national girls school of repute and famous for intellectual rigour, made headlines when a mysterious fire killed 11 young girls in a night blaze. This time, it is a young Form Two student who was raped in the dead of night on Saturday. The rapist, who is still on the run, is believed to have sneaked into the sprawling school. Then as now, the school's administration blocked parents and the public from entering the school, let alone provided a detailed and transparent sequence of events that led to the fire — and now the rape. Moi school chiefs take the view that silence or cover up in a time of crisis is a solution. The administration must take full responsibility for the security and well-being of the girls the moment parents hand them over. The school has a moral and legal obligation to the parents of ensuring the students under under its wing are safe. The Ministry of Education must take this opportunity to send a strong and unequivocal message to all school administrators countrywide that the safety of students is their number one responsibility.
