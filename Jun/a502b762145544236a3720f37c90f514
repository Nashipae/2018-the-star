Kenyans will wait a little longer to be treated by Cuban doctors. Health Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman said on Wednesday that they will be posted to counties after completing a two-week induction at the Kenya School of Government in Nairobi. They will be taken through the country's health system and be told of what to expect. The team of specialists will begin the induction once the second group arrives on Thursday. The expected time of arrival has not been announced. The first 50 specialists landed at 9:57 pm on Tuesday and were received by officials including Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o, Health CAS Rashid Aman and Cuban Ambasador to Kenya Raul Rodri­guez.
