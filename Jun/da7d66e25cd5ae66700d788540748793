Busia county residents have been urged to adopt new agricultural technologies to achieve the Big Four pillar on food security. The four, especially food security and manufacturing, are key to socio-economic development, Kenya Agricultural Livestock Research Organisation director Joyce Maling’a said. “We aim for zero poverty amongst county residents, hence, the need for new technologies like aerial farming used in green houses. It cost the county government Sh 2.9m. It should be embraced by farmers to earn income,” she said. Speaking during the agricultural show at Busia Agricultural Training Centre on Thursday, Maling’a said Kalro and the county are keen on achieving sustainable development. Busia executive for Agriculture Moses Osia said new technology will bring back extinct species like the gooseberry thatare highly nutritious and profitable. Osiah said the county government has given 44,000 assorted seedlings including to farmers since last year. They are targeting 600,000 seedlings. “We are setting up seedlings nurseries in all seven subcounties,” he said. The aim is to supply farmers with seedlings to sustain the upcoming juice factory at Ikapolok in Malaba, the executive said. He said the government has zoned the county for soil testing to determine the best crops and fertilisers. A laboratory has been set up in Alupe to enable easy soil testing.
