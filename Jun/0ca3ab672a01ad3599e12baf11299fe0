The government has warned Kiambu alcohol outlets against selling illicit liquor. Lari deputy county commissioner Aaron Koros (pictured) said some traders ferry chang’aa from Kisii. “Chang’aa from Kisii has been noticed in Kambaa town,” he said on Friday. Koros told chiefs and assistant chiefs to support the crackdown on killer brews. Those found complacent will be sacked, he said. “This is serious. It is not a hide-and-seek game,” Koros said at St Joseph The Worker High School in Kijabe, where he read President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Madaraka Day speech. “We have embarked on serious investigations. We shall arrest, impound the brews and take legal action against the traders.” He was accompanied by deputy police boss Musa Omari, AP commander Gilbert Nyunyi and county government administrator Rose Kimani. Area Maendeleo ya Wanawake chairperson Jedidah Wanyeki urged residents to support the government to rescue young people from alcoholism and drug abuse. “Whenever alcoholism war is mentioned, all women clap because they have felt its negative impact. We need to have beautiful homes and healthy families to achieve progress,” she said. Previously, women from the county have held protests against sale of illicit brews, demanding that traders be punished.
