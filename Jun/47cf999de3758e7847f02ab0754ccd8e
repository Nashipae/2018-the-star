Mlolongo traders are demanding a new market before they are evicted from a road reserve. They said they do not have another source of income other than their businesses. Hawkers, mechanics, food vendors, bar owners, sand traders and boda boda riders said evicting them from the road reserves would kill their trade. The Kenya National Highways Authority has asked county commissioner Matilda Sakwa to ensure the traders obeyed the directive. The agency said the traders are interfering with its operations along the Nairobi-Mombasa highway. Many truckers park beside the road in Mlolongo as they wait for clearance from a weighbridge. “As a mechanic, I earn income from repairing the trucks. I have to be next to the road because that is where the trucks park,” a resident said. The traders spoke during a sensitisation meeting with Kenha officials. Sakwa was present. Mlolongo MCA Daniel Mbevi asked for an alternative place to relocate the traders. Sakwa gave the traders seven days to move out of the area, saying they had encroached on the road reserve. She said the traders had been issued with notice a month ago. It is the responsibility of the county government to find them an alternative market place, Sakwa said.
