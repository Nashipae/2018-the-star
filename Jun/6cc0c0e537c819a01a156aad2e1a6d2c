Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has been advised to slash his Sh34 billion budget by Sh2 billion to make it realistic. MCAs on Wednesday said it would be unrealistic to fund the budget with a deficit of Sh7 billion. The county’s annual revenue collection stands at Sh9 billion, according to finance executive Charles Kerich. They expect to receive another Sh16.5 billion from the National Treasury. Budget and Appropriations committee chairman Robert Mbatia said the executive must balance recurrent expenditure with development estimates. “We’re still negotiating. We feel the executive are not able to immediately fund the budget hence the need to revise the estimates,” Mbati said.

Both the executive and the MCAs agreed there was a huge deficit. “We want to reduce the budget to realistic levels,” committee vice chairman Patrick Karani. The executive had targeted Sh17 billion in revenue collection. MCAs said Sh15 billion was a more realistic target. But City Hall still needs to convince the assembly how it intends to improve collection. Budget reading was pushed from yesterday to Tuesday next week. The MCAs said revenue collection had increased but said more funds were still required to fully implement the budget. “The county has really performed well in terms of revenues especially in the third quarter,” Karani said. The committee said they wanted to know the status of all projects in the previous budget before the next financial year begins. “It is important for us to know how far the implementation of these projects have gone,” Mbatia said.
