Court injunctions have been blamed for hampering the war on betting machines in Naivasha. Members of the Nyumba Kumi initiative want new guidelines on how the crackdown on the machines will be conducted. Member Stanley Ngige said it has been difficult for chiefs to conduct raids on buildings with the machines due to the court orders. Ngige said nearly all owners of the gaming equipment have obtained orders barring chiefs from interfering with the trade. “We are stuck, the machines have had negatives effects on the lives of our young people, but we can do little to seize them, since the owners have found a leeway in courts,” he said. Ngige said nearly all estates have the machines and they have become a haven for criminals and drugs. The elder urged Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to visit the town and give guidelines on how the destruction of the machines should be carried out. Member Purity Wangeci said apart from the machines, they have been able to fight the use of drugs in their respective areas.
