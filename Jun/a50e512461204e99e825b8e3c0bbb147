The Kenya Commercial Bank has moved to court to block KRA from recovering Sh457 million tax arrears. According to the suit papers, KCB says the money is owed to KRA by Chemelil Sugar Company which has an account with the bank. KRA wants the bank to collect money as last year's tax arrears from the miller. The bank did not honour the request because the miller had an outstanding loan which exceeded the amount being requested by KRA. KRA has since written to Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) directing it to collect the tax. CBK informed the bank that it will remit the money to KRA. The bank wants the court to stop the payment. It says it had explained their failure to comply with the request. The reason was allegedly accepted by the chief tax collector in an email. KCB says it is unfair to hold it liable to taxes due from the miller.
