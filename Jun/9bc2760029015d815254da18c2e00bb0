Tension gripped three villages in Suba South on Thursday as a mob torched 17 houses whose owners were accused of witchcraft. The incidents took place in Mwikongo, Kisaku and Kitawa villages in Kisaku sub-location. Homa Bay County Police Commander Marius Tum said at least 200 villagers raided the houses. They burned down two granaries and left a 70-year-old woman injured. “Nambi Oindi got injured as her granary was torched," Tum said, adding she was taken to Camilus Mission Hospital in Migori. Kisaku Assistant Chief Nicholas Otieno said some of the victims were linked to the killing of two men two years ago. “The [attackers] said they had swallowed their anger for too long," he said. Tum said security teams assessed the damage and started investigating. The police boss discouraged the public from resorting to mob justice and told them to help police find suspects. The victims appealed for help in finding other places to live. Click here for the latest political news
