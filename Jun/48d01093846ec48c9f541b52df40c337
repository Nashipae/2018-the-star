Dancehall singer Hopekid is set to walk down the aisle this year. The Huduma hit maker is in a serious relationship and says this is definitely the woman he is tying the knot with. "Yes, I'm dating and I will get married later this year," he said, adding: "Matters of the heart are quite difficult sometimes. My ideal woman is the one my heart will love. I like a woman who understands. I look for somebody who supports by mission." He has also taken shots at singers who run to Tanzania for collabos. “Be wise.
When Tanzanians were invading the Kenyan market, they didn’t need any Kenyan
artiste... We
are playing ourselves. We have everything it takes.”
