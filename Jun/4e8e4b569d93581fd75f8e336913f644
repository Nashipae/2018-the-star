Kisumu MCAs came to blows on Tuesday over claims of a plot to impeach Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o. Trouble started after the Majority leader Kenneth Odhiambo claimed that some MCA had hired youths who accosted him at the county government offices. He said the youths claimed there was a notice of motion prepared in the house to impeach the governor. This sparked outrage among some of the ward representative who moved out of the chambers to discuss the matter. The chat later turned ugly when Kondele MCA Joakim Oketch and his Migosi counterpart Victor Rodgers confronted the lot. This escalated into a push and shove between the two and the MCAs as others joined in an attempt to separate the groups. As this was going on, members of the public who were following the events started hurling stones in the county assembly compound. Police guarding the premises fired shots in the air to disperse the crowd that had gathered near the assembly forcing the speaker to adjourn the sittings. "What I experienced today at Prosperity House - Nyong'o's office, was uncalled for. It is unfortunate that a member from this house would do such a thing," Odhiambo said. The MCA said he does not understand where the allegations of impeaching the governor came from. "The assembly is fully behind the governor. Hiring youths to shout at MCAs is uncouth and uncalled for," he retorted. Others who spoke over the matter condemned the members who they accused of "spreading unnecessary rumours".
