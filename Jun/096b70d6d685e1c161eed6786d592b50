Two street urchins on Saturday tied the knot in a wonderful ceremony in the streets of Nairobi. The two lovers were accompanied by glue-sniffing street children when they marched to Gikomba to celebrate the newly wed. In a short clip that surfaced online, the bride donned a white wedding gown but without make up. She is seen struggling to hold it up due to the dilapidated state of the road. The groom was also clad in a clean suit, white shirt and was well shaven. It is not clear who officiated the wedding and where the couple retreated for their honeymoon. Their wedding comes amid efforts by Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko to flush street families out of the city. Nairobi is one of the towns with the highest number of street families running into thousands. Their presence has been blamed for increase in petty crime and muggings, besides being a nuisance for their begging habits. Efforts by successive government to get rid of the street families through rehabilitation programmes have been futile. Click here for the latest political news
