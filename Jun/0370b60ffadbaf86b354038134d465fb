Siaya Governor Cornell Rasanga will go on a retreat with MCAs to mend fences between the executive and the ward reps. Speaking outside his office yesterday, the governor said rivalry between the two groups has hurt services. Rasanga praised the county assembly for approving his cabinet nominees who had previously been rejected. The MCAs had rejected Rasanga’s preferred list four times, but after meeting him in Mombasa, they approved the nominations. Rasanga said the meeting was fruitful. “As elected leaders, we are meant to work together, not foster personal fights,” he said.
