Kenya Airways flew to Mauritius for the first time on Thursday and introduced four weekly flights to the country as part of its expansion plan. The four-hour flights from Nairobi have been scheduled for Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday, and will be from the JKIA in Nairobi. At the launch, Chief Operating Officer Jan De Vegt noted that their goal is to grow business opportunities between Kenya and Mauritius. "The investment and trade opportunities presented by this direct flight will certainly add value to both countries," he said. “The Nairobi-Mauritius route will also have great impact on our upcoming non-stop flights to New York by reinforcing its attractiveness to the American Premium Leisure travellers." Mauritius is the national carrier's 53 destination overall. De Vegt said KQ already has a code-share agreement with Air Mauritius, under which there will be three weekly flights, bringing to seven the number of daily flights to that country. Mauritius, an island country in the Indian Ocean, is popular for its beaches, lagoons and reefs. It boasts of its waterfalls, rain-forests, hiking trails, wildlife and the Black River Gorges National Park. KQ has also introduced three non-stop flights from the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) to Cape Town, South Africa. The non-stop flights, to the second-most populous urban city in South Africa, will depart Nairobi every Wednesday, Friday and Sunday at 3:30pm. The airline said the launch is in line with its strategy to assert its presence and expand connectivity across Africa and open up opportunities for tourism, trade and investment.
