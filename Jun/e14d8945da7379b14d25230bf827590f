KICC will host over 200 local artists to exhibit and sell their work for free at the premises to support the growing creative art industry in the next one year. The initiative, called ‘KICC Mini-Art Gallery’, will give upcoming artistes an opportunity to showcase their art, meet domestic and international guests, and attend meetings and conferences at the facility. KICC chief executive Nana Gecaga said: “Leveraging on KICC’s foot traffic, comprising domestic and international visitors, we have set aside space in our foyer to support the creative industry by providing an avenue for artists to showcase their talent and promote their art." The management of KICC will also connect artists with interested buyers and use short videos to assist them to market their art online using its social media assets. “We are certain the exposure the artists will get through this programme will go a long way in promoting their work and giving them growth opportunities. We view this initiative as part of KICC’s contribution to spurring job creation, especially among the youth, who make up a big percentage of the creative arts,” Gecaga said. Under the programme, KICC will provide a platform to eight artists (four women and four men) every two weeks to exhibit and sell their work, at no fee. The best illustration depicting KICC by every artist will be displayed on the first floor of the centre and meeting rooms. Through this programme, KICC believes that works by little-known artists will be seen by thousands of visitors to the country’s largest convention centre.
