Since
its 1959 revolution, Cuba’s infant mortality rate has fallen from 37.3 to 4.3
per 1,000 live births — lower than the US’s (5.8). According
to the Commonwealth Fund, from 1970 to 2016, life expectancy increased
from 70.04 to 78.7 years, approaching expectancy in the US at 79.8.  The quality of Cuban healthcare system is not
in doubt, as possibly, as Fidel Castro once said, “condemn me. It does not
matter. History will absolve”, he has been absolved as far as this sector is
concerned. And
Cuban has exported 100 doctors to Kenya for two years. Whereas many, including
myself on this column, have raised some reservations about this, Kenya is not
the first country to seek Cuba’s help. This
is part of global health diplomacy, which Cuba has christened Cuban
medical internationalism. Since the 1959 Cuban Revolution, the
country sends medical personnel overseas, particularly to Latin America, Africa
and other developing countries, and also takes medical students and patients to
Cuba. According to World Affairs, the
initiative began in 1960, when the relatively new revolutionary government sent
medical brigades to Algeria during the civil war with France, and to Chile after
a devastating earthquake. It is around this period that it
realised it would turn out to be a winning strategy for itself as well. A
win-win situation: Cuba could mobilise health workers and send them practically
anywhere, including hardship locations, make them work under unique terms, and
have them stay as long as necessary. This being around the Cold War
period, Havana used this to propagate socialism in their host countries.
Government-to-government cooperation agreements, World Affairs notes, guaranteed
a more permanent and larger foreign presence. According to Havana, from then to
2008, 270,743 Cubans had worked in 154 countries, and its official sources indicate
there are between 38,000-40,000 medics in 68-77 countries, with 17,000 being
doctors. Medical training and instruction also
became part of the deals Cuba brokered primarily with third-world countries
facing a scarcity of doctors and health workers. Currently, Kenya has 2,204 active
medical specialists of the 2,711 that are registered by the doctors’ board. “In view of the World Health
Organization’s recommendation of one doctor per 1,000 population, Kenya has an
absolute deficit of 40,332 doctors. The Cuban specialists are therefore a first
step in bridging the doctor-to-population ratio in our country,” Health CS
Sicily Kariuki said during the signing of the MoU between Kenya and Cuba. However, of concern is the payment of
these doctors. While the MoU does not say how much the specialists will earn,
CS Sicily Kariuki said the MoU puts the medics in Job Group S. This means they
will earn Sh882,000. The Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union
estimates the deal will cost about Sh2 billion annually. A comparative look at
the other countries shows Kenya might be paying way expensive. Typically the
host country pays Cuba a hard-currency sum for each health worker; currently,
for example, it has been reported at Sh500,000 in Angola and Sh278,400 in
Namibia. The host government provides each
medic a furnished housing, domestic transportation, and a monthly stipend
generally betweenSh15,000-Sh50,000 for food and personal expenses. Whereas Cuba’s health diplomacy has
been successful in manu countries, it is imperative to sort out the outstanding
issues to prevent possible resistance from their local counterparts.
