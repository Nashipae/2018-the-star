A brace from Brian Osumba and a goal from Boniface Muchiri inspired Tusker to a 3-0 win over Ulinzi Stars at Ruaraka Stadium. In a match characterised by bizarre officiating and physical might by either sides, Tusker had the last laugh disarming the soldiers who were aiming to move to the second place as well as level points with Sofapaka. The muddy Ruaraka grounds worsened with the light showers prior to match, which favoured the home side in keeping possession unlike the visiting team who hardly managed to string passes. With Ulinzi’s custodian Timothy Odhiambo missing, Danstan Nyaudo recalled James Saruni back to the starting eleven but the shot stopper had a game to forget as he let in easy goals and caused a penalty which was luckily send wide. After raiding Ulinzi’s back for an opener without success in the opening 20 minutes, Osumba showed a rare character as he wittingly escaped the attention of his markers to put the ball into the net with Saruni well beaten. Ulinzi reacted swiftly to the goal through Cliff Kasuti but his shot did not trouble Duncan Ochieng who superbly tipped for a corner. Five minutes later, Kasutu threatened again with a hard drilled shot which flew wide. Sensing the danger posed by the lanky winger, Robert Matano instructed his midfielders to shut the supply to the winger, forcing him retreat to the centre. The match seemed headed for a 1-0 lead for Tusker at halftime until Muchiri reminded the fans of his free kick conversion skills as he curled the ball from the edge to hand his side the second goal with a minute to play. Osumba completed his brace in the 48th minute after being teed by Hashim Sempala. Efforts by Ulinzi to stage a comeback were futile as Matano called on his players to protect the 3-0 lead. Hassan Mohammed was lucky not to have been sent off in the 81st minute for a dangerous foul on Lyod Wahome which ignited a brawl as players from Tusker confronted the soldier while his teammates shielded him.
