Machakos Town MP Victor Munyaka has said Governor Mutua has let down Machakos residents. The Jubilee MP, believed to be a close ally of Mutua, said the Maendeleo Chap Chap party leader might not retain his seat if the county goes back to the ballot following nullification of his election by the Court of Appeal on Friday. “Mutua has failed in his duties as the governor of Machakos. I fear that if the election is repeated, he will not retain that seat,” Munyaka said. Munyaka spoke at a burial ceremony in his constituency on Saturday. He said it will be hard for Mutua to convince the electorate, the majority of whom have lost trust in him for the eight months he has served after his re-election. “Machakos residents are waiting for the decision of the Supreme Court concerning Mutua’s appeal. I believe the governor has appealed against the ruling,” he said. The second term MP said the ruling should serve as a lesson to leaders. They must be ready to work for their people and not appear to be taking their electorates for a ride after being elected. “Mutua behaved in a manner that made most voters lose trust in him,” Munyaka said. Immediately after Mutua was reelected, he would be seen taking development outside Machakos county, while the locals continue suffering and languishing in poverty, the MP said. He said Makueni and Kitui counties are much ahead in development while Machakos continues lagging behind. Nullifying the election of Mutua in the August 2017 vote, Judge William Ouko said the IEBC’s declaration of the governor as the winner was not valid. “The results as declared by the returning officer failed the constitutional test,” he said. The appellate court set aside the judgement by the High court in the petition filed by Wiper’s Wavinya Ndeti.
