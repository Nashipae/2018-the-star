MPs from the Coast yesterday declared their support for Deputy President William Ruto, days after ODM announced it will initiate disciplinary measures against lawmakers who do not toe the party line. In a press conference at Parliament Buildings, 12 MPs from the region said they will work with Ruto. Coast Parliamentary Group, led by Bura’s Ali Wario, did not state whether they will support the DP’s presidential ambitions. “We have no other Deputy President apart from William Ruto and we support him. He should be supported by all. He is our DP and we are willing to work with him,” Wario said.
