About 100 Chinese companies will be scouting for deals with Kenyan traders during the second phase of the China Trade Week exhibition set to take place in Nairobi starting today. The trade fair, which is in its fourth year, seeks to connect distributors, manufacturers, exporters and retailers in Kenya with their counterparts in China. The first phase of the conference which came to a close last week was attended by about 13,000 visitors. “The second phase of China Trade Week expo 2018 will be starting today June 18 all the way to June 20. The show will be open to the public from 9 am to 4 pm featuring exhibitors of agricultural and electrical appliances mainly from China,” said the exhibition’s event organizer Sian Xiao. The China Trade Week was inspired by China’s ambitious development plan dubbed One Belt One Road. It started in 2013 at the United Arabs Emirates and has spread to other countries including Ghana, South Africa, Iran and Morocco. The event was attended by about 450 Chinese companies last year.
