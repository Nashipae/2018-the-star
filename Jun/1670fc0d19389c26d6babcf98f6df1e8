Police are looking for a man who allegedly hacked his 65-year-old father to death over 4kg of beans in Imani village, Kiminini on Tuesday. The suspect, 23, is reported to have killed Stephen Masinde by slashing him several times on the head and face. His sister told journalists that she is the one who had given the beans to her father to sell. "When he saw my father with the beans, he asked him where he was taking them but my father did not reply, that is when he attacked him," she said. She said their mother tried to intervene, but her furious brother slashed their father to death. The suspect's twin brother said he was shocked as the two had not quarrelled. "I had gone to job in the morning as usual when I was called back and told my father had been killed by my brother who is hardly here at home as he spends most of his time in Eldoret town working," the brother said. Kiminini police took the body to Kiminini hospital morgue. Click here for the latest political news
