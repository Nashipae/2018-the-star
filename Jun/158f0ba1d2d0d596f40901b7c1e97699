A a Makueni county official is among two men who were charged on Monday with defiling a 15-year-old girl at a village in Kilungu sub-county. Paul Musau, a market superintendent at Kyambeke, and Bosco Maundu - a boda boda rider, appeared before senior resident magistrate Charles Mayamba. The two were arrested on Friday in connection with the defilement of the standard six pupil on diverse dates since last year. They denied the charges. Musau and Maundu were remanded after failing to pay Sh500,000 bond each as asked by the court. They are among 21 suspects who were identified by the teenager. Mathew Mumbu, a teacher at a primary school in the area, was the first to appear in court facing similar charges after he was arrested on Thursday last week. He denied the charges and was remanded after he failed to raise Sh500,000 bond sought by the Kilungu law court. Their trial will resume on June 20 even as the hunt for 18 other suspects, who are at large, continues. Click here for the latest political news
