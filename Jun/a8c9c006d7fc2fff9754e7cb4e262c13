Police on Friday failed to produce Husni
Mbarak, a boy abducted in Mombasa by unknown people, despite a court order. Mbarak is said to have been kidnapped at Saphire hotel along
Mwembe Tayari road in Mombasa county. The incident took place in broad daylight, with several people and
security personnel at the hotel watching. Judge Erick Ogola had directed that the Inspector General of Police and Director of Public Prosecution to produce Mbarak by
Friday. Ogola noted today that there had been no substantive response from the DPP and the IG. He reviewed the order and directed that Mbarak be produced by Wednesday, dead or alive. "The
DPP and the IG should take the personal initiative of ensuring that the
18-year-old boy is produced in court," he said. "The respondents must respects orders issued by the court." The court
further joined the AG to the proceedings as he represents all government organs. In an application filed last week, the boy's father Mbarak
Khalid said the IG and police illegally arrested or abducted his
son. He also sued the ODPP. Police have denied involvement in the matter which will be mentioned on July 4. More on this: Court orders police to produce 'abducted' Mombasa boy by Friday Click here for the latest political news
