Nakuru West MP Samuel Arama and a lawyer have been granted Sh2 million bond each with a similar surety. Arama and lawyer Kennedy Onkoba were charged with conspiracy to defraud businessman Ahmed Nisar of his land between August 3-11, 2015. They were remanded on Monday after taking a no-guilty plea. The court had heard they sought to have the parcel transferred to the politician. Yesterday, Milimani Anti-Corruption Court chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti granted the MP and Onkoba an alternative of Sh1 million bail each, pending the pre-trial hearing on July 9. Defence lawyers requested for bail saying Arama and Onkoba cannot run away because of the nature of their work. State counsel Joseph Riungu had opposed the request. He said the legislator was likely to interfere with key witnesses, as “demonstrated at a Nakuru police station where unruly youths believed to be Arama’s supporters demanded his release”.

Ogoti however said the prosecution had no compelling reasons to have the accused denied bail. He said it is their constitutional right to be admitted to bail, pending the hearing and determination of the case. The court heard the accused sought to dispossess Nisar of his parcel in Nakuru municipality. Arama faces other counts of forging a document with intent to defraud, willfully obtaining registration of land by false pretences, fraudulently registering certification of ownership and knowingly misleading an EACC investigator. Onkoba is accused of knowingly misleading an investigator. See:MP Arama denies graft charges, to spend another night in cell Click here for the latest political news
