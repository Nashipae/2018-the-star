Nakuru County Assembly Speaker Joel Maina Kairu has survived ouster motion debated on Wednesday. Kairu managed 32 out of 78 votes during the voting held this afternoon. The motion to remove the speaker had been filed by Biashara Ward MCA Peter Njoroge Nyaguthii. At least 55 out of 78 MCAs had signed the petition to sack him but some changed their minds last minute.

At least 36 MCAs attended the meeting that failed to reconcile the two sides. Nyaguthii, a first-term MCA, accused the speaker of denying the representatives funds for benchmarking in foreign countries. However, six of them are currently in Arusha, Tanzania, for benchmarking. “We were allocated Sh15 million for foreign trips but only Sh 9 million is available as the financial year comes to an end, where did Sh6 million go,? Nyaguthii asked. He also accused the speaker of ignoring the contribution of MCAs while nominating two members to the county assembly Public Service Board. Nyaguthii said nominated MCAs Alice Kering and Cecilia Karanja were nominated to the board without the consent of other MCAs. Last year the MCAs defied Jubilee’s call to support one of their own for speaker, former Subukia MP Nelson Gaichuhie. He is now the National Treasury and Planning Chief Administrative Secretary. Kairu got 62 votes in the first round, beating his closest rival, Gaichuie, who only got 14 votes during the election in September last year.
