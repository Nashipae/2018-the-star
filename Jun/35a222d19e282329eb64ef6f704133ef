Embu MCAs and residents have clashed over a plan to spend Sh14 million on the ward reps’ fitness and underwears for schoolgirls. The county assembly has defended the Sh11 million allocation for gym subscription for MCAs and staff in this year’s budget. The MCAs have also shielded a proposal by the executive to set aside Sh3 million to provide free underwears and sanitary pads to schoolgirls from Standard Six to the secondary level to promote their hygiene. The legislators supported Gender, Children and Social Services executive Joan Mwende’s proposal for the underwears project after she said the programme would help in lifting the self-esteem of underprivileged girls. She said the programme would also keep poor girls from poor families in school during their periods. However, residents, some politicians and religious leaders have opposed the two projects on social media and in public meetings, terming them a waste public money. They say the MCAs are selfish and are focussing on the wrong priorities. Residents say the MCAs rejected some of their preferred projects, during public participation meetings. The MCAs have, however, said the matter was overly politicised and exaggerated to provoke a public backlash. Led by Majority leader Michael Njeru, the leaders said the Sh11 million sports and fitness kitty was meant for inter-county games and tournaments, not to solely to fund gym subscriptions. He dismissed the insinuation that they are misusing public funds as “mere political rhetoric from detractors, who have no agenda for the county”. The Kithimu MCA added that on completion, the proposed ultramodern county assembly office complex will have a fully equipped gymnasium for the county legislators and staff.
