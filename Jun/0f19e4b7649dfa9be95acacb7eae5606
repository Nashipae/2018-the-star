A report by the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights has linked two sitting MPs and a former lawmaker to violence and cattle rustling in the North Rift Valley. Turkana South MP James Lomenen, Baringo North MP William Cheptumo and former Tiaty MP Asman Kamama were named in the report released on Wednesday. It also blamed some Turkana MCAs, security forces, police, bandits and others for the trouble. Witnesses told a KNCHR inquiry that Lomenen recruited and armed youth to attack Pokots at Nadome. The report said he also incited youth at Kalemng’orok and at Ngamia 1 in 2014. Contacted by the Star on Friday, Lomenen accused the KNCHR of trying to incite residents. He said on the phone there is no evidence. “I am a peacemaker. Let these human rights people produce anyone who says I incited Turkanas to kill Pokots,” he said. The report also cites second-term MP Cheptumo. It says that in 2012-13 violence erupted between the Pokot and Tugen. It says Cheptumo announced that Loruk was part of his constituency and the Pokot-Tugen border was nine kilometres inside East Pokot near Chesirimioni. Pokot politicians told the community their land had been taken, sparking violence and killings. On Friday, Cheptumo said he had not seen the report, but termed the allegations serious. He said he was ready to be probed. Cheptumo admitted making the remarks when former PM Raila Odinga launched the Loruk-Berbello road, but he denied that caused violence. “What I said was fact. Cattle rustling has been going on since 1977 when I was in school. KNCHR didn’t get my side,” he said. The report said a witness told KNCHR that in 2015 at Mukutani, Kamama said that within one week Pokot herders will have left Arabal where they had raided. On Friday, Kamama told the Star he worked for peace and was ready to be probed. “My influence in the community is positive. That’s why I worked with communities to put up many schools and use education to change lives,” he said.
