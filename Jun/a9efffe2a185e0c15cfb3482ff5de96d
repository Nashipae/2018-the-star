A meeting of at least 48 Rift Valley MPs is currently underway at Weston Hotel, Nairobi. The agenda is unclear but sources said they could be discussing the unity of the vote rich Rift Valley and the leadership of their parliamentary caucus. Elgeiyo Marakwet senator Kipchumba Murkomen took over leadership from former Kericho Senator Charles Keter who was appointed into the Cabinet by President Uhuru Kenyatta. It was reported earlier on Wednesday that Senators and MPs from the Rift Valley called a meeting to discuss the conduct of the Senate Majority leader whom they call divisive. On Tuesday night, a group of MPs from the region met in Parliament and resolved to remove Murkomen as chairman of the Rift Valley Senators and MPs Parliamentary Group. They told the Star yesterday that they were unhappy with statements the Senator has issued about divisions between President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto. An MP attending the meeting however said: "This is a normal meeting. The leadership of the caucus is not part of the agenda."
