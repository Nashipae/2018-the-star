Cashless revenue collection will begin in Kakamega county on July 1. A digital collection platform has been set up by technology systems integration firms Sybil Kenya, Oracle Kenya and Kenya Commercial Bank. It is intended to seal leakages and theft to raise revenue collection. Representatives from Sybil and Safaricom on Thursday explained system operations to county officials. The experts said USSD, a mobile communication technology software, has also been set up and is ready for system roll-out. “Ninety per cent of the roll-out plan has been finalised and we expect the platform to be up and running before July 1,” county communications head Dickson Rayori said. Governor Wycliffe Oparanya launched the new system on June 1 at Bukhungu stadium. Kakamega is among 31 counties that missed out on the Sh6.8 billion fund from the Commission on Revenue Allocation, as a reward for improved collections. The government intends to collect at least Sh1 billion in the the next financial year. “I have focused on fixing the existing non-integrated revenue collection system of the defunct local authorities by replacing it with an end-to-end integrated Oracle ERP System platform,” Oparanya said. Residents will make all payments through a paybill number 003737. During the launch, Oparanya said he would lobby for the adoption of a unified digital platform by the 14 counties under the Lake Region Economic Bloc to improve revenue collection and services. He chairs the bloc. Oparanya said the bloc would address common problems like revenue shortfalls, management, collection and billing. The bloc comprises of Kisii, Nyamira, Siaya, Migori, Homa Bay, Kisumu, Kakamega, Busia, Vihiga, Bungoma, Trans Nzoia, Nandi, Kericho and Bomet counties. “As of today, only 10 per cent of the counties have achieved their revenue targets,” Governor Oparanya said.
