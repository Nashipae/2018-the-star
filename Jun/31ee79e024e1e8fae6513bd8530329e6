Anne Kiguta has gotten tongues wagging after penning a beautiful Father's Day message to the father of her twins, Jomo Gecaga. Potential suitors out there who thought Anne Kiguta and her baby daddy are not communicating will have to search elsewhere. She took to social media to post a dated photo of Jomo Gecaga with the twins and captioned it, "Happy Father’s Day." Jomo, who is Uhuru Kenyatta's nephew, reacted to the kind wishes by saying: "And respect to the Mothers who pick up the slack and make Fathers lives all the more easier." Jomo also took time out to respond to a fan who asked him why he is wearing two watches. Instagrammer linah.og asked, "Is it wrong for me to ask why is he wearing two watches?" Jomogecaga responded, "One for each of the two angels [using Angel emoji]" Here are some reactions from the general populace in the interwebs to the photo. jomogecaga: @mosesambani2 Queen Mother kindly kindly kindly.
