Maasai Girls' School in Narok county was closed indefinitely on Tuesday after
parents stormed in seeking answers on rape claims. They had camped outside the school from as early as 6am after reports that a male teacher had been demanding sexual
favours from the girls. It was said that some students alerted their parents who dashed to the school. The students protested by refusing to go to class and demanded action against the teacher who reportedly hid in the principal's office. Principal Rose Oteko told the media that the administration asked police to investigate. "We acknowledge receiving the information about one of our teachers demanding sex from the girls. We did not [dismiss it as a rumor]," she told reporters. "The school will remain closed until further notice." She added, however, that they suspected a former teacher had incited the students. Oteko's sentiments were echoed by county Education Director Samuel ole Sankale who said they would speed up investigations. The school has about 1,300 students. The claims follow the case of Moi Girls' School in Nairobi, where a student was reportedly defiled and two others assaulted. The school was reopened on Sunday but some parents demanded details on the allegations and said they would not take their children back. At a protest on Monday, activists demanded the arrest of suspects so justice is served.Â They held demonstrations in the CBD before handing a petition to Education CS Amina Mohamed.
