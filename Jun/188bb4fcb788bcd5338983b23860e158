The truth will soon be known who between the different agencies charged with the fight against corruption is the villain. Yesterdayâ€™s claims and counter claims between the EACC and the ODPP were as interesting as they were confounding. Earlier in the day, in his appearance before a Senate committee, DPP Noordin Haji laid the ball squarely at the feet of the EACC for insufficient evidence that has led to the acquittal of many suspects of corruption, or at any rate, the unsuccessful prosecution of any high profile case. Later in the afternoon, the EACC chief executive Halakhe Waqo was filing his response at a press conference attended by Haji in which he defended their work. He claimed 99 per cent concurrence between his office and the ODPP on the strength of cases before they are taken to court. Yet, the ODPP had told Senate he had returned 57 files back to EACC and only found one to be worthy of prosecution. Who is telling the truth? It appears everyone is under pressure to perform and have results to show for it. But it bears noting that the EACC was sidestepped in the NYS investigations which culminated in prosecutions at lightning speed. That was a radical departure from the traditional pace of investigations associated with the EACC, especially its furtive mode of operation and proclivity for silence whenever asked about its work.
