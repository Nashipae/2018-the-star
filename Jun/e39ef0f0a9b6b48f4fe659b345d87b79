A mother in Migori is on the run after allegedly burning her seven-year-old daughter's hands to punish her for losing Sh400. The girl was given the money for school fees after she was sent back home. She said that after she lost it, her mother tied up her hands, poured paraffin on them and then held them over a gas cooker. Her mother then fled, leaving her in pain and crying, until her grandmother found her. The grandmother said she was alerted by neighbours on Wednesday evening. The woman, who is taking care of the minor in hospital, termed the incident unfortunate but said she had not reported it to police as she was busy. “I have not been able to reach my daughter or police since then," she said, noting the mother of two switched off her phone. Migori County Police Commander Joseph Nthenge regretted that police learned of the incident through the media. "Police rely on reported crimes to launch investigations as they cannot go on rumours. Crimes must be reported for police to take action," he said on Friday. "This report has not been filed anywhere in Uriri." He said they launched a search for the suspect.
