The National Cereals and Produce Board is yet again on the spot, this time over Sh2.1 billion subsidised fertiliser sold to farmers in 2014. The NCPB already is being probed for paying non-approved traders for maize. The board told the National Assembly’s Parliamentary Accounts Committee on Friday that it bought the subsidised fertiliser, but did not present documentation, four years since the matter was raised. PAC had invited Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe to explain the Sh2.1 billion fertiliser flagged by the Auditor General in his 2014-15 report. It emerged that the Board only had ‘records’ of how the subsidised fertiliser was distributed to the farmers but no documents to show whether it was indeed procured, as demanded by the Auditor General Edward Ouko.

There have been growing demands that Sicily -- who was also at the helm of the Youth ministry when the country lost at least Sh468 million -- step aside and be charged alongside other NYS suspects. On Thursday, five MPs warned of initiating an impeachment motion if President Uhuru Kenyatta fails to remove her. The fertiliser – according to Lesiyampe – was tendered and bought by the ministry and the board only sold it to the farmers.

They are kept at the Board and available for verification,” Lesiyampe said. The PAC, however, rejected Lesiyampe’s response and demanded he produce documents showing indeed the fertiliser was bought.
