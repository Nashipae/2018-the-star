The Meteorological department has issued an alert on heavy rains from Monday evening to Wednesday. Peter Ambenje, the department's acting Director, said Central, Northern Rift Valley and Northern and Central highlands will be affected. The severity of the rains will be “moderate to heavy” while levels will hit over 40mm. Ambenje listed Nairobi, Nakuru, Baringo, Bungoma, Uasin Gishu Turkana, Nyeri and Kirinyaga as some of the counties to be affected. Others were Murang’a, West Pokot, Marsabit, Trans Nzoia, Isiolo, Nyandarua, Elgeyo Marakwet, Tharaka Nithi and Meru. The weatherman said the rains are likely to cause flash floods in urban area so residents should be cautious. “Keep to safer ground until the flooding subsides,” he said. The heavy rain that kicked off earlier in the year left massive death and destruction in its wake across the country. The most devastating tragedy was the Solai Dam incident that claimed 48 lives. A multi-agency report that was prepared following the May 9 incident states that the walls of the dam had cracked but the rains worsened the situation leading to the many deaths. Landslides also claimed several lives in various parts of the country following the rains. “Residents in landslide-prone areas in Murang’a County should be on high alert,” Ambenje said. Advice was also given against walking or driving through flood waters and open fields, as well as sheltering under trees or near grilled windows due to the risk of being struck by lightning.
