Documentation from the Kenya Bureau of Standards has shown that various metals and compounds in brown sugar are is tolerable to the body. The acceptable limit of arsenic in brown sugar as per Kenya or the East Africa Standard (EAS) is 1mg/kg, 2mg for copper and 0.5 mg for lead. The document does not list the permitted limits for cadmium and mercury metals. Internationally, the limits or safe levels of contaminants in brown sugar for arsenic is 0.5 mg, 2mg for copper, 0.5mg for lead, 0.5 for cadmium and 0.1 for mercury. Last week, Interior CS Fred Matiangâ€™i said some of the contraband sugar hidden in warehouses in Nairobi and Eastleigh contains mercury. He said chemical analysis on some of the 1,030 sacks of the seized sweetener showed copper contamination. The document from Kebs has summarised the heavy metals tested, the tolerances and health implications in brown sugar. It states that high levels of mercury in brown sugar is toxic to the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs and the immune system. Lead has an effect on brain and intellectual development in young children, while long-term exposure in both children and adults can cause damage to the kidneys, reproductive, immune systems and the nervous system. Excessive levels arsenic cause cancer of the lungs, skin and bladder and can cause diabetes, heart and vascular diseases. And death. Cadmium damages the blood vessels, kidneys and lungs and causes lung cancer. EAS standards specifies acceptable levels.
