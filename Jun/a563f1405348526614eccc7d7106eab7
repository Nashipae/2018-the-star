The war on contraband sugar has just begun, government spokesperson Erick Kiraithe has said in a warning to "rich men" causing Kenyans to suffer. At a press conference in Mombasa on Wednesday, he noted that the fight against illegal imports will intensify and that all culprits will be punished. Kiraithe said the government is prepared to fight social evils by "rich men" and will catch up with businessmen who think they are untouchable. "Multi-agency Investigators are already pursuing important leads of businessmen suspected to be behind the importation of the sugar," he noted. "Any sugar that is unfit for humanÂ consumption will be nabbed and destroyed. We will not tolerate anyone harm to Kenyans." The spokesman added that officials who permitted the imports will also be held accountable. For weeks now, thousands of tonnes of substandard sugar have been confiscated in parts of the county including Nairobi, Bungoma and Meru. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i, who has also read the riot act, said some of it contained copper and mercury, as shown by tests. After demands for explanations by people including Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati, Rai Paper and West Kenya Sugar Company denied allegations that they were dealing in contraband sugar.
