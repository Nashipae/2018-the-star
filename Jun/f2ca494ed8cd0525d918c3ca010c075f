I do not pretend to know everything about taking good wildlife photos, but over a period over half a century, hopefully some lessons have been learned. Here are some factors that help me to enjoy many “Clicks and pics”: 1) Know your camera equipment.Even small “point and shoot” camera’s can get good results if used correctly. Some people buy the best and expect instant excellence. 2) Practice makes perfect. It’s okay to make mistakes, but note how to improve. 3) Hold still. If possible, avoid “camera shake”. A “bean bag” to rest the camera on does help. 4) Sometimes, first and last hours of the day are “golden hours”, when the soft sunlight is just right for great photos. 5) Don’t overzoom, try to get the full subject into the frame, if moving, use “sport function”, and follow with the camera as you click. 6) Try to get out of “City mode” and relax into “Bush mode” 7) Pray for God to show you the glory of creation 8) Drive slowly, less than 30km/h is advised. 9) Don’t just look at grass and trees, look through grass and trees. 10) Watch the reactions of different herbivores and birds. I have often seen lions in this way. 11) Have an attitude of “birdwatching”,  and showing an interest in the smaller creatures. This is very rewarding. 12) Don’t drive too fast. Stop often and wait. 13) Stop often  and scan the area with binoculars. 14) Go with the attitude of “let nature come to me” rather than trying to “catch a bit of nature”. 15) Be ready. You never know when that special moment could happen. Always have your camera ready. Remember, simply speaking, “It is the clicks that become the pics ”.  The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00.
