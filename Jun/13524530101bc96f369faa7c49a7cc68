Seven teachers have been interdicted for allegedly assisted nine students  to cheat in national examinations last year at Tenges Boys High School in Baringo Central subcounty. The accused teachers, one supervisor and six invigilators, are Reuben Mambei, Linah Kiprop, Lily Too, Daniel Kiplimo, Francis Kiptalam, Keitany Kipkirui and Priscilla Tisia. “They still have pending cases in court and in the process they were rendered jobless after being interdicted,” Kenya National Union of Teachers Baringo branch secretary Joshua Cheptarus said yesterday. He asked teachers to show solidarity with their colleagues but think twice when called to invigilate national exams in future. “It is not a must that you take the  risky duty that will later cost your job, put you into unnecessary expenditure and brand you an outcast in the society,” Cheptarus warned teachers. The 16 suspects (teachers and students) who were arraigned in Kabarnet on on December 7 denied the cheating charges. Prosecutors said the suspects were found with History paper 2 before it was released, during last year’s Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exams. They all denied the charges and were released each on bail.  Yesterday’s meeting was also attended by  Koibatek-Mogotio Knut secretary Richard Bundotich and Baringo branch Chairman Silas Ruto.
