Another 1,000 bags of
contraband sugar was yesterday recovered from a godown in Ruiru. The sugar was recovered by officers from Parklands DCI who raided the warehouse on the
Eastern-bypass. A prominent Kirinyaga
businessman said to be the owner of the warehouse was arrested. The recovery

of sugar said to be unfit for human consumption. The previous recovery happened in Eastleigh, Nairobi. The operation was
headed by Parklands DCI boss David Chebii. He has been coordinating
operations against contraband goods. Investigators have
since expanded the probe on the illicit sugar to a warehouses in Mombasa where unscrupulous traders are believed to
have stored the sonsignment. It was shipped in from Brazil.
