Transport services in Murang’a town were disrupted for hours after lorry operators took to the streets. They were protesting the hiking of levies by the county government. Hundreds of parents taking their children back to school and students were caught up in the protests. The traders transport building materials, including stones and sand. They accused the county government of hiking the levies from Sh500 to Sh1,000 per trip. John Mwangi, a lorry operator, said the county hiked the fees to Sh3,000 two weeks ago, before reviewing it downwards following an uproar. Mwangi said he pays the county government Sh1,000 per day from the two trips he makes. “This translates to Sh30,000 per month, which is too expensive.” Police were forced to lob teargas cannisters to disperse the traders who blocked the Mkuyu Murang’a Road. The traders complained that despite the high levies, the county has not rehabilitated access roads to quarries. They said they want the county to impose a fixed daily levy instead of charging them per trip. “If these taxes are not reviewed, most of us will be rendered jobless,” Mwangi said. He questioned why the police used force against them yet they only wanted to head to the governor’s office to give him their petition. Click here for the latest political news
