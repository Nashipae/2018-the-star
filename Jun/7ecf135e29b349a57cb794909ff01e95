The Nyeri county government has cancelled a road construction tender with one of the companies mentioned in the NYS scandal. Deputy Governor Caroline Karugu said the contract with Ark Road Holdings was terminated after the firm cited financial constraints. "The County Government of Nyeri jointly with Ark Road Holdings have mutually agreed to terminate the contract for tender number CGN/INF/60/2017-2018," Karugu said in a statement on Tuesday. The tender had been awarded to the firm for re-carpeting the stretch of the road between Kuku Lane Junction and Temple Road Junction. "Ark Road Holdings have cited financial constraints. The tender will be re-advertised immediately," Karugu said. She did not, however, reveal the cost of the tender. Ark Road Holdings is among the ten companies listed by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations as having benefited from the alleged fraudulent payments of Sh468 million from the National Youth Service.
