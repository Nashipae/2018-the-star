Lamu Governor Fahim Twaha has said is ready to forgive all his political enemies and even offer them employment in his administration in the spirit of the handshake. Addressing residents at the Mkunguni Square in Lamu town on yesterday, Twaha lauded president Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto for reconciling with NASA opposition leader Raila Odinga and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka. “I am willing to forgive and work with my political rivals. If they want, I can even offer them employment in my administration. All I want is that we follow in the President’s footsteps to lead Lamu forward.The time for politicking is long gone,” Twaha said. Twaha said it was in the same spirit that he was also extending the olive branch to his political rivals and all opposition party members in the county. The governor said he was more than ready to forgive and work with his rivals as long as they are willing to do the same so that they can all work together for the general good of Lamu. He said his office was always open to those who are willing to share the same spirit and embrace forgiveness and pave way a more unified Lamu and Kenya in general. Lamu Woman Rep Ruweida Obbo urged leaders in the county and in the country to emulate the two leaders and seek to lead Kenyans into forgiveness and healing after a heated electioneering period on August 8 last year.
