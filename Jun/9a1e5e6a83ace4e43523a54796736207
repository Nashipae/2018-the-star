Interior CS Fred Matiang’i yesterday said he will do everything in his power to fight “white collar graft”. He said measures are being put in place to stop illegal imports, white collar graft and tax evasion. Matiang’i spoke in Busia after meeting the One Stop Border Post (OSBP) management and stakeholders. “It is cleanup time and as government, we are determined to deal with white collar crime. Sugar and contraband goods do not arrive in Industrial Area or Eastleigh from the sky, they come through some of our border points,” he said. The CS warned that those involved will be brought to book. Matiang’i said clearing agents will see a difference before the end of the month. Click here for more political news
