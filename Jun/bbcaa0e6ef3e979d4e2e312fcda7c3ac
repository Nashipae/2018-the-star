  A 93-year-old woman was raped in a fatal attack in Embu West, two weeks after an eight-year old girl was also raped and murdered. Residents of Kithimu
village in Embu West on Wednesday woke up to a rude shock after Naomi Warunji was found dead. She had been raped in her kitchen. Police are investigating. Her relatives found the door wide open. She had no clothes on. Warunji's grandchild Josline Muthoni said she was woken up at around 6am and told her granny had been found dead. The elderly woman  used to sleep alone in the kitchen to feel the warmth of the room, Muthoni said. The other rooms had become cold since the rains started. Assistant chief James Nyaga said he learnt of the crime early Residents said Warunji and Sharon Mwende, whose body was found on May 29 in a maize plantation, must have suffered at the hands of the same person or gang. They want more police officers deployed to deal with rising crimes. Mwende was a Standard Two
pupil at Kithimu Primary School.
She had gone to fetch firewood.
