Kiambu county government has created a rehabilitation program aimed at empowering recovering alcoholics. Governor Ferdinand Waititu said the program dubbed 'Kiambu youth service' will be offered short courses that will help them when looking for jobs. Speaking in Ndumberi grounds on Saturday, Waititu said majority of young people were hooked to drugs because of lack of employment. "While we were campaigning we promised to create jobs and we have started with the 5000 alcoholic addicts whom as a government we are rehabilitating." Waititu said on Saturday. The six month course will be catered for by the county goverment. Currently, recovering alcoholics in the county earn Sh400 daily for collecting garbage, cleaning trenches and drainage systems. "We were not elected so that the youth can be clap for us while giving speeches in functions. It is time that we return the favour by creating jobs." Waititu said. Waititu also lashed out at Kiambu leaders who have opposed the program. "This is my initiative and it will go on Those fighting me claiming that I am giving addicts money, they can also start their own programs and help young people" Waititu added. The governor urged Kiambu residents to join him in the fight against illicit brews and also bringing down the number of bars in the county. The county has been on the spot over the rehabilitation programme with some leaders terming it as gateway of stealing public funds. They argue that the money meant to be used in the programme is yet to be approved by the assembly, neither has it been factored in the county budget. The county uses Sh2 million daily to pay the addicts and uses Sh500,000 weekly for fuelling cars used in the war against alcohol abuse. Click here for the latest political news
