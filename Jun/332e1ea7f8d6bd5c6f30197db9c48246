Embu Governor Martin Wambora has urged saccos to align their services to the Jubilee’s Big Four agenda. He said his government fully supports the national development agenda of manufacturing, food security, affordable housing and universal healthcare. His comments were contained in a speech read on his behalf by Deputy Governor David Kariuki during the opening of the Stima Sacco branch in Embu on Thursday. The governor praised the sacco for contributing to the cooperative movement. Stima Sacco national chairman Ken Tarus said plans of starting an insurance agency are at an advanced stage of implementation. He said this will help them tap into the ever-increasing insurance market share. Tarus said the sacco will also refocus on the energy and allied sectors to grow the loan book. He said the sacco will improve access to information and become more competitive. Tarus urged Embu residents to support the new office to ensure the branch is self-reliant and contributes to the overall revenue growth. According to the sacco website, Stima Sacco was established in 1974 to improve members’ social and economic well-being. In July last year, Mary Mungai, commissioner for co-operatives, said saccos were traditionally formed or founded along specific bond lineages to identify or distinguish persons who qualify and are eligible to become members. “However, these traditional bond lineages are fast disappearing, with many co-operatives loosening or opening up the bond to allow eligibility of every adult citizen,” she aid. Mungai said the Kenya Police now accepts members from sectors other than the disciplined forces, as does Stima Sacco where members don’t have to work for Kenya Power. Growth of saccos is fuelled by growing social needs, such as home ownership, with land buying companies converting to saccos.
