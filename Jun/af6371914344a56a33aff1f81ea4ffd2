Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has called for a lifestyle audit of all leaders in the wake of the financial scandals that have rocked the country. He said the audit should start from Cabinet secretaries, Governors, Senators, and all senior civil servants. "Those who will fail to explain how they acquired their fabulous wealth should have the properties confiscated and returned to the people of Kenya who are the rightful owners." Mutua, speaking in Machakos town on Thursday, said it is absurd that there are Kenyan's who own planes and thousands of acres of land, not to mention other assets worth billions, "yet they earn modest salaries from their full-time jobs". He hailed President Uhuru Kenyatta for the renewed fight against corruption. "However, a lot remains to be done to slay the dragon which has impoverished wananchi for over three decades," the governor said.

Deal with them ruthlessly and show Kenyans there are no sacred cows in your administration," he told the president. He said the purge should now focus on the 'big fish' as "those arrested over the Sh9 billion National Youth Service scandal are the 'small fish'". Mutua said the country's composition of 100 billionaires and 40 million paupers cannot allow proper growth of the economy. "Approximately more than Sh1 trillion has been lost through corruption in the past three decades. It is now time to deal with the menace once and for all."
