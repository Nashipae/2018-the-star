Listen to anything done by Moji Shortbaba, and one thing is evident: Fun. Known more for his comical persona, he certainly owns the part in every project he has been involved in. Comedian or not, he's always really seemed to enjoy making his music, even before he parted ways with his fellow Kelele Takatifu comrade Didi Man.  The duo were a force to reckon with. In fact, they created striking tunes that after a couple of listens would get lodged in one's head. The thought of this two high-spirited lads going their separate ways seemed far-fetched. But, for whatever reason, they did what they had to. The truth is, this unforeseen move seems to be paying off more for Moji as it is for Didi.  But there's just no letting go of the of the initial impression. Moji's personality still lives on, even in his solo attempt. For him, transitioning was effortless. He has been on a relentless move to ensure he offers his fan base new music on the regular. Now, he can proudly claim to be one of the leading urban gospel artistes currently dominating the music scene.  The strength of his delivery, youthful exuberance and his physical appearance seamlessly meld with his personality. Despite his sense of style and exciting music, he ensures to impart the teachings of the gospel of Christ to his listeners. He does so using catchphrases and a language and style that his target audience relates with.  For the most part, Moji's recent catalogue is packed with danceable, catchy music. He is hovering on the edge of something big - he has all the talent and creativity needed. His consistency is remarkable and his current effort directed towards making the "Vimbada" massive is quite accomplished.
