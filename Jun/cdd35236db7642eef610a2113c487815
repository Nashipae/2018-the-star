The National Assembly Environment committee has asked Nema to list developers who have grabbed and encroached on riparian land. The committee members spoke yesterday during a tour of land that has been encroached on in Nairobi. Chairman Kareke Mbiuki (Maara MP) said land grabbing and illegal construction are going on because someone somewhere is asleep on the job. He said the government is pumping a lot of money into the regeneration project, but it will be an effort in futility if relevant agencies fail to do their job. “Nema and Warma [Water Resource Management Authority] might have given conditional approvals but they never make a follow up to find out if the conditions are followed,” Mbiuki said. He said action will be taken against those involved irrespective of the position they occupy in government. Nema director general Geoffrey Wahungu had a difficult time explaining how someone was able to build a wall along Ngong River in the Arboretum, yet no action has ever been taken. Mbiuki said those involved should be summoned before the committee in two weeks, together with Nema and Warma officials, to explain themselves.

Kasipul MP Charles Were said if those summoned will give inadequate explanation, then all the buildings will be demolished. Areas visited included Fuata Nyayo informal settlement in South B, South End Mall on Lang’ata road, Taj Apartments in the Arboretum, Gem Suites in Riverside and Alina Villas in Spring Valley. Alina Villas were given a clean bill of health. The committee said the developer was the only one who has followed Nema rules. Also present was Nairobi Lands executive Charles Kerich.
