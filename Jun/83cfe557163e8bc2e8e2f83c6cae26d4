Bungoma residents want the World Bank to withhold Sh300 million meant for upgrading towns because they are not satisfied with the list. On Monday, the committee on Lands, Housing and Physical Planning chaired by Humphrey Simiyu held a public participation forum at KIE in Bungoma town. The World Bank plans to give Sh200 million for the upgrade of Kimilili town and Sh100 million for Bungoma town. It cited the 2009 census figures in the choice of the towns. Bungoma Chamber of Commerce and Industry chairman Herman Kasili said the county government never followed the right procedures. Kasili wondered why the committee did not select Webuye, which is the second largest town. He said before towns get new status, management boards must be formed. “The World Bank should not to release the funds yet. The committee which selected the towns was not properly constituted. Members were handpicked by the county leadership,” he said. Residents who spoke also suggested that Webuye be included based on its population. They want the committee to relook in the choices for fair sharing of the cash. Residents are unhappy the committee left out Webuye and settled on Kimilili, which comes third in the county and has less population. Participants said the people involved in drafting the list of towns were not nominated by institutions under the Urban Areas and Cities Act.
