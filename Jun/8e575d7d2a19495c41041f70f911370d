The government has set aside Sh200 million towards reviving rice production in Nyanza following low production for years. EAC Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya said part of the funds are allocated in this year’s budget. He said part of the cash will be used to revamp the dormant Kibos rice mill run by the Lake Basin Development Authority. The project seeks to promote food security and boost rice production to reduce imports. Kenya has a deficit of rice, producing only 250,000 tonnes against 400,000 which is imported, Munya said. “The country needs around 650,000 tonnes a year,” he said. Munya said the government is committed to boosting food security and the project is a major step in achieving the goal.
