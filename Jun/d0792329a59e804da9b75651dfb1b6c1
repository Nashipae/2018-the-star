A truck driver and a woman died in Karai area, Naivasha on Friday morning following an accident involved three vehicles. Scores of people were injured in the 3am accident which caused a heavy traffic snarl-up on both ends of the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. The gridlock was caused after the vehicles which were involved in the accident blocked the road at a bridge along the route. The wreckage pf the truck, bus, and private car was cleared after two hours of total paralysis. Witnesses said the accident occurred after the trailer, which was heading to Nakuru from Nairobi, attempted to overtake other vehicles. The trailer crashed into the bus and the personal car which were heading in the opposite direction. James Kabono said the trailer driver was on the road illegally as trailers are supposed to be using the Limuru-Mai Mahiu road. "The trailer first hit the side of the bus and an oncoming county car before the driver lost control and landed in aÂ  ditch," he said. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said that the victims of the accident died while undergoing treatment at the sub-county hospital. Tens of motorists were stranded for over three hours on the same highway following another accident near Kijabe area. This was after a lorry that hit a personal car blocked the busy road forcing motorists to seek alternative routes. The situation was worsened by overlapping drivers before police cleared the mess restoring traffic flow. Click here for the latest political news
