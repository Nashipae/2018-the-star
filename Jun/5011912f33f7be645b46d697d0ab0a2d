Cash deposits and withdrawals above Sh10 million in banks will have to be approved by top managers, new rules published by the Kenya Bankers Association indicate. The lobby yesterday said its governing council has resolved to have transactions of Sh10-20 million approved by regional branch managers, while those above Sh20 million will only be given a go-ahead by head of branch banking or directors. Customers will have to give their banks three-day notice before making any transactions above Sh10 million. Transactions above Sh1 million will have to be approved by branch managers. “For cash transactions above Sh10 million, the branch manager should request the customer to give a three-day written notice giving source of funds (with supporting evidence) for deposits and for what purpose the funds are being used for,” KBA chief executive Habil Olaka said. The tough new rules have been enforced as lenders seek to join in on the fight against graft. In 2015, it emerged that a number of bank employees, some senior managers, aided in laundering part of the Sh791 million that was looted from the NYS.
