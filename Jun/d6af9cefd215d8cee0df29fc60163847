The death toll of the Gikomba fire tragedy has risen to 16 after a child aged below 10 succumbed to her injuries at Kenyatta National Hospital. The child died on Friday at 3am and is among five children that have met their end following the Thursday tragedy. Six people have died at the hospital. “Four died on arrival yesterday [Thursday] and two have died while undergoing treatment. Most of the patients are suffering from smoke inhalation, while others have 36 per cent burns, which are not extensive,” KNH acting chief executive officer Thomas Mutie said on Friday. He said 74 patients were rushed to the hospital. Eight people were discharged on Friday. By Friday morning, 35 people had been discharged, while seven were still at the Burns Unit. Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki (pictured) visited the victims at the hospital on Friday. She said the government will foot the hospital bill for those without NHIF cards. “Some of the patients have NHIF cards and this has taken care of the bills. For those without the cards, the government will assist them with the hospital bills and even to resettle,” Kariuki said. She appealed to Kenyans and well-wishers to donate blood and support those hospitalised with ventilators and monitors so they can recover. “The hospital is giving the patients the attention required and the situation is under control. The hospital has set up an information desk to assist families in tracing their relatives and in getting any other information about the fire victims,” the CS said.
