Machakos Level Five Hospital staff boycotted work on Thursday morning in a demand for a better working environment. Those who spoke to journalists said they could no longer offer their services without facilities, equipment, drugs and other necessities. Doctors, technicians, nurses, cleaners, patient attendants, cooks and drivers marched from the hospital to the streets of Machakos town, while waving placards. They noted on the signs that they were also fighting for patients' rights. The protesters said they were displeased with the county, led by Governor Alfred Mutua, as it has not provided facilities. They noted that the lack of drugs had forced patients to buy them from private chemists. "Most of the laboratories at the hospital are not operational due to lack of testing kits and chemicals," said one who did not want to be named for fear of victimisation. "CT scan and X-ray machines are not functional. They broken down."
