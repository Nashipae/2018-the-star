More than 200 fish and chicken traders evicted from City Market two weeks ago have urged Governor Mike Sonko to help them. The traders said their eviction targeted one group. They were removed from the market despite having operating licences and paying requisite fees, they said. They accused some officers at City Hall of being behind the eviction. The officers have been mistreating and extorting them, they said. “We are pleading with the governor to help us. Let these people be investigated because they have frustrated us for years,” a trader said. They urged the governor to order a probe into nepotism and bribery at the market. “We were removed and chased away from our stalls on the grounds that there is a change of user at the market. They told us the market is now under the Ministry of Tourism,” another trader said. Efforts to get a comment from Trade executive Allan Igambi were unsuccessful. The county said illegal traders have invaded the market, selling substandard and non-inspected meat. Two weeks ago, inspectorate officers removed hundreds of traders from the market for operating outside designated stalls. Traders protested the raid and accused city officers of acting without notice. They claimed their merchandise was destroyed and some of them were roughed up by askaris and police officers.
