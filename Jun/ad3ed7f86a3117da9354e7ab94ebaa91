Excited Kogelo residents may not get to see former US President Barack Obama as he might not go there when he visits Kenya on July 16. Mama Sarah Obama, his grandmother, said this on Saturday, noting "he is a government, not village visitor". "He will be busy so I am not sure he will visit the village," she told the Star. Information on Obama's visit is so scanty that not even the government can confirm he will come to Kenya. According to the Nelson Mandela Foundation and the Obama Foundation, however, the former President will be in the country on this date and then head to South Africa where he will deliver the 16th Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture in Johannesburg. Read: Former US president Barack Obama to visit Kenya on July 16 Reports indicate Obama will hold talks with President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House and Opposition leader Raila Odinga before traveling to his ancestral home of Kogelo. When he visited Kenya in 2015, he promised to return more relaxed and mingle with the people, as he would be without the trappings of power. But Mama Sarah said the former President had not told her to expect him yet they communicate frequently. It was also reported that Obama will open a Sauti Foundation project in his village but Mama Sarah said she was not aware of this. "Kogelo people do not like development. Which project are you talking about?" she asked. She said, however, that Obama will be welcomed should he go to Kogelo as that is his home. "At the moment, I have not prepared in any way for my grandson as the information I have is that he will be a state visitor," she said. Workers were at the home but there was little activity.
