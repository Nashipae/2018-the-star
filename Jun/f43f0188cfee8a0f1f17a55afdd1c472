Most of the developed world uses polygraph testing to qualify their workers. Organisations that need high levels of integrity, confidentiality and secrecy employ polygraph testing in choosing staffers. These include the CIA and FBI countries like Israel go further and also employ layered voice analysis (LVI/LVI). A polygraph tests your emotions, it’s a psycho-physiological test. This means ‘reading’ emotions, blood pressure, skin reaction. There’s a standard way your skin and blood pressure respond when you are telling the truth. When you are lying, the polygraph spots and records abnormality. But in Israel they go the next step and use LVI to qualify you further. Those who fail the polygraph, even those who pass, go through voice analysis that picks up stresses and intonations as you talk. I think we’re on the right track and using the polygraphs is a good way to deter corruption. It’s better than doing nothing. When a thief knows you are doing nothing, he or she goes into overdrive to steal. When they know they will be vetted and subjected to polygraph testing, they will be careful. The truth is we were not created to lie. When you lie, your body reacts in a different way than it should and does when you are telling the truth. Just as with fingerprints and DNA, you commit the crime, but the sweat or the hair or semen would be left behind and establish that you were there. Polygraph testing is a good way  to start individualising the fight against corruption. What the government should do to get this right is employ a private firm to do testing for them. The government cannot test itself. That procurement cannot be from within. That clearance should be left to either DCI or a private company, as is done worldwide. If we can say that frequently, or every six months, we do the testing, it is likely we can shuffle and turn around the officers within the procurement, accounting and other departments.
