President Uhuru Kenyatta will on Tuesday leave for Canada where he will attend the G7 Summit. The president's visit is on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's invitation. It is lauded as a privilege for Kenya as the summit only incorporates the seven most-developed nations. They are Canada, USA, United Kingdom, German, France, Italy and Japan. The meeting, which will take place between Friday and Saturday, will focus on economic growth, climate change and security. Before his departure, the President will receive the credentials from the new Chinese Ambassador to Kenya Sun Baohong. Baohong arrived in the country on May 13 at the end of her four year diplomatic stint as the Chinese ambassador to Ghana. She takes over from outgoing ambassador Liu Xianfa. The diplomat, who has been working on African affairs for 26 years, is expected to continue strengthening the strong bilateral ties Kenya has held with China since 2014, notably over the financing and construction of the SGR. Uhuru will also receive the 2018 Babacar Ndiaye Grand Trophy awarded by Africa Road builders before he jets out at around 5:30pm. The award recognises Uhuru's commitment towards infrastructural development, notably the SGR and road construction.
