Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma yesterday urged Governor Cyprian Awiti to convene a meeting of residents to deliberate on the success of devolution. He said this will enable residents to highlight priority projects they want implemented to avoid duplication by the county and CDF teams. “Development can’t be achieved singlehandedly. It’s high time Homa Bay people met and dialogued on their progress,” Kaluma said. The legislator said the county has not achieved much since the inception of devolved government in 2013. He blamed this on feuding leaders and the county’s failure to exploit natural resources, especially the agricultural sector. On Madaraka Day, Awiti said he is ready to join hands with all leaders to fight the ills bedevilling the county. “We should play our part without blaming one another,” he said.
