Rapper Frasha is at pains to explain to his fans and wife how a video of him in what looks like a bedroom surrounded by half-naked women lying in bed got leaked. The video has raised eyebrows. Now Frasha is claiming it was a social experiment. "I wanted to see the reactions... You see I have come to realise people, even those you think know you and what you stand for, are never there for you in this generation. If they see one negative thing about you they will all distance themselves." Adding, "The clip was part of a music video titled Chocha, and to be sincere, I don't even know one of the vixens' names, because it was just part of a set. But you see the world is quick to judge people and have perceptions based on social media."
