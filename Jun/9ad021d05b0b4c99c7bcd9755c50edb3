Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana has warned his officers against focussing on 2022 succession politics and ignoring services. Kibwana said that since this is his last term in office, many employees may want to make alliances with those who might take over from him. The governor spoke at the county prayer breakfast in Wote town on Monday. He said such plans would derail his development plans and hurt his legacy. He was responding to concerns by county assembly speaker Douglas Mbilu. Kibwana asked the clergy to pray for those who will come after Kibwana not to ruin the strong foundation he had laid. “Some of us whose terms are not ending might be tempted to start focusing on our next jobs or political plans,” Mbilu said. He added that the governor must watch out for such employees. Kibwana said for counties to succeed, politicians must be ready to offer servant leadership. “If we don’t review our leadership and make political parties true vehicles of people’s representation, we will not be making any progress,” he said. He urged Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka to be keen “as we pick the next heads and get true servant leaders”. Deputy Governor Adelina Mwau, Woman representative Rose Museo, Makueni MP Daniel Maanzo, Kibwezi East MP Jessica Mbalu and Kilome’s Thaddeus Nzambi were present.
