Singer Idd Aziz is well known for his hit, Come Dada, featuring Khaligraph Jones, alias the real OG. They did the song a few years ago, when Khaligraph was still young in the industry. Speaking to Word Is, he talked about how the two met and worked on the collabo. "By the time I met Khaligraph Jones, he was not an OG yet. I found him on YouTube and we spoke via Facebook, while I was still in Norway, because when I saw his work and I really wanted to do a song with him. So I promised him that the first thing I would do when I come in Kenya was to do a song with him, and it happened." Despite the two doing a song together, they never met one-on-one until during an event after their song was already out. "I did not meet him in studio, I did my part of the song and trusted he would do his part well, too, so I sent him my part," he said. So how was it like working with him? "Khaligraph was nice and easy to work with because he does his work so well. I would really want to work with him and produce more songs. I am looking forward to it." Aziz is in the country handling his media tour.
