Some 76 per cent of children in Tiaty subcounty, Baringo, are out of school because of early marriage and cattle rustling. Children’s services director Otisom Omuse said only 24 per cent attend school, “although their completion is not guaranteed.” Omuse attributed the low school turnout to the Pokot community’s adherence to FGM, early marriage and insecurity caused by banditry. “Majority of the children, especially girls as young as 10 and 14 years, are circumcised and later married off,” Omuse said. They are married off to young or old men to bring wealth to the family in form of livestock. Omuse addressed a Day of the African Child rally at Museum Grounds in Kabarnet town, Baringo. The county children’s officer urged politicians to end the vice and keep children in school. Kabarnet principal magistrate Samson Temu and Baringo central subcounty deputy commissioner Reuben Ratemo were present.
