Western Stima will today seek to reclaim the top spot in the National Super League when they take on log leaders Ushuru at Camp Toyoyo grounds in Jericho. Western Stima have thrown away an 11 point lead and now sit second on the log— a point behind Ushuru. The tax men lead the log with 38 points. However, Stima chairman Laban Jobita is not worried man. He says his team’s promotion push is very much on track. “There is no need to panic. We are in the process of strengthening the team by signing more players,” he said.
