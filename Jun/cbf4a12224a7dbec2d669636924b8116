Kenyans will pay an extra Sh4.4 billion for the new Mombasa-Nairobi pipeline, the Senate Energy committee was told yesterday. This means the new line will cost Sh53.3 billion instead of the initial Sh48.9 billion. The additional charges are as a result of extension of time and change in the design, Kenya Pipeline Company managing director Joe Sang told the House team chaired by Nyeri Senator Ephraim Maina. He said the project delayed for 18 months due to legal disputes. Initially, the contractor demanded Sh18.9 billion – almost half the cost of the entire project – but the figure was later revised to Sh4.4 billion after arbitration. “...we listed the services of an independent scheduler who reduced it Sh4.4 billion,” Sang said. He said no payment has been made to the Chinese engineering firm as the KPC awaits a nod from the Energy Cabinet Secretary. The KPC paid the arbitrator Sh20 million. Sang appeared before the committee to answer to queries on the alleged lose of Sh95 billion. He denied the claims, terming the reports ‘malicious and inaccurate’. According to media reports, detectives have been investigating 27 projects at KPC in the last four years, in which tendering was done irregularly. Click here for more political news
