Police are investigating claims of rape of three girls at Moi Girls' school in Nairobi on Friday night. A parent of one of the affected girls said that a test conducted at the Nairobi Women's hospital confirmed that her daughter was raped. The girl was referred to Kenyatta National Hospital for further tests. One of the survivors said a man - only described as brown in complexion, attacked them at night, claims that the school attempted to water down, according to some parents. The man reportedly raped a girl in a toilet before committing the heinous act on two other girls in the dormitory - christened Iten. The situation of the other two girls remains unclear. Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations visited the school on Saturday and have launched a deeper probe into the incident. An officer handling the case told the Star in confidence that they cannot rule out the claims until their investigation proves otherwise. The girls protested the incident even as parents demanded to be handed their daughters citing the school's deteriorating security situation. "The teachers are ridiculing us instead of coming to our help....we better be allowed to go home where our security is assured," one of the girls said as the others shouted in protest. Principal Jael Mureithi said the administration knew of the case at 5.30am but some of the students said they reported the incident at 2am. Nairobi county director of education Ellias Abdi visited to the school upon receiving the news of the rape allegations. He told the students that they have beefed up security at the school to ensure they are safe. The girls booed him. "We are doing everything we can to ensure you are safe...I also have a daughter here." The school was in the news in September last year following a fire incident which left ten girls dead.
