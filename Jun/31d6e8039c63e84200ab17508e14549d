The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission is now pushing for a law that will make it mandatory for wealth declared annually by civil servants to be made public. The EACC chief executive officer Halake Waqo said at present public officers declare their wealth and the information is kept in a sealed envelope. He spoke on Thursday when he appeared before the National Assembly’s Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs committee at Parliament Buildings.

It is tedious to trace and track ill-gotten wealth and this derails the fight against corruption, he said. “It takes long before you get to the property of an individual.We are proposing a law that will make accessability easy,” Waqo said. Some state and public officers have amassed wealth from proceeds of corruption. Some are reported to under declare their wealth to dodge investigation. Waqo said after changes to the law are adopted by Parliament, they will give EACC power to ascertain the accuracy, completeness and consistency of information provided. “We have a limited legal framework to do that at the moment”, Waqo said. Waqo was presenting a report on the status of corruption. He was accompanied by EACC vice chairperson Sophia Lepuchirit and commissioners Abdi Maalim, Paul Mwaniki and Rose Macharia. Waqo told the panel that a law should be passed to make governors accounting officers. President Uhuru announced all public servants including himself will undergo a lifestyle audit.
