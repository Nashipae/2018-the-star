A 73-year-old granny was on Monday found raped and murdered near her home at Kigoro village, Maragua sub-county, Murang’a. The body of Jedidah Wambui was found dumped on the roadside by children who were going to school. The children alerted neighbours who then informed the police. The granny who sells bananas at the nearby Mbombo market along the Kenol Murang’a road had been stripped naked. “We heard children screaming on the road only to find the naked body lying along the road,” a neighbour said. The assailants who took her life had gagged her with a piece of cloth. Murang'a South OCPD John Onditi said detectives have started an investigation to unearth what happened. Meanwhile, a bar has been closed down in Karung’e village after a 47-year-old man died mysteriously. According to area District County Commissioner Jamleck Mbuba, the deceased Charles Irungu Gachure passed away outside the pub after only taking one beer. “He got to the bar drunk and took one beer after which he left only to be found dead outside the bar,” he said.
