Counties with less developed urban areas could receive little funds if proposals on county allocations are adopted. The Commission on Revenue Allocation, in its six-year Strategic Plan, proposes to allocate more funds to counties with cities and major towns next year. The CRA proposal to allocate cities and major towns more funds to save them from financial constraints will see the country’s three cities Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu emerge as the biggest beneficiaries. CRA chairperson Jane Kiringai will replace the current formula which expired following the allocation of Sh314 billion shareable revenue to counties in 2018-19. “There are counties which face additional financial burden in providing services to residents,” reads part of the Strategic Plan. The CRA’s 2017-22 plan launched on Friday states the criteria in allocating funds will be based on the Urban and Cities Act, 2011 and Sections 174 and 175 of the Public Finance Management (PFM) Act, 2012. “It will provide strategic direction on how urban areas and cities can access additional funds.” The Urban and Cities Act, 2011 outlines provisions on classifying urban areas based on the population and services offered. A city should have a population of at least 500,000 people, a municipality at least 250,000 and at least 10,000 for a town. Some services they should offer, according to the Act, include traffic control and parking, water and sanitation, street lighting, health facilities, waste collection and management, learning institutions, five-star hotels and conference facilities.
