Kenya has uploaded all its budget information on the World Bank’s open budgets system called Boost. The portal is expected to create greater financial transparency on government spending. The World Bank said it cleans and verifies fiscal data uploaded to the platform before presenting it in a mode that can be understood by nonfinancial experts. The World Bank launched the platform in 2013 and since then, 21 countries have upload their budgets. Kenya is now the 10th African country to do so after Burkina Faso, Burundi, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Seychelles, Togo, Tunisia and Uganda. Other countries outside the continent are Armenia, Brazil, Guatemala, Haiti, Kiribati, Mexico, Moldova, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Solomon Islands and Uruguay. Kenya became the first African country to avail to the public its budget data in a single excel sheet in 2011. The data included budget information dating back to 2002. The move was in line with Vision 2030. Treasury PS Kamau Thugge told the Star in an earlier interview that uploading Kenya’s fiscal data on the World Bank platform will help increase citizen participation in the country’s spending. The data is already available on the World Bank’s website and the Treasury is set to add the Boost access link to its website. Aside from accountability and citizen participation, Boost can serve as an alternative source of spending data.
