In the Athi
basin, many species have crossed the Athi river and are now out of the Nairobi
Park. This seasonal movement out of the park happens during the wet season. For
thousands of years, large herds of wildlife have migrated across the
Athi-Kipiti Plains. In recent years, the ancient migration routes have been
severely throttled by the ever-growing developments. As little as 50 years
ago, wildlife migrations were virtually unrestricted. But now in 2018, the
situation has resulted in severe restriction of movements throttled by a maze
of farm fences, land development activities and the ever-growing greater
Nairobi Mega City of over 5 million people. Older
photographs indicate that as little as 30 years ago, very large herds of
wildebeest and zebra moved easily in and out of the area that is now called
the Nairobi National Park. Over the years, there have been many discussions over
whether to completely fence the area or leave it open. The recent news of a
number of lions being killed outside the park has prompted the Kenya Wildlife
Service to state that the park will be completely fenced on all sides. However, this is not the best solution. The conservancies and “sheep and goat” land
adjacent to the park are vital buffer zones for wildlife movement. The
ideal solution is to have a protected corridor that is monitored by wildlife
organisations. Effectively this translates to a park that is over 90 per cent fenced
with a narrow, controlled migration route in the south. So
now the challenge for all concerned is to secure the conservation zone and
ensure a corridor zone for safer seasonal movement of wildlife. Without a
migration corridor, the Nairobi National Park will effectively just become “a
green island in a sea of human development.”  The
park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00. For
