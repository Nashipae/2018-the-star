Police in Nairobi are looking for matatu crew who pushed a student out of a moving bus near Safari Park Hotel on Wednesday evening. The 21-year-old woman, identified as Doreen Mweti, succumbed to her injuries as she was being rushed to Neema Uhai Hospital along Thika Superhighway. The body was transferred to City Mortuary. The Githurai bus, KCC 021A, belongs to Zam Zam Sacco. Boda boda riders blocked the bus from leaving the scene. Kasarani police boss Robinson Mboloi yesterday said the conductor and his colleagues took off immediately, but “we’ll do everything possible to ensure they are apprehended and brought to book”. Peter Pekat, a good Samaritan who tried to save Mwetu’s life, said the crew had confronted the student. “I was driving behind the matatu at around 3.30pm. There was no blood at the scene of the accident, which means the lady might have died from internal bleeding. I decided to take her to Neema, but she died in my car. The police took the body,” he said. Mweti was from Meru but stayed with her sister near Safari Park. She was a student at Nairobi Institute of Business Studies, Kimbo campus, where she enrolled last month for an ICT course. Matatu Owners Association chairman Simon Kimutai yesterday condemned the incident. “That is criminal. We will not condone it. Each sacco has details of its staff. They should help with the probe.”
