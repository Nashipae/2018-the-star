Police yesterday seized 2,000 bags of contraband sugar in a warehouse in Eastleigh, Nairobi. The brown sugar was packed in 50kg bags and stored in a warehouse in Section Three of the suburb. Flying Squad boss Musa Yego officers acted after a tip-off. The consignment was from Brazil. The sugar was to be transported to Mumias and Kabras sugar factories for refining. Police are investigating how it ended up in the hands of unscrupulous traders who have been selling it to the public. Yego identified suspects behind the illegal business as three Somalis. “As you can see the sugar is branded not fit for direct human consumption but these traders have been repackaging it and selling to unsuspecting members of the public,” Yego said. Police also seized cans of cooking oil. The suspects are to be arraigned today. “We expect the goods to be destroyed under the instruction of the court,” Yego said. Last month, the government said it will win the war on contraband goods which have been denying the state millions of shillings in taxes. Trade CS Adan Mohamed said the war on contraband would be enhanced when he led the destruction of 400 tons of contraband sugar worth Sh38 million at the Mombasa port on May 12. Mohamed said importers of illegal goods have been using the courts to shield themselves from prosecution by delaying action against them. “Your days are numbered,” he said.
