The Kitui government has disbursed bursaries worth Sh110 million to more than 18,000 learners from poor families. The money was disbursed in two tranches. The first batch of Sh55.8 million for 9,200 beneficiaries was released in April. The balance was cleared on Thursday. Each of the 40 wards was allocated Sh1.27 million. The money is for learners in youth polytechnics, secondary schools, colleges and universities as well as children with special needs. Deputy county director for Education Mwenga Sammy said the programme is meant to reduce the school fees burden for parents. Mwenga spoke at Nuu market in Mwingi Central constituency where the bursary cheques were handed to parents. He said the money is expected to boost education standards by improving transition levels from primary to secondary schools through to colleges. “This is a noble initiative, which will reduce student dropout rates and improve transition from one level of education to another. Students from disadvantaged families will get equal rights to education,” he said. Mwenga said Kitui has lagged behind in national examinations for many years. He stressed on the need for radical interventions to reverse the trend.
