The bodies of a man and woman believed to be a couple were found in a tea plantation off Nairobi-Nakuru highway on Monday. Police said the victims died from deep wounds to their heads and that they may been killed elsewhere. The identification documents they found at the scene had the names Richard Ogeto Gichana and Kemunto Gichana. Resident Amos Kimani said plantation workers alerted officers after finding the bodies. "This is not the first time that bodies have been dumped in tea plantations in this area. It seems the people are murdered elsewhere," he said. “Previously, the bodies were dumped in Kinale Forest along the highway but those responsible have changed tack and are now using tea plantations." Lari OCPD Isaiah Odhiambo said investigations were on but that no arrests had been made. "Our CID officers have taken over the case and opened an inquest file,” he said. The bodies were taken to Naivasha Sub-county Hospital mortuary. Click here for the latest political news
