Drugs take over your brain, body and soul, basically your entire life, Tanzanian musician Rehema Chalamila, famously known as Ray C, has said of her addiction. She is now clean and believes anything is possible. “Addiction took three of the best of me. I was heartbroken. My brain was taken away by drug use. My brain was not working because there was something else in my brain telling me I could not perform on stage without drugs, that I could not do anything without drugs. I could not go anywhere without drugs, therefore I was a prisoner in my own soul.” Ray C spoke in Mombasa at an event to mark the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking. The day is observed on June 26 every year. Ray C urged addicts to seek help as drug abuse is a disease. “Wengi wanaoingia kwenye madawa, watu wanaathirika maini kwenye madawa, watu wanatumia sindano pamoja wanapata HIV, wanawake wanajiuza ili mradi aweze kupata pesa aweze kukidhi ule utegemezi wake,” she said. Ray C urged health officers to carry out more drug awareness campaigns. The singer's addiction hurt her singing career. Ray C said if she was able to overcome her addiction, then anyone can.
