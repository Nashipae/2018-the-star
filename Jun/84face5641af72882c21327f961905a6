Three clergyman of the Presbyterian Church of East Africa want members to discarded Kikuyu traditional rites that go against Christian norms. PCEA Uplands Parish minister Rev Mukundi Cheche told the faithful to shun “Mburi cia kiama” in which an individual gives sheep and traditional brew before being made a Kikuyu elder. He spoke on Sunday at PCEA Gitumba in Lari during a service for retired elders elders Muturi Matauwa and Waithaka Gathenji. Kahuho Parish minister Rev Njogu Thiitu and South Imenti’s Rev Joseph Mburu attended the event. The clergymen urged people to seek advice from church leaders. Cheche said God sent His son Jesus Christ to be crucified for the forgiveness of sins. Animal sacrifices and Christianity should not be mixed, he said. "Many of the people who give the animals for sacrifice are not well-informed of the traditional practice. "Let us pray for our members to come back and join us with a repentant heart. We shall accept them," Cheche said.
