Nyamira County has been losing an average of Sh1.16 million every month to 24 ghost workers, the ongoing human resource audit has revealed. This is according to a preliminary report released on Thursday evening by Deputy Governor Amos Nyaribo. The report states that the county has been paying 24 people yet they are not its employees. It includes a list of 24 officers said to be working with the county and a 25th individual who has not been profiled. The report also revealed that 32 out of 535 staff members, whose form four certificates were forwarded to the Kenya National Examinations Council for verification, had fake credentials. Nyaribo said it was likely that more fake certificates would be found. "We have 4,000 employees who must all be audited. We are sure more of such cases will be found," he said. As a result, 15 officers working in the payroll section were sent on administrative leave for 15 days pending the conclusion of the audit. The audit is being done by the Kenya Human Resource Audit, a private consultant, and is expected to run for the next one month. In a report in November 2016, the Auditor General questioned the expenditure of Sh86 million for renovation works and construction of a gate at Nyamira Level 4 Hospital. Edward Ouko's report said that the Nyamira government could not justify why it used Sh2.5 billion for the construction of the gate. The report for the 2014-15 financial year added that some Sh26 million was paid for renovation of the mortuary, kitchen, store and plumbing works.
