The department of fisheries in Nakuru county has expressed concern over increased cases of poaching around Lake Naivasha. The department, however, ruled out imposing a fishing ban on the lake despite a sharp drop in fish catch in three months. County fisheries director Mathew Ngila said hundreds of families rely on the lake. He said poaching and the use of undersize nets has hurt fish production. “At the moment we are not considering introducing the fishing ban but this can be introduced if the fish catch continues to drop,” Ngila said. He spokeon Saturday at a stakeholders’ meeting in Naivasha. Ngila attributed the current drop in fish catch to the rise in water levels. He said the fisheries department expects production to increase in the coming weeks. “If the ban had been introduced at this moment, it would have done wonders, but currently we don’t have the manpower and capacity to sustain the ban,” Ngila said. Lake Naivasha Boat Owners Association warned the lake is on its ‘death bed’ due to overfishing and pollution.Chairman David Kilo painted a grim picture warning it was a matter of time before the fish population got wiped out. He cited the year 2000 when the lake run out of fish adding that currently, fishermen are having a hard time due to the sharp drop in their daily catch. “Illegal use of undersize nets and seining has become the order of the day, hence the present crisis,” Kilo said.
