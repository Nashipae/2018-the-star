Former speaker Alex Magelo has criticised Senate Majority leader Kipchumba Murkormen over claims that people in the Office of the President were frustrating Deputy President William Ruto’s 2022 presidential ambitions. Magelo said the claims by the Elgeyo Marakwet senator were a show of disrespect to President Uhuru Kenyatta. He said Murkomen attacked “innocent civil servants” who cannot defend themselves against such accusations. “He should name the specific people frustrating Ruto’s presidential ambitions and not make blanket accusations,” Magelo said. “By accusing officers in the Office of the President, he [Murkomen] is attacking the President.” Magelo said the presidency is a symbol of unity and asked politicians to respect the office holder. He faulted politicians who have criticised the handshake between President Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga. Politicians allied to Ruto have developed cold feet about the handshake, saying it is aimed at blocking the deputy president from succeeding Uhuru. “We are enjoying peace because of the handshake. I wonder why some politicians are using it as a scapegoat. They are hiding behind the handshake to disrespect and falsely accuse others,” Magelo said. He supported Uhuru’s call for a lifestyle audit of civil servants, saying it is not a witch-hunt. He criticised those opposed to the call. “Why should people politicise the audit? It is something that should be supported by everyone because it is about fighting corruption,” Magelo said.
