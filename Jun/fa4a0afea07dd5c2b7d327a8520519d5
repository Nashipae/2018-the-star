Treasury CS Henry Rotich ignored MPs proposals to cut the budgets of state departments for the 2018-19 financial year. In the budget read out on Thursday, Rotich snubbed House recommendation to reduce the Judiciary’s budget by Sh2.5 billion. The Cabinet Secretary instead slashed it by Sh2.1 billion. MPs wanted the Judiciary allocated Sh14.8 billion down from the Sh17.3 that had been proposed. The Judiciary decried the budget cut, saying it will hinder its expansion plan. The Judiciary wants to set up more courts to accelerate delivery of justice. In his 2018-19 budget estimates, Rotich allocated Parliament Sh36.8 billion against MPs initial demand of Sh42 billion. Following fears Treasury could declined House demands, Budget and Appropriations Committee chairman Kimani Ichung’wa moved amendments on Wednesday to reduce the budget. Mps approved the amendment a day before Rotich tabled the budget estimates. Rotich allocated Sh6.3 billion for Senate affairs. The committee had requested for Sh6.4 billion. The CS also reduced development expenditure budget by Sh100 million. MPs wanted Sh2.7 billion. Parliament also wanted Sh6 billion for recurrent expenditure. Rotich gave it Sh5.9 billion. He also slashed Sh21.9 billion that MPs allocated for national legislation oversight and representation by Sh100 million. On Thursday, Rotich put governors on the spot over continued shrinking of revenue amounts, saying it had caused counties to rely heavily on the national government.
