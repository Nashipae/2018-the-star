Former Tana River Governor Hussein Dado and his wife have been sued by their former house help for unlawful termination of employment. Claimant Catherine Omwansa, who is seeking Sh350,000, says the couple did not pay her upon her termination in October 2012. Omwansa says in court papers that she was employed in 2009 for Sh4,000 a month, which she notes was below what she could have earned. Through her lawyer Jason Okemwa on Tuesday, Omwansa told Justice Onesmus Makau that Dado and his wife violated her rights to earn a good salary as required by labour laws. She noted that both parties had agreed that upon termination of her employment, she would get her 12 months’ salary. “I never received the one-month notice, a salary of Sh10,656.25, payment for annual leave for three years that amounted to Sh25,820,90, severance pay for three years which was Sh16,037 and 12 months’ salary compensation for Sh10,656,25 per year,” she said. Okemwa said the case was filed in October 2013 after the respondents declined to meet Omwansa's demands for unlawful termination. In his court papers, Dado acknowledged that he was the complainant's employer and that he had been the one paying her salary. He said he and his wife interviewed the claimant and found her suitable. “Contrary to what the claimant has submitted to the court, I paid Omwansa Sh8,900 per month,” the court papers state. The Governor, however, did not turn up in court for cross examination by the applicant’s lawyer and verification of the figures. The judge said Dado and his wife were to go to court. The case will be mentioned on September 18. Click here for the latest political news
