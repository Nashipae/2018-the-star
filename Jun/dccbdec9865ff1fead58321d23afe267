If you are going to get your breasts enlarged, then do it right, is Vera Sidika's opinion. She was commenting on June Wanza, who died at Nairobi Hospital weeks ago, where she was admitted
after developing complications from a botched breast enlargement surgery. Well, speaking to Word Is during the launch of her beauty parlour last Sunday, Vera said; "I read about the story in news and it feels really devastating...If
you want to do breast enlargement, then look for a good doctor, that
does not mean that our doctors here are not good, but my advice is go to
someone who has had probably like 20 years experience in that field,
someone who has done more than 10,000 patients." Vera went for a breast enlargement a few years ago. "Like I had mine done in the States at Beverly Hills and the doctor who did mine has 30 years experience and has done like tens of thousands of surgeries. That is someone who has experience and you walk to his office he has like people lined up waiting for the surgery. That means, the person is always in the act and they are doing the practical every other day." Adding, "When you go to a person who is just trying to get into the industry...this is Africa where we are blessed with big breasts and big sitting allowances, which means most people will not opt for surgeries because we are naturally blessed. In the States it is a rare thing because most people desire the look and the demand there is high as opposed to the demand here where a doctor you meet has probably done 10 surgeries since he started doing it so they don't have that experience to really trust them with your body." She continued, "My feeling is that she should have been more careful because that is a risk you are taking with your body and anything could happen. For someone who has great experience, that is something that should never happen."
