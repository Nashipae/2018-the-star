Kenya yesterday pushed up its foreign loan portfolio to Sh2.54 trillion with a new Sh47 billion loan from the French Development Agency. Visiting Director General of the French Development Agency RÃ©my Rioux signed the loan with the government in support of energy, water and transport projects and Kenya's public finance management. France is Kenya's second bilateral lender. One of the agreements was with KenGen managing director Rebecca Miano for a wind farm project in Meru county. The Sh7 billion soft loan will finance the construction of a wind farm with an installed capacity of up to 80 MW. The Kenya Electricity Transmission Company got a Sh10.9 billion loan. Funding will include the establishment of a control centre for Ketraco, a 400/132 kV substation in Makindu, which will improve network stability and additional funding for the Nairobi Ring transmission project. "Kenya is one of our main partners in the world. We are proud to celebrate 20 years of activities in Kenya in support of key development issues, mainly in the areas of infrastructure, climate change and private sector support,” Rioux said. The CEO also signed a Sh14 billion loan agreement with the government for the Mwache project, which is under the Coast Water Services Board. Co-financed by the World Bank, the project intends to end chronic water shortages facing Mombasa, increasing water production capacity from 50 million litres per day to 190 million litres per day, compared to current demand of about 150 million litres. AFD will also help Kenya Port Authority to finance the development of the port of Mombasa through a Sh11.6 billion non-sovereign direct loan. The agreements were signed at the National Treasury in the presence of the Treasury CS Henry Rotich, his Water counterpart Simon Chelugui and Charles Keter of Energy. Rioux also confirmed with the Kenya Airport Authority the allocation of a Sh70 million grant to improve KAA's strategic project management, infrastructure maintenance and financial modelling. AFD will also help Kenya improve public finance management with the World Bank under GESDEK — World Bank project Programme to Strengthen Governance for Enabling Service Delivery and Public Investment in Kenya. The project will also aim to promote the control of budgetary risks in devolution. AFD is celebrating 20 years of presence in Kenya this year.
