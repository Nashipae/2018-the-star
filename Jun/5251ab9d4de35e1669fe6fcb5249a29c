Clearing agents and importers are incurring huge losses transporting empty containers from the inland depot in Nairobi to Mombasa. They are spending up to Sh45,000 per trip to ferry the containers by road, failure to which they accrue demurrage charges. Freight industry players want efficiency. After cargo is delivered in Nairobi, the containers are returned to designated shipping line depots. Demurrage charges range Sh3,000-5,000 per day. Kenya International Freight and Warehousing Association (Kifwa) chairman William Ojonyo said cumulatively, the industry is losing at least Sh3 million per day on detention and storage fees. He spoke in Nairobi on Friday night during a stakeholders’ meeting. Transporting containers by the standard gauge railway is cheaper. It costs between Sh15,000 and Sh19,000 for a 40-foot container. However, most agents and importers prefer road transport. “When containers are transported by Kenya Railway Corporation, agents cannot tell when they will leave Nairobi or arrive in Mombasa,” Ojonyo said. Kenya Railways transports 600 containers per day to the inland depot, but takes 150 to Mombasa. Stakeholders who attended the meeting were Kifwa, Kenya Ports Authority, Kenya Revenue Authority, Kenya Ship Agents Association, Shippers Council of East Africa, and Kenya Maritime Authority.
