A film academy whose aim is to ignite and grow Africa’s creative industries into vibrant, economic centres has opened regional academies in Kenya and other countries. MultiChoice Kenya MD Eric Odipo said, “The African development story has long been defined by investment in many industries on the continent, leaving our creative industries to fend for themselves on the fringes of economic development for far too long. As a result, the film and television industries have not developed at the same rate as other industries on the continent, and not for a lack of talent, passion or imagination." Adding that, "We are abundantly blessed in these areas, however, the space given for this expression has at best been limited and at worst, been relegated to the fringes of the mainstream economy, leaving in its wake unfulfilled dreams, unexplored talent and stories that are yet to be shared.”
