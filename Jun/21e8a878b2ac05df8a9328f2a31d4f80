South Africa's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has found himself at the centre of a new race storm after he accused most Indians in the country of being racist. “[The] majority of Indians hate Africans. The majority of Indians are racist, and we must never be scared to say that they are racist," Malema said at a rally on Saturday. “I’m not saying all Indians, I’m saying the majority of them,” he added. Prominent radio show host Eusebius McKaiser hit back at Malema today, saying: "It is grossly unacceptable and irresponsible and I hope you get punished at the polls for this kind of racism." The chairperson of the South African Minority Rights Equality Movement, Daleep Lutchman, said the group would consider laying a complaint with police against Malema for "going back to the apartheid system of classifying people by race", the IOL news site reports. Leading journalist Ferial Haffejee said she was concerned about the "EFF's new campaign against Indians". "On Friday, Eid Day, a man on Twitter sent me a direct message saying I deserved a bullet and should just shut up. It's two of hundreds of online attacks that have happened after the anti-Indian campaign started," she wrote in a blog.  Click here for the latest political news
