Illegal structures around Moi Girls' school were demolished on Tuesday in a security operation which followed last week's rape incident. Police were forced to fire teargas to disperse traders who protested the demolition which saw over 200 structures pulled down. A trader said that that they were not notified of the demolition, hence their confrontation with the police and City Hall officials. An investigation into claims that three students were sexually assaulted at the school's dormitory is ongoing. Several suspects have been interrogated in relation to the same. Police have questioned 30 men - among them teachers, security guards, and male relatives of teachers living in the school compound - over the incident. The
men were also notified that they will undergo a mandatory DNA
examination. So far, 50 people had been interviewed by the police,
according to official accounts. Related: Did Moi Girls' School attempt to cover up rape incident? See: DNA tests ordered for Moi Girls' male teachers, workers amid rape probe Click here for more political news
