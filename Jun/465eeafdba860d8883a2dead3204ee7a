Mathare United are seeking to cut Gor Mahia’s lead to a point when they begin their second leg matches of the SportPesa Premier League against Nzoia Sugar away today at Sudi Stadium. Mathare ended the first leg with 30 points— four shy of Gor— after beating struggling Zoo Kericho 3-1. The slum boys will be without their head coach Francis Kimanzi, centre half Johnstone Omurwa and attacking midfielder Chrispin Oduor who are with Harambee Stars in the Hero Intercontinental Cup in India. In Kimanzi’s absence, assistant coach Salim Ali will man the touch-line for the second match having led his charges against Zoo Kericho last weekend. Mathare come into the match aware of the danger posed by the sugar millers, who demolished Dero FC 7-0 in the SportPesa Shield over weekend to subsequently book a place in the last 32. Nzoia are fifth with 26 points and boast of producing the leading top scorer Elvis Rupia who has netted 12 times in 17 matches. Should Mathare win, they will consolidate their second spot with 33 points—one adrift Gor as well as ease the pressure from third placed Ulinzi who have 28 points. Sofapaka will launch their second leg campaign against cash-strapped Chemelil at Narok, hoping to topple Ulinzi who sit above them courtesy of their superior goal difference. The 2009 league champions will have to do without the services of first choice goalkeeper and skipper Mathias Kigonya who was confirmed unfit for the match after returning late from Uganda. Chemelil on the other hand are placed tenth with 20 points and will aim to reduce the gap between them and ninth ranked Homeboyz to a point. Wazito begin life without talisman Pistone Mutamba who crossed to Sofapaka when they host Nakumatt at Camp Toyoyo. Wazito, under Frank Ouna sit 15th with 17 points —same as Tusker, who they beat 2-1 in their previous match.
