I have not been roaming around the country over the weekends without President Uhuru Kenyatta's knowledge. Deputy President William Ruto on Saturday told a gathering in Meru that President Kenyatta was aware of his movements. “Lakini Mheshimiwa Rais kwa ile ruhusa na amri umenipatia ambayo ulisema juzi mimi nafanya kila wikendi huko mashinani, kitongojini,Kijiini hata na huko kwenya vichororo nataka nikupatie report. Vile ulinituma inganwaje my friend Ndaragua hakusema, ile barabara ulitunituma kuanzisha pale Mathathari, Siakago, Ugweri hiyo barabara imeisha” (“The permission and command you gave me when you said that I love going to villages and alleys [politicking] every weekend, I want to give you the report though my friend Ndaragua did not say...that the construction of the road from Mathathari to Siakago to Ugweri is now complete.” Ruto said. His remarkes comes two days after Kenyatta threw a jibe at his deputy publicly accusing him of loitering across the country in weekend politicking. "Hii Kijana anaitwa Ruto unajua kila weekend anatangatanga kila pahali atakuwa anapitia hizi machoro choro mkiona kuna kitu inaenda kona kona mumwambie," Uhuru said.
