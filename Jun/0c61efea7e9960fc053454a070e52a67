The Kitui government on Monday signed a deal with South Eastern Kenya University to set up a livestock facility. Governor Charity Ngilu said her administration is committed to projects that will create jobs and improve residents’ income and livelihood. Ngilu said tapping the expertise, technology and knowledge at Seku will help solve the county’s problems. The deal was signed by Ngilu and Seku VC Geoffrey Muluvi at the governor’s boardroom. The programme is meant to improve the value and quality of Kitui livestock. Those expected to benefit directly are farmers, livestock keepers and merchants. “Kitui residents will submit their livestock to Seku for fattening to fetch better prices in the market,” the governor said. Ngilu added that the project will start immediately. Farmers will be trained on technology and animal husbandry. Other services to be offered to farmers in the project include informal training in garment and shoe making, mining and honey and milk production. Muluvi said Seku has the capacity to implement the project. He said the university would use modern techniques to help Kitui farmers. Muluvi said Seku is working with the African Development Bank to make the university an ICT centre of excellence. In February, Ngilu flew to India for a two-day conference on grains and pulses where she spoke of the “Ndengu Revolution”. Implemented with the Kenya Red Cross, Ngilu kicked off an ambitious programme of large-scale green gram farming to end perennial hunger. Ngilu was part of a high-level panel representing the East and Central African Region at the Indian Pulses Conclave 2018 in New Delhi. Temi Mutia, value chain specialist in the Office of the Governor, told the Star that Ngilu would appeal to India to lift the ban on ndengu from Kenya. The governor is keen to cement the county’s relationship with other large-scale green gram buyers. This year, Kitui is expected to harvest more than 15,000 tonnes of ndengu, despite poor rains.
