The agenda to build 500,000 low-cost housing by 2022 is now clear. On Friday Transport and Infrastructure, CS James Macharia unveiled how the government intends to implement the project starting with flagship projects that will be largely located within Nairobi city and its environs. The Government has defined four levels of housing types with only three being the focus of the program. The first type of housing identified is referred to as ‘Social’ and is targeted at people in formal employment earning a salary of less than KSh14, 999.

This category represents 71.82 per cent of Kenya’s formally employed workforce while the first category represents 2.62 per cent. The third category is called the Mortgage Gap and is targeted at those earning between Sh50,000 to Ksh99,999. This group represents 22.62 of the formally employed in Kenya. The fourth category of houses, which the government intends to have the private sector provide, is meant for the middle and high-income earners who get more than Ksh100,000 per month and who represent 2.85 per cent of the formally employed. The housing projects have been divided into five lots with one lot covered in each financial year. Each lot is then broken down into flagship projects, flagship social housing projects, counties and towns and Nairobi County projects. In the 2018 financial year, the Affordable Housing Program will focus on projects in Park Road, Muguga Green, Starehe A and B, Makongeni and more in Mavoko. The total number of units under this category will be 36,640. Another set of houses under the flagship social housing projects will cover Transitional housing, Kibera B, C and D, Mariguini and Kiambu. The total number of houses under this category will be 15,000 Another 67,800 new houses will be built in Bahati, Maringo, Ziwani, Jericho, Lumumba, Gorofani, Bondeni and Shauri Moyo.
