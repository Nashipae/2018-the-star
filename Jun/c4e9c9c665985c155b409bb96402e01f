Kenya Rugby Union has received a shot in the arm with the expected disbursement of Sh21m from the government. Speaking yesterday, Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Sports Peter Kaberia said the money is being processed and by the end of week, it will be in the union’s bank accounts. “The money has been approved a while ago but the issue of processing has been the problem,” said Kaberia. The latest amount brings the government’s contribution to Sh52m following a Sh31m initial grant sent in January as part of the pledge by government to cushion federations who had their sponsorship deals with SportPesa terminated. Details of how the money will be used was not established but sources reveal it will go to the preparations for the Kenya Sevens team ahead of he Rugby World Cup in San Francisco USA as well as the Rugby World Cup qualifier matches for the Kenya Simbas. The Simbas are slated to play Zimbabwe this weekend followed thereafter by a match against Uganda on July 7 as well as encounters against Tunisia and Namibia the same month. The monies could also go to operations at the secretariat on Ngong Road, which has endured dry coffers in the recent past. The disbursement of the monies was part of the agenda discussed at the by Sports Cabinet Secretary, Rashid Echesa and senior union officials on Monday. The monies will come as s big sigh o relief to the embattled federation which has been in the headlines for the wrong reasons following the sacking and later reinstatement of Kenya Sevens head coach Innocent Simiyu.
