President Uhuru Kenyatta has revoked the appointment of Mark Bor (pictured) as the non-executive chairman of the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) board after barely two months. Bor has been replaced by former Isiolo Governor Godana Doyo. The former Health PS previously served in a similar position at the Kenyatta National Hospital before he was transferred to the Eldoret-based MTRH in March. In a gazette notice, Uhuru appointed Constantine Kandie to the MTRH board. Both Doyo and Kandie will serve for three years. Their terms are renewable. Click here for more political news
