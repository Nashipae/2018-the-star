Buuri MP Mugambi Rindiki has said he will prioritise education in the use of CDF funds for the 2018-2019 financial year. The lawmaker said he will renovate schools, saying poor infrastructure had contributed to increasing drop out rates. "The environment is not conducive. I have noticed reducing student numbers in most schools. I think that is happening because of dilapidated structures," Rindikiri said. He spoke at Kieni Kia Ndege Primary School where he distributed Sh14 million for bursaries. Rindiki said it was shameful to expect students to get quality education from a school with structures built more than 50 years ago. "Some schools do not even have toilets. We need to rehabilitate these schools to improve education standards. To achieve this, we have decided to allocate 100 per cent of the CDF kitty for this year to education," he said. The MP donated Sh500,000 to be used to build toilets for school which has about 200 pupils.
