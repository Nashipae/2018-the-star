Despite a 28-24 win over Morocco in an Africa Gold Cup-cum-World Cup qualifier encounter over the weekend, Kenya Simbas' stand-in skipper Davis Chenge said their defence must improve ahead of their second match against Zimbabwe this weekend. Kenya started their campaign with the hard-fought victory away in Casablanca on Saturday, the first by a Kenyan team against the North Africans in their backyard. “Our defence on set pieces was not good and our alignment when defending rolling mauls or scrums must be better going forward,” said Chenge. Chenge said there were positives to take from the match which included the intensity shown in attack and defence especially when winger Edward Anya was sent to the sin bin with 10 minutes to go. “We dug deep especially when we were reduced to 14 men. The Moroccans attacked our line but we defended well and held out for the win,” added Chenge. Chenge expects a stern test from Zimbabwe in Kenya’s first home test of the season at the RFUEA grounds. “It will be a tough match. Zimbabwe and Kenya have similar style of play and they will come hard at us so we must be ready for what they are going to throw at us,” he observed. Winger Tony Onyango, scored a brace of tries with reserve prop Moses Amusala and scrumhalf Samson Onsomu scored try each for the Simbas. Flyhalf Darwin Mukidza kicked over four conversions for the side who trailed 10-7 at the interval. Chenge was happy with the intensity displayed during the encounter, saying: “We dipped against Uganda but today we battled hard until the final whistle and that bodes well for the team in our future qualifiers.” The team returns this morning and will have a one-day break before resuming training on Wednesday for the match against Zimbabwe.
