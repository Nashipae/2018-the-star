The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has urged counties to conduct lifestyle audits of their officers to establish those who have stolen public funds. EACC vice chairperson Sophia Lepuchirit on Thursday said the commission was finalising plans to audit the lifestyles of all government officers. Speaking during a two-day workshop for Kilifi executive members, Lepuchirit said the EACC was focusing on asset recovery. “In this regard, we are asking county governments to go ahead of us and conduct lifestyle audits of their officers. You need to investigate the wealth of your officers against what they earn and their allowances,” she said. Lepuchirit said some recently employed officers had turned into millionaires overnight. “There is no way you get a job when you have nothing and suddenly become an owner of estates and top-of-the-range vehicles. That is impossible,” she said. Kilifi Deputy Governor Gideon Saburi said they were committed to the fight against corruption. “That is why we invited the commission to train our executives and chief officers. We’ll not condone corruption in our offices,” he said. Saburi said there were allegations of graft in the county but no evidence had been found to back the claims. “We’re working closely with the EACC to ensure Kilifi is a corruption-free zone,” he said. Lepuchirit congratulated the county for becoming number one in the use of development funds. “It demonstrates that the county is on the right track. As the commission, we’re grateful to you for safeguarding public funds,” she said. Lepuchiri said the workshop was necessary and the commission will continue to sensitise state officers on the prudent use of public funds. “Prevention is better than cure. We don’t want to always make arrests,” she said.
