The National Assembly Public Investments Committee will propose that those who caused the delay in completion of the new Mombasa-Nairobi pipeline project be surcharged. The project that had a 2016 deadline is expected to be complete in one-and-a-half weeks with its cost jumping from Sh48 billion to Sh51.5 after the Kenya Pipeline company agreed to pay an extra Sh2.7 billion to the Lebanese contractor as settlement for delays allegedly caused by design variations and legal tussles. The committee members who toured the five pump stations on Friday said they will issue a report.
