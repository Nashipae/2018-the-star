The hearing of Sh1.3 billion graft case against former IEBC chief executive officer James Oswago and three others was put off yesterday until August 20. Milimani principal magistrate Felix Kombo of Anti-Corruption Court adjourned the case after former IEBC vice chairperson Lilian Bokeeye Mahiri-Zaja and other prosecution witnesses completed their testimony. In her evidence, the former vice chairperson said she does not know whether the procurement laws of Sh 1.3 billion tender for election material in 2013 was legally followed or not. Oswago is charged alongside former deputy secretary in charge of support services Wilson Shollei, finance and procurement director Edward Karisa and acting procurement manager Willy Kamanga. The four are charged with abuse of office and failing to comply with procurement regulations relating to electronic voter identification kits which failed during the March 4, 2013 elections. Led in her evidence by senior state counsel James Warui, the witness said she is not aware if the direction by plenary about adopting of an alternative solution of laptop-based devices to be used in general election was revised accordingly in the contract documents. She confirmed to the court that during the 2013 general election EVID did not function optimally not only due to technical or software issues but also because of late delivery by the contracted firm, deployment, inadequate training and insufficient charging of batteries. "These failures were mainly managerial human in nature as the commission had major challenges, with time being a major constraint in a tight electoral calendar," said the commissioner. Lillian informed the court that the EVID devices is a good technology that could go a long way in eliminating ballot stuffing and curbing electoral fraud, but it required adequate time, proper planning and proper management of the system for it to work effectively.
