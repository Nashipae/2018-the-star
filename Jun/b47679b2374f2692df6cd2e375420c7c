Former MPs from Mt Kenya have backed ODM leader Raila Odinga in the push for lifestyle audits ordered by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Led by former MPs Jamleck Kamau and Kabando wa Kabando, they noted the need to correct the wrongs of past generations. "It is time to call out those fighting the lifestyle audit for leaders and civil servants because this is the only to correct mistakes that have caused Kenyans to suffer," Kabando said during their press briefing on Wednesday. Kamau said the goodwill between the President and Opposition leader are important for Mt Kenya's future. "We had lunch with Raila today ... we must join the two leaders in nation building," he said. The leaders had a closed-door meeting with Raila at a Nairobi hotel. In a veiled attack against the DP on June 17, Raila said some people should not dare call for lifestyle audits. "You are dishing out cash. We know your salary. Don't ask for a lifestyle audit. We know the thieves," he said. Uhuru, Raila and Deputy President William Ruto have said they are ready for audit. The President ordered the National Intelligence Service to look into public servants, including him and Ruto. He said all state officers will be asked to explain the sources of their wealth and that all those found to have plundered public coffers will be punished.
