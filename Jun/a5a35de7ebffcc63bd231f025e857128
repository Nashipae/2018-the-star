Over the weekend Musalia Mudavadi called for a Commission of Enquiry into the sugar scandal. Right now politicians are making conflicting claims about contamination, supermarkets don’t know if they can sell sugar or not and sugar is being seized from warehouses, whether or not it is good or bad. There are multiple questions that need to be answered. Why did government allow the import of one million tonnes of sugar — duty free and without licences — in a four-month period last year? That is more than one year’s consumption of sugar in Kenya. How poisonous is the sugar on sale in Kenya? Is it allowable to transport sugar in bulk without first bagging it? Who should be allowed to import sugar? Are sugar estates still viable and how can we protect them? How much contraband sugar is coming into Kenya from Kismayu? An independent commission with a respected chairperson and acknowledged experts as members is the best way to get to the bottom of all these issues.
