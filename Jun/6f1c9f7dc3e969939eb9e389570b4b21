Communication Authority is hosting the 25th East African Communications Assemblies in forum to harmonise policy and regulatory frameworks in the region. Sector players from Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania and Rwanda will discuss how to promote development of broadcasting, postal and ICT services and ways to achieve fast, reliable, secure, affordable and efficient communications services within the EAC. “Harmonization of ICT policy and regulatory frameworks will position East Africa as a single investment market, and catalyze the realization of our region’s ultimate goal of political and monetary integration,” CS East African Communiity and northern corridor development Peter Munya said yesterday. The theme for this year’s EACO Assemblies is Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure for Inclusive Social and Economic Development, with discussions on technology trends and key issues in the communications sector. Some of the issues to be addressed include network development and regional inter-connectivity, harmonization of tariff structures and settlement of accounts, policy advise on issues relating to the communications sector and quality of service. “Our region requires massive investment in broadband to support the deployment of a wide range of innovative products and services that are largely being generated within the region,” CA director general Francis Wangusi said. He said EACO has commenced the establishment of a regional Database, which will serve as a reliable and sustainable source of information for informed decision-making process. “The region and the communications sector specifically needs data to inform further research, planning and investment decisions,” Wangusi said.
