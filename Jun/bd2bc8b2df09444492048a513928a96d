The court of appeal has upheld the High Court's decision that validated the election of Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu. The petition had been filed by former Kitui Governor Julius Malombe. The court said Malombe failed to prove before it that there were election malpractices during the August 2017 election. "The petitioner must first adduce evidence of the nature that would entitle him to judgement if the respondents did not adduce any evidence at all in the battle. "All in all we are satisfied that the Kitui gubernatorial election held on the 8 of August 2017 was conducted in accordance with the Constitution and legal principles and that the allegations raised against the said election do not meet the threshold for the nullification of an election," the court said.

He had filed a petition against Ngilu’s win at the High Court but it was dismissed on March 2, 2018. Malombe appealed the ruling on March 9 saying he was dissatisfied with the ruling of Justice Pauline Nyamweya that upheld Ngilu's win. He further argued that the ruling was delivered by a judge who had not been gazetted to hear the case. The March 2 ruling was delivered by Justice Mativo on behalf of Justice Nyamweya who was unwell.
