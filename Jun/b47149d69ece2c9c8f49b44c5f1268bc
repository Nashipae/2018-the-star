The boundary dispute between Nandi and Kisumu counties will be resolved by the National Land Commission, Nandi Governor Stephen Sang has said. Nandi claims seven towns in Kisumu were hived off from the county. The towns are Muhoroni, Kopere, Koru, Chemelil, Miwani, Kibigori and Kibos. The claims have been criticised by Kisumu leaders who accused Sang of stoking tensions. Speaking in Eldoret on Friday, Sang said the matter will be amicably sorted out by the NLC. He asked residents along the border to co-exist and live in harmony. “We have been neighbours for long and we will remain so. This is a matter that will be dealt with as per the laid down procedures and there is no need for panic or worry among our people,” Sang said. Interior CS Fred Matiangi engaged leaders from both sides in dialogue and asked elders to resolve border disputes. Chemelil, Muhoroni and Kibigori are perennial violence hotspots; often sparked by cattle rustling. Last week, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) said it would not be involved in the matter because it only deals with constituency boundaries. On Friday, Sang said NLC was involved in investigating historical land injustices and that its findings would be binding. During the meeting with Matiang’i, Sang and Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong’o agreed to promote harmony among communities living on the border of the two counties. Sang said peace was paramount for development to take place. “We have also engaged elders from both sides to ensure there is peace. Economic activities by both counties are going on as usual,” Sang told reporters. Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei and MPs from the region have supported dialogue to resolve the dispute.
