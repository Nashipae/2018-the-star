Team Kenya to the 2018 IAAF World Under 20 Championships in Tampere, Finland have stepped up preparations as they seek to better on their 2016 performances in Bydgoszcz, Poland. Head coach Robert Ngisirei said all the athletes have reported to camp save for World U18 1500m champion George Manag’oi, who has been given several days off following the death of his sister. However, the coach observed that this has not dampened their spirits as they gear up for the July 19-24. “We have given him time to go home to bury his sister. However, I gave him a training programme to follow while he is at home because the championship is just three weeks away,” Ngirisei said of Manang’oi. Commonwealth 3,000m steeplechase silver medalist Celliphine Chepteek and World U18, 800m champion Jackline Wambui, who represented Kenya Prisons at the national championships are also in camp. Chespol won the steeplechase in Bydgoszcz two years ago and went on to break the world U20 record one year later. In Tampere next month, she will aim to become one of a select group of athletes who have won back-to-back world U20 titles. “It is a full house here. We have just completed the morning training session and the athletes are in high spirits ahead of the evening session at Karura Forest. The evening training at Karura is for endurance especially for long and middle distance runners,” said the veteran youth coach. Meanwhile, coach John Njue has been roped in to train World U18 wlak race silver medalist Dominic Ndigiti while Caroline Kola will handle triple jumper Philip Musyoka. “We brought them to assist the two athletes because that is their area of specialization,” noted Ngisirei. Kenya is one of the most successful nations in the history of the World U20 Championships, having won 175 medals (72 gold, 62 silver, 41 bronze) since the inaugural edition in 1986. Coach Ngirisei is confident that Kenya will continue with their dominance in the championship.
