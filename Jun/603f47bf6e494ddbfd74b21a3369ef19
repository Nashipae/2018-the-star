June 22  Jurassic World:
Fallen Kingdom follows up in the aftermath of the disastrous ending of Jurassic
World (2015). After the dinosaurs take over the Jurassic World park, the island
is left abandoned for three years. A team of
soldiers go to the island to collect DNA samples from the remains of an Indominus
rex. They are attacked by surviving Mosasaurus and Tyrannosaurus rex. In their
hurry to escape, the soldiers leave the gate to the park open and the dinosaurs
escape. Meanwhile the
Senate holds a special hearing to decide the fate of the dinosaurs. Claire, who
worked at Jurassic World, is approached by an independent party who wants to
save the dinosaurs and give them a new home on a different island. Claire knows
that the task of rounding up the last surviving dinosaurs will be difficult, so
she enlists the help of former dinosaur trainer Owen Grady. The film is
definitely not as light and interesting as its predecessor. It has some dark
and scary moments that somehow end up being the highlight of the film. The
visuals and choreography are more detailed than the story itself. The film adds
nothing new to the franchise except working as the mule that ferries viewers
between an interesting prequel and what might be an even better final
instalment. But we can always count on Chris Pratt to save the day. At this
point, fans might watch the film because of Pratt and not because of the
dinosaurs, as it ought to be. Star rating: 3
