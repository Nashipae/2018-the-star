Amref Health Africa has called on the government to deploy a customer-centric distribution system of health insurance in order to achieve Universal Health Care.  The organisations Country Director in Kenya Meshack Ndirangu said the move would be most beneficial to the informal sector and will reduce administrative costs.  In a press statement to the Star, Njoroge said trusted agents such as Community Health Volunteers, M-Pesa agents, SACCOs and chamas can be powerful distributors for NHIF.  Commenting on the 2018 budget, he welcomed the move by the Government to reconfigure NHIF to align it to the Universal Health Coverage agenda.  “poor people who cannot afford to buy insurance premiums need to be identified and a budget allocated to them by the national and county governments while at the same time improving their economic status through actions in the other Big Four,” Ndirangu said.  In his Budget Statement, Treasury CS Henry Rotich said the fund will be reconfigured and the governance of private insurance companies will be reformed in order to align them to UHC.  He said in the next one year, the government will undertake a universal health coverage pilot in four Counties namely Kisumu, Nyeri, Isiolo and Machakos.  “The lessons learnt from the pilot in terms of capacity of NHIF, and the requirements on infrastructure, commodities and personnel will inform the roll out to all the counties in the subsequent years”.
