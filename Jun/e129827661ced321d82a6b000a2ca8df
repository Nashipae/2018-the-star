The Kenya Rugby Union board has reinstated Sevens head coach Innocent Simiyu. The move followed intervention by Sports Minister Rashid Echesa. In a statement to newsrooms on Monday, the CS said the decision was made at his meeting with board chairman Thomas Opiyo and CEO Ronald Bukusi. The meeting also resolved that the ministry wil work with KRU on pending salaries and allowances for the players. "In future, the federation will be consulting with the ministry before serious decisions are made," Echesa said. He noted that all parties agreed on the need for a successful rugby team. "They will go the extra mile to ensure this is a reality," he said. They also discussed preparations for the 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens tournament to be held in July in San Fransisco, USA. Simiyu was fired last week after reportedly taking responsibility for players who refused to display the Brand Kenya sponsorship logo during a game in Paris two weeks ago. Earlier on that day, Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala canceled a Sh20 million sponsorship deal between Brand Kenya and the Kenya Rugby Union. A furious Balala accused the union of not paying the Kenya Sevens players their allowances during the Paris Sevens earlier this month. As a result, they blocked the sponsors’ logo ‘Make It Kenya’ Read: Blow as Balala cancels Sh20 million Kenya Sevens sponsorship Also read:Kenya Sevens head coach Innocent Simiyu fired, Sh20m sponsorship revoked In their statement, the players said they loved the game and were honoured to represent Kenya, but that they needed better facilitation.
