A multi-agency team comprising officers from KEBS, KRA and DCI on Tuesday intercepted 1,350 sacks of suspected contraband sugar at Kanini Haraka enterprises in Nakuru town. The sacks of the brown Brazilian sugar were stocked at a shop at the central business district. Nakuru East Deputy County Commissioner Omar Salat said they are treating the consignment as suspect until they verify details of the contents. He said that samples have been taken for onward submission to the government chemist. "The samples of the netted sugar have been taken to the government laboratory and the results will be out in the next two weeks," Salat said. The multi-agency team also extended the raids to Menengai oil refineries limited where there are thousands of tones of suspected contraband sugar. According to Salat more sugar could be finding its way into the market within Nakuru town adding that they have intensified vigilance in all the 11 sub-counties. No arrests have been made so far. “The government will intensity raids in the area to crack down on illicit traders and their counterfeit goods. We do not want to risk lives of consumers in the county,” said Salat. The first consignment nabbed in Eastleigh was found with mercury and copper traces, according to findings from the Government Chemist. The consignment had 1,474 bags (50Kgs) of sugar, clearly labelled as not being suitable for direct human consumption.
