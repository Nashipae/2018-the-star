Residents of Busia have asked the government to identify contaminated sugar in the market so they can boycott the brands. Led by ODM chairman for Samia George Obola, residents of Funyula and Budalang’i on Friday said they were ready to boycott sugar consumption if it was putting their lives at risk. The government has over the last weeks impounded tonnes of sugar suspected to contain dangerous heavy metals and other contaminants. On Thursday, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i told MPs police have also impounded fertiliser, cooking oil, fruit juices and tomato ketchup suspected to contain heavy metals. Obola urged the government to educate wananchi to help them identify the contaminated foodstuff. “We do not want to risk our lives. We want the government to hold awareness forums to sensitise people and save lives,” Obola said. Everlyn Sakwa said she has stopped flavouring children’s porridge with sugar for fear of endangering their lives. Sakwa is an early childhood development teacher in Bunyala. ‘We’ve resolved to stop putting sugar in the porridge because we are not sure whether it is safe,” Sakwa told the Star. A wholesaler in Budalang’i who asked not to be named said sales ae low since the saga of contraband and poisonous sugar began. “I fear for my business. The government should help us identify the fake sugar to restore confidence in consumers,” he said. Matiang’i said sugar in the market has been certified as safe except that impounded. “I cannot vouch for sugar that is still in police custody,” he told the joint committee of the House.
