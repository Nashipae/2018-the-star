A crisis looms between the Laikipia county assembly and the executive over the appointment of eight chief officers and three executives. On Tuesday afternoon, the assembly had a heated argument over the officers. Members issued a two-week ultimatum to Governor Ndiritu Muriithi to forward their names for debate, failure to which they will pass a vote of no confidence in him. Ward representatives said the eight chief officers have been in office for close to nine months in an acting capacity, but have never been vetted and approved by the assembly. Led by majority leader Peter Thomi, they argued that the county government’s operations may be jeopardised, considering they cannot be summoned to answer some queries related to their dockets. “Did the assembly and the executive burnt the midnight oil trying to approve 2018-19 budget of Sh4.6 billion to be managed by people we have not vetted? People who are in office illegally?” Thomi asked. The MCA’s said the acting officers may embezzle public money or fail to perform their duties because no action can be taken against them. Tigithi ward MCA Mutahi Muritu and Irene Wachuka (nominated) said if the governor fails to respond, stern actions will be taken. The assembly was discussing a response statement tabled by the Labour, Social Welfare and Community Services committee over the status of the office holders.
