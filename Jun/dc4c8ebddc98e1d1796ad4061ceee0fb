A Baringo family, whose son was among five GSU officers killed in the Liboi IED attack, has renewed calls for withdrawal of KDF troops from Somalia. The family of Justine Kiprop, who was on patrol with his colleagues when their vehicle ran over a landmine on June 6, also wants to be compensated for the loss. They criticised the state for deploying fresh recruits to fight in the dreaded al Shabaab zones. "If the government can ignorantly send someone who is fresh from college right to the battlefield without any experience, what do you expect?" Joseph Makilap, one of the family members, asked. He spoke during the burial of the 22-year-old officer atÂ  Maregut in Barwessa on Saturday. Bartabwa MCA Reuben Chepsongol also called upon the government to consider withdrawing military officers deployed in Somalia. "The state should also compensate the families of those who have lost their lives in attacks in various parts of the country," Chepsongol said. The politician also called upon the National Police Service to deliver its promise of recruiting at least one family member to replace the deceased. After he graduated from Embakasi GSU training camp in  2016, Kiprop was selected to join the elite RECCE squad, popularly known for its swift operations and evacuation during distress. He was trained in VIP Protection, recognition and demolition of explosives, anti-terrorism among other specialised courses at Ruiru. Kiprop was eulogised as an obedient young man who had a promising future in the Kenya Police Service and also being depended upon by his family and the community at large. IED attacks are still commonplace at the Kenyan border with Somalia, much as the Kenyan security officers have repulsed a number of attacks in the region.
