Muslims came out in large numbers for this year’s Eid celebrations on Friday. In Mombasa, Governor Hassan Joho led the Muslim community in celebrating Eid at Ronald Ngala Primary School. He said he is committed to working with the national government. The celebrations came a day after he met President Uhuru Kenyatta during the official opening of the first phase of the Dongo Kundu Bypass. Addressing the press after Eid-ul-Fitr prayers Joho said, “We will continue to build unity like I have seen many other leaders [do].” He said Mombasa is a peaceful county, despite its diverse cultures, ethnicities and religions. Joho urged residents to shun tribalism. “We will walk the journey to achieve a Kenya free of tribalism and religious undertones. It is our responsibility as politicians to unite Kenyans,” he said. Joho was accompanied by Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir and other local leaders. In Kwale, Muslims held special prayers to celebrate the end of Ramadhan at various mosques across the county and gave donations to the needy. Governor Salim Mvurya and other leaders joined residents for morning prayers at Kongo Mosque in Diani. The county boss urged Muslims to practice the teachings of Ramadhan, which he underscored as the virtues of tolerance, patience, love, unity and peaceful coexistence with all Kenyans. “I want to emphasise the need to love one another and to coexist peacefully because it is the tool for achieving unity as spearheaded by President Kenyatta,” Mvurya said. He urged Kenyans to live peacefully with one another irrespective of their religious or ethnic affiliations. Mvurya urged Muslims to remain steadfast in prayer and submit totally to Allah’s will. “We must take advantage of this spiritual rebirth and seek to unite the country,” he said.
