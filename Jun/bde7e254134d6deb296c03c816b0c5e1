Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o has appointed a new chief of staff. Joseph Omondi’s employment took effect from Wednesday, according to a statement by the governor’s press unit. He was a mathematics and statistics lecturer at Masai Mara University. The decision comes after Nyong’o terminated the contract of chief of staff Patrick Ouya on grounds of gross misconduct. The county boss, in a letter on Tuesday, said the officer was found in breach of Article 75 of the Constitution and Section 40 of the County Governments Act. “Hand in all the county property and equipment in your possession to the county secretary,” the letter read. The police grilled Ouya over threats to Nyong’o’s life after he was taken to the Kisumu Central police station. “The officer recorded a statement and left the station,” County commander John Kamau told the Star on phone. Ouya was accused of threatening to shoot the governor and Deputy Governor Mathew Owili. Nyong’o, through his press team led by director Aloice Ager, said the altercation occurred in his office on Tuesday morning. He said Ouya, “in an unexplained and unwarranted fit of rage”, accosted his security personnel and attempted to forcefully gain entry into his office. This took place as a meeting with “very important guests” went on, he said, adding Ouya threatened to shoot everybody. Ouya dismissed the claims as untrue. “There was nothing like that. All those are lies,” he told the Star on the phone. The former county officer said he went to work as usual and met Nyong’o’s bodyguard who followed him into his office where they “argued for a while”. The argument concerned claims Ouya had plotted to have the county chief impeached. “The body guard left and after 15 minutes came with police officers who ransacked my office and found no gun,” he said. “We went to the station. I explained everything and left so these are just lies. I had not seen the governor. I went straight to my office.”
