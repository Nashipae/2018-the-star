Bomb experts on Monday visited the site of the FlySax plane that killed eight passengers and two pilots at the Elephant Peak in the Aberdare Forest. Forensic examiners from the DCI headquarters also visited the scene of the accident in search of clues. Njambini DCI officers have started investigations into the crash. After hours of searching the wreckage, the bomb examiners concluded their investigations and reported no traces of explosive materials. The forensic examiners collected samples, incluing soft drink bottles to have tests on any consumbale materials found at the scene. More samples will be picked from the bodies of the killed people during the postmortem. Highly placed sources told the Star the samples will be analysed to rule out a possibility of foul play. “We must rule out the possibility that the pilot and captain were not drugged leading to the crash,” the source said. Kenya Civil Aviation Authorty officials are expected to join the investigations. A team from the KCAA toured the site on Monday but failed to access the wreckage of the plane because of bad weather. The FlySAX plane, registration number 5Y-CAC, was on its way to JKIA from Kitale airstrip in Trans Nzoia. It lost contact with the JKIA control tower at 5pm on Tuesday last week. A search and rescue team was mobilised by the KCAA, the Kenya Wildlife Service, Aircraft Accident Investigation Department and the Kenya Air Force. On Thursday, the wreckage of plane was sighted at 6.45am by the aerial search team at Elephant Point, some 11,000 feet above sea level. None of those on board survived. The pilot of the ill-fated aircraft, Captain Barbra Wangechi, will be laid to rest tomorrow at her family farm in Kiambu county. Others on board were co-pilot Jean Mureithi, Robinson Wafula, Khetia Kishani, Ahmed Abdi, Karaba Muiga, Matakasakaraia Thamani, Matakatekei Paula, Pinuertorn Ronald and George Ngugi.
