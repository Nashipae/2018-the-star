Kisumu Planning CEC Richard Ogendo was arrested on Monday over allegations of assault on his chief officer Margaret Ouma. It is said the two clashed over procurement issues at the county government way back in April, leading to a confrontation from which the chief officer claimed she was assaulted in the process. Kemunto Onsongo, the official's lawyer, said her client was summoned over the assault claim and was released on a police bail. Police are yet to prefer charges against Ogendo. Margaret had been suspended by Governor Anyang' Nyong'o. She was sent on a 90-day compulsory leave on grounds of misconduct while performing her duties in office.
