City Hall employees will today hold demonstrations to protest a proposal to exclude their house allowances from pension payments.The proposal in contained in the County Pension Scheme Bill, 2017 that is currently before the National Assembly.The bill also wants counties prohibited from deducting more than 30 per cent of workers pensionable income.The Kenya County Government Workers Union (KCGWU) has termed the bill draconian.In a notice signed by all three Nairobi branch secretaries, the union has notified City Hall of members planned demonstrations. The notice was issue on June 4. It was signed by Boniface Waweru of Nairobi Staff branch, Benson Oliang’a of Nairobi City branch and Matilda Kimetto of Nairobi City Water branch.“The purpose of this letter is to notify you that members of the union and all the pensioners shall assemble, demonstrate, picket and present petitions to various authorities,” the notice says.The workers said exclusion of house allowance from their pensionable income will mutilate their terms of service. Their Collective Bargaining Agreement classifies house allowance as part of the salary, making it pensionable.“The bill wants to change the pension scheme from occupational to a public one,” the union said.KCGWU said limiting members deductions will reduce them to paupers upon retirement because it will result in inadequate pension.“The bill seeks to give control of workers’ funds to the National Treasury yet the funds belong to employees in the county governments and associated water companies,” the union said. The bill wants county government workers to join a new umbrella pension scheme that will replace the Local Authorities’ Provident Fund.“Contributions by and in respect of an employee shall cease to be payable from the day he/she reaches his/her retirement date or from any earlier date upon which he/she ceases to be a member of the scheme,” reads the bill.The union said the bill does not give clear provisions on transition to the new scheme. It does not provide guidelines on how the Sh30 billion owned by county governments in the Lapfund will be settled. The union wants the bill withdrawn pending further consultations on the contentious provisions.“We want to make it so big that employees in the other counties will follow suit,” Kimetto told the Star on the phone yesterday.
