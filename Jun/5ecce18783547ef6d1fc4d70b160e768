Suspects in the Sh468 million NYS scam yesterday renewed their bid to be freed on bail. They told Justice Hedwig Ongâ€™udi that their incarceration is humiliating and unconstitutional since the charges they face are bailable. The suspects, including former PS Lilian Omollo and former NYS director general Richard Ndubai, will however wait until June 19 for a ruling. Anti-Corruption Court chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti declined to release them on bail a fortnight ago. He instead asked the prosecution to speed up the trials.
