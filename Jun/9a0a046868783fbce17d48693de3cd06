Police in Kilifi have impounded 86 tonnes of what they believe is contraband sugar that was being transported to Garissa County. A truck with 650 50kg bags was intercepted at Kijipwa roadblock on Wednesday night and another with 600 bags of the same capacity seized at the same place on Thursday night. They were taken to Kijipwa police station. Police boss Fredrick Ochieng said the sacks did not have the quality mark by the Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs). He said that police were on high alert, especially with the transportation of goods at night. “They are doing a good job at roadblocks. The drivers of the trucks were travelling in the dead of the night,” Ochieng told reporters on Friday. Officers from the Kenya Revenue Authority and Kebs manned the trucks pending testing and verification of the product. Documents seen by the Star show the sugar was imported from Brazil in August last year. “The sugar was shipped to the country last year. The documents indicate that it was tested and verified on August 31 last year," said a Kebs officer who sought anonymity.

We will take samples to test if this is contraband or not. We can’t let it go without ascertaining if it’s fit for human consumption." The documents state, however, that sugar was transported from the warehouse on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. The officer added: “There is only an entry order but the quadruplicate is not stamped. These trucks will not leave this place until we clear them." Customs officers are investigating the authenticity of the clearance documents that were used to transport the goods.
