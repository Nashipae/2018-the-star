Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka has asked the two levels of governments, their agencies and the public to seek recourse through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. This approach is quicker and cheaper, he said on Thursday during a Senators' breakfast meeting with the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (K) and Centre for Alternative Dispute Resolution. “Kenyans must be made aware that litigation is not the only solution to disputes. Going to court is no longer sustainable therefore we need to educate the masses on ADR,” he said. "Protracted court cases, between national and county governments and frivolous electoral petitions for instance, have redirected millions of shillings that could have been used for development.” At least 277 cases were filed at the end of the general election that took place on August 8, 2017. Some have only just been concluded.

Article 159 (2) (c) notes forms of dispute resolution including reconciliation, mediation, arbitration and traditional mechanisms. "It needs not be fashionable anymore to say 'Let’s meet in court'," she said. Kipchumba Murkomen, who is Majority Leader and Elgeyo Marakwet Senator, said that while examining the legal and policy framework of ADR, mechanisms for mediation within counties should be considered. “This had not been envisioned because the focus has been on intergovernmental ADR,”  Murkomen said. Minority Whip Mutula Kilonzo Jr (Makueni), Rose Nyamunga (Nominated), Cleophas Malala (Kakamega) and Sylvia Kasanga (Nominated) were among those who attended the meeting.
