The Kenya Urban Roads Authority has said it’s not to blame for Outering Road flooding and crime at Taj Mall roundabout. Kura’s communication director John Cheboi said yesterday the authority should not be blamed. “Insecurity around Taj Mall has been there even before we started upgrading the road. In fact, our contractors have not installed lights because of the same issue,” he said. “If we had installed the lights first, maybe the same thugs terrorising people would have stolen them.” He said poles for the lights have been erected. Installation of streetlights will be among the last tasks undertaken. Motorists have complained about the increasing number of armed thugs at the underpass tunnel in the area. They have said it has become a hideout for highway robbers. Last week, police arrested 15 suspects. Embakasi deputy county commissioner Jackson Letangule the operation will continue until the robbers are flushed out. “The 15 people are held at Embakasi police station and are helping police with investigations as the crackdown continues,” Letangule said on phone. Cheboi said contractors are still working on the drainage. “The rains were heavy and the contractor could not open up the drainage system at that moment,” he said. Cheboi said the authority was working on 11 footbridges for the 13 km stretch from GSU headquarters in Ruaraka to Taj Mall on North Airport Road. “We are working to complete the project by July 14. It is more than 90 per cent complete,” he said. The Sh8 billion expansion,launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta in January 2015, was to be completed in September last year but there were delays in compensation and relocation of services such as water supply. The road has been upgraded to a dual carriageway
