The ban on gaming machines will stop many families from falling apart, Embu Chambers of Commerce chairman Samuel Kanyi said on Friday. He said many couples have been fighting over money, with women accusing their husbands of wasting their families’ resources on gambling. Interior CS Fred Matiang’i on Wednesday ordered a crackdown on all gaming machines. He ordered the police to destroy all unlicensed premises. Matiang’i blamed gambling for the rise in crime. “Matiang'i has saved the people of Embu from a lot of problems. We applaud the move and would urge that the ban remains permanently in place,” Kanyi said. He said women had been lured into gambling with the promise of making quick cash. Many ended up losing their savings, the official said. Kanyi said gambling machines had been placed in every premises in rural areas, estates, shops and verandas. “These things were spoiling our children and causing conflicts in homes,” he said. He said children were forced to steal from their parents to raise cash for gambling. Families have often missed breakfast due to gambling. “Those sent to the shops are tempted to gamble with the money. They often end up losing it,” he said. Kanyi asked Matiang’i to extend the ban to licensed gambling machines. “They should be restricted to bars only,” he said.
