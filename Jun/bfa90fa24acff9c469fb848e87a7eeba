Divers have retrieved the body of a fisherman believed to have died when their boat capsized in Manda Maweni, Lamu, on Friday. Jefwa Ngombo, 45, was among five fishermen whose boat was toppled by heavy tides. Three colleagues were rescued. The body of Rumlas Munga, 25, was recovered hours after the tragedy. Lamu West police boss Juma Londo said Ngomboâ€™s body was recovered by marine police on Sunday. "The body had been caught up in a fishing net which we suspect made it impossible for the victim to swim to safety," Londo said. The bodies have been taken to Kilifi and Malindi for burial. Survivors were identified as Safari Katana, Safari Baya, and Mwatari Kahindi. Click here for the latest political news
