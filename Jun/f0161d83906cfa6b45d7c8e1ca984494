A twenty five year old barber has allegedly murdered his 58 year-old lover in Kinungi village of Naivasha. The suspect first strangled the elderly woman before stabbing her six times and fled. The body of the mother of seven was discovered by members of the public lying on a bed in the suspect’s house on Sunday morning after missing for three days. Emotions ran high as police moved in to collect the body. A manhunt for the suspect is ongoing. According to James Kabono, a cousin to the deceased, the two had a relationship for a long time. Kabono said his cousin went missing on Thursday last week and effort to trace her had been fruitless. “We decided to check on the suspect’s house and we found it locked and on breaking in we found the body lying in bed and covered in a blanket,” he said. Area chief Michael Ng’ang’a said the whereabouts of the suspect remained unknown but was confident that police would catch up with him. “The two were lovers for a long time but no one knows what transpired leading to this brutal murder,” said the chief. Meanwhile a middle aged man was hit and killed by a speeding motorist along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway on Saturday night. A witness James Karanja said the man was allegedly drunk when he was hit by the car that was heading to Nairobi from Nakuru.
