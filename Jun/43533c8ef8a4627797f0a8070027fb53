Captain Barbra Wangechi was eulogised yesterday a charismatic woman in an emotional funeral service held at the St Paul’s catholic Church in Nairobi. Wangechi, 29, died last week following a plane crash in the Aberdares. Her fiancee Austin Mbalo was too distraught to talk. The two had been dating since 2016 and were preparing to tie the not soon. Wangechi’s parents Jonathan Kamau and Marrie Njeri said the last 10 days have been the darkest in their lives. Njeri said she remained hopeful of meeting her daughter even after news broke the plane had gone missing. “We remained hopeful until we received the terrible news that completely shuttered our hopes,” Njeri said in a speech read on her behalf by her sister.  She thanked Mbalo saying he was a good fiancee who made her daughter’s life lively. “Thank you Austin for making my Barbra the happiest woman,” she said.Ushers wore black dresses and purple scarfs with purple pinned corsages as tribute to Wangechi. Purple was her best colour. It was the first time the family spoke since the tragedy occurred. Barbra was the pilot of the FlySax aircraft that was flying from Kitale to Nairobi. Ten people died including eight passengers and co-pilot Jean Mureithi. Barbra was an IT graduate for United States International University in Nairobi. She later pursued a two-year postgraduate training in aviation in South Africa. She has been a pilot since 2014. FlySax director George Kivindyo said Barbra was a fighter and a great flier. “She was one of the senior captains,” Kivindyo said.
