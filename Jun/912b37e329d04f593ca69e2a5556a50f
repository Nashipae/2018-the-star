Two police officers linked to the murder of Janet Waiyaki at Nairobi's City Park will be charged at the High Court on Monday. Constables William Chirchir and Godfrey Kirui were with three others on the morning of May 21, when the businesswoman was killed, but they were the only ones who fired at her. They both discharged 15 bullets from their AK47 rifles, killing Waiyaki on the spot and injuring Bernard Chege who was with Waiyaki. All the officers and Janet's husband George Kirumbi recorded statements at Gigiri police station. Nairobi police boss Joseph Ole Tito said the officers shot at the car because out of suspicion as it remained parked in a thicket for too long. National Police Service spokesman Charles Owino said the shooting may have occurred because the opolicemen were not from the area. Waiyaki was buried at her home in Murang'a county on May 31 while Chege was treated at Avenue Hospital in Parklands.
