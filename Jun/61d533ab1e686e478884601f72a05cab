Sergio Aguero gave the South Americans the lead in the 19th minute with a brilliant finish on the turn from 12 metres.  But Iceland, the smallest-ever country by population to qualify for the World Cup, equalised four minutes later when Alfred Finnbogason swept home a loose ball from close range.  Argentina were awarded a penalty in the 64th minute for a push in the back on Aguero by Hordur Bjorgvin Magnusson but Messiâ€™s weak effort from the spot was saved by goalkeeper Hannes Por Halldorsson.
