The MP who appeared before the Milimani Anti-Corruption Court chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti is charged alongside lawyer Kennedy Begi Onkoba. They were arresed on Friday and detained. The suspects will spend another night at Kileleshwa police station pending a ruling on bond application this afternoon. The magistrate ordered them to be remand in custody to enable him write his ruling on their bail application after prosecution led by senior state counsel Joseph Riungu opposed the defence bail request.
