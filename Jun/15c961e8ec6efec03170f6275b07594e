Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago wants public servants to work on contract to keep them on their toes. Mandago said permanent and pensionable terms of employment in government encourage laziness among civil servants. The governor said MPs should introduce reforms through Parliament so all public servants work under contract, failing which the wage bill will not be manageable. Mandago said, “The National Assembly should amend legislation that will help us address problems concerning terms of employment in the public service.” He spoke in Eldoret on Sunday. The governor also proposes the retirement age to be set at 50 years. Mandago said the decision to increase the retirement age to 60 years was unwise and costly. “Under the current terms persons who are unproductive cannot be replaced, meaning they have to sit there until they attain 60 years. Setting the retirement age at 50 will help us solve the youth unemployment problem,” he said. The governor said counties are facing problems of ballooning wage bills because they are forced to implement salary increments agreed through CBAs even in the middle of a financial year, when the money is not available. Last month, religious organisations called for the reduction of elected state officers and constituencies to lower the wage bill. They said constituencies should be slashed from 290 to 150 and counties reduced from 47 to 16. “The counties should be clustered into viable economic blocs,” Ufungamano-Joint Forum for Religious Organisations secretary general Charles Wambugu said. In December last year, the former chairperson of the SRC, Sarah Serem, raised a red flag that while the wage bill stood at Sh627 billion in 2016-17, it was expected rise to Sh650 billion in 2017-18.
