The government has been urged to compensate residents affected by the Malindi airport expansion.
Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa (pictured) on Sunday said there is an outcry from 240 families whose land has been identified for Phase 1B of the project. She said they are unable to carry out any development project. Jumwa said many houses are leaking.
She urged DP William Ruto to intervene so residents can get their money and move away.  Ruto promised to resolve the compensation issue in three months.
 Jumwa said efforts to get answers from the National Land Commission and the Transport CS have been unsuccessful.
