Leaders from Western have condemned rampant corruption cases in which Kenyans have lost billions of shillings. ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna, Kwanza MP Ferdinand Wanyonyi and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development secretary general Mukhisa Kituyi said corruption is painting a bad image of Kenya globally and locally. The leaders said graft should be declared a national disaster and urgent measures taken to curb it. They spoke on Saturday in Ndivisi, Bungoma East. The leaders asked the institutions mandated with fighting corruption to ensure those implicated are arrested, charged and jailed. Kituyi said any leader found guilty of looting public funds should not be cleared to run for any political seat. “Let us not victimise a few individuals and let the big fish go scot-free,” he said. Sifuna said all those implicated in the National Youth Service, National Cereals and Produce Board, Kenya Power and scandals in other institutions should be held accountable. He said maize farmers who were laughing at cane growers now feel the pain of corruption. Wanyonyi said corruption has made a lot of people suffer unfairly and it is time strict measures are put in place.
