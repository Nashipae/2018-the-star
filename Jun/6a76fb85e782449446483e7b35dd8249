Kisumu residents want Governor Anyang Nyong’o to step up the war on corruption to improve services. Led by Residents’ Voice Association chairman Audi Ogada, they praised Nyong’o’s crackdown and urged him to clear his team of those hell-bent on looting. "As we appreciate action taken so far, we want him to honour the promises he made. Accountability and transparency must reign in his government," Ogada said. He told the county boss to conduct an assets and liabilities audit to recover looted property. Ogada said the previous administration should be investigated.
