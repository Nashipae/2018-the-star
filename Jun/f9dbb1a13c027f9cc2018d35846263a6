    Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has been told to nominate another person as his deputy. MCAs yesterday declined to vet Sonko's nominee, lawyer Miguna Miguna. Speaker Beatrice Elachi said the Assembly could not debate Miguna's nomination for the Deputy Governor's position because he was a dual citizen. As such, Miguna is not eligible for election or appointment to a state office under article 78 of the Constitution. That law limits election or appointment to a state office to Kenyan citizens only. “Under Standing Order number one of the House, the name of the nominee is to be referred back to the appointing authority for further validation,” Elachi said. Elachi said Miguna's nomination had raise concerns both within and beyond the assembly. “It is a matter of public interest that the nominee in question is still in court seeking his right to acquire a Kenyan citizenship,” Elachi said. “In the above regards, members are not in a position to debate the nominee,” Elachi said. Sonko nominated Miguna as deputy governor on May 16. The move sparked mixed reactions from different political quarters. Jubilee MCAs said they would reject the appointment, saying Miguna was not a member of the party.
