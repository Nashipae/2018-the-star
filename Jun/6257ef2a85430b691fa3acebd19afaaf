Education CS Amina Mohammed on Saturday appointed a nine-member interim board to oversee the management of Moi Girls School in Nairobi. The team is made up of senior officials drawn from the ministry and the Teachers Service Commission. The school board and the Parents Teachers’ Association were dissolved on Tuesday over rape allegations at the institution. A student claimed she was raped by an unknown assailant on Friday last week while two other students said they were assaulted. The school principal Jael Mureithi opted to resign on Tuesday over the issue. TSC replaced her with Deputy principal Florence Omusula in an acting capacity.
