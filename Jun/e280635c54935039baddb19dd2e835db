Nyeri doctors have been urged to welcome their Cuban counterparts. Governor Mutahi Kahiga on Friday said the county will get two doctors, a family doctor and a kidney expert. He said the county is ready and prepared to accommodate the medics so they can help residents. “If you find me giving the Cuban doctors a vehicle to take them from Nyeri to Karatina or any other hospital, please understand,” Kahiga said. He said the expats will need to travel and offer services in far-flung hospitals from time to time, but will mainly base in Nyeri town. “We may take them to Mukurweini for a day and another hospital on another day,” Kahiga said. The national government has hired 100 Cuban doctors. It will pay their salaries while counties are to house them. “Housing them would mean getting them a furnished apartment. Because they are here to serve our people, that is the least we can do,” Kahiga said. One Nyeri doctor is in Cuba on an exchange progamme to upgrade skills and services. .
