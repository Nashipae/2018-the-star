Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua (pictured) got a reprieve yesterday after the Supreme Court halted his removal from office pending the hearing and determination of an appeal. Chief Justice David Maraga, in orders read on behalf of four other judges, restrained the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission from conducting elections in the county. The court also barred speaker Florence Mwangangi from assuming the governor’s office. Mutua’s election was nullified by the Court of Appeal on June 8. “There shall be a stay of the execution against the judgment of June 8 pending the hearing and determination of the case,” Maraga said. The Court of Appeal said Mutua’s election failed the constitutional test of verifiability and that his declaration as the winner had no legal basis. Mutua said the judges failed to balance competing constitutional rights to vote and to be elected.
