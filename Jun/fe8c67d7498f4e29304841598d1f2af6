The Busia assembly yesterday unanimously passed the Sh7.1 billion county budget after amending it. The 2018-19 estimates were tabled by the Budget and Appropriations committee chairman and deputy speaker Lawrence Okaale. It included Sh5.9 billion for equitable share, Sh728 million conditional grants and Sh452 million local revenues. Development projects will have 37 per cent and the rest for recurrent expenditure. Sh875m has been allocated to ward projects, each electoral unit getting Sh25 million. Speaker Bernard Wamalwa picked the new committee to complete the budget process after the disbanded John Obwogo-led team moved to court to block their colleagues from taking over. Governor Sospeter Ojaamong won the hearts of the majority of MCAs after he declined the Sh45million allocated for construction of a governor residence. He wrote to the committee to have the money moved to the Health and Sanitation department â€” Sh35 million to build a modern mortuary and Sh10million to hire more health staff. The assembly increased its budget from Sh690 million to 728 million. Of this, Sh30 million will be used as revolving fund and Sh8.1 million for employing staff.
