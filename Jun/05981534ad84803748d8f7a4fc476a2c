The Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya has said it fully supports the vetting of procurement officers and the lifestyle audit for public servants ordered by President Uhuru Kenyatta. They, however, want it carried out through the legal framework, in a fair and transparent manner. ICPAK says the measures ordered by the President are timely, considering the high level of corruption that threatens to ruin the country’s economy. “We fully support the President and the timing of these initiatives cannot be gainsaid, given the ceaseless depressing news on high level corruption in the country,” ICPAK chairman Julius Mwatu said in Eldoret on Saturday. Uasin Gishu Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno presided over opening of the new ICPAK branch in Eldoret. Mwatu termed the process as noble but said the institute wants it to be guided by the Constitution, international best labour practices, natural justice and all the other existing laws regulating employer-employee relationship “We must guard against turning this well-meaning process into a witch-hunt expedition,” Mwatu said. He was with among others the vice chairperson, Rose Mwaura, and CEO Edwin Makori.
