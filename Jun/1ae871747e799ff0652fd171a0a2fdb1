Pressure is mounting on President Uhuru Kenyatta to sack Health CS Sicily Kariuki over the Sh9 billion National Youth Service scandal. Five MPs yesterday demanded Kariuki be fired because she was at the helm of the youth docket when NYS lost billions of taxpayers cash in dubious deals. Speaking at Parliament Buildings yesterday, MPs Tindi Mwale (Butere), Sylvanus Osoro (South Mugirango), Abdikadir Osman (Fafi), Bashir Abdullah (Mandera North) and Moses Kirima (Central Imenti) said she should “join her colleagues at Lang’ata Women’s Prison”. The lawmakers told Uhuru not to apply double standards in the war on corruption by going only for the small fish and letting the fat cats go. "Sicily Kariuki should take personal responsibility and step aside. She was mentioned in the Health ministry scandal and nothing happened. She must be tried," Osoro said. Kirima said it was not possible for Sh9 billion to be looted from a department in any ministry without the Cabinet Secretary’s knowledge. Click here for more political news
