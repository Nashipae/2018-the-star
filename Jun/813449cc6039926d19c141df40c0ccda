Government is undertaking an audit of uncompleted CDF projects (see P7). The Constituency Development Funds provided to each MP since 2003 have undoubtedly helped to spread development resources to where they are most needed. Some MPs are well known for their good work with CDF money - for instance, Peter Kenneth's projects in Gatanga or Yusuf Hassan's bursaries in Kamukunji. Yet there are also horror stories: the unwanted mud hut classroom that lies empty; the new dispensary being built next to the dispensary constructed by the former MP; the bursaries that were never paid; or construction that was never completed. How can we regulate CDFs to make them consistently successful? Firstly a new MP should be forced to complete projects begun by his predecessor. Secondly the CDF committee should not just be packed with the MP's cronies. There should be representatives of local churches and other bodies to make them more independent. And finally government should continue to audit CDF expenditure. And where there is a shortfall, the MP should be held accountable. Quote of the day: "War is peace. Freedom is slavery.
