Kenya Cup losing finalists Kabras Sugar have parted ways with head coach Charles Cadovillis after a one year partnership In a surprise move by the sugar millers, the club have also dispensed with the services of team manager Phillip Mwenesi. Club chairman Peter Samba cited personal reasons for the exit of the two officials. “The coach has a young family which is based in Tanzania while the team manager family resides in Nairobi. We tried having their families relocated to Kakamega but it has not worked out,” said Samba. Cadovillis was appointed last year on a one-year contract subject to renewal. Sources, however, revealed that there was friction between the coach and the management in the course of the season. A source familiar with the going-ons at the club observed that Cadovillis was absent in most matches especially towards the tail end of the season. Cadovillis guided the club to the national Sevens circuit title for the first time last season and led them to the Kenya Cup final before losing to KCB 29-23 in March. He also guided the club to the Enterprise Cup final last year, where they again lost to KCB. Efforts to get a comment from Cadovillis bore no fruit as he did not respond to our inquiries. Samba was confident of getting replacement by the time the national Sevens circuit starts next month as well as the Kenya Cup League in November. “We will advertise both positions and offer the incoming coach and team manager competitive salaries and remuneration and hopefully, we will win the league next season,” added Samba. Kabras have played in four consecutive Kenya Cup finals having gained promotion from the championship in 2014. They won in 2016 when they beat Impala 22-5 but have lost three finals to KCB. Kabras have had a high turnover of coaches in the past four years with player-coach Anthony Ogot handling the side for a season followed thereafter by Australian Mike Bishop.
