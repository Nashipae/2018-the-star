KICC managing director Nana Gecaga says she would have been an Olympic achiever were it not for alcoholism while in university. Speaking to Kiss FM, she said she dreamt of becoming an athlete but her hopes were shut down before they materialised. "The person you see here today has had many lives before who I am today. My passion was actually sports. I was a very big athlete back in the day, and I actually qualified for the '96 Olympics. "I used to love, soccer, football and basketball. At the same time, I also wanted to be a game changer and help people, because if you are in a position where you can help, just help because it doesn't cost you anything." Nana finally settled on leadership because she also wanted to be a leader. She went to university in the United States, where she became a drunkard, a habit that cost her her dreams. "My first year at the university in America was very rocky, and that is where my everything fell apart. I was an addict of alcohol but I was able to go to rehab and from there, it's been 19 years without drinking." A big lesson she learnt from alcohol addiction is the difficulty of battling with alcoholism "It definitely builds character because it takes a lot of strength to acknowledge that you have a problem, whatever it is. Getting out of it is something I am happy about because most people do not manage."
