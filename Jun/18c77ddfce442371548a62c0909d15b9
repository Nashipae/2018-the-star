Lilian Muli
has been more open and interactive with her second pregnancy, unlike the first,
which was low-key. The talented reporter, who is engaged to flamboyant
football administrator Jared Nevatona, is currently on vacation at Swahili
Beach at the coast. Like with many
other celebrities, everyone is expecting and eager to hear news about her baby
shower. Speaking to
Word Is, Lilian said: "I’m not sure I will have a baby shower, since
this is not my first baby and I have categorically told my friends I don’t want
one, as I really don’t like surprises," adding: "I am a
very last minute person when it comes to planning events, so if I feel the need
to have one, I will plan a small one myself with very close friends." Lilian is
known to be private about her life, but she has a YouTube channel, where she
updates her fans on matters of her pregnancy. "I am
very private but people have made my life their business. Viusasa is an
opportunity for me to create content on a digital platform, as that has always
been my desire. I am careful not to reveal too much, but the little that I do
reveal is fun and just a glimpse into my life, but not in totality. I have more
plans for this digital space, so watch this space." It has also
become a norm with most celebrity children to have an Instagram page that their
parents monitor, but Lilian thinks otherwise regarding that. She
said: "I will not reveal the baby’s face. In as much as many people
have been supportive and happy for me, there are those who have said the most
heartless things, and it shocks me that people can be so openly vicious and
unkind. When baby is bigger, yes, I might. There will be no social media
account for my baby." Lilian does
not, however, look forward to getting another child after her second.
