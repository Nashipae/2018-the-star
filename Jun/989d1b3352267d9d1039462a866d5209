President Uhuru Kenyatta's executive order that put independent constitutional commissions under direct control of the Attorney general and Cabinet Secretaries has been suspended. High Court judge Winfred Okwany issued conservatory orders on Friday against the directive. The directive was challenged by the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) which says it is unlawful. Okwany gave AG Paul Kihara 14 days to file and serve his responses to the petition. Uhuru's order applied to Kenya Law Review Commission, Council of Legal Education, Office of the Registrar of Political Parties, Assets Recovery Agency, Kenya School of Law, Kenya Copyright Board, Victims Protection Board, Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and the Kenya National Human Rights Commission. The Commission on Administrative Justice, Judicial Service Commission, Parliamentary Service Commission, National Police Service, Commission on Revenue Allocation, Salaries and Remuneration Commission, Controller of Budget, Teachers Service Commission, National Land Commission and the Public Service Commission were also affected. LSK said the directive was contrary to the law. Uhuru issued the directive in early June. Lawyers said the President's move was an illegal attempt to amend the Constitution. They said the AG can not oversee independent commissions. "The executive order is unconstitutional and void of inconsistency. It is a contravention of the Constitution," LSK said. The order placed all the agencies under Cabinet Secretaries for Interior, Education, Lands and Public Service, Youth and Gender. Click here for the latest political news
