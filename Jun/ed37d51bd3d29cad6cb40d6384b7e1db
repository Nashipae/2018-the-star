Kisumu MCAs have passed a motion compelling the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and the National Land Commission to intervene in the boundary dispute with Nandi county. The move comes following reports that Nandi County wants the NLC to re-adjust its common border to place Chemelil, Muhoroni, Miwani, Kibigori, Kibos, Koru and Kopere towns within its borders. The towns traditionally fall in Kisumu, close to the border with Nandi. Yesterday, nominated MCA Caren Muga, who moved the motion, said the boundaries are well defined and they will defend them.
