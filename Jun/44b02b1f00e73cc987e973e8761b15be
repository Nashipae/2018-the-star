West Pokot leads in teenage pregnancies among North Rift counties. More than 22 per cent of girls have children according to ‘Mending the Rift’, a report by the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. It covers 2005-2016. The national average of teen pregnancies is 14.7 per cent. It was not clear if the rate in West Pokot was the highest nationwide. It was a result of a probe into insecurity in the North Rift and its impact on communities. Samburu ranks second with a teenage pregnancy rate of 19 per cent, followed by Turkana at 17.6 per cent. Baringo has 10.5, while Elgeyo Marakwet has 7.4 per cent. The KNCHR blames the problem on poor access to education and healthcare — basic human rights. “Schools are closed, too distant or unavailable due to insecurity,” commission chairperson Kagwiria Mbogori said on Monday after she handed the report to West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo. The report says the high bride price for girls in West Pokot encourages parents to marry off their daughters at an early age. This is also blamed for cattle rustling. Kiambu’s rate is 12.7, Machakos’ 12.2, Bungoma’s 13.8 and Nairobi’s 13.1 per cent. The KNCHR says access to modern familyis lower in the North Rift than anywhere else in the country, “The main reason is that health infrastructure is either not available, abandoned or destroyed due to insecurity,” Mbogori said. Many health centres have no staff. Some fled for safety, several were killed, while others are afraid to report to work. Violence deprives residents of the right to access health services, she said. The report says most mothers deliver at home. The average distance to health facilities in the region is 40 kilometres.
