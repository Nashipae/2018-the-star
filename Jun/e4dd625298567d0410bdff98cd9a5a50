KPAWU officials in Kericho and Bomet have asked COTU boss Francis Atwoli to name politicians dealing in contraband sugar in the country. The Kenya Plantation and Agricultural Workers Union officials Peter Nyandoro and Isaiah
Odhiambo said the prosecution of the said individuals will save the ailing sugar sector. They cited the death of
Mumia Sugar Company as one of the reasons the cartel behind importation of contraband
sugar should be named, prosecuted, and jailed. During a funeral in Kwisero on Saturday, Atwoli said he will, next week at COTU headquarters in Nairobi, disclose names of high profile politicians behind the trade. He said sugar cartels are well-connected individuals working with the protection of the country's senior leaders, of whom he said are part of the larger network of sugar barons. The KPAWU officials and
members said: "Importers of contraband goods are not only sabotaging Kenya's economy but are individuals killing jobs for the youth." They spoke at a press conference in Kericho on Sunday, remarks which came in the wake of a multi-agency operation to net contrabands, counterfeits, and fakes. A consignment of 2,000 bags of contraband sugar was seized at a warehouse in Matuu on Saturday as the state stepped up war on the illicit trade. Machakos county commissioner Matilda Sakwa said they suspect that the sugar is part of the uncleared goods which were recently seized in Eastleigh, Nairobi. Security agencies, Kebs, anti-counterfeit agency, and KRA officers are conducting a crackdown to arrest the proliferation of such illicit goods.
