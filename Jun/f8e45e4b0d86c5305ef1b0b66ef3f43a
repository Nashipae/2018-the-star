Bondo MP Gideâ€‹â€‹on Ochanda has suspended CDF officials over corruption allegations. Ochanda said he was perturbed by the wave of corruption in the CDF office. He said his campaign pledges are bound to fail if the kind of corruption at his office is tolerated. The MP told journalists in Bondo on Friday that the officials have been directed to report to the DCI officers at Bondo police station until the investigations is complete. He revealed that cartels colluding with his staff have positioned themselves in the CDF office to influence development projects in the constituency. "They must report to the DCI office from Monday. They are not part of the office until they are cleared." "I want the investigating officers to carry out a thorough probe and those found guilty be prosecuted," Ochanda said. The Bondo MP said he is not ready to allow unscrupulous contractors to derail his development track record. He regretted that some staff members have even gone to an extent of registering their own companies to award themselves tenders. "The same staff have even perfected the art of obtaining bribes from contractors in order to get tender awards and leak the Bill of Quantities to their preferred contractors against the law," he added. The MP stated that he halted a school development project at Ugadhi Primary School as tendering has not been done by the committee. Ochanda also accused the CDF office of mishandling bursary funds revealing that he has received numerous complaints from his constituents. The MP further disclosed that the staffs at CDF office have altered the names of bursary beneficiaries that were vetted and replaced the names with their preferred names.
