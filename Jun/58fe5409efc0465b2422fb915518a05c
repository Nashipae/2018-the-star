Kenya Premier League Champions Gor Mahia will face off with Tanzanian side Simba FC in the SportPesa Super Cup Final this weekend. The Kenyan side beat Singida United from Tanzania 2-0 in the second semi-final played at Afraha Stadium in Nakuru. Simba SC qualified for the final after eliminating Kakamega Homeboys 5-4 on post-match penalties after a barren draw in regular time. The winner between Gor and Simba will travel to Goodison Park and play English Premiership side, Everton. Gor is the current holder of the Super Cup and is looking at its second encounter with Everton should its players overcome the Tanzanians. Rwandese International Meddie Kagere stole the show by scoring twice for Gor in a match played in the afternoon showers that hit the lakeside town of Nakuru on Thursday. Gor had thrashed Jeshi la Kujenga Uchumi 3-0 in the quarter finals. In the earlier match, Kakamega Homeboyz was confident after beating Yanga FC by 3-1 in the quarterfinals. However, Simba came out stronger and did particularly well in defence, stopping the likes of Allan Wanga and Noah Wafula. Click here for more political news
