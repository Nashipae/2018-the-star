Busia assembly speaker Bernard Wamalwa has appointed a nine-member committee to complete the budget by the June 30 deadline. The speaker intervened after the disbanded Budget committee chaired by Nangina MCA John Obwogo moved to court to block a new committee from taking over. “The one million plus population of our beloved county is looking upon us to deliver the budget by June 30. Busia is greater than one individual,” Wamalwa said. The committee will be chaired by deputy speaker Lawrence Okaale. The members are Felix Omanyi, Evans Barasa, George Busera, John Oganga, Mwajuma Toloi, Abiud Ochilang’ole, Ruth Achola and Emmaculate Joyce.
