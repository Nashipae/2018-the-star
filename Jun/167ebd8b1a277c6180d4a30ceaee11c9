The Teachers Service Commission has been urged to expand the health insurance cover for teachers to include benefits like air evacuation and treatment overseas. Deputy President William Ruto yesterday said teachers need to be covered on all fronts and the government will work with the TSC to ensure this is implemented. “This will enable more teachers to have access to facilities in line with other members of the public service,” he said. Ruto said teachers deserve a good, comprehensive health cover. He spoke during the 43rd Kenya Secondary Schools Heads Association annual conference. Teachers have complained about the poor services some providers offer whenever they visit their facilities. This led to the blacklisting of at least 200 of them last year by the medical cover scheme administrator, AON. Last year, AON vetted all the 1,600 hospitals that were contracted to take care of the 305,000 teachers across the country. AON admitted there were problesm in providing services by some providers, citing rogue hospitals. At the same time, Ruto directed healthcare facilities contracted by the National Hospital Insurance Fund to provide services to students inside the schools. “We do not expect students to leave school to go and look for these services,” the DP said. There are 1.7 million students in public secondary schools under the NHIF cover. The government wants all the 2.8 million students in secondary schools covered. Ruto said only in-patient services will be sought outside the school premises. “All out-patient services must be provided in the school,” he said. He said all service providers must prepare themselves to work with school managements. “Where we have facilities in schools, those facilities must be expanded to accommodate the new facilities that will come with the provision of the health insurance,” the DP said. He said the Education ministry and the service providers must figure out how this will be efficiently implemented.
