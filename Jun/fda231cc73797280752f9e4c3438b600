Goalkeeper David Okello is on the way back to Mathare after parting ways with Tusker. “The club has completed the signing of David Okello from Tusker. Okello agreed to a one-and-a-half year deal to become the second signing of the mid-season transfer window after Emmanuel Otieno. He brings a wealth of experience to our youthful goalkeeping department having won a double at Tusker in 2016 and the the domestic cup with Sofapaka in 2014,” read a post from Mathare. The arrival of Okello could not be more timely coming as it is less than 24 after the clubs revealed that another of their shots stopper Robert Mboya was heading to the exit door . “The club has reached an agreement with Robert Mboya to part ways on mutual consent. His departure cuts short his second stint at the club which began in January 2018 after he rejoined the club from Kariobangi Sharks. We wish him all the best in his future endeavours,” Mathare said on Sunday. Mathare lie third in the league table, 10 points adrift of leaders Gor, who have played three fewer games. Okello, meanwhile, could make his debut against Bandari on Saturday and coach Francis Kimanzi will hope that his experience comes in handy in putting their title ambitions back on track.
