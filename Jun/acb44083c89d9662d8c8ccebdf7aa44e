Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga is hopeful he will unite South Sudan President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar. In a statement sent to newsrooms yesterday, Raila said he is focused on uniting the warring leaders and restore restore peace in the Kenyan neighbour. He said he has held talks with both Kiir and Machar in South Sudan and South Africa respectively in a bid to broker a truce. “Raila’s talks with President Salva Kiir and Riek Machar respectively were aimed at understanding the current position of each of the two on the various issues separating them and which have implications for peace and stability in South Sudan, Kenya and the region,” Raila said through spokesman Dennis Onyango.

Raila remains hopeful that these efforts will soon bear fruit.” Raila dismissed speculation he was planning to convene a meeting between Kiir and Machar. Raila’s new role in restoring peace in South Sudan has the backing of President Uhuru Kenyatta, with the ODM leader being treated abroad as the official representative of the Kenyan government. He met European Union envoys and briefed them on his talks with Kiir. The meeting took place at the residence of the EU Ambassador to Kenya, Stefano A Dejak, just four days after Raila met Kiir in a closed-door meeting that lasted several hours last weekend. Sources said Kiir, who is increasingly being alienated in the global community over the escalating conflict, reached out to Raila. Click here for the latest political news
