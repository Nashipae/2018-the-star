Garissa town will have 14 more boreholes in the next few months. Governor Ali Korane yesterday commissioned one borehole in Bula Iftin and promised that more will be completed. For the past two months, flooding has hurt supply. Korane promised to fix the water problem. The county has set aside Sh1.6 billion for sinking 100 boreholes. “I appeal to residents to bear with us. There is not much we can do to make the water as clean as you would wish. But the water from your taps is treated and good for use. Only the colour is not appealing,” he said. The project will add 16 billion litres to the current 32 billion supplied to Garissa town. This will surpass the daily demand. The county said it will also build 2,000km roads in partnership with Hitech Company, Korane said. The work will start in three months. A Sh2 billion cancer centre is under construction in the town. It is funded by Garissa, the national government and donors. Korane urged residents to avoid divisive politics and focus on developing the county and improving their lives. He was accompanied by Senator Yusuf Haji.
