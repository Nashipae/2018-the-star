Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has attributed his success to his father, saying the elder taught him crucial life skills. During an inspirational speech at the Buru Buru Girls High School on Saturday, Sonko thanked Gideon Kivanguli, saying he taught him the importance of education. Kivanguli died in 2015. “I really salute my late father Mzee Kivanguli. May his soul rest in eternal peace. He taught me a lot,” Sonko said. Acknowledging that he was a naughty teenager, Sonko told the girls he made his first million while still in high school. He said he acquired entrepreneurship skills early enough. Land was very cheap then and he saw opportunities as people hesitated. “Omar Mwasabuni in Diani was one of the first people who sold land to me. I later sold that land to a German national and made good cash,” Sonko said. He spoke when he launched the school’s new laboratory, library and swimming pool. The governor said hard work is the key to success. “You must strive to achieve anything. Life is not easy and always never give up. You should also put God ahead of everything,” Sonko said. He cautioned the girls against depending on the family to succeed. “Don’t think of your family background or what you ate last evening. Just focus on your life. You are the future of this great country,” the governor said. Sonko encouraged the students not to lose hope even if they do not excel in academics. “It is not the end of life. I scored C+ in KCSE with an E in maths . But I still became Makadara MP and I started my charity, assisting people, some of whom even got better grades than I did in high school,” he said. The governor was with Education executive Janet Ouko. Sonko said he witnessed God’s hand during the Makadara campaigns when he won despite several hurdles. “My accounts were frozen. But my belief in God sailed me through,” he said. Principal Muthoni Kimuya thanked the governor and asked him to enhance his fight against corruption.
