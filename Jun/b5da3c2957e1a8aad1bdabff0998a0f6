A man has been arrested for allegedly assaulting his nephew. The man allegedly beat the boy with a stick then hit his head with a panga for taking his bicycle without permission for a ride in Ndeiya ward, Limuru. The man was watching the boy since his parents are not around.The boy’s mother left when he was two and his father works in a different town. The boy usually stays with his grandmother but on Saturday he had gone to visit his cousins. Children’s officer Mary Muthumbi said, “The boy sustained four head injuries. His cousin had allowed him to ride his father’s bicycle.” The boy was not taken to the hospital immediately as his grandmother was not at home. “We were called by neighbours at night and informed that a boy who had been badly beaten with a panga by his uncle is still at home. We had to come at night to save him,” she said. Muthumbi was with an officer from her office, George Ngugi, and administration police officers. They took the child to Ndeiya Health Centre and later handed him to Limuru Children’s Centre. “We brought him to this rescue centre, where he will be checked by the matron,” Muthumbi said. The children’s officer said the suspect will be charged after police finalise investigations. The standard three boy said he would want his uncle jailed for four years. “I cannot forgive him. I want him to be jailed for four years. If he beats me again, he should be jailed for nine years, so that I can get time to grow up. Where will I live if he is attacking me like this?” the boy said.
