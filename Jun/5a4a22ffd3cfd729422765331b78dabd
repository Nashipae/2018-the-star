American Serena Williams withdrew from the French Open yesterday, shortly before she was due on court to face Maria Sharapova in a much-anticipated fourth round showdown. The 36-year-old 23-times Grand Slam champion, making a comeback after a maternity break, told a news conference she had a pectoral muscle injury. “Unfortunately I’m having some issues with my pec muscle. Right now I can’t actually serve it’s kind of hard to play,” she said. “I’m having an MRI (scan) tomorrow (today), I’m going to stay here to see the doctors and see as many specialists as I can. I won’t know (how serious the injury is) until I get those results.” Williams had worked hard to get back in shape and was making her Grand Slam comeback at the French Open following the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia last September. “Physically I’m doing great. It hasn’t been easy. I sacrificed so much to be at this event. I’m going to continue to get better. I had such a wonderful performance in my first Grand Slam back,” she added. Meanwhile, Rafa Nadal continued his birthday celebrations by moving into the quarter-finals , beating a determined Maximilian Marterer 6-3 6-2 7-6(4). Nadal, who turned 32 on Sunday, fired 39 winners as he completed the victory in two hours and 30 minutes to set up a match with Argentine Diego Schwartzman, who had earlier beaten Kevin Anderson. After roaring to a two-set lead, Nadal faced a stern test in the third with Marterer leading 3-1 at one point after breaking the Spaniard. The German battled for every point in a bid to drag himself back into the contest. Nadal, however, maintained composure in the decisive moments of the match to seal victory on his second match point as Marterer's backhand went long.
