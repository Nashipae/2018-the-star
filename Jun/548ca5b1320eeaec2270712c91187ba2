The fight against corruption got a shot in the arm after Treasury increased funding for governance, justice, law and order. In what is seen as part of the government’s efforts to win the war on graft, Treasury CS Henry Rotich on Thursday allocated more resources to relevant sectors. Presenting the Sh3.07 trillion 2018-19 budget, he announced a Sh 6.4 billion allocation to criminal investigation services. The funding for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions was enhanced to Sh2.9 billion. In the 2017-18 budget, it had Sh2.3 billion. “These measures are aimed at strengthening multi-agency teams involved in the fight against corruption,” Rotich said. The Office of the Attorney General was allocated Sh5.1 billion. Funding for the Financial Reporting Centre increased to Sh587 million from Sh300 million in 2017-18. The huge resources are meant to strengthen the FRC’s sting operations against banks flouting guidelines issued by the Central Bank. Some banks have been linked to public agency scandals.
