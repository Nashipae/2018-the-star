Terror attacks along the Lamu-Garsen road have gone down to nil in the last nine months after the establishment of extra police camps. Lamu county commander Muchangi Kioi attributed the positive trend to the ongoing multi-agency security operation dubbed the Linda Boni Operation. “For the past nine months, no single terror attack or an attempt has happened here. This is due to increased security measures that include the establishment of extra camps in all hotspots here,” Kioi said on Monday.

Kioi noted that the current calm and security in Lamu was due to an upgrade in strategies which saw normalcy return, especially on the Lamu-Garsen road having been previously turned into a combat zone by militants. He said the situation wouldn’t have been so without the immense cooperation from members of the public who continue to feed security agencies with crucial intel. “The public has really done it this time around. We have had people call us to come and check out a suspicious activity or people. We have had others alert us of suspicious-looking elements. We can only ask that the same spirit continues. The bottom line is to have a terror-free Lamu for all,” he said. He urged investors to come forward and invest in Lamu saying the region was now among the safest for business and investments. “We expect investments and business to grow. With the increased security patrols and the ongoing operation in Boni forest, we have been able to neutralize any terror threats that were present and contain any situation that would have threatened the security of this region. Lamu is now safer than ever,” he added. Also read: Al Shabaab attacks in Lamu are political, says Marwa Click here for the latest political news
