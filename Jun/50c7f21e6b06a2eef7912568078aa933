Memory Kachambwa is set to take over from Dinah Musindarwezo as Executive Director at Femnet. Musindarwezo left Femnet, also known as the African Women’s Development and Communication Network, in March after serving for six years. Kachambwa has been the organisation’s head of programmes since 2016. "She was picked n a transparent recruitment process," chairperson Emma Kaliya said. The new Executive Director is a holder of a Masters in Philosophy in Management and Integrated Water Resources with a focus on women, and is currently pursuing another in Peace, Human Rights, Gender and Development. She has more than 18 years' experience at Femnet and related organisations. KACHAMBWA TO CHAMPION WAR ON CORRUPTION Femnet has given strong views on matters such as corruption in relation to the empowerment of women and girls. Kachambwa said the organisation will push for an end to graft in Africa. “The situation is devastating when it comes to what Africa’s women and girls miss out on because of graft. What should be budgeted to improve and develop the continent’s most vulnerable is what is now being consumed," she said. The executive described Africa’s Gender Equality index as “shockingly more devastating on women and girls" and said it should be addressed within the African Union's 2018 theme. This year is 'The Anti-corruption Year'. Femnet sent a message to the AU ahead of the 31st Ordinary Session summit in Nouakchott, Mauritania. It proposed steps such as ratifying, domesticating and implementing regional instruments on corruption. “They must also infuse open governance mechanism that is a critical part of enhancing transparency so that information on tenders, contracting, loans and inflows from mining is publicly available to the public for scrutiny," Kachambwa said. She added that the Maputo protocol will ensure gender equality and women’s empowerment. Click here for the latest political news
