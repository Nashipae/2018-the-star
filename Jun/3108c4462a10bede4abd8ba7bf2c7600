Armed thugs on Sunday night broke into Nyeri speaker John Kaguchia's residence, vandalized property and terrorized the night guard. The speaker and his family were not at home at the time as they had travelled to Nairobi for an interview with a local TV station this morning. "At around 2 am this morning, the thugs gained access into my official residence and on discovering that I and my family were not around, they harassed the security person, from a local security company, who was there," he said. The residence is near King'ong'o area in the outskirts of Nyeri town. Kaguchia said the gang vandalized a vehicle which was in the compound and a motorcycle belonging to the guard before holding the guard hostage. "They took him and disappeared with him, they beat him up and then they dropped him along Kiganjo- Nyeri road," said the speaker. Kaguchia said neighbours who heard the commotion called his personal assistant who informed him. The speaker alerted the police. The DCIO assigned officers at the residence and investigations have been launched. "It is not common to see thugs getting the confidence to get in that kind of neighbourhood and even getting to the Speaker's residence," he said. He called for thorough investigations to establish what the motive was. Nyeri Central sub-county assistant county commissioner John Marete confirmed the incident but said nothing was stolen from the residence. Click here for the latest political news
