Two more suspects linked to the loss of Sh486 million at the National Youth Service have denied charges before the anti-corruption court in Nairobi. Stephen Munyunzi, a senior officer at the NYS, and verification committee member Peter Waema appeared before chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti yesterday facing multiple charges. They denied several counts of conspiracy to commit an economic crime, abuse of office and failure to comply with procurement procedures. They were similarly denied bail and joined 46 others who are in remand pending trial.
