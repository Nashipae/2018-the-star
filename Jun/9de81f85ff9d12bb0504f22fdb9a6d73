An anti-drugs activist has warned that the land lease row pitting Del Monte and Kiambu county will have adverse consequences on the youths in the region. Gladys Chania said that the over 7,000 workers facing lay-offs if the matter is not resolved may opt for drugs and other crimes if an alternative will not be sought. Del Monte Kenya and Kiambu county government have failed to agree on the lease renewal terms, threatening the factory's operations. Local leaders have asked Governor Ferdinand Waititu's administration to seek views from members of the public on the matter. The county declined to renew the company's lease after a meeting between Waititu and Delmonte's managing director Stergios Gkaliamoutsas last week. The land occupied by the firm has been identified as a suitable site for the development of Aerotropolis City, which Waititu says is a Kenya Vision 2030 project. Kiambu County Spatial Plan and Nairobi Metropolitan spatial plan have factored the land for the construction of the agricity project. Thika district business association chairman Alfred Wanyoike asked the county administration to include residents' views in the plan. He said Waititu's decision to end the company's lease is self-driven citing a hidden agenda on the use of huge chunk of land. Wanyoike said that that the company provided 50 per cent of Thika's GDP and therefore, its closure will have negative results. Chania said that Delmonte has been the backbone of Thika's development calling on residents to reject any attempts by Waititu to act on the land issue without public participation. The land lease row between the county and the fruit processing firm has been a subject of conversation in Kiambu and the neighbouring Murang'a county. Leaders from the two devolved units have asked the state not to renew the company's leasehold on the 20,000 acres of land which they want reverted for public use.
