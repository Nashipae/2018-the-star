The county has established operation zones for boda bodas in the periphery of the CBD. They are Globe Cinema Roundabout, OTC stage, Uhuru Park and Railways Bus Station. The riders will only have access to Kirinyaga Road, University Way, Uhuru Highway, Haile Sellasie and Race Course Road. The county has tried several times before to get the operators out of the CBD but they have been defiant. On January 23, they defied instructions by Governor Mike Sonko and asked for time to self-regulate.
