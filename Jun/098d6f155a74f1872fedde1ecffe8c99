Kisumu Central AP boss Benjamin Koima yesterday failed to prove his officers were not among police deployed to Nyalenda where Baby Samantha Pendo was clobbered to death. Koima initially told an inquest into the death his officers were redeployed to guard polling stations, government installations and VIPs between August 8 and 16 last year. He said he did not know AP officers who were deployed to Nyalenda. Nyalenda is in Kisumu Central. Resident Magistrate Beryl Omollo ordered Koima to produce a deployment order to show his officers were not in Nyalenda. The order failed to show the officers were deployed elsewhere. Two APs Erick Chirchir and Cleophas Ochieng’ were found to have been deployed in Nyalenda. Their names appeared in the operation order. Omollo had ordered Koima to present the operation order. The police boss asked the magistrate to allow him be represented by a lawyer. The application was granted. Kenya National Commission on Human Rights lawyer Charles Onyango and his Law Society of Kenya counterpart Richard Onsongo asked Koima to explain why names of the two officers appeared in the operation order and not the deployment order he earlier presented to court. “With the names of the two officers missing in deployment order, it then tells that they were part of the joint force that was quelling riots in Nyalenda as stated by the operation order,” Onyango told the hearing. Koima said Chirchir was guarding a polling station before he returned to his main work station at the immigration department. Omollo summoned Inspector Ali Mohamed to appear before the hearing on July 9. Prosecutor Mokaya Nyakundi made the application saying Mohamed had been adversely mentioned by witnesses. “I don’t know the said officer or where he is but the court can summon him,” Nyakundi said. Former Kisumu county commander Titus Yoma and police boss Chris Mutune will testify.
