A man is seeking help from Good Samaritans to raise money to fuel an ambulance to transfer him to Kitui General Hospital. Eric Kyalo, who was shot with an arrow on Tuesday, says he risks losing his jaw and or die if the arrow is not removed as soon as possible. "I was passing near a popular supermarket here in Mwingi at 8pm when the watchman threatened to shoot me. I told him I meant no harm and before I could ran for safety, he shot me. I don't know what happened next since I found myself in hospital," Kyalo said. His mother, Patricia, said she is hopping her son will be treated and get justice as well. Patricia is appealing to well wishers to help her raise Sh5,000 to fuel an ambulance and take her son to Kitui.
