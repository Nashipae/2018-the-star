Wajir county is concerned over the delayed Sh360 million equalisation funds
by the national treasury. The fund is enshrined in the Constitution and is used to promote basic services that
include water, roads, health facilities and electricity to marginalised. This helps bring the quality of those services areas to the levels generally enjoyed
by the rest of the nation. Speaking after inspecting the Sarman-Tarbaj water supply project yesterday, water chief officer Yussuf Dayib said the delay will bring adverse effects in the water sector. He said the projects forms part of the county integrated
development plan. The installed water supply project include sarman-Tarbaj, Wajir bor, Arbajahan-Adan Awale and Quli-kursin water supplies. The projects are funded by the national government through
the Northern Water Service Board. “I am calling upon the national project implementer of northern water service
board to speed up project financing and link up with the national treasury to release
funds that will see this projects completed,” he said. He said that even though the county had plenty of
water at the moment, the situation would be different towards September
when drought will set in. He said the flagship projects are crucial for water
supply in the sub counties, which mainly rely on water trucking. “We will  start hearing of water trucking. And we all
know how expensive it is. the completion of the projects will  minimize this,” he said. The county has so far successfully drilled 270 boreholes
across the county.  In April, the chief officer said that the county
was determined to drill more boreholes as part of ‘our long term measures to
end water crisis’.   Ends……….
