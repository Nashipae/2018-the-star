An MCA has raised questions about the Bungoma government’s plan to build an industrial park in Webuye. Maraka MCA Ali Mutoka termed the plan “ill-advised”, saying the county has not provided sufficient information to the public. “We question this plan to try and construct an industrial park in Webuye. A lot of issues must be addressed before it can proceed,” Mutoka said. He said the information residents have is that the county is constructing an industry. Mutoka said the county government needs to have proper public participation. Residents need to know exactly what’s happening and who the actors are, he said.
