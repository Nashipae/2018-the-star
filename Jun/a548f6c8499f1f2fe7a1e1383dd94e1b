National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale has dismissed claims of split in the ruling party Jubilee saying they have one boss and that is President Uhuru Kenyatta. "We have one President and a party leader whom all of us starting from the Deputy President to the lowest person we take orders from him and that's is President Uhuru Kenyatta," said the vocal Jubilee lawmaker. Speaking when he disbursed bursary funds from Constituency Development funds amounting to shs.23 million at Garissa High School, Duale said the coalition is more united than before general election. He said the party has the highest elected leaders in the country including 175 members of Parliament, 37 senators, governors and members of county assemblies adding that they collapsed 15 parties to form Jubilee. The Garissa Mp was responding to claims of internal turmoil within the party over Deputy President's bid for Presidency for 2022 general elections. Political commentators have in the recent times questioned the seemingly end of bromance between President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto as each camps have been raising conflicting approaches on various matters including fights against corruption. The Garissa Township lawmaker said those doubting the unity of jubilee coalition were in for a rude shock as the leadership is working to unite the country and implement big four agenda. The handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Nasa leader Raila Odinga have also raised eyebrows with Mr Ruto's camp claiming the opposition leader was out scuttle jubilee unity.
