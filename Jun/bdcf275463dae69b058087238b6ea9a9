Treasury CS Henry Rotich has said a proposed financial markets regulator will not infringe on the mandate of the Central Bank. CBK has said the new agency would leave it “emasculated”. The bill proposing the agency aims to deal with predatory lending, Rotich said yesterday. He said the Treasury will consider CBK’s views before the draft law is presented to Parliament. “There is no overlap, duplication or contradiction whatsoever,” Rotich said. The Financial Markets Conduct Bill, published in May by the Treasury, proposes to create a regulator in addition to the CBK to deal with the conduct of lenders. CBK has criticised the bill. Last month, Governor Patrick Njoroge said, “The bill emasculates the Central Bank, (which) ... is under attack.”
