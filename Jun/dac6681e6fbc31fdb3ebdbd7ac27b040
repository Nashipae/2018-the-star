Consumer protection is a good thing. But I’m quite confused
by the new proposal coming out of the treasury to set up the Financial Markets
Conduct Authority (FMCA). Not only is this confusing in itself: It’s a bit of
an overkill since you could improve consumer protection with some amendments to
the current constellation. And CBK governor Patrick Njoroge is also not keen on
this as the seeming duplication of institutions would also undermine the
position of the Central Bank of Kenya. But more baffling is the fact that this proposal, while
extensive, does not seem to do anything to address the interest rate cap, and
does not offer a repeal of this mechanism. Not only has the interest rate cap
had a confusing effect on monetary policy implementation, but it has also, as
contradictory as this sounds, been bad news for people and companies looking to
borrow: When lending, banks put a price on this service: the interest. The
riskier a client is perceived, the higher the price, i.e. the interest rate –
because a higher risk means that there is a higher chance that this client will
not repay. Across the overall portfolio of loans, this will even out: some will
not be repaid, and those losses are, very simply speaking, covered by the
higher interest. Yes, banks in Kenya have made good money. And no, an interest
rate cap is not the way to go. We’ve seen a significant decline in lending to the private
sector: especially those asking for unsecured loans, especially individuals
asking for loans, especially SMEs. This is not entirely the fault of the
interest rate cap – it’s also the fault of the government which has borrowed
substantially in the local market to fill its consistently large budget
deficits: A bank, offered the option of a risky loan to a smaller client or the
option of lending to government at much larger sums and much lower risk, will
go for the latter. The government should not have waited until put on the spot
by the IMF. In fact, the president should have never signed this bill because
he knows better. But he did it anyway – to be able to keep the financing costs
for the government’s unending spending sprees low? It is pretty obvious that
Kenya will have to address its massive fiscal deficit, its spending, its
surging debt. And to make sure that bank lending returns to SMEs, which is
unlikely to happen while the interest rate cap is in place. That whole FMCA?
Fiddling while Rome burns â€‘ and a collision course with the IMF with respect to
their emergency overdraft facility. Time to get serious.
