A civil society group has called for the nullification of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s latest appointments to boards of parastatals, saying appointees were not vetted.Uhuru last week gazetted the appointment of directors and board members to state institutions.The Civil Society Reference Group says the move will undermine the war on corruption.The lobby has written to Attorney General Paul Kihara, asking him to nullify the appointments.Head of the lobby Suba Churchil said the appointments were in breach of Chapter Six of the Constitution because the vacancies were not advertised and applicants vetted.“Recent appointment by President Uhuru Kenyatta of 106 state corporation chairpersons and directors failed the constitutionality test and will undermine the ongoing efforts to rid the public service of graft,” Churchil said.“None of the appointments was done in accordance with the constitutional requirement that selection to such public offices be done on the basis of personal integrity, competence and suitability.”The lobby said fairness, competition and merit were not the basis of the appointments.Churchil said the President and Cabinet Secretaries, who also made appointments to parastatals under their dockets, failed to make them constitutionally sound and beyond reproach.“This glaring failure on the part of the Office of the AG and other state agencies charged with the responsibility of advising the President will erode the progress being made in the fight against corruption,” the lobby said. The group said Kihara failed to advise the government appropriately. It wants him to announce the appointees as nominees for their respective positions so that each can be vetted and subsequently appointed only after their credibility, suitability and competence is confirmed in a competitive process. Among those appointed are former chief of staff in the defunct Office of the Prime Minister Caroli Omondi, former KDF boss Julius Karangi and former Kenya National Union of Teachers chairman Mudzo Nzili.
