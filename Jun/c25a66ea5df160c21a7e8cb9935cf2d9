The Director of Public Prosecution has gone to the Supreme Court in his push for ex-Transport CS Michael Kamau to be tried over abuse of office. State Prosecutor Ashimosi Shitambasi told Anti-Corruption Court Magistrate Douglas Ogoti on Thursday that the DPP had filed an application at the apex court. "We have filed an application to stay the decision of the Court of Appeal delivered on July 14, 2017," ShitambasiÂ said. The court will give directions on July 27. The DPP's office is seeking to halt a decision that quashed charges against the former minister. Kamau was booked following claims that he presided over the loss of Sh33 million meant for a road in Bungoma county.

The DPP and Kamau, through his lawyer Nelson Havi, asked Ogoti to delay today's ruling and await the decision of the Court of Appeal. They noted that the decision has a bearing on the case before him. "For purposes of respect of hierarchy of court, and since the Appeals court decision is binding on this court, the ruling expected today is hereby stayed," Ogoti said.
