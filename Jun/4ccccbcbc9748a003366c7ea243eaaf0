Public Service PS Lillian Omollo was discharged from Kenyatta National Hospital and taken back to Langata Women's Prison on Wednesday morning. The PS was taken to the facility on May 30 after reportedly fainting at the prison on the night of May 29. Her release followed investigations by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, which found that her stay at the KNH was not warranted. Omollo is among 46 suspects facing a myriad of charges related to the alleged loss of Sh9 million at the National Youth Service. The suspects were denied bail and remanded until their trial is concluded. Anti-corruption court magistrate Douglas Ogoti said the allegations against them are too serious.
