For all those who doubted that Gor Mahia squad of 2018 was the best ever assembled, the answer was given emphatically yesterday as K’Ogalo ran over Tanzania champion 2-0 in a one sided affair at Afraha Stadium. An encounter with Simba is always a deadly prospect but the mighty K’Ogalo made it look like a walk in the park and not a stroll in the wild savannah. Rwandese striking duo of Medie Kagere and Jacques Tuyisenge scored the goals that ensured Everton will endure the toughest pre-season yet. Kagere’s goal had all the hallmarks of a poacher’s strike. Fortune does sometimes favour the brave and a quick interchange of passes between the peerless Francis Kahata and Tuyisenge ended with the latter finding his compatriot Kagere. With one swing of his boot, the ball proved to be more than a handful for Tanzanian international goalkeeper, Aisha Manula, who let the ball squirm under him and into the net for a lead that the defending SportPesa Super Cup champions deserved. Further chances came in Gor’s way at Afraha. Kahata went close as did George Odhiambo but their opponents ‘Wekundu wa Msimbazi’ survived the onslaught and went into the break and luckily so, just a goal down. If Simba had any aspirations of making a game out of this surprisingly lop-sided encounter, they were extinguished within 10 minutes of the restart. Once again, Kahata was in the thick of things and with his low cross into the box seemed to have gone waste, the outstretched leg of Tuyisenge was on hand to guide the ball past a bemused Manula. Just like that, the Sh3 million headed in K’Ogalo’s way. Simba looked lost and were instead praying for the game to end rather than compete against such aformidable side that is repeating records that were put in place by the club’s greatest sides. The fact that they conceded no goal goes a long way to show that the mighty Gor are shoulders above the rest especially in the East Africa region.
