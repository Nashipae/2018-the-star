Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti has broken his silence over allegations that his administration is held hostage by corruption cartels. He said he has not been defeated to take control of his administration due to the alleged cartels. Awiti said his silence should not be misconstrued to mean he is hands off in running the county. “Let nobody be cheated that my quietness means the county is out of my hands. I tell you I am in charge of the Homa Bay government,”  he said. Some leaders, including Trade executive Carrilus Ademba, have accused Awiti of pampering corrupt officials in his administration. Other leaders are Homa Bay MP Peter Kaluma and Suba North MP Millie Odhiambo. Ademba, who comes from the same ward as Awiti in Karachuonyo constituency, had called on him to sack the corrupt and threatened to resign if the status quo remains. But speaking during Madaraka Day celebrations in Kendu Bay stadium, Awiti said corruption is not fought through shouting in the streets. The governor said he exonerated his administration on corruption claims when he appeared before the Senate Public Accounts Committee in Nairobi. Awiti said Homa Bay is moving in the right direction. "We have normal challenges in our administration like anywhere else. I don’t like those who tanga tanga (move here and there) shouting about corruption without facts," Awiti said. The county boss said he welcomes all leaders, including national government officials, to join hands with him in the fight against corruption, adding that it is a major issue in the country. "We should fight the corruption menace. Each one of us should play their part without blaming one another," Awiti said. Leaders present were Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata and county commissioner Irungu Macharia. Click here for the latest political news
