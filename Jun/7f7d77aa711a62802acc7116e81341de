Uasin Gishu Woman Representative Gladys Shollei will not
play populist politics. Shollei said this during a media briefing in Eldoret on Saturday, following reports that she has skipped a number of functions since the election on August 8, 2017. "I am not a flower girl who advertises herself so as to be seen," she said. “I have a different style of politics and leadership, just like other leaders who do things their own way. I respect all leaders including
those in Uasin Gishu but I will not attend meetings without
a clear purpose." Shollei said she cannot afford to waste time. “I will always do what I believe is useful to the people. I am not ready to sell my soul just to please people or get re-elected. If my style will cost me the re-election, so be it," she said. The MP hosted the breakfast to explain her agenda in the county and at Parliament, where she is pushing more than 10 bills on affirmative action, youth, education and other matters. At the meeting, she discussed issues affected women, youths and vulnerable groups. Shollei's hope is that with time, Uasin Gishu residents will understand her style. A week ago, she caused a stir when she toured Spain area, Eldoret, a slum known for its many chang'aa dens. Shollei, who did not have her security detail, spent the whole day talking to women who brew chang'aa about rehabilitation. More than 100 of them ended up forming a group
which will be given money for other businesses. Shollei is also working on a medical
insurance scheme for boda boda riders. She says too much focus on the girl child has become a major problem for boys. “I will also focus on issues affecting the boy child," she said. The Woman Representative challenged journalists to change their
style of reporting by focusing on issues affecting poor Kenyans who are the
majority. “You should focus on ordinary Kenyans instead of only writing about leaders," she told them. Click here for the latest political news
