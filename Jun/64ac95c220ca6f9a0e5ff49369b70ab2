Three more NYS suspects were arraigned at the Milimani Anti-corruption court on Wednesday. They are Josphat Njoroge - a member of verification committee, Peter Kimani and Anthony Makara - directors of Arkroad Holdings. A warrant of arrest was issued against the two directors but they presented themselves before chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti on Tuesday. Their lawyers urged court to discharge the warrants saying those they were issued against have already presented themselves to the police. Kimani is seeking special treatment saying he suffers from diabetes, therefore, wants to be allowed access for special diet and medicine. The court is likely to kick off the pre-trial conference for the charges related to the loss of Sh468 million from the National Youth Service.

The chief magistrate insisted that the sessions will proceed on Wednesday. He however directed that the prosecution furnish the defence with all the documents they required by Tuesday evening. PS Lillian Omollo was not in the court after she was admitted to the Kenyatta National Hospital on Tuesday last week. "PS Omollo was still in hospital after being admitted last week," the DPP tweeted. The accused persons were remanded at Lang'ata Women's and Industrial Area prisons after they were denied bail.
