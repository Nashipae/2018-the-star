Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to protect Kenyans living on Migingo Island. The MP who spoke to the Star on Sunday in Kisumu said following the arrest of Kenyan fishermen by Ugandan authorities two weeks ago, the President should have intervened. Ugandan soldiers also arrested three Kenyan security officers in the latest controversy over fishing rights in Lake Victoria. They were released after intervention of the government. They were disarmed near Mageta and Hama Islands. The officers were taken to Uganda by boat. Wandayi said it was wrong for security forces from a neighbouring to arrest and torture Kenyans citizens without repercussion. He said the first responsibility of a government is to protect the territorial integrity of Kenya. “The least we expected the government to do is to recall the Kenya's High Commissioner in Kampala for debriefings. The state should have a sent a protest note. It should have also sent the Ugandan High Commissioner back to Kampala," Wandayi said. Wandayi said President Uhuru should have used the incident to demonstrate he cares for citizen's welfares. The MP urged Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni not extend the political differences have with tribes leaving in northern and western Uganda to Kenyans. “We are a peace loving country. But this should not be mistaken be cowardice,” he said. The government has proposed that an inter-state agency manages Lake Victoria to end the perennial border row between the Kenya and Uganda. On Friday, East African Community and Regional Development Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya said in Kisumu said the government is reviewing the treaty to have the agency under one management. Munya said this will help in tackling issues of fights amongst fishermen from both country and other security related matters. “When we have one management, we will not have issues of who should fish where in the Lake Victoria waters, issues of arrest ad fines will be tackled, “he said.
