Machakos County Assembly has said the IEBC should declare Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua’s position vacant and allow Speaker Florence Mwangangi to take over. In a statement read by the assembly’s Justice and Legal Affairs chairman Fredrick Muthoka, the MCAs demanded that the speaker assume the governor’s position immediately. “On June 8, 2018, the Court of Appeal nullified the August 8, 2017, election of Governor Alfred Mutua as Machakos Governor and ordered IEBC to conduct fresh elections in accordance to the law ruling that the certificate they had issued be withdrawn,” Muthoka said. Mutua has obtained a stay of the ruling.
