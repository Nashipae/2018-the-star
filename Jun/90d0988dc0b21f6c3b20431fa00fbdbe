UN refugee agency special
envoy Angelina Jolie visited Mosul in northern Iraq on Saturday
and urged the international community not to forget residents
trying to rebuild their city. Iraqi forces seized Mosul in July 2017 from Islamic State
militants, who had occupied the city three years earlier and
turned it into a stronghold of a "caliphate," in a military
campaign that saw 900,000 residents flee. The Hollywood actress met families from western Mosul and
walked through bombed out streets, according to video footage
and photos provided by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR). Normality has returned to many parts of Mosul, with
displaced residents leaving camps nearby and going back home. But the old city in West Mosul was largely destroyed during
a campaign by a 100,000-strong alliance of Iraqi government
units, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Shi'ite militias backed by
air support from a U.S.-led coalition. Reconstruction has been slow. "This is the worst devastation I have seen in all my years
working with UNHCR. People here have lost everything," Jolie
said in a U.N. statement. "They are destitute. They have no medicine for their
children, and many have no running water or basic services," she
said. "I hope there will be a continued commitment to rebuilding
and stabilizing the whole of the city. And I call on the
international community not to forget Mosul." Jolie has worked for UNHCR since 2001, visiting uprooted
civilians from Iraq to Cambodia and Kenya. It is her fifth visit
to Iraq, UNHCR said. Click here for the latest political news
