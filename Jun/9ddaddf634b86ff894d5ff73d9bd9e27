The national pre-primary education policy has been launched. It aims to better prepare pupils for primary, secondary and university education. â€‹Education CS Amina Mohamed attended the launch in Mombasa yesterday. She said the policy will reduce repetition, dropout rates and increase learning achievements. She said the Jubilee administration has placed more emphasis on the workability of the policy. “This is manifested in the increased enrolment in pre-primary education from 2.7million in 2012 to 3.2 million in 2016 representing an increase of 10.2 per cent,” Mohamed said. The policy will be piloted in five counties. Mohamed said the ministry seeks to resolve the issues ailing the education sector.  ACCESS She cited high the pupil-teacher ratio, inefficient teaching methods and shortage of instructional and play materials. “Transition from pre-primary to grade one is a major challenge due to the use of academic testing and disharmony between the two environments,” she said. The policy states there is an inadequate balance of summative and formative assessment of learning outcomes at this lower level. Under the new strategy, Dugsi and Madrassa centres will be covered. With the policy, focus will also be on child care and protection services. The document found problems facing the pre-primary education to be legal and policy framework, coordination, linkages and partnerships, resources and, governance and accountability.  HIV EFFECTS Access to this level of education, attitude towards gender and special needs children, health and nutrition, child abuse, neglect and exploitation and insecurity, conflict and disaster have also been cited as stumbling blocks. “Effects of HIV and Aids and socioeconomic activities predispose children to violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation hence minimizing their chances of participating in pre-primary education,” the policy reads.
