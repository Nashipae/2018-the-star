Hundreds of extra security officers were deployed across Lamu on Friday as Muslims in town got free clothes from traders for Idd celebrations.  Traders said this was their gift to the faithful. Hundreds of people thronged Mkunguni Square to receive the garments. This was the first time vendors in town donated garments for Idd. Trader Mahenzo Kalu said the month of Ramadhan has been a fruitful period, they raked in huge profits, he said. Kalu said their decision to gift the customers was inspired by the need to show gratitude and love, especially to the poor. Meanwhile, security was tightened across Lamu and on its borders. Police said they had reports that al Shabaab planned to attack at the end of the month of Ramadhan. Lamu county commander Muchangi Kioi said they intensified patrols on the Lamu-Garsen highway to protect travellers. Security was in place to guard villages, especially those along the Lamu-Somalia border. The five jetties and entry points of Lamu Old Town, a Muslim and tourism site, had more security officers, Kioi said. The jetties are the Mokowe Customs, the Manda Airport, Lamu Mangrove Customs, the KPA and a smaller jetty at Shella. Manda Airport was also protected so flights could continue uninterrupted. Kioi said officers would be on high alert round the clock around mosques and other public places. “We are good to go. We have taken all the necessary measures and can assure residents all is well concerning safety,” Kioi said. The county is literally “sealed off,” he said. “People are secure.” He urged residents to play their part to ensure there is no security lapse.
