Cricket Kenya are facing a possible ban by the International Cricket Council (ICC) if they do not address the current leadership impasse in accordance with their current constitution. In a letter addressed to CK acting chairman Harpar Singh and the executive committee, ICC wondered why CK was yet to fill the vacancies left by the resignation of their various top officials. Since the resignation of CK chairperson, Jackie Janmohmmed, treasurer Ravi Kaul and Development Manager, Raja Sarkar earlier this year, CK are yet to hold a Special General Meeting to replace them. ICC, through Africa Development Manager Patricia Kambarami, said: “Notwithstanding that a considerable period of time has passed, no steps have been taken to regularise matters and, in particular, to take steps to hold a Special General Meeting to fill the vacancies.” Kenya has been given up to end of this month to be compliant with the ICC constitution membership provisions or get sanctioned. In circumstances where CK are unable to demonstrate that they are validly following their constitution at the time of the upcoming ICC Annual General Meeting, then the country will be formally put on notice of its failure to comply with the Membership Criteria, the first step towards a possible suspension. “You are also advised that, pursuant to Article 2.8 (D)(i) of the ICC Constitution, any Associate Member who is found to be non-compliant with certain aspects of the ICC Membership Criteria, including paragraph 2.2(b) thereof, at the time of the ICC’s Annual General Meeting in any given year, will be formally placed on notice at that Annual General Meeting that they have failed to satisfy the Membership Criteria and will be given 12 months following the end of the Annual General Meeting at which they were placed on notice to remedy the issue,” the statement added.
