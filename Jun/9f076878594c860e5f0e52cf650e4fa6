Alcohol outlets close to schools have been blamed for the increase in drug abuse among students. The government wants all bar owners to ensure their premises are at least 300m away from the schools. In Mombasa, the number of students abusing drugs and alcohol has increased. Nacada records show 23.2 per cent of students take alcohol. Others chew miraa (17 per cent), tobacco (15.5 per cent) and bhang (7.5 per cent). In a speech read by Interior CAS Patrick Ntutu, Interior CS Fred Matiangi’ yesterday said the 300m strategy will make schools a drug free zone. The speech was read on Tuesday in celebrations to mark the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking at Tononoka Grounds. The theme was Listen First - Listening to Children and Youth Is The First Step To Help Them Grow Healthy And Safe. “We shall protect the health and development of our children,” Matiang’i said. He added that some secondary school students have already been introduced to drugs. “My ministry, through the National Authority For The Campaign Against Alcohol And Drug Abuse, will come up with a programme targeting schools, families and communities,” the CS said. The programme will train students on the effects of drug abuse. Matiang’i warned those supplying drugs in schools that strict action will be taken against them.
