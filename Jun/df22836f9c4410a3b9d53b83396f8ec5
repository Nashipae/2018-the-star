I don’t want to preempt the work of the task force for now. But our terms of reference are to evaluate the national challenges as outlined in the joint communiquÃ© of 'Building Bridges to a New Kenyan Nation'. We are expected to make practical recommendations and reform proposals. We will consult all cadres of citizens countrywide and then make proposals on implementation modalities for every challenge we identify. What I can say for now is that we are focused on delivering the big task of 'building bridges' so that we can have a unified country embracing diversity and cohesion. After the announcement by Excellencies President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga, today the government officially gazetted the task force. Gazettment is a major step in operationalisation of the memorandum. It sets the ball rolling for the committee in delivering on its mandate. We want to assure the country that we shall not disappoint. We understand the nature of the task before us. We want to ask Kenyans to pray for us as we navigate the next steps. Following gazettement today, we will roll out more activities in the coming days and we shall fully inform Kenyans as time unfolds. As you would be aware, the committee already started its work after the announcement on March 9. It has already held a very important retreat to enable members to draw up the work plan to guide us in executing the task. The members fully understand their mandate and have contextualised their assignment and the terms of engagement. It's all systems go as the committee had already drawn up an extensive work plan. I may not be able to tell when his Excellency the President and his Excellency the former Prime Minister will officially launch the task force. It is not for me to say. I can’t promise it will be in two weeks, one month or three months. That is not appropriate for now. Joint Secretary of the Building Bridges Task Force spoke to the Star
