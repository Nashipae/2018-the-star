An audit firm has regained access to its account, which was frozen for investigations into the alleged theft of Sh9 billion from the National Youth Service. Clyde & Associates, an audit, tax and consultancy firm, said its accounts was one of more than 100 which were frozen for allegedly holding some of the money. The Asset Recovery Agency got the order from court on Monday after pointing out that suspects could move the funds and jeopardise recovery efforts. In a statement on June 3, Clyde said it was paid by a client, whom it did not name, for audit services. "Investigators claim our client received a payment from another company that supplied the NYS," Clyde Atsango said. "We clarified to the investigators that our payment from our client was legitimate and they [unfroze] our bank accounts on June 11." Clyde & Associates is listed as having an account at Standard Chartered Bank, alongside 17 others belonging to different entities in the NYS probe. One hundred and thirteen accounts held in 13 banks have been frozen as detectives zero in the NYS multi billion-shilling scandal. One is that of Anne Ngirita, Lucy Ngirita and Phyllis Ngirita.Â The Ngiritas are among the suspects charged with corruption at the NYS in which Sh468 million has been illegally paid out.
