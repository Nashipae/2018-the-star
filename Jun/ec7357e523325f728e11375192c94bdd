They included fake East African cables worth Sh600,000, 1200 bulbs worth Sh1.8 million, Toyota parts worth Sh500,000. “You see it as East African cables, it is not. It is an imitation it is a counterfeit,” Wanyama said. Other products were baby blankets valued at Sh11 million that were confined together with undergarments valued at 21 million Cooking oil in nine containers valued at Sh10 million was also seized.
