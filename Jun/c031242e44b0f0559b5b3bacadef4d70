Thirty three students were seriously injured after a bus they were using overturned at Mukurweini in Nyeri county on Saturday. The students from Kangubiri Girls' School were heading home for their mid-term holidays when the accident occurred. "Three girls in critical condition rushed to Mukurweini sub-county hospital," Kenya Red Cross said in a tweet. The bus overturned 50 meters from the Tambaya river bridge at the boundary of Mukurwe-ini and Tetu sub-counties. Witnesses said the bus tyre burst forcing the driver to swerve off the road to avoid plunging into the river. About ten students sustained minor injuries during the accident. The learners were heading to Nairobi. The bus, which reportedly belongs to one of the parents, had picked the students from the school. Click here for the latest political news
