Prezzo's Tanzanian girlfriend, Amber Lulu, is smack in the middle of an embarrassing leaked sex tape. Lulu, a video vixen and singer, is seen giving a man identified as Nuh Mziwanda fellatio. The embarrassed video queen has come out to plead for Prezzo's forgiveness saying, "Tulikua home tuna-vibe. It wasn't love. It was an accident." She says the video was leaked by mistake and regrets having an intimate moment with a man she barely loves. Lulu said Prezzo is not happy. "I thought about Prezzo. He is the man that I'm in a relationship with. I disappointed him. We've started arguing, even with his friends and family." Adding "He is my lover, I thought about him all that time when the video leaked. Imemkosesha raha na amani pia. Prezzo ni mume wangu." She then pleaded for the singer's forgiveness, saying she spent the whole day crying and asking the My City My Town hitmaker to understand her situation as a celebrity. "I love Prezzo and I'm asking for his forgiveness. I've cried a lot. I just need him to understand me. I'm human and I make mistakes. I plead for forgiveness. I love him so much. I'm so stressed up right now. It is not good what I did." Other than Prezzo, Lulu says she has in the past slept with former Ya Moto Band lead singer Aslay, who she terms "kiboko yao" when it comes to bedroom matters. "Kwenye game yuko noma. Aslay kiboko kabisa" We tried reaching Prezzo for comment but our calls went unanswered.
