Kenya Power will spend Sh1.63 billion for projects to improve electricity distribution in the North Rift. Kenya Power MD and CEO Ken Tarus said on Wednesday in Eldoret that projects are expected to be complete by end of this year. He addressed a meeting with large power customers. Projects include construction of new substations and upgrading of infrastructure. He said the investment is part of the company’s strategy to ensuring electricity is accessible to all by 2020. “North Rift is served by two main lines — the Turkwel-Lessos and the Olkaria-Lessos lines. They are inadequate to meet growing demand from domestic and commercial customers,” Tarus said. Last month, Kenya Power announced it will spend Sh1.5 billion to implement various projects to improve power supply in Kisumu and the wider Western and Southern Nyanza region.
