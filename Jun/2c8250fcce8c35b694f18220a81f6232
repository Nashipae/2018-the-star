Music streaming service Songa by Safaricom has appointed one of Africa’s top music streaming business experts, Chinasa Udeala, as its new general manager. Chinasa Udeala leaves his role as Boomplay Music's East Africa regional director, where he helped expand the streaming business significantly. He had previously worked as Spinlet East Africa head of business and Africori East Africa head of business and content strategy manager. Africori is one of the continent’s largest content aggregators. “I am very passionate about the Kenyan and African music industry. I want to help establish Songa as the leading platform for local, African and international music in Kenya and on the continent," Udeala said. “I also want to open the platform up to every local artiste so they can upload their music and create an opportunity for them to earn revenue. We are planning to launch a new version this month aimed at low end smart-phones. The new version will be twice as fast, use only small amounts of data, and we will also respond to consumer demand for a lower-priced product. These are very exciting times I am looking forward to." The Songa By Safaricom music streaming service, which was launched in Kenya earlier this year, has been long preparing to ramp up its rollout and speed up expansion into various parts of the country.
