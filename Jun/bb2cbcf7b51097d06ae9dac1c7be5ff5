For instance, goods that enter the country without a Certificate of Conformity will be subjected to 100 per cent inspection on the point of entry. "Cargo passing through Eldoret Airport, used clothes and shoes will also be subjected to 100 per cent inspection," Ongwae said. While at it, imported goods are subjected to pre-export verification of conformity programme. The programme requires goods to be inspected at the country of origin. This means that the testing is done at the country of origin before they are exported to Kenya. About 10 per cent of the imports are subjected to destination inspection and 90 per cent of the imports go through the pre-export verification of conformity testing and inspection programme. Regular sampling and testing is done on PVoC covered products to cross-check the performance of KEBS inspection agents.
