A group of MPs yesterday urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to sack Trade and Industry CS Adan Mohamed (pictured) after revelations that harmful contraband sugar is in the market. Ayub Savula (Lugari), Justus Murunga (Matungu) and Beatrice Adagala (Vihiga Woman Representative) also called for Mohamed’s resignation. They blamed the CS for illegal importations. “The CS should resign. If he fails to do so, the President should sack him. President Uhuru acted swiftly on the NYS scandal bysacking top officials. We expect him to speedily sack Adan,” Savula said. They want the government to cancel all sugar import licences handed out to millers and the Interior ministry to arrest importers whose sugar was found to have been laced with mercury, copper and lead. Adagala said some state officers are believed to have conspired with cartels to push for the illegal trade. He wants them arrested and prosecuted. “The country’s recent sugar import windows should be audited for potential abuse by phony traders who may have taken advantage to ship in illegal consignments. Kenya Bureau of Standards staff who cleared the unfit sugar for domestic consumption should be investigated,” she said. Kebs yesterday rejected claims the sugar had mercury, but admitted it contained copper and lead. MD Charles Ongwae told the National Assembly Committee on Trade that they conducted a chemical test.
