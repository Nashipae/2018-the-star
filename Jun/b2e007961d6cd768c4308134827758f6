The crisis at the Music Copyright Society of Kenya has deepened after one board member resigned amid reports that others would follow suit over graft issues. Bernard Mukaisi, a board member and the director in charge of Rift Valley, resigned over accountability issues. In a letter, he said the resignation was in solidarity with members who for months have cried foul over the running of the MCSK. “Due to unavoidable circumstances arising from persistence governance issues and non-committal of the board in serving the members, I have tendered my resignation,” the letter reads. Mukaisi said despite his resignation he will remain committed to fighting for the rights of musicians, who continue to be oppressed. “I have been involved in a lone-ranger spirited fight against a number of issues facing our members and this has ended up in fallout between me and the rest of the board,” he said. Speaking on the phone, Mukaisi confirmed his resignation, saying he could no longer work with the current board. He said all was not rosy in the society and he expects more board members to resign in the coming days. “Apart from the issue of accountability and financial misappropriation, there is fighting in the MCSK board and this has affected services to our members. I'm still a musician and thus a member of the MCSK and I will continue to fight for the rights of my colleagues until we get what is rightfully ours,” Mukaisi said. A board member who declined to be named talked of plans to call an AGM on June 5. The member said some of the emerging issues include plans to sell MCSK's assets by some cartels, adding that they are against this. “All is not well within this board and we have planned a meeting for June 5 so we can deliberate on the way forward and support our suffering members,” the board member said.
