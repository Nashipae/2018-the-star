Chief magistrate Samuel Soita yesterday extended orders barring police from arresting Palea Stores directors. On June 13, Patrick Kuria and Leah Njeri filed an application at the High Court in Kerugoya to prevent their arrest in the crackdown on contraband and unsafe sugar. Though lawyer Ndegwa Njiru, they filed a new application citing contempt. They said Parklands DCIO David Chebii ignored the order and arrested Njeri on Thursday last week, despite being served. Ndegwa said his client was arrested and detained at the DCIO’s office at Parklands police station without being booked. “My client was arrested by corporal Jared Kamwaro and kept in the DCIO’s office until morning. We seek the indulgence of this court to hear the application of contempt of court before the first application,” he said. On Thursday last week, Kuria and his wife Njeri were granted Sh200,000 conservatory bail. Judge Soita extended the bail to July 18 when judge Lucy Gitari will hear the matter. On June 13, police raided Palea Stores in Ruiru, Kiambu, and Eastleigh, Nairobi, and impounded more than 1,000 50kg sacks of sugar said to contain mercury, copper and a high volume of moisture. They said the content made it harmful for human consumption.
