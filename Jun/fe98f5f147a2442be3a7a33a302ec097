Nakuru Town West MP Samuel Arama and lawyer Kennedy Begi Onkoba have pleaded not guilty to corruption charges before Nairobi chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti. They were accused that on diverse dates in August 2015, they jointly conspired to defraud Ahmed Muhammed Nisar of a plot number 6/95 in Nakuru municipality. The two are facing a total of six counts. The prosecution objected to the admission of cash bail to the accused persons saying the charges they are facing are serious and that the MP may interfere with witnesses. They will remain in custody until tomorrow in the afternoon when the court will make a ruling on their cash bail application.

On Sunday, youths pulled down police several signposts of Railways and others belonging to a Church nearby demanding for his release. "We want Arama's immediate release. No peace without our MP's release,' they chanted. He was later transferred to Nairobi at 4 am today to answer to the charges. His family and supporters expressed their displeasure after it came clear that the MP will not be arraigned in Nakuru law courts. "I have talked to him (Arama) and he has confirmed that he has been moved and not sure where he was being taken. Even his lawyers have not been notified yet," Omoi Makori, the MP's friend said in the morning.
