The Nyanza secondary schools boys’ soccer final which failed to take off at Cardinal Otunga High School, Mosocho in Kisii will be played next week, according to Nyanza Region Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association secretary Thomas Odhiambo. Odhiambo said the game between Kisumu Day and Ringa will be played at a neutral venue. He ruled out Kisumu, Homa Bay and Kisii Counties. “The two schools are from Homa Bay and Kisumu while in Kisii we failed to control the fans so the venues are out of question. We don’t have a problem with the two teams unless they have a problem which we have not been told,” he said. He added: “Schools are currently on half term. We shall consult the Regional Director of Education on the way forward. We want the final played next week when students resume from their half term. Ringa beat Kisii’s Gesero 1-0 while Kisumu Day thrashed Nyarach 4-1 on Saturday morning. The game was postponed on Friday due to darkness. By the time on postponement, the teams were deadlocked at 1-1. After the game, Nyarach, the champions of Migori County protested claiming Kisumu Day fielded ineligible players. The case was however dismissed due to lack of evidence. Organizers moved the final to Kisii School due to fears of insecurity but Ringa Boys fans surrounded their bus and prevented the team from travelling. Kisumu Day coached by Dan Otieno however proceeded to Kisii School but their opponents failed to show up forcing organizers to call off the game. Winners will head to the national term two games to be held at Hill School in Eldoret as from June 20 to 29. In under-16 soccer, little known Riyabu from Kisii defeated Migori County’s Ugari 5-3 on post-match penalties to lift the title while in the girl’s category, Sega from Siaya County beat Kobala 1-0 in the final.
