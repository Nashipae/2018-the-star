Sofapaka coach John Baraza has released utility defender Vitalis Akumu and announced plans to sign four more players as he seeks to bolster his squad for the final push of the Kenyan Premier League title. Baraza, who was confirmed yesterday as the coach after acting since March when he took over from Ugandan tactician Sam Ssimbwa, said Akumu who joined the 2009 champions in January from relegated side, Western Stima, had requested to leave the club so that he could get playing time and increase his chances of being considered for a national team call up in future. Akumu, who has never started any match for Sofapaka since joining the team, has been below Moussa Omar, Rodgers Aloro, Willis Ouma, Yusuf Mohammed, Humphrey Okoti and Kevin Oduor in the pecking order, hence limited chances of a starting place. “Akumu requested if he could leave the team to join Vihiga United where he can get more playing time and we granted him his wish. That means I will be going for a defender to replace him when the transfer window opens,” said Baraza. “I will also be looking for play makers and a striker. In total, I plan to sign four players to enable us have depth,” he added. Sofapaka, who finished second last season are currently placed third on the log on 28 points, the same as second placed Ulinzi Stars, but have an inferior goal difference.
