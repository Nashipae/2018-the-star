Fifty-three people are still admitted to Madogo Health Centre following a cholera outbreak in Tana River. Eighty people tested positive for the deadly disease on Thursday, but some were treated and discharged. This is the second time cholera has hit Madogo this year. in February, a man died of the disease in Vango village. The Kenya Red Cross society says 74 people countrywide have died of cholera since January. Isiolo, West Pokot, Trans Nzoia, Elgeyo Marakwet, Tharaka Nithi and Turkana counties are also affected. Tana River Health executive Mwanajuma Hiribae said test samples for the Tana River victims were taken to Hola and it was verified they have cholera. She spoke to the press yesterday. Hiribae said the main cause of the outbreak is lack of safe drinking water. Water supply to Madogo was cut after Kenya Power disconnected electricity because of floods in the county, she said. Residents who cannot afford to buy clean water from vendors are digging shallow wells in dry river beds. However, the water is contaminated by wild animals. “Kenya Power restored electricity yesterday and water supply will resume,” Hiribae said. “We have a water truck on standby. We will deploy a team of health workers to the affected areas to educate people on hygiene.” Hiribae said health workers are monitoring eateries and food vendors to see if they are part of the problem. The worst affected areas in Madogo include Bulla Vango, Bulla Kodha, Bulla Karatasi and settlements near Madogo Secondary School, she said. Hiribae urged residents to wash their hands after visiting the toilet, boil drinking water and wash fruits before eating. Residents who spoke to the press accused the Tana River County Government of responding to the outbreak slowly.
