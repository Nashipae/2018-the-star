More than 70 people were arrested on Friday in a crackdown on illegal traders at City Market. The arrests brought to 131 the total number of traders arrested in the operation that started on Wednesday to 131. Traders protested the raid and accused city officers of acting without notice. They claimed their merchandise was destroyed some people were roughed up by the askaris and police officers. “We have been working here for many years and we pay license fees to the county. Why do they take our money if we have been operating here illegally?” trader Peter Mwangi asked. The county has said illegal traders have invaded the market, selling substandard and non-inspected meat, thus jeopardising lives and health. County director of operations Peter Mbaya said the traders are not licensed by the county Health department to sell meat and other food products. “They do not have medical certificates, they do not wear official clothing required and they operate outside the stalls in the market,” Mbaya said. Mbaya said the county had received claims of horse and donkey meat being sold at the market. The traders have illegally been slaughtering animals in the market, he said. “That is why anytime you pass near City Market; you are disturbed by the bad smell. The slaughterhouse for meant sold at this market is in Kariokor and all the genuine traders here know that,” he said. In and outside the markets, Health department notices give food vendors seven days to stop preparing food outside the allocated stalls. The notice is dated April 19. “Scaling of fish at the market to stop. All fish should be packed before selling,” reads the notice. It tells all vendors to ensure food is prepared under hygienic condition. All stalls should have licences and food handlers must have medical certificates. Mbaya said all those arrested will be charged and fined up to Sh100,000.
