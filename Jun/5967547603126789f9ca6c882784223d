Kenya has been challenged to cut its import bill by promoting local industries that can make some of the foreign products. Participants at the inaugural American Chamber summit in Nairobi said many goods and services sourced from outside the country can be produced locally. The 60-member trade delegation attending he summit is led by the US undersecretary for Commerce Gilbert Kaplan. This, the forum said, will the create job opportunities and improve the lives of millions of Kenyans. Agro-processing, value addition and textile manufacturing were cited as areas that offer ready areas for investment as the country currently exports raw produce then imports the same as finished products. Kenya imported goods valued Sh1.16 trillion between January-August 2018 a 22.6 per cent increase from Sh940.18 billion over the same period in 2016. With food imports skyrocketing, hitting Sh68 billion in January-April 2018, emphasis for value addition and agro-processing were listed as growth opportunities in the manufacturing sector, to stem post harvest losses that take over 50 per cent of harvest. Energy sector players were challenged to supply affordable, quality and reliable energy to power production and remove down times when factories have to stop work due to power outages. The government was also challenged to come up with predictable and consistent tax laws to help investors in their long term planning. They said ad-hoc tax environments pose a challenge, leaving a number of businesses in the dark as to what amounts of tax to pay, and when. "As business, we do not refuse to pay tax, but we need a consistent tax landscape that will enable us plan years ahead," said a participant from the energy sector. Trade PS Betty Maina said the president will soon announce the setting up of a Presidential Investment Council. The council, she said, will tackle the regulatory challenges which putt off foreign investors.
