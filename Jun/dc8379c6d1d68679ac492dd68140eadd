Uruguay comfortably beat World Cup hosts Russia 3-0 yesterday to seal top spot in Group A courtesy of a Luis Suarez free kick, a Denis Cheryshev own goal and a late Edinson Cavani strike. Russia, who had already qualified along with Uruguay for the last 16 after winning their first two games, played much of the match with 10 men after Igor Smolnikov was sent off for two yellow cards after 36 minutes. Suarez opened the scoring in the 10th minute with his seventh World Cup goal and Uruguay’s lead was doubled in the 23rd minute when Diego Laxalt’s shot took a wicked deflection off Cheryshev. Cavani, Suarez’s strike partner, sealed the victory to open his World Cup account with a goal from close range after a corner in the 90th minute. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia managed their first win in Russia after beating Egypt 2-1 with a last-gasp winner that eclipsed Egyptian talisman Mohamed Salah’s 22nd minute goal. Saudi Arabia finished third in the group standings, scoring their only goals of the tournament and vastly improving from the 5-0 thrashing by hosts Russia in their opening game. It was a bitter disappointment for the Egyptian side, however, with Liverpool striker Salah unable to prevent three consecutive defeats for his country. Egyptian keeper Essam El-Hadary became the oldest player ever to appear at a World Cup at 45-years-old. Saudi Arabia got back in the game with a penalty awarded just before halftime and Salman Al-Faraj scored from the spot. They then pulled off a win in the 95th minute thanks to Salem Al-Dawsari’s angled shot.
