A recruit drowned in a dam at the NYS training college in Gilgil, Naivasha under unclear circumstances on Monday. The 24-year-old was on his way back to the institute from the nearby Karati trading center when he fell into the flooded dam located few meters from the college. Naivasha police moved in to investigate the case and identified the deceased as Kevin Majimbo. Police, with the help of NYS officers, managed to drain the dam before the body was recovered. A witness said guards on duty spotted the trainee, who had sneaked out, returning to the camp and challenged him to stop but he fled. "The guards claim that they came to learn of the drowning in the morning after searching for the recruit in vain," the witness said. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said an inquest file has been opened to probe if there was any foul play. He said the initial investigations pointed to drowning. "The guards claim that the recruit slipped and fell into a dam but we have launched our own investigations following the incident," he said. Click here for the latest political news
