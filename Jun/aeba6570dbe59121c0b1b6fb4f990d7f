Police are set to question directors of four Rai Group companies over thousands of tonnes of imported sugar. The companies are Amnav Ltd, Sukari Industries Limited, West Kenya Sugar Ltd and Pan Paper Mills 2015 Limited. Yesterday, police obtained a list of directors of the four companies. Those expected to record statements with the police include family members of directors. The Rai family also owns Rai Paper Mills in Webuye, Raiply Kenya Limited and Mufindi Paper Mills. A report from the Kenya Bureau of Standards laboratory has revealed the dangers of elements found in sugar samples. The report seen by the Star states that tested sugar was found to have high concentrations of arsenic, copper, lead and mercury. Tonnes of sugar said to contain harmful elements, mould and yeast have been seized in various parts of the country. The Rai family has denied that any seized sugar is part of a consignment they imported. Spokesman Tajveer Rai has denied any wrongdoing and said none of the sugar consignments they imported found its way into the market. Read : 'Does Rai Paper deal with sugar?'
