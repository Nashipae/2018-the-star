Annitah Raey has come out to defend her reasons for posting too much information about gospel artiste Hopekid. Last week, Hopekid released a new song called Perfect, and the Radio Jambo presenter has been playing the song during her show because she says it is well done. However, this has brought controversy in the gospel world, with complaints from one female gospel artiste. Annitah says the artiste has claimed she is posting too much of Hopekid's photos on her Instagram page, adding that the two have a thing. "I have known Hopekid since he began music, and the pictures I post of him really look good, so I have all the reason to like them and crush on him every day. That does not mean we are dating or we are not. The thing is he is a good artiste who is really working so hard. "He is one of the most saved gospel artistes I know, who is not there for money but for the true gospel," she told Word Is.
