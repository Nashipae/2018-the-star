A school in Elgeyo Marakwet has been closed after students went on the rampage, destroying Sh4.1 million property. The students of Kispsoen Boys Secondary School vandalised classrooms and toilets on Wednesday morning before they were sent away in the afternoon. Some students told the Star they were protesting harsh treatment by some teachers. They also wanted mock exams abolished as they wait to sit KCSE exams. But principal John Kigen said students were complaining about lack of adequate toilets and water.They also demanded to be allowed to swear sweaters, he said. Kigen said a group of Form Four ustudents remained in class after evening preps ended at 9.30pm on Tuesday. Watchmen asked them to go to their dormitories. “At 12am on Wednesday, the students agreed to go and sleep but when they reached the dormitories they turned rowdy and woke up other students who were already asleep.” The principal said he asked the students to list their grievances during the Wednesday morning assembly. But one group left angrily and used metal from nearby construction to asmash windows of 16 classrooms and toilets. “Our initial assessment indicates that property worth Sh1.4 million was destroyed,” he said. “We shall inform the parents when to bring the students back.”
