Kehancha police OCS has been issued 22 days to produce in court a suspect who disappeared from the police station on January 17, 2017. A Migori court ordered Kipsaina Serem to produce Baru Nyamohanga — dead or alive on July 20. Serem had been summoned on Wednesday to explain why he should not be jailed for disobeying a court order requiring him to produce the suspect. His lawyer Philip Kisia asked the court for an adjournment to go through the file to be able to defend his client. “I was picked by my client this morning to represent him. The matter is weighty and for the sake of justice we request for adequate time for preparations,” Kisia said. Kenya National Commission on Human Rights lawyer Victor Kamau, who is representing the family said the whereabouts of the suspect is unknown. The court heard that the suspect was arrested with five others on January 12, 2017. He called his wife Rebecca Boke the same day at 6:00 pm to inform her that he had been booked at Kehancha Police Station. Boke went to see her husband the following day but was not allowed to see him until January 14, 2017, at 10:00 am. The suspect was then taken to Kehancha Law Courts on Monday, January 16, 2017, but was not arraigned with the others and was taken back to the cells. His wife said she followed him to the Kehancha Police Station where she saw him but was not allowed to speak to him. The father of three had told his wife that the officers who arrested him took Sh35,000 that he had. Baru's wife was joined in court by Human Rights Defenders from Justice Centers in Nairobi.
