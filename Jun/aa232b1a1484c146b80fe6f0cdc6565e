The Bomet government is set to begin taxing boda boda operators in what Governor Joyce Laboso says will raise revenue. She made the announcement following a day-long meeting with boda boda operators in her office on Saturday. Former Governor Isaac Rutto had in 2013 exempted the group and mama mboga from taxation. But Laboso said for her administration to achieve the desired development growth, all business operators should pay a monthly fee. She said Bomet is the only county where boda boda operators are not taxed.
