City Hall has cautioned traders against ignoring eviction orders and then crying foul when their illegal structures are demolished. On Monday, county officials backed by police officers pulled down illegal riverside buildings at Kariokor. Director of operations at the city inspectorate Peter Mbaya told the Star yesterday the demolitions have been underway along the Nairobi River for almost two weeks. They will continue, he said. “Last week we demolished a two-storey building. This should show those putting up illegal structures that the county is serious with its work,” Mbaya said. Owners condemned demolitions, accusing the county government of not giving them proper notice to vacate. Mbaya dismissed the claims. “No demolitions or evictions are conducted without traders being given notice,” he said. The structures being removed are those less than 30 meters from the Nairobi River, following an assessment by the National Environment Management Authority. A task force formed in April to spearhead the clean-up of Nairobi River ordered removal of illegal structures. Among those affected are mechanics in garages near Grogon market, M-Pesa shops and food kiosks. Environment PS Charles Sunkuli has said Nairobi River Restoration Command Centre has been set up to coordinate the clean-up. He warned individuals encroaching on riparian reserves their structures will be demolished.
