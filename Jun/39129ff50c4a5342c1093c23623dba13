The view over the wonderfully green Athi basin beneath us was looking stunning. After much rain in the past months, the vegetation has grown thick and lush. In the distance, the telltale shape of hundreds of large black dots was visible. We knew that they were buffalo and drove to where they were. They were really having a feast or a “bovine fine dine”, so to speak. We watched them for a while as they went down to the Athi dam to drink! Then we witnessed a very unusual event. A number of the buffalo were very interested in the remains of the ribcage of an antelope, and even licked the carcass. Osteophagy is the practice in which animals, usually herbivores, consume bones. Most vegetation around the world lacks sufficient amounts of phosphate. Phosphorus is an essential mineral for all animals, as it plays a major role in the formation of the skeletal system, and is necessary for many biological processes, including: energy metabolism, protein synthesis, cell signaling and lactation. Phosphate deficiencies can cause physiological side effects, especially pertaining to the reproductive system,as well as side-effects of delayed growth and failure to regenerate new bone. The importance of having sufficient amounts of phosphorus further resides in the physiological importance of maintaining a proper phosphorus to calcium ratio. So I believe that they benefit from the mineral nutrients in the bones of animal carcasses. Next time you are in the park, and you see a herd of buffalo close by, it is good to just switch off your vehicle, and relax while watching them for a while. You never know, maybe you might also witness the unusual behaviour known as osteophagy, when herbivores like buffalo lick or gnaw bones for nutrients.  The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00.
