Mombasa based Milly Glass Works is considering relocating its busines from Kenya, exposing more than 2,000 workers to job loses. The glass bottle manufacturer said the EAC and COMESA trade agreements have opened doors for cheap products from member states. It said the situation will worsen if Kenyan signs another pending trade deal with South Africa. The companyâ€™s consultant, Rajan Salvi said the local manufacturers have been struggling to compete with these cheap imports. The company has been in operating for the last 40 years and had planned a Sh600 million expansion before July, 2019. The decision is now being reviewed and if the commissioned study reveals the business will not survive, expansion will be halted. Kenya is likely to lose to Ethiopia where the company is setting up a Sh48 million plant.
