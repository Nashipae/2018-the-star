An impressive field of drivers and co-drivers converge in Zambia today for Gomes Zambia International Motor Rally 2018 which brings the FIA African Rally Championship (ARC) to the halfway stage. Headed by reigning African Rally Champion, Manvir Baryan, the field includes a long list of Zambian speed merchants among them the crowd -pulling Singh siblings Muna Jnr and Jassy. Former African champion Mohamed Essa is among the top seeded drivers in a strong entry list that is dominated by the home brigade. Essa, one of the most talented Zambian stars of his generation, will start as hot favourite, with the Gomes -Kleevan and Leroy -also going for the jugular on home soil. Tanzanians have not been left out in the quest for the coveted title and will be represented by Ishmail Shermohamed and Ahmed Huwel. Uganda has Fitidis Christakis who is a regular on the ARC front. Also in the ARC mix is Piero Cannobio of Kenya who like compatriot Manvir is contesting for the full continental season. His major competition is likely to come from a host of Zambian drivers. Zambians will be fighting to stop the Skoda Fabia R5 of Manvir which swept the ground with all his ARC opposition down south. The Skoda has since the York Rally been the talk of town. Manvir became the first ever driver from outside South Africa to lay his hand on the coveted ARC Rally of SA christened The York Rally.
