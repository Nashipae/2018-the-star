Nandi Governor Stephen Sang has said he will not relent in his push for the review of Nandi-Kisumu boundaries. Sang said fears by successive leaders from Nandi to address the volatile boundary issue resulted in violence. Speaking during Madaraka Day celebrations at the Nandi Hills Stadium on Friday, he cautioned politicians against making public outbursts on the boundary matter. The county petitioned the National Land Commission to review the boundary with Kisumu county to have Muhoroni and Kisumu East constituencies in Nandi.
