Baringo Senator Gideon Moi was unable to attend a church service owing to bad weather yesterday. “The skies are cloudy, the weather is erratic as it keeps changing every 10 minutes. That made it impossible for him (Gideon) to use his chopper," his Personal Assistant Peter Chelang'a told media. He spoke at Full Gospel Churches of Kenya (FGCK) Bartolomo where more than 500 faithful eagerly awaited for Gideon. They were disappointed to learn that the senator would not be joining them. Chelang'a said there were no elaborate arrangements for Gideon going to the church. He was going to attend service like any other Christian, we were no expecting him to speak politics, he said. FGCK general secretary Dr Eli Rop, who doubles as director of Sayare Christian Radio Station opened the new sanctuary. Rop said Gideon will arrange to visit the church at a later date. Gideon is also the chairman of Kanu. He has declared his interest to run for the top seat after President Uhuru Kenyatta's term ends 2022. Deputy President William Ruto is also eyeing the seat. Both politicians hail from the vote-rich Rift Valley. Some members of the congregation seemed not be satisfied with the explanation for Gideon's absence. “Does it mean the senator does not have a sophisticated chopper that can fly in such weather conditions or at night?” a resident asked. It has been long since the senator visited the county, although his rival Ruto has been frequenting his home turf. The latest visit by Ruto who flew in to receive Baringo South politician Charles Kamuren and other leaders who ditched Kanu last month. Kamuren has been nominated by Jubilee candidate to replace the late Baringo South MP Grace Kipchoim during the by-election. People are still left speculating if Gideon is still interested in the 2022 presidential race, because he is yet to make an official annnouncement.
