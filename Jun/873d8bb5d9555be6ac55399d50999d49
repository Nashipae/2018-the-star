US President Donald
Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort will be arraigned
on Friday following a third superseding indictment against him
by Special Counsel Robert Mueller that lodged additional charges
on accusations of witness tampering. Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is presiding over Manafort's
criminal case in federal court in Washington, DC, set the
arraignment to coincide with a previously scheduled hearing over
whether Manafort's bail conditions should be revoked in light of
the witness tampering accusations. Manafort is currently under house arrest and required to
wear GPS monitoring devices. The indictment last week included new counts against
Manafort and Manafort aide Konstantin Kilimnika, a political
operative with alleged ties to Russian intelligence, for
allegedly tampering with witnesses regarding their lobbying for
Ukraine. The additional charges could increase pressure on Manafort
to cut a deal and cooperate with Mueller's probe, legal experts
said. Friday's indictment marked the first time that Kilimnik, who
in previous court filings was referred to only as "Person A",
was named. Mueller has said Kilimnik has links to Russian spy
agencies, which Kilimnik has denied. Click here for the latest political news
