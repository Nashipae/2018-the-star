The International Criminal Court on Friday overturned the war crimes conviction of Congolese politician Jean-Pierre Bembaon appeal. Presiding judge Christine Van den Wijngaert said that Bemba could not be held responsible for atrocities carried out by troops under his control in neighbouring Central African Republic. She also said that trial judges had failed to consider the efforts he made to stop crimes once he became aware of them. Bemba, a former vice-president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, had been sentenced to 18 years in prison in June 2016 for alleged crimes including murder and rape. He had been found guilty of war crimes committed in the neighbouring country between 2002 and 2003. His supporters cheered from the gallery. Click here for the latest political news
