Britam will pay Sh756 million dividends after shareholders approved a 35 cents per share payout for the year ending December 31. This is a 17 per cent rise from the previous year. The company attributed the rise to enhanced dividends earned by the group mainly from subsidiaries which recorded improved performance despite a dip in net income earnings to Sh1.9 billion. Net profit slipped 78 per cent from Sh2.4 billion to Sh527 million.  IFC REJECTION Total income grew by 24 per cent to Sh27.8 billion, from Sh22.4 billion in 2016, attributed to a 15 per cent increase in gross earned premium to Sh23.3 billion and a strong performance in equities. Britam also attracted new international strategic investors - the International Finance Corporation - which injected Sh3.6 billion for a 10.3 per cent stake in the company, and AfricInvest, a Pan African private equity fund which acquired a 14. 3 per cent stake in the group for Sh5.7 billion. Group MD Benson Wairegi said the partnerships were an indication of their confidence in the listed firm. The asset management business recorded strong performance, with assets under management growing 18 per cent from Sh108.9 billion in 2016 to Sh128.9 billion in 2017. Group total assets grew by 18 per cent to Sh99 billion up from Sh84 billion the previous year, while shareholdersâ€™ funds increased by 27 per cent on the back of a strong performance and issuance of new shares to the International Finance Corporation.  REVENUE GROWTH The general insurance business revenues grew three per cent to Sh8.1 billion from Sh7.8 billion in 2016. International businesses grew in both profits and revenues, and accounted for 13 per cent of the net insurance business revenue, 13 per cent of total income and eight per cent of the assets of the group last year. Total revenues grew 12 per cent to Sh4.1 billion from Sh3.5 billion in 2016.
