Kerio River burst its banks on Friday causing water to flow to irrigation schemes in Turkana East and damage crops. Disaster executive Charles Lokyoto reported that Elelea Nakwamomwa and Morulem were among the affected schemes. "Floodwaters have wreaked havoc downstream as the flowed into 10 irrigation farms," he said. "Over 3,000 farmers were affected and exposed to the danger of hunger in the next season because they wont harvest anything." Lokyoto added that most of the sub-county was inaccessible by road, following heavy rains. "The rains have cut off Turkana East as most seasonal rivers have eroded roads, creating deep gullies and rendering the whole constituency inaccessible by vehicles," the executive said. Rebbeca Lokunoit said farming was the only she could feed and educate her children. "All my animals were driven away by bandits. I had to venture into farming but the river swept my crops which were all mature," she said. Farmer Simon Eregai asked the county and national irrigation boards to help them construct dykes that will block river water from getting into their fields. Lokyoto told the people that the county was working with partners on assisting the victims. Click here for the latest political news
