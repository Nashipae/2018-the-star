Businessman Jimi Wanjigi's lawyers have protested against the "constant" harassment of their client and threatened to take steps to ensure his protection. In a letter dated June 5, J.A.B Orengo Advocates claimed state officers have illegally raided Wanjigi's home while gun-totting ones have harassed him on the streets, in purported service of court warrants. The lawyers led by Siaya Senator and Senate Minority Leader James Orengo said police have also constantly trailed Wanjigi. "We wish to record our displeasure with the conduct of the state and some of its officers in engaging in acts of persecution of our client through abuse of the criminal justice system," the letter stated. The lawyers further alleged that the government is planning to continue to criminally profile the businessman through filing frivolous charges against him in several courts across the country. Part of the plan, they said, is to dump illegal guns in property associated with Wanjigi or people linked to him so as to accuse him of having an illegal cache of weapons. "We write to categorically put it on record that our client does not own or posses any illegal weapons and that all guns that have been in his possession were lawfully acquired in complete compliance with the laws of the land," the letter read. It was coped to the Director of Public Prosecution, National Police Service and the Inspector General of Police. "We call upon your offices to clamp down on your officers engaging in the stated illegal acts, whose aim is to harass and besmirch the character of our client." The lawyers threatened to take measures to protect and defend Wanjigi from ongoing and intended illegal harassment. Others in the team are John Khaminwa, Nelson Havi, Julie Soweto, Kiogora Mugambi and Jackson Awele. Click here for the latest political news
