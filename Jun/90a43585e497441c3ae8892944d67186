Africa 10,000m Africa champion Alice Aprot will be seeking a continental brace after qualifying for the Africa Senior Championships set for Nigeria in August. Aprot, of Kenya Prisons booked her ticket despite falling to Kenya Defence Forces’ Pauline Korkwiang during the national championships-cum-trials at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Korkwiang ran a tactful race to clock 31:59.1 with Aprot second in 32:16.5. Sandra Felis Chebet missed out on the two automatic slots after clocking 32:16.5 for third. Gladys Koech set the early pace in the 25-lap race under warm conditions alongside Beatrice Begi and former Commonwealth Games 5,000m champion Lucy Kabuu. The runners then went into a single file in the sixth lap with Koech still in the lead as Korkwiang and the big guns stayed in the back. Commonwealth Games 10,000 silver medallist Stacy Ndiwa then surged to the front and led for four laps. At the halfway point, Rosemary Wanjiru joined Ndiwa at the front with Korkwiang and Aprot right behind them. Ndiwa showed weariness at the start of the 15th lap and Aprot seized the lead with Korkwiang in hot pursuit. Korkwiang bid her time as she kept tabs on Aprot with the duo opening a sizeable gap on the rest of the field. Korkwiang made her move with two laps to go and Aprot could not respond. “The last time I represented Kenya was at the World Cross Country Championships in Punta Umbra in Spain in 2011. I have battled injuries (hip) for the past two seasons but am glad I won today. It was not an easy race,” said Korkwiang. “I am confident I can win at the African event since I have trained hard and I hope to be in peak condition.” World and Commonwealth Games 1500m champion Elijah Manangoi cruised to the final of his specialty by clocking 3:48.1 ahead of Laban Kiplimo (3:48.4), Evans Keitany (3:48.8) and Joseph Karanja (3:49.1) World silver 1500m silver medallist Timothy Cheruiyot also stormed today’s final after winning his heat in 3:46.54 ahead of Charles Simotwo (3:46.75), Collins Cheboi (3:46.80) and Kumari Taki (3:46.87) Jeremiah Mutai won the other heat in 3:47.47 with Robert Biwott (3:47.69) and John Kibui (3:48.60) in tow. Winny Chebet took the first 1500m women’s heat in 4:24.10 with Mary Kuria second in 4:24.96. Josephine Chelangat finished third in 4:25.33 ahead of Judith Chepngetich, who posted 4:28.56.
