A house help who allegedly stabbed a mother and her three-month-old baby to death in Muhoroni, Kisumu county has been arrested in Uganda. The police have applied for an extradition of the house help, whose name is yet to be disclosed, following her arrest on Sunday. County police commander John Kamau said they are liaising with their counterparts in the neighbouring country for the woman, a Ugandan citizen, to be transferred to Kenya to face trial. He said the woman was rescued from a mob having been spotted after the news of the Kisumu killing spread. She is likely to be charged with the murder of Elizabeth Achieng, 26, and her son who were found in their house in Shauri Yako Estate in Muhoroni by neighbours on Friday. Achieng' worked as a community health officer at Kadenge Health Centre in Muhoroni. Her body had several knife wounds on the chest and burns on the left side.
