A study by the International Rescue Committee indicates that Kenyans oppose citizenship for most refugees. They also want Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps closed. The survey conducted in May revealed that 58 per cent of Kenyans surveyed disapprove of citizenship for them. More than half of Kenyans, 54 per cent, support closure of the camps. They want refugees sent back to their homes. However, Kenyans support citizenship for refugees born here or raised in the country from a young age. Sixty-two per cent agree refugees who have had legal residence for 20 years are welcome to stay. By law, refugees may apply for citizenship if they meet requirements, including having seven years of legal residence. In 2016, the state threatened to close the camps, saying they were sheltering terrorists and Kenya had already done enough to help. A court order stopped closoure. But the survey suggests security is not a major concern for Kenyans. Only 27 per cent of the people interviewed believe hosting the refugees is a security threat. Kenyans consider humanitarian need the primary reason to continue supporting refugees. IRC in partnership with Twaweza did the survey using a tool called Sauti za Wananchi, a mobile phone survey. It was developed by Twaweza and used in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Data was collected from 1,672 respondents in Kenya, 1,606 in Tanzania, and 1,925 in Uganda. Citizens age 18 and older were surveyed. The target population was citizens of 18 years and above. In each country, 2,000 individuals in 200 enumeration areas were obtained â€” a sample sufficient for a confidence interval of +/- 5 percentage points. The World Bank gave Kenya Sh10 billion to improve access to basic social services and conserve the environment around refugee settlements. They are Garissa, Turkana and Wajir counties. Kenyans are divided on whether the state should borrow to support refugees.
