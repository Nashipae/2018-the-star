Former ACK Bishop Johannes Angela was arrested on Friday evening for allegedly defiling a 14-year-old minor. Angela was apprehended in Bondo after the class eight orphaned girl raised the alarm. She made the revelation at a local children's home and was taken for a check-up that proved she had been sexually abused. The 66-year-old, who served as Anglican Church Bishop for 17 years before retiring, was arrested immediately. A source said the girl had lived with the cleric for more than two years. The source said police raided Angela's home and took him to Lwala Kotiende police station. Bondo OCPD Paul Kiarie said investigations were on and that Angela will be arraigned on Monday at a Bondo court. He said the minor was placed in their protection for the sake of a proper probe. The Bishop who retired last year has been on the spot for allegedly faking his own kidnapping to gain the public's sympathy. Read: Bondo bishop kidnapped Click here for the latest political news
