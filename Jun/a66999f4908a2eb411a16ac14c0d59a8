Nairobi county yesterday acknowledged owning “Maryland account”. Acting Finance executive Charles Kerich said the bank account is for donor–funded projects managed by its Health docket and the University of Maryland. He said at City Hall that the county Treasury opened two accounts with the Cooperative Bank, City Hall branch, on March 28 and April 24 — the Nairobi City County/University of Maryland Health Services Account 01141232396611 and Nairobi City County Bursary Fund Account 01141232396612. The bursary account was opened in line with Nairobi City County Bursary Act of 2014. Kerich said the accounts do not earn interest. “Given that both accounts were opened more or less the same time and when processing payments via Integrated Financial Information Management System, only the payee appears on the work bench screen ,” Kerich said. He also said that the accountants preparing the payments had erroneously picked the health donor fund account instead of the bursary account. “The funds were transferred from Nairobi City County Revenue Account at the Central Bank on the May 21 to the health donor account,” Kerich said. He said that on May 28, the bank notified the county it could not print bursary cheques because the money was sent to a different account. “We took immediate remedial action the next day, May 29, and directed the Cooperative Bank to transfer the money to the bursary account. The instruction was effected the same day.”
