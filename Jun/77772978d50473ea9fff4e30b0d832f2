Baringo Senator Gideon Moi yesterday made a surprise trip to Mombasa during which he met Governor Hassan Joho. The move is seen as a counter to Deputy President William Ruto’s charm offensive at the Coast. Both Gideon and Ruto are expected to contest the presidency in 2022.

Moi’s move is seen as reaching out to influential Coast politicians to win their support. The senator landed in Mombasa in a chopper, met Joho at the governor’s office before flying back to Nairobi.
