The Appeals Court on Thursday upheld the decision to jail UK terror suspect Jermaine Grant for nine years in forgery-related charges. Justice Alnashir Visram said at the Mombasa law court that Grant's sentence was justified, adding that his appeal lacked merit. Grant was sentenced in 2015 by Judge Martin Muya after the prosecution appealed a lower court decision to acquit him. He was jailed for nine counts of forgery, including presenting fake documents in order to obtain an ID. Visram said Grant had raised a question of whether his sentence was justified to run concurrently or consecutively. He said the crimes were committed during different times and in a different location and therefore, the sentence was justified. "The sentences running consecutively was justified and is therefore upheld by this court." Judge Visram further said the appellate bench could not find any fault in Muya's decision. He said the evidence was corroborated by numerous witnesses. In his ruling, Muya said the law provides for a maximum of three years imprisonment for each of the nine counts. This was save for the fifth count of attempting to procure registration, which carries a maximum sentence of one year. Earlier, resident magistrate Anastancia Ndung’u had acquitted Grant citing lack of sufficient evidence. But judge Muya said the prosecution, led by state counsel Jami Yamina, had provided their case against Grant. The Briton procured a fake birth certificate and a Kenyan primary school leaving certificate. Other charges against him were making a false statement for the registration of birth. He also faced three counts of procuring a document by false pretence. He was also booked for attempting to falsely procure registration.
