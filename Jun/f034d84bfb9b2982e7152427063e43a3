Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o has named his new Chief of Staff following the sacking of Patrick Ouya. Joseph Omondi's appointment took effect on June 13, according to a statement by the Governor's Press Unit. He was a lecturer of Mathematics and Statistics at Masai Mara University. Nyong'o terminated Ouya's contract on grounds of gross misconduct after police questioned him on alleged threats to his boss's life. Ouya had been accused of threatening to shoot the Governor and Deputy Governor Mathews Owili. In the sack letter on Tuesday, Nyong'o said the officer was found in breach of Article 75 of the Constitution and Section 40 of the County Government Act. The county boss filed a report at Central police station, claiming that Ouya, "in an unexplained and unwarranted fit of rage", accosted his security personnel and attempted to forcefully enter his office. The officer was then arrested by Flying Squad officer who took him to the station for grilling. He denied the allegations.
