Kitutu Masaba MP Shadrack Mose has dismissed claims discrimination and victimization in the disbursement of national government CDF bursaries as ‘hopeless allegations’. The MP further said the claims are ‘evil thoughts’. “There is nothing like that you can go to the constituency and find out. The disbursement was done transparently,” he added. The MP was responding to the accusations leveled against him by the Nyamira Youth Forum. The forum through the secretary Amos Onsoti said several university students were left out of the bursary disbursement because of politics. “Issues of equity and transparency in the disbursement of the 2017/2018 financial year should be addressed. Some of us are likely to abandon our studies if we doing get the bursaries,” said Onsoti. The statement was also signed by Abuga Makori (secretary), Sheppernard Nyakundi (vice chairman) and Angela Kwamboka (treasurer). He said 22 of the genuine students who did not get bursaries will be financed by well wishers. They will receive Sh11, 000 each. Through a WhatsApp group Kitutu Masaba Forum, they raised Sh22, 000 for Wesley Okibo a student at Kisii University who was among those left out. They demanded to know from the MP why people aged 35 years and above were left out. The forum also expressed their displeasure at the MP’s performance both in parliament and the constituency telling him to wake up or go home. They threatened to recall the MP at the right time if he fails to address their grievances.
