A section of the clergy has asked the government to declare corruption a national disaster. They also want the law changed to allows for life imprisonment for corrupt persons. Led by NCCK Upper Eastern Chairman David Ngige, the religious leader said corruption is cancer that is killing the nation. “We have considered this matter and laud efforts by the government to expose and prosecute corruption but that is not enough. We wish to highlight that more needs to be done,” Ngige said. He said declaring it national disaster will intensify and campaigns against it. “Past corruption offenders should be offered an amnesty from prosecution for one year if they return what they stole and name their partners in the looting. Ruthlessly enforce asset recovery to take back what any person has acquired through corruption,” Ngige said.
