Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o has terminated the contract of Chief of Staff Patrick Ouya on grounds of gross misconduct. The county boss, in a letter on Tuesday, said the officer was found in breach of Article 75 of the Constitution and Section 40 of the County Government Act. "Please hand in all the county property and equipment in your possession to the county secretary," the letter reads in part. The developments followed after police grilled the official over threats to Nyong'o's life. He is accused of threatening to shoot the governor and DG Mathews Owili. The governor registered the complaint with the police at the Kisumu Central police station. Flying Squad officers arrested Ouya at Prosperity House and took him to the station for questioning. "The officer recorded a statement and left the station," county police commander John Kamau told the Star on phone. Through his press unit, Nyong'o regretted the fresh altercation which occurred in his office on Tuesday morning. He said that the Chief of Staff, "in an unexplained and unwarranted fit of rage", accosted his security personnel and attempted to forcefully gain entry into the office. This was while a meeting with "very important guests" took place, he said adding Ouya threatened to shoot everybody.
