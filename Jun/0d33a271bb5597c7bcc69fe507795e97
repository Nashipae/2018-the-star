Kabras Sugar surpasses quality standards, West Kenya Sugar Company has said following claims that it it unfit for consumption. The claims arose on social media after sugar repackaged in Kabras bags was seized by government agencies. COFEK said results of tests conducted at the government chemist showed the impurities in the sugar are capable of damaging internal organs. In a statement on Tuesday, the company noted that it was not the proprietor of sugar that was impounded. "The quality of our brand meets and indeed surpasses all the requisite quality standards. We shall provide any assistance requested by authorities in relation to ongoing investigations," Managing Sirector Tejveer Rai said. Rai said they had voluntarily provided government inspectors with unfettered access to all their facilities. "The samples of sugar that we imported are currently undergoing testing. We have no doubt that the results will confirm the integrity of our products and serve to counter the inaccurate reports in the media," he said. "We are often a target of counterfeiters and unscrupulous traders and packers who import and pass off contraband products in our name."
