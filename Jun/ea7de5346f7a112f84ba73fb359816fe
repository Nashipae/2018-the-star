Hamisa Mobetto has denied rumours that she is pregnant with another child by Diamond Platnumz. The video vixen and Tanzanian model said she is not pregnant, at least not with Diamond’s child. “Sina uja uzito. Lakini tena ikitokea ninao, ni jambo la heri. Nitazaa, hata watoto kumi, ishirini nitazaa, kwa nini nisizae? [I’m not pregnant, but if it happens that I am,  then it’s a good thing. I will give birth. I can even give birth to 10 or 20 kids, why not?]” Hamisa is an only child. Her mother recently said she was willing to take care of Hamisa’s children, and that she always advises her not to get rid of pregnancies. Hamisa is a mother of two; one fathered by Majizzo and another by Diamond Platnumz.
