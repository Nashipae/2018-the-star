Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Services needs Sh1.4 billion to ensure safety of food, managing director Esther Kimani said yesterday. The money will be used to enhance production and grow the export market, she said. Kimani spoke during the opening of the second phytosanitary conference at Kephis in Nairobi. The MD said EU requirements for the export market keep changing and farmers have to be dynamic to maintain the high standards. “As Kephis, we need more resources to mobilise and educate farmers on the new changes. This will help them be compliant with the EU standards so they can be competitive in the international market,” Kimani said. Local farmers, Kimani said, are losing lucrative opportunities in the local and global market as their export commodities fail to meet standards. Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago said farmers need to be supported with new innovations and hybrid planting materials so they can increase food production. “There is a need for the national and county governments to increase funding,” he said. Mandago said plant materials being imported by Kephis will protect against use of low quality materials that lead to low food production. Click here for the latest political news
