The national government has committed to upgrade the remaining part of Embu Moi Stadium to international standards. The county government has completed 70 per cent construction work. Sports CS Rashid Echesa held a meeting with Governor Martin Wambora on the completion of the stadium. “We discussed how we can plan out programmes to set up talent academies in sports and performing arts,” he said. The stadium will have a tartan track with playing surface, modern seats and a media centre.
