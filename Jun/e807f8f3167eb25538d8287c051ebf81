President Kenyatta has called for lifestyle audits to crack down on corruption. But now the waters are being muddied by politicians calling for audits of all sorts of people, including MP Oscar Sudi's call for a retrospective audit of President Jomo Kenyatta. For a long time Kenya has had a serious problem with corruption. But it would be counter-productive to start going back in history to investigate the many dodgy deals that happened in the past. It would distract us from pursuing the more important crackdown on corruption in Kenya today. Even the present lifestyle audits should keep a very narrow focus. Let the lifestyle audits be confined to just CSs, PSs, under-secretaries, parastatal MDs and FDs, MPs and top police and army officers. It is possible to conduct a lifestyle audit of a few hundred people but it would be impossible to audit tens of thousands, including those long dead. If we over-extend lifestyle audits, it will result in the collapse of the process and allow corrupt top officials to escape without penalty.
