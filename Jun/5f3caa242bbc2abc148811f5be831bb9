A bus conductor who allegedly pushed a security guard out of a moving vehicle over Sh10 on Sunday leading to his death has been arrested. The security guard died after he was ran over by the bus. The driver of the KBW 110E bus, which belongs to City Shuttle Sacco and plies the Kangemi-CBD route, is still at large. The incident took place near St Marks ACK Church on Waiyaki Way. Walter Ochieng was on his way to work. Officers say the conductor, who is being held at Parklands police station, denied pushing Ochieng out of the vehicle. “We are appealing to the passengers who were in that vehicle to give us information to help us with investigations,” Nairobi DCI boss Ireri Kamwende said yesterday.
