Garissa Woman Rep Anab Gure yesterday condemned the Wednesday attack in which five GSU officers died when their truck hit an improvised electronic device in Liboi. The IED was planted on the road between Harhar and Deg-Elima near the Kenya-Somali border. Three other officers were seriously injured during the 8.30am incident and were airlifted to Nairobi for specialised treatment. Gure told the press in Garissa the attack was barbaric and cowardly. She said Islam is a religion of peace and considers attacks on innocent human beings a grave sin. “I call on security forces to flush out the perpetrators from their hideouts and bring them to book,” Gure said.
