Garissa Governor Ali Korane has put contractors on notice, saying none of them will be paid for shoddy work. Engineers are under firm instructions not to sign certificates of completion if the contracts are not done in accordance with the specifications, Korane said. “If you fail to perform, we shall take the job from you and pay you for what you have done and give the contract to somebody else,” he said. An honest profit is maximum 20 per cent of the contract, Korane said. The governor said contractors will be paid immediately they present their certificates of completion. He said there are many cartels and commission agents who think they are going to make a killing from the county government of Garissa. “I’m sorry to disappoint you, that will not happen under my watch,” Korane said. He spoke at Bulla Iftin, where he commissioned a Sh1 million borehole. The governor said 94 contracts have been given out and funds set aside. He said his administration is working to deliver the pledges made during the campaign. Senator Yussuf Haji said he will mobilise all the MCAs, elected leaders and the community to support Korane. Meanwhile, hundreds of Muslims in Garissa on Friday thronged various grounds to celebrate Eid-Ul-Fitr. Men, women and children started flocking to the grounds as early as 6.30am to get space for the last prayers that end 30 days of fasting. Korane and Haji joined the faithful at General Mohamud Idd grounds.
