Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa yesterday termed reports on plans to remove her from the powerful Parliamentary Service Commission as “mere rumors”. She was reacting to a newspaper report that ODM had written to the speaker of the National Assembly seeking guidance on how to remove her from the position. Jumwa said she is treating the reports as hearsay until she gets official communication from the speaker. She spoke to journalists in her office in Malindi. Jumwa said she had no differences with ODM leader Raila Odinga. She was among 10 MPs who snubbed ODM’s parliamentary group meeting organised by Raila in Mombasa on Monday. She said ODM did not elect them and they chose to be in the party. Jumwa said she will support DP William Ruto’s presidential bid in 2022, adding that it is her constitutional right. The decision to have her removed is believed to have been caused by her decision to support the DP after she openly declared in a rally in Taita Taveta in March. Since then, Jumwa and 10 MPs from the region have been seen following the DP around and endorsing him as their choice. “My stand will not change its my constitutional right I have freedom as stated in the Bill of Rights Chapter 4. As Jumwa, I will support William Samoei Ruto in 2022,” she said.
