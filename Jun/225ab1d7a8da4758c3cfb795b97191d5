Nyamira Deputy Governor Amos Nyaribo was yesterday forced to flee the wrath of nurses demanding payment. He was launching the county bursary kitty at the Jamhuri Gardens. His efforts to calm down the nurses were in vain as they shouted at him. “Liar! Liar! We want our money. Pay us now. Get our cash or we go home,” the nurses shouted. The county enforcement officers and Nyaribo’s bodyguards had a hard time trying to get the deputy governor in his car. Nyaribo tried to explain the delay of the nurses’ salaries but they did not want to listen. They kept on shouting. The nurses have not been paid for two months. Addressing journalists in his office later, the deputy governor said the nurses should go back to work as he works on their pay. “The pay delay is affecting the county. We have made arrangements and they are going to be paid on Thursday,” Nyaribo said. He further said the delay of the nurses’ salaries is as a result of the CBA deal reached by the nurses and the Council of Governors. The increase was allocated in the middle of the financial year, Nyaribo explained. The nurses, through secretary Richard Orutwa, promised to continue disrupting services at the Nyamira County Referral Hospital until their salaries are paid. “It’s better we go home. The county government is joking with us. We are telling them there is no work if they will not pay us,” Orutwa said. Click here for the latest political news
