The process of getting a new owner for Imperial Bank might take longer than anticipated. Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation CEO Mahmoud Mohamed said the organisation is still working on the due diligence of investors who have expressed interest to take over the bank. “We had told the investors to go and improve on their bids, which they have. We now expect to complete the process by mid July,” Mohamed told the Star on the phone yesterday. Central Bank placed IBL under receivership on October 13, 2015 following the “unsafe and unsound” business condition at the bank. Since 2015, the receivership period has been extended at least three times with the latest being June 17 last year when the High Court granted a 12-month extension. Last October, the regulator said that selection of the final investor would happen before January 27. LIQUIDATION FEARS In an Interview with the Star, Imperial Bank depositors’ lobby group chairperson Mohamoud Khambiye said they are tired, but willing to wait for a solution. “We are tired but also resilient. Other than liquidation of the bank, we are willing to be part of any other proposed solution,” he said. Khambiye said depositors are interested in a similar arrangement to that of Chase Bank and Mauritius-based SBM Bank. They want 80 per cent of their deposits to be paid immediately the investor takes over. For the remaining 20 per cent, they want Central Bank to go after directors to recover the funds. In January, KDIC revealed three banks had expressed interest in investing in Imperial Bank. However, Mohamed said KDIC was not impressed with the bids and asked them to express their interest afresh.
