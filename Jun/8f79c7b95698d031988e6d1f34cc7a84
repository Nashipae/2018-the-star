Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi has been asked to reinstate sacked employees as part of a truce between him and predecessor Peter Munya. President Uhuru Kenyatta brokered the peace deal last week, when he led Madaraka Day celebrations in Meru. He asked Kiraitu and Munya to work together. Munya now wants Kiraitu to also continue with the development projects he initiated. He said working together will spur growth. Speaking during his home-coming ceremony Maili Tatu Stadium in Meru on Sunday, Munya asked Kiraitu to pay supplies and contractors. The governor terminated the contracts of 1,030 casual workers on January 31. In March, MCAs recommended that the employees be reinstated on permanent and pensionable terms. They said the sacking was illegal because Kiraitu flouted the Employment Act. On Sunday, nominated MCA Karimi Njeru said most of those sacked were perceived supporters of Munya. “The President has urged us to stop retrogressive politics and work together for developments. We want the governor to develop this county. We allocated money to build this stadium, that should be done. There are other water projects, let them be accomplished,” Munya said. Supporters received the news of a truce with Kiraitu in surprise and asked Munya to recant it. Munya said the move was Uhuru’s directive. He promised the residents that the deal will result in more development projects by both the county and the national governments.
