ANC deputy party leader and Lugari MP Ayub Savula has said that announcement of new plans to introduce lie detector for top accounting and procurement officers in government will be a waste of tile without a legal framework. Savula said that the Attorney General must bring to parliament legislation that seek to anchor new strategies in the fight against graft for passage. On Madaraka Day last Friday, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced fresh vetting plans for top accounting and procurement officers — complete with polygraph or lie-detector tests — to be carried out by the end of this month. "Those who shall fail the vetting will stand suspended," Uhuru announced, saying that corrupt officials must be put in jail. Heads will roll and they will include senior officials,” he said. But Savula said that the polygraph will only work if it is entrenched into the law. He said that this will avoid its circumventing by culprits through courts arguing its illegal like the Alco blow was dealt a blow in the fight against drunk driving. “The government should not engage in rhetoric and ensure the relevant laws are amended to include the new mechanisms and ensure their full implementation,” he said. Savula also suggested that the constitution be amended to split the prosecutorial powers into three to speed up prosecution of corruption suspects.
