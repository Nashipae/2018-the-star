Embu
county assembly Majority whip Margaret Kariuki has raised fears for her life, saying she has been threatened by unknown people. The nominated MCA said the people had threatened to destroy her property. She made the claims when she gave a personal statement in the assembly on Thursday. Arsonists have previously attempted to torch her vehicle, she said. Kariuki said she had found two cigarette butts in the engine bay of her car when she took it for servicing. "This discovery led to a conclusion that there was an attempt on my life. The cigarette butts were meant to trigger an explosion of engine," she said. She said it could not be immediately established
how the cigarettes found their way under the bonnet of the car. The car had previously been parked outside the MCAsâ€™ offices at Ghanshyam Plaza in
Embu town before the discovery was made. She
called for the strengthening of security for MCAs within the precincts of the assembly. "We want the administration department to put in place measures for maximum security of members and their while
attending to legislative business," Kariuki said. She
asked the county assembly service board to recruit
more security wardens. Speaker
Josiah Thiriku said security of members and safety of their property could not
be taken for granted. He
promised to engage the assembly leadership to ensure proper safety precautions
were put in place to safeguard members possessions within and
outside the chambers. Thiriku asked members to consider
reviving the County Assembly office complex project that stalled two years ago. The construction stalled due procurement concerns raised by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption
Commission and the Public Procurement Oversight Authority. Thiriku
said it was difficult to assure MCAs of security when they were in rented offices. "It would be easier if members were housed
in a building fully owned by the county government," he said.
