As the world marked International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking on Tuesday, addicts in Lamu complained that they were dejected because the society despises them. Khadija Shebwana said drug abusers in Lamu town are shunned by a community that is supposed to help them lead productive lives. "Our efforts to get the government's attention have been fruitless," she said. Shebwana said many had abused drugs for years but were willing to undergo rehabilitation. “Ask around. Many of us are still hooked because we don’t know how to stop. You know with drugs, you just can't wake up and say you’ve stopped. It doesn’t work that way. "We understand there’s a drug one can be given so as to deal with the withdrawal symptoms. We don’t have that in Lamu and no one seems to care." Persons who inject drugs are weaned off the substances through Medically Assisted Therapy (MAT), which involves administering methadone, a narcotic pain reliever, orally, and counseling. Athman Khamis, who admitted to being an addict for more than 13 years, said county leaders play games by promising assistance that does not come. “So many times we are told to register for rehabilitation only to discover that it was nothing serious. It seems our names are used for some other purpose ... money-making maybe." Lamu Governor Fahim Twaha said, however, that the county and Red Cross were setting up a rehabilitation centre in Hindi town, Lamu West. Speaking in Lamu recently, Twaha called for patience by those willing to undergo the transformation. “We understand the lack of jobs has made many youths turn to drugs. We are doing everything we can to see to it that those willing to recover are assisted. The Hindi facility should be ready very soon," he said.
