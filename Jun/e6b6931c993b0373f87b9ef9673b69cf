Nandi Governor Stephen Sang has said the county will account for every coin in the Sh7.7 billion budget for the 2018-2019 financial year. “I will not get tired of giving residents of Nandi facts and the truth about all the work my administration will be undertaking. We will use resources diligently,” the governor said. Health, roads and infrastructure, education, agriculture, land, water and the environment will get the lion’s share of the budget. Sh1.2 billion will go to pending bills and incomplete projects. Contractors want to be paid Sh800 million. Sang spoke on Thursday in Kapsabet where he issued Sh60 billion bursary cheques to needy students. Earlier in the day, Finance executive Alfred Lagat tabled the budget in the assembly. The estimates are an increase from Sh6.4 billion in the last financial year. Sang said emphasis will be on raising revenue collection. This is the governor’s first budget since he took over from Cleophas Lagat after defeating him in the General Election last year. Lagat told the assembly they would focus on swift economic growth and quality services. The county will implement recommendations by the Auditor General to curb mismanagement, he said. “We are verifying the pending bills and stalled projects inherited from the previous administration,” Lagat said. An audit by the county government revealed there are 300 non-existence projects inherited by the current administration. Lagat said revenue collection has increased by 80 per cent in the last seven months. At the same time, Governor Sang said persistent attacks and character assassination on social media have affected staff performance. The social media wars are unwarranted as they are distracting staff, he said. Sang said some of the targeted employees are committed public servants. The governor denied claims that some money has been misused by members of the bursary fund committee.
