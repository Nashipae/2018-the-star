Livestock keepers in Garissa want mass vaccination of their animals following heavy rain, saying there may be a disease outbreak. Kenya Livestock Marketing Council chairman Dubat Amey yesterday said some camels died in Fafi constituency from diseases related to the rain. The diseases include tick infestation, camel pneumonia and foot rot. The increased breeding of flies may lead to Rift Valley Fever. Amey said since the rain is over, the national government should team up with the county and other stakeholders and conduct mass vaccination not only in Garissa but across Northeastern. “If the diseases are not controlled through vaccination an outbreak may claim many livestock,” he added. Amey was with herders from Garissa town. The council has been receiving calls from herders, asking about vaccination. “I am appealing to the county commissioner to speedily work with the county Livestock executive and draw a plan,” Amey said. “Livestock is the backbone of our economy. If we allow them to die the pastoralist will be left poor. We should not wait for that.”
