A magistrate who chaired an inquest into the death of British aristocrat Alexander Monson wants four police officers charged. Alexander, 28, died on May 19, 2012, while in police custody after being arrested the previous night at a club in Diani, Kwale county. Senior principal magistrate Richard Odenyo yesterday implicated the police in the killing. He said Naftali Chege, John Pamba, Charles Munyiri and Ismael Barasa are prime suspects. Odenyo said the Director of Public Prosecutions should charge and prosecute the officers after receiving the inquest file. “The evidence adduced in court shows they are linked to the death,”he said Odenyo, in his lengthy judgment read by chief magistrate Julius Angelina said the police tried to cover-up the truth. Their testimony contradicted their written statements, he said. The magistrate said the police tried to paint an image of Alexander as an addict who must have died of a drug overdose. He said there was an attempted cover-up in a report on blood and and urine tests. The blood tested negative for cocaine, while the urine allegedly contained the drug. However, two pathologists said Alexander died because of head injuries after being hit by a blunt object. Odenyo said witnesses testified that Alexander was in good health when he was arrested and put in a cell. “Whether he a drug user or not, whether he was a criminal or not, he had a right to life. No one should have taken his life away,” he said. Alexander’s mother Hillary was satisfied with the court’s decision. Hillary said she never believed she would ever get justice for his only son. She almost lost hope. “It’s been a long journey. Six years and one month later, we can say it is possible for a mother who has lost her child to police brutality can get justice in court,” she said. Alexander developed breathing problems and he was rushed to Palm Beach Hospital where he died. A witness said he chained on his bed as if he was a criminal.
