Two people were injured in Kakamega on Friday in clashes between the supporters of Senator Cleophas Malala and Sports CS Rashid Echesa. The groups came face to face in Matungu in what some said was a battle of supremacy for the control of the county. Wycliffe Oparanya is the Governor. Kakamega OCPD Peter Katam said the group supporting Echesa barricaded a road to block Malala as he headed from Matungu to Mumias.Â He had opened a private medical training school in Makale. "Malala's group responded and they both resorted to hurling stones at each other at Mayoni shopping centre," he said. The Senator's convoy was attacked by people who sang and chanted Echesa's praises. Katam said the protesters also had clubs. The OCPD also said a manhunt was launched for the rowdy people who caused the chaos. He reported that several vehicles that were damaged in the chaos were towed to Mumias police station. Malala, who addressed a crowd after the incident, asked Echesa to support youths pushing for the revival of Mumias Sugar Company. "Echesa should use his position ... he should write a memo to the President for funds to revive the miller," he said. Echesa dismissed claims that he and Malala clashed. "Kindly ignore the fake news alleging my involvement in a scuffle with my brother Malala in Kakamega where two people are feared dead. The life of every Kenyan deserves to be respected. Let us maintain peace and build our country," he told the public in a tweet. Click here for the latest political news
