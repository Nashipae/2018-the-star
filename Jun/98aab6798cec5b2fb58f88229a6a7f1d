Deputy President William Ruto will “whip” Kiambu county leaders if they keep on fighting each other. Ruto issued the warning yesyerday, describing wrangles between Governor Ferdinand Waititu and Deputy Governor James Nyoro as a shame. He said they can solve their problems amicably. Nyoro urged county leaders to work with Woman Representative Gathoni Wamuchomba and Senator Kimani Wamatangi for development. The two have disagreed with Waititu over the rehabilitation of alcoholics through casual jobs that earn them Sh400 a day. Ruto said the county’s issues affect the country since it is the home of President Uhuru Kenyatta. “I ask all leaders from this region to work together like brothers and sisters. You should not spend all your energies on bringing shame,” the DP said. “I want you to remain a hardworking team. Do not bring shame to us. If you continue, I will come back with a whip. The boss asked me to keep on checking on you.” Ruto spoke in Kikuyu town where he commissioned the modern market to decongest the town and provide hawkers space to work. Those present were Waititu, Nyoro, Wamatangi, Wamuchomba, Deputy Senate Speaker Kindiki Kithure. MPs Kimani Ichung’wa (Kikuyu), Jude Njomo (Kiambu), James Githua (Kabete), Jonah Mburu (Lari) and Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira) also attended. Click here for the latest political news
