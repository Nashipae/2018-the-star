MPs allied to DP William Ruto have expressed unease about the pact between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Nasa leader Raila Odinga, saying it is a threat to the unity of Jubilee Party. The more than 20 MPs from the Rift Valley and Central said Jubilee has been experiencing problems since March 10, a day after Uhuru and Raila agreed to work together. The legislators were led by Senate Majority Leader Kithure Kindiki and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi. “The rains started beating us in Jubilee when Raila came and said he wants his party to work with Jubilee. We have problems here and there and the main target is DP Ruto,” Kindiki said. Sudi said if Raila was genuine then he should have extended the handshake to other leaders. The legislators spoke in Kaptinga, Eldoret, on Sunday where they hosted former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth. Others present included Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and DP Ruto’s aide Farouk Kibet. Naivasha MP Jane Kihara said the 2022 politics deal was sealed in 2017. “In 2012, we agreed it will be 10 years for Uhuru and another 10 years for Ruto and that is the way it will go,” she said. Chesumei MP Wilson Kogo said the lifestyle audit ordered by Uhuru should not be used to target leaders who worked hard to succeed in politics. EALA MP Florence Chematia said Ruto would be elected unopposed in 2022 because he does not have any serious rival at the moment. Soy MP Caleb Kostany said they welcomed the unity between Uhuru and Raila. “We are only asking Raila to allow his MPs in ODM to extend the same handshake where they wish. Let those who back DP Ruto from ODM be given the freedom to do so.” But Kesses MP Swarrup Mishra said the handshake should not cause worries in Jubilee. “Uhuru and Ruto greet each other every day, and when Uhuru greets Raila once that does not mean Jubilee will collapse,” he said.
