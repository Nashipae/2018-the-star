Journalists covering Jubilee party nominations in Marigat, Baringo South were on Saturday threatened and chased away by angry youth. Over 50 irate youth blocked Kapkuikui center, south of Marigat town at around 3pm saying they were already through with elections early in the morning. "You better return back peacefully before things turn black on you," the youths told the journalists while threatening to stone their vehicle. The scribes complied. It was not ascertained whose supporters the youths were but they said they were comfortable holding their elections without media coverage. "We are done with elections here, you don't have any business so just go and wait for the final results" one of the youth shouted. It was, however, claimed that voting started late in about 15 polling stations in Mochongoi due to delayed arrival of ballot boxes. The primaries are in readiness for the August 17 by-election for Baringo South parliamentary seat. The seat was left vacant following the death of Grace Kipchoim on April 20.
