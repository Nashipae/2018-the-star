Stanbic Bank has lost its bid to dismiss a Sh615 million claim by real estate firm Sarra Investments which accused the lender of reneging on a 25-year deal to lease its Industrial Area building. High Court judge Mary Kasango ruled that some of Sarra’s claims appear to be rightly before her and that only a full hearing can determine whether the real estate firm’s claims are valid. Stanbic had filed an application seeking to dismiss the nine-year-old case, arguing the contract was null and void. The lender said the disputed lease does not have witness signatures or Sarra’s company seal as required by law, and that the real estate firm did not obtain documents from the Lands ministry allowing the land to be used for commercial purposes. Sarra said in its suit that Stanbic refused to make the agreed monthly payments after demanding the rent be lowered from the agreed Sh975,000. The lender was also to pay for building insurance, land rent and rates.
