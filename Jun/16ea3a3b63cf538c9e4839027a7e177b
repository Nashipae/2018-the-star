The government has set ablaze Sh700,000 Chinese-made gambling machines in Kakamega as the crackdown on illegal betting intensifies across the country. Security officers on Tuesday destroyed more than 100 gaming machines at the Kakamega’s Roasterman dumpsite. They were led by county commissioner Abdulrazak Jaldeza, county police commander Johana Tunoi, Kakamega Central police boss Joseph Chebii and AP commander David Kabena. The machines were seized in different markets in Kakamega Central and Mumias town. “Our target is that by the end of this month, we shall have destroyed all the gambling machines in Kakamega,” Jaldeza said. He said more machines that have been impounded will be destroyed tomorrow. Tunoi said the law will catch up with those still involved in illegal gambling. “We are coming for you and this time round, we shall arrest even those found gambling,” he said. Tunoi said parents who allow their children to gamble will be arrested for failing in their responsibilities.
