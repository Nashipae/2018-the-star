Mandera MCAs allied to the Economic Freedom Party yesterday removed the Majority leader in the Assembly through a popular vote. Abdi Hassan was accused of incompetence. The reps said for a long time, Abdi has not delivered on his mandate. He was replaced by Adan Ali. The MCAs allied to EFP, the majority, said the replacement was not malicious. One ward representative said, “We saw the need to make credible debates for better legislation as the assembly plays its oversight role.” But the EFP leadership distanced itself from Abdi’s removal. National chairman Issack Hassan said the removal had not been communicated to them and so they are treating it as a “rumour”. Efforts to get a comment from Abdi or assembly speaker Aden Khalif were unsuccessful. The assembly, which sat on Thursday, has an uphill task of vetting county executives after the first list by Governor Ali Roba was rejected last November. The assembly’s vetting committee is also required to approve the 2018-19 budget estimates. Early this year, the speaker urged the members to sobre up and carry themselves with decorum. Khalif said the assembly will punish those who misbehave. His warning came following constant fights last year between MCAs from opposing sides of Jubilee and EFP. Roba was elected on a Jubilee ticket.
