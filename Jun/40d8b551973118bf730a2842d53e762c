STARRING: Sierra Capri, Jason Genao, Brett Gray, Diego Tinoco, Jessica Marie Garcia, Ronni Hawk CREATED BY: Lauren Iungerich RELEASE DATE: March 16  It’s been a while since a coming of age has been this funny, dramatic and intriguing. It might not sound particularly ideal for a grown-up to sit for half an hour watching teenagers go through typical teen dramas. But trust me, On My Block is unlike anything we’ve seen. On My Block is the story of four friends who live in a rough neighbourhood. And whilst they have grown accustomed to living in a dangerous hood, starting high school seems like a scarier thought to them. Monse is a strong-willed, feminist tomboy and the only girl in the group. Monse has always had a romantic inclination towards Ceaser. Ceaser is highly intelligent but his education prospects are put on hold when his brother forces him to join a gang. Ruby is a geeky math whiz who becomes infatuated with a new girl in town. And the last member of the squad is Jamal, who has an irrational fear of pain and death. The show follows the group as they try to make it through high school facing strenuous situations that threaten to tear apart their lifelong friendships. This show is amazing. It has a brilliant mixture of comedy and drama, with a hint of real-life crime. Each character is so brilliantly created in such a way that their importance to the story is apparent, yet they don’t overshadow the other characters.  Although the pilot is particularly shaky, it manages to get a few loud laughs and a solid plot foundation. Episode by episode, the show, like its stars, gets a little bit better and wiser.  Star Rating: 4/5
