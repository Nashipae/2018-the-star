Starring: Michael C. Hall, Amanda Abbington, Marc Warren, Audrey Fleurot, Hannah Arterton, Nigel Lindsay Genre: Drama Release: May 10th I might be prejudiced, or maybe it’s my exposure to the majority made ‘Hollywood’ films and shows; but I’ve always found British made shows to be somewhat lacking. Of course, there are the great exceptions such as Downton Abbey and Netflix’s The Crown. Therefore, when Netflix introduced another British made show, I was optimistic. Safe, is a British-French show that connects several families through hidden dark secrets. When Tom’s daughter Jenny goes missing, he frantically begins the search for her and what he uncovers is nothing like he’s ever imagined. With every step he takes, he discovers a web of secrets that involve nearly everyone around him, including buried secrets from his late wife’s past. Jenny’s boyfriend Chris is also missing and later turns up dead. Could Jenny be dead as well? The surprising twists and turns are engaging. The show achieves some level of mystery and intrigue. But it’s like in-between every twist and turn there’s an incredibly long dull flatline, that is somehow unbearable to watch. All the show needed was a quick pace and some pumped-up performance. It’s therefore fair to say my optimism was met with a diverse range of emotions. Sometimes I wanted to watch and find out what happened yet sometimes I couldn’t help forwarding over the dragging parts. All in all, the show achieves what it set out to do, give us something to watch when there’s nothing better on television. Star rating: 3/5
