Nurses in Bomet have suspended their strike planned for Monday because of “cordial relations” with the county. Kenya National Union of Nurses (KNUN) branch secretary Vincent Rono said they had fruitful discussions with the county government. It has honoured some of their demands, he said. Addressing the press in Bomet town on Friday, the nurses cited the confirmation of workers who have been serving on contract in various health facilities and promotion of other staff. The officials had early this month issued a notice to the county that should their grievances not be addressed they would not hesitate to down tools, something that would have paralysed operations in the 134 health centres and dispensaries across the county. The union has more than 200 registered members working in the county. “We were open to discussions with the county government. We are happy because some of the issues we raised have been dealt. That’s why we called off the strike,” Rono said. The official said the County Public Service Board had also agreed to employ some of their workers who have been working on contract since 2013. Other demands include having Longisa County Referral Hospital improved and training staff working at the newly established high dependency unit at the facility on how to operate the machines.
