The facility will be in Marsabit County and will sit on 100 acres of land provided by the Marsabit county government. The research center bids to ensure residents can access healthcare services from local facilities that has lagged behind for years. Speaking in Loiyangalani yesterday, Marsabit Governor Mahamud Ali said the research facility will give access to treatment for neglected health conditions. Mahamud further noted that the facility would increase the surveillance and reporting of the health situation. The facility will give prominence to infant mortality issues, nutrition, malaria, diarrhoea, respiratory tract infection, measles and tuberculosis, among others the governor said.
