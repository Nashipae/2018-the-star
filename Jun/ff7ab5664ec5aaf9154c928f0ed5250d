The DPP yesterday applied to withdraw a case against a lawyer facing charges of forging a will of a Sh500 million prime land in Karen, Nairobi. The complainant, Margret Kagure, who was ready to testify in the case and give evidence, was stood down after the prosecution said it wanted to withdraw the case. The prosecution said that following arraignment of lawyer Guy Spencer, they received new evidence from the persons who were supposed to record statements. The matter will be heard on July 19. In May, a Registrar of Companies official distanced himself from two signatures in documents allegedly forged by Spencer. Silas Ngatia told Justice John Onyego that he was in charge of registering companies and had records of execution of certificate. "I know my signatures. The only genuine signature is the one of certificate of incorporation," Ngatia told the court. Spencer’s lawyer, however, asked if he had ever changed names as the signature in question was allegedly appended by one Langat.
