Nyandarua County will close at least 700 bars as part of efforts against alcoholism. Governor Francis Kimemia said only 500 of the 1,243 licensed bars will remain open. Rural areas will be affected most. Kimemi acknowledged that the move could cost the county millions of shillings in revenue but said this will be recovered in other ways. The county is known for agriculture. “We want to make this a working county. The only way to do so is to close some bars,” he said, adding establishments in villages and near schools will be the first. “We will seek the views of the public first."
