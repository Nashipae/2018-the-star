Education institutions have been told to go digital and stop using papers to help conserve the environment. Privatisation Commission of Kenya acting CEO Jacqueline Muindi said the country would solve some of the challenges it faces as a result of environmental pollution and degradation if schools, colleges, universities and other training institutions use digital technology. “Stop using papers. As a commission, we try to refuse using papers in our operations. Print only if it is necessary. If it is a must, print on both sides of the paper,” Muindi said. Muindi spoke when she launched tree planting and a cleanup at Kanaani Girls’ Secondary School in Athi River, Machakos county, on Saturday. More than 800 trees were planted at the school and AIC Athi River church among other places within Athi River and its environs. The event was organised by Athi River Child Education Program community based organisation in partnership with the Privatisation Commission of Kenya. Muindi asked school heads to make sure their students do not misuse books. “Let every child carry forward their exercise books. If they are not filled, let the children use them until they are used up,” Muindi said.
