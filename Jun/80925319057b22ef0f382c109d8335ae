The Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists union want the government to offer local and Cuban doctors the same benefits. Chairman Samuel Oroko told the Star on Thursday that the government is giving the Caribbean doctors "special treatment". The 100 doctors specialists will be sent to all counties to fill gaps in the health sector. They will be posted after a two-week induction at the Kenya School of Government in Nairobi.

He said they will intensify the push for equal treatment if the government fails to obey conservatory orders issued by a court on Wednesday. The Employment and Labour Relations Court temporarily stopped the employment and issuance of work permits to the Cubans. Justice Onesmus Makau ruled that the positions be advertised for people to apply. The court’s ruling came after a doctor moved to court seeking to stop the government from importing the doctors. Medic Samuel Miango said it was unfair for the government to offer the jobs to the foreign doctors without advertising the positions. Oroko said that the government needs to employ the more than 2,000 local doctors so that they do not feel left out. “They [government] ought to have advertised those positions for the best candidates to be picked on merit. Since that has not happened, the move is discriminatory against lour members," the chair said. The first 50 Cubans arrived on Tuesday while the rest will land tonight. It is unclear when they’ll be posted to counties as the court barred their deployment until the case is heard and determined.
