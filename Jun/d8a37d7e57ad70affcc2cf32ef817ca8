Alternative investment firm Cytonn is close to listing on the NSE Growth Enterprise Market Segment. Communications chief Teresiah Wanjiku said the firm got the green light from shareholders at last month’s AGM. The NSE confirmed it is preparing to receive Cytonn, but declined to give details about the regulatory stage, citing customer confidentiality. “We are with Cytonn on every step towards regulatory approval. We are optimistic the process will end shortly and welcome them on board. The firm must, however, adhere to every set process,” NSE communications chief Waithera Mwai said. Cytonn, which has put in Sh82 billion in its real estate investment arm, first declared its intention to list in September last year when it advertised for professional services to drive the plan. Early last year, the firm acquired a 25 per cent stake in real estate developer Superior Homes in what the company’s chief investment officer Elizabeth Nkukuu described as Cytonn’s strategy to connect capital from global and institutional investors. Superior Homes is behind Greenpark Estate in Athi River, Machakos county. Cytonn’s planned listing is being watched closely considering Gems has not attracted many firms since its inception in 2013. Real estate developer Home Africa, manufacturing firm Flame Tree Group Holdings, investment Company Kurwitu Ventures, footwear firm Nairobi Business Ventures and Atlas African Industries are the few players at the counter. Companies can list on Gems with Sh10 million share capital, turnover of up to Sh500,000 and less than 10 employees.
