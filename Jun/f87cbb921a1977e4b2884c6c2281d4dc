A Meru pastors’ group wants police to quickly arrest the men who raped and killed a pastor’s wife in Mitunguu, Imenti South, on Saturday. The Meru County Ministers Forum, led by patron Edward Buria and chairman Richard Musangi, prayed at the pastor’s home and scene where his wife was killed. On Tuesday Mitunguu residents held protests accusing police of laxity after Roseline Munala was raped, her eyes gouged out and she was murdered just 50 metres from Mitunguu police station. She was going home after cleaning the church. Her body was found on Sunday morning. The protesters broke into bars that they suspected have been harbouring criminals. Mitunguu MCA Evans Mawira said, “There are some leads to those who committed the heinous crime. We will rectify the mess. I’m ready to be jailed but Mitunguu must be free of crime.” He said five people have been murdered in the last five months. Word of Faith Pastor Michael Nduyo said, “It has destroyed our peace. We are together as preachers and no one should fear.” Compassion of Christ Pastor Frances Kibuko said Kambakia was worst-hit by crime years ago, but they stood their ground and ensured all criminal hideouts were destroyed. “We ask for thorough investigations to bring the perpetrators to book,” Musangi said. Buria urged security officers to contain crime in the county. The church leaders also said they will fight illicit brew and drugs sale in the area.
