OCP has temporarily suspended shipments to Kenya following allegations that a vessel with fertiliser from Morocco fled to the high seas to prevent tests. Office Cherifien des Phosphates said this in a statement on Thursday while dismissing media reports that the vessel 'vanished' as sensational and misleading. Daily Nation published an article titled 'Ship with Morocco fertiliser flees Port of Mombasa to avoid inspection'. The company explained that the diversion came in a bid to allow OCP Kenya to to dedicate all its energies and resources to supporting investigators. “In this context, OCP made the decision to reroute vessel MV MYKONOS BAY," read the statement. "It is instructive to point out that the vessel was rerouted while on international waters and that the cargo had been inspected and a certificate of conformity (COC) issued by Intertek on behalf of Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs)." The company also apologised to its customers for the inconvenience. “OCP maintains the highest ethical standards in its production and business operations at all times. Our governance is based on strong values anchored in integrity, ethics and a commitment to the highest levels of quality assurance,” it stated. The company has been on the spot after it was accused by the government of importing fertiliser contaminated with mercury. On Thursday last week, DPP Noordin Haji said the Morocco-based company imported 5,846,000 kgs of compound fertiliser that did not meet Kebs standards. The fertiliser was supposed to be destroyed or be re-shipped to the country of origin but it was released into the market. OCP denied the claims saying its commodity had a positive effect on yield and competitiveness.
