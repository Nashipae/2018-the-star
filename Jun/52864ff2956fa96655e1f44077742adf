A marketing organisation has rolled out a programme to help Busia farmers access markets. Busia is among 12 counties where the programme, Business to Business Forum, is being implemented. It is designed to spur competitiveness and resilient market systems in horticulture and dairy sectors, Kenya Crops and Dairy Market Systems Development regional manager Seth Yake said. “The B to B forum is meant to link producers to markets and along the value chains of specific crops,” Yake said on Wednesday during the inaugural forum. Agriculture executive Moses Osia said the forum presents a good opportunity for farmers to learn where they can sell their products.
