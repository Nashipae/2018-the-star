Police have arrested 15 people believed to have been robbing pedestrians at the Outering underpass tunnel at Taj Mall. This came after a public uproar following the increased insecurity after it emerged that the underpass was a hideout for highway robbers. Jackson Letangule, Embakasi sub-county commissioner, said that the operation started on Thursday and will continue until the robbers are flushed out. "The 15 people are at Embakasi police station and are helping police with investigations as the crackdown continues," Letangule said on phone.
