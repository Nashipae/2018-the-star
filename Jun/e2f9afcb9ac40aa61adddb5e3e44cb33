I don't carry IEBC office keys with me, I'm not a janitor, Chairman Wafula Chebukati has said. Chebukati was reacting to claims that he had flown out of the country with the keys to suspended CEO Ezra Chiloba's office. The embattled CEO on Wednesday showed up at his Anniversary Towers office in Nairobi to find new locks, clear signs that he was still an unwanted man. When he asked why his office was locked, the CEO was allegedly told that Chebukati had 'travelled abroad' with the office keys. But the IEBC and the chairman reacted to the claims on Wednesday night saying Chebukati is not the janitor. "It's just some coincidence that Chebukati was away. He is the Chairman, he does not carry any office keys. He is not the janitor," IEBC said via Twitter. Chebukati on his personal account added, "I was going to joke that my wife has them in her handbag but this is the correct position." Last week, locks to Chiloba’s office were altered to ensure that he would not access it even if he were to return. The Employment and Labour Relations court had allowed Chiloba to go back to work pending the hearing and determination of an application against the compulsory leave he was forced to take by the chairman. Chebukati sent Chiloba on leave in March to pave way for investigations into the procurement of elections materials. Chiloba challenged the decision in court saying the move was wrong as he was not given a chance to defend himself.
