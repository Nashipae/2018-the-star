Opposition leader Raila Odinga has thrown his weight behind the push for better cancer treatment facilities in the country. Following the death of Migori Senator Ben Oluoch on Tuesday morning, Raila has noted that treatment remains a big challenge for Kenya. Concerted efforts are needed to contain the disease, he said on Wednesday at Lee Funeral Home in Nairobi, where he and several members of his ODM party viewed the Senator's body. Raila said Kenya must come up with ways to manage cancer. “It's unfortunate that he lost his life through this scourge. It has become the biggest killer in our country," he said. Kenya Cancer Statistics and National Strategies says cancer is the third highest cause of morbidity in Kenya (seven per cent of deaths per year), after infectious and cardiovascular diseases. It is estimated that 39,000 new cases of cancer are recorded each year in the country, with more than 27,000 deaths per year. The Opposition leader said he met Oluoch a month ago before he left for treatment in India. “He came to see me while writhing in pain. He fought this battle bravely and died like a warrior. We will all miss him,” he said.
