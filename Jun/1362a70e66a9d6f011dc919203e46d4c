Students of Moi Girls woke up their matron at 5am to report the rape that allegedly occurred at the school on Saturday. Monica Wambui told the National Assembly Committee on Education that she alerted the boarding mistress and the deputy principal before she went to check on the raped girl. “I was woken up by commotion at my door. Students were shouting that they had been raped,” Wambui said. She called the boarding mistress Celstine Mutiso at 5.08am before proceeding to the dormitory, where she found the raped girl lying in her cubicle. Students said their colleague had been raped and two others sexually assaulted. Principal Jael Mureithi arrived within minutes. She took the girls to hospital, accompanied by the matron. Mureithi said the girls’ parents should be called to witness the results of the examination. The matron proceeded to Kilimani police station, where she recorded a statement.

MPs heard that the dormitory ought to have been locked at the time of the incident. A female guard was manning the dormitory area at night. The house captain is supposed to lock the door from the inside while the guard patrols outside. “I am not in a position to tell whether the door was locked on that particular night,” Mutiso said. “The guard did not report anything unusual. The captain was also not aware of the incident until morning.” Malava MP Malulu Injendi, who led the House team, said “There is a missing link that the guards did not notice.” Also See:Moi Girls' principal quits, board dissolved after rape claims Click here for more political news
