The Nairobi County Public Service Board has asked speaker Beatrice Elachi and clerk Jacob Ngwele to step aside following issues in the procurement of the speaker’s house. In a meeting held yesterday at City Hall, the board resolved that since both the speaker and clerk were involved in the matter being investigated by the DCI, they should step aside. According to Majority Leader Abdi Guyo, the speaker’s husband was allegedly recorded pushing for the contract. He also said the speaker wanted her husband to be given the mantle to purchase the house on behalf of the county assembly. Guyo said the speaker did not attend the board meeting.  FIGHTING GRAFT Elachi denied any wrongdoing, saying she had nothing to do with the purchase of the residence. “The process of tendering for the speaker’s residence was made public and I am not afraid of being investigated on this. Let him involve even the DCI. He can as well take the media there to see for themselves,” she said. From the meeting, the board revealed the bill was inflated by Sh30 million. The actual amount was supposed to be Sh100 million The board established problems started when Elachi’s husband was told his company does not meet the required threshold as per procurement rules. “So it is very clear they were fighting the tender and we are saying both of them - the clerk and speaker - should go. We are not going to entertain corrupt people and affairs,” Guyo said. The clerk agreed to step aside until investigations are complete. Guyo said the board and assembly are at the fore front of helping President Uhuru Kenyatta fight graft. Click here for the latest political news
