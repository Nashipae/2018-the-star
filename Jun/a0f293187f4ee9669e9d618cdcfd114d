The proposed merger of Ford Kenya and the Amani National Congress will not take Luhya's anyweher, Ikolomani MP Bernard Shinali has said. In an interview with the Star on Monday, Shinali said having different political parties does not mean Luhyas are divided. The merger of the two parties is intended to unite Luhya and give them one political voice. ANC secretary general Barrack Muluka and Ford Kenya deputy party leader Boni Khalwale last week said the merger plans had been finalised. “For me, the merger is like a circus. I don’t believe it will help anything," Shinali said. The lawmaker said the leaders should focus more on bring the minds of their supporters together instead of killing political parties. "They should forget about party affiliations and think about what Luhyas want as a people," he said. Shinali said Luhyas were not divided and asked the electorate to wake up and decide who they want to be their leader. "Claims of divisions among Luhyas is a psychological game the politicians are playing on our people for selfish interests," he said. Proponents of the Ford K-ANC merger say it will consolidate the Luhya vote and possibly propel one of their leaders to the presidency. But Shinali said it wasn't time yet for a Luhya to become president. He urged those angling for the presidency to instead reach out to Deputy President William Ruto and negotiate to become a running mate. "Let's not cheat ourselves. What we can manage now is a running mate. Our leaders should reach out to Ruto as soon as possible," Shinali said. ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya are among Luhya leaders who have declared their interest in running for president in 2022. Mudavadi has previously criticised those against the merger, saying they were enemies of Luhyas.
