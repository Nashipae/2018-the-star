The Nakuru government has started reopening all grabbed access roads leading to Lake Naivasha. The county through the assembly will introduce a motion for the forcible acquisition of the corridors. The decision comes days after Governor Lee Kinyanjui banned Chinese nationals from fishing in the lake. The governor noted the foreigners had contributed to the sharp drop in fish catch in the lake due to use of undersize nets. And in the latest move, MCAs have joined the fight to save the water body. According to Lakeview MCA Karanja Mburu, only four of the 21 corridors around the lake were open while the rest have been grabbed. He asked the government to support the MCAs in their bid to reclaim the corridors which were used by traders and pastoralists to access the lake. “We shall be introducing a motion in the county assembly so that we can forcibly open all the public corridors around the lake,” he said. Karanja said the President and the parliamentary committee on Land had on various occasions called for the reopening of the corridors but this had not been adhered to. “Currently there is a major dispute over the Karagita-landing beach corridor,” he said.
