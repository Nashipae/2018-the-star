Opposition leader Raila Odinga and his wife Ida have travelled to India for a week-long tour. Raila's spokesman Dennis Onyango said he is expected to meet India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In his statement on Friday, Onyango did not say whether the tour was part of official government business. The Opposition and ODM leader is expected to return in time for preparations to receive former US President Barack Obama's visit. Raila has taken at least two foreign trips since his March 9 handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta. In February, he attended the burial of Zimbabwe Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai who succumbed to colon cancer at a South African hospital. In April, Raila represented the Kenyan government at the burial of Winnie Mandela in South Africa. He was pictured with a badge written, 'Presidential official', indicating that he represented the state at the event. In a rare show of unity in March 9, Uhuru and Raila shook hands and told the world that they had decided to work together after a lengthy and troublesome general election. The period officially began with the vote on August 8, 2017 and ended on November 28 with Uhuru's swearing-in for his second and final term.
