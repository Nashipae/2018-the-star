Makueni county assembly has passed a motion on establishing family planning strategies. MCAs said a legal framework was needed to expand family planning services to improve the well-being of residents. The strategy will involve sensitising residents on the use of contraceptives and advising teenagers on the dangers of engaging in premarital sex. The motion passed on Wednesday was moved by health committee chairman Jackson Mbalu. Members said family planning will hasten the realisation of the county’s Vision 2025. “With fewer children, families will have more disposable income to save or invest,” Janet Kitunga said. She said smaller families can afford better education, creating the necessary conditions for development. Ivingoni/Nzambani MCA Harrison Mutie said the policy will empower women. “Family planning is the most cost-effective way of reducing maternal deaths,” Mutie said. Nominated member Justus Masesi said there was need to protect mothers and girls from fake contraceptives. “In as much as we want this plan to work, we also need to ensure there is use of safe contraceptives,” Masesi said. The MCAs recommended the establishment of youth friendly centres where the reproductive healthcare guidance will be offered. They said the centres will provide the opportunity for youths to freely express themselves. Majority leader Kyalo Mumo said parents should work together with the county to create awareness of family planning among teenagers. “We cannot bury our heads and shy away from deliberating on family planning issues with our teenagers because the fact is that some are already engaging in sexual activities. It’s time they are told the dangers of such things,” Mumo said.
