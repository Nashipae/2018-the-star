Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko and EAC Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya have disagreed over claims vehicles transporting miraa have been impounded and drivers arrested in Makuyu on the Meru-Nairobi highway. Sonko asked President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday to authorise immediate release of the vehicles. He said the county relies on revenue generated from sale of the crop in the city. But Munya told Sonko a certain Cabinet Secretary intervened and the vehicles were released. Nyambene Miraa Trader’s Association national chairman Kimathi Munjuri said farmers have incurred losses of Sh12 millions after the vehicles were impounded on May 31. He said, however, three were released on Friday. “We want Makuyu police station OCPD to tell us why you still have Henry Mutuma, driver of Toyota Hilux Pickup KCL 106A, detained for an unrecorded offence,” Munjuri said. The Star could not independently verify the claims because it is not clear what the offence the driver allegedly committed.
