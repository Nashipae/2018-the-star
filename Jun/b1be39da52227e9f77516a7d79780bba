The estimated value of goods and services in Kenya’s marine and coastal eco-system is more than Sh440 billion annually. This is about 20 per cent of the total value of the blue economy of the Western Indian Ocean, which is more than Sh2.2 trillion annually. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri yesterday said fisheries account for only 0.5 per cent of Kenya’s Gross Domestic Product. The CS said the sector can employ more than two million Kenyans through fishing, boat building, equipment repair and fish processing. Marine fishing has annual fish potential of 350,000 tonnes worth Sh90 billion. “However, Kenya yields 9,134 tonnes worth about Sh2.3 billion. It is important to ensure the full economic potential of marine resources has fully been exploited,” said Kinjuri. His speech was read on his behalf by Agriculture Research PS Hamadi Boga during the World Ocean Day celebration at Mama Ngina Drive, Mombasa. Kiunjuri said Kenya should capitalise on the blue economy resources. As part of ensuring Kenya reaps big from the blue economy, Kiunjuri said the government recently submitted a Fishing Fleet Development Plan to the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC). It is geared towards flagging off vessels to enable Kenya harvest fish from its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). “Kenya has been allocated 72 deep sea fishing vessels, which include 18 purse seiners and 54 long liners by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission,” the CS said. The ministry is promoting the private sector to develop the domestic fleet targeting tuna fishery. It will allocate Fishing Access Rights, facilitating joint ventures and licensing. Kenya will streamline the Fisheries Advisory Council and develop the Kenya National Fishing Fleet to ensure a sustainable exploitation of the under-utilised EEZ. “Strengthening the monitoring, control and surveillance system to provide effective fish governance will ensure full exploitation of the zone,” he said.
