Kenya moved a step closer to exporting its own crude oil after the four trucks that were flagged off on Sunday by President Uhuru Kenyatta were officially received at the Kenya Petroleum Refinery Limited in Mombasa yesterday. Each of the four trucks carried 150 barrels of crude oil, making the 1000-km journey from Lokichar in Turkana county. The KPRL storage tanks which have been improved in readiness for the consignment at a cost of Sh200 million, will be receiving 2,000 barrels a day. The crude oil will be stored at the KPRL until the critical volume of 200,000 barrels is reached before export begins. The improvement works include modification and insulation of receipt tank 117 which has a capacity of 90,000 barrels, two adjacent truck unloading bays, a steam boiler for line heating and reheating the crude oil trucks if necessary. Tullow Oil, the company that discovered oil in Turkana, already has 80,000 barrels of crude oil ready to be transshipped to Mombasa. The company first discovered oil in Kenya in 2012. Since then 40 wells have been drilled and the crude oil output is expected to hit the 80,000 barrels a day by 2022. “We are introducing a new economic sector in Kenya,” Tullow Oil Kenya managing director Marti Mbogo said. Petroluem and Mining Chief Administrative Secretary John Mosonik described the journey towards exporting oil in the country as ‘impressive and painful’. He said once all has been put in place, including upgrading the storage facilities in full, whose work is expected to be completed in February 2019, the oil and gas sector will be the country’s third highest foreign exchange earner after tea and coffee and tourism.
