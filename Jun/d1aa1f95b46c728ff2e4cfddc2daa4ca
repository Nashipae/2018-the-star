Sofapaka beat Chemelil Sugar 1-0 in a mid-week clash as the second leg of the Kenyan Premier League got underway at Narok Stadium yesterday. Sofapaka scored the lone goal in the 38th minute through Yusuf Mohammed’s header after a corner kick from captain Anthony Kimani. Both sides tried making changes in the second half in a bid to increase the goal tally but failed to hit their targets, owing to poor finishing. Ten minutes to the final whistle, the sugar millers, who are placed 10th position with 20 points, could have levelled matters but striker Felix Oluoch’s tap from Vincent Mahiga’s cross went above the bar with the Sofapaka custodian well-beaten. An elated Sofapaka coach John Baraza said he is happy to return home with all the points considering Chemelil have in the past given them hard time. “I must admit our opponents are tough and have always given us hard time. We had to use all tricks to defeat them,” said Baraza, adding that the focus have now shifted to next week’s game against AFC Leopards in Machakos. On his part, Chemelil tactician Charles Odero said his team is still new and the players are still gelling. “We played well even though my players are new and lack experience. I am happy because they are improving by the day,” Odera.
