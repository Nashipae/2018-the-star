National Police Reservists in Tiaty East on Saturday dispersed armed Pokot bandits at Nakoko in Baringo. There were reports they planned to raid villages, but the plan was thwarted at 2pm. Nobody was injured. "They were camping along the River Natan. Two reservists on patrol fired in the air and they fled," resident Yuda Losutan told the Star on the phone yesterday. Tiaty East deputy subcounty commissioner Steve Muonge said the reservists helped chase away the resurgent group. "We met reservists at Tangulbei on Wednesday. We told them they will be held responsible in case of any attack against a neighbouring community," he said.
