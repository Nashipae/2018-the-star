Makueni MP Daniel Maanzo has proposed a death penalty for state officers found guilty of corruption. He said the proposal should go through a referendum since the Supreme Court has made death sentence illegal in Kenya. "Corruption in Kenya is at levels it cannot be fought without the death penalty," he said on Friday. The legislator spoke at Kilungu secondary school in Kaiti constituency during the Madaraka Day celebrations. "The option that will safeguard taxpayer's funds is amending the Constitution to have the death penalty back," Maanzo said. The MP said he will table a Bill in parliament to restore clauses that warranted a death sentence for such economic crimes. He spoke even as President Uhuru Kenyatta vowed to escalate the war on corruption by nabbing senior state officers. The president told Kenyans to expect arrests of "big shots" implicated in graft. Scandals have rocked the NYS, NCPB, Kenya Power, Irrigation Board, Kenya Pipeline Company among other state entities.
