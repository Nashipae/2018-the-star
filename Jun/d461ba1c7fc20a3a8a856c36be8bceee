Tanzanian stars Ambwene Yessaya, aka AY, and Hamisi Mwinjuma, aka Mwana FA, are the newest millionaires in town. A Tanzanian court awarded the Bongo Flava artistes TSh2.18 billion (KSh96 million) in special damages in a landmark ruling that could set a precedent in the application of copyright law in the country. The two sued mobile phone company MIC Tanzania (Tigo) for unauthorised use of their music as callback tunes. Speaking to Word Is when he was in Kenya at the weekend, AY said, "The case started seven years ago and there were times we got to a point and felt like giving up. But I did not give [up] and we are happy that justice was done and we have been given what is ours." Mwana FA told Tanzanian press, “This is a key moment in copyright in Tanzania. This is something that has been happening for quite a long time now, mainly because of lack of knowledge and maybe because of the costs associated with such cases.” “Nobody is supposed to use your work without your permission or agreement, and if at all he has benefited then he is supposed to share with you according to the price tag you have set for your work.” The two songs at the centre of the controversy are Dakika Moja and Usije Mjini, featuring AY, Mwana FA and the late Mangwea. On Monday, AY and Mwana FA woke up to find the entire sum deposited in their account. On the same day AY welcomed his second child, a daughter. AY did not want to talk about how he will spend the moolah. But we did ask. The Zigo hitmaker was in Kenya to support the East Africa Music awards launch on Friday.
