Moi Girls' school Nairobi has released students in the wake of an alleged case of rape in the school. Education CS Amina Mohamed said at the school that her ministry has started investigations into the incident. However, no timelines have been given within which the investigation will be completed. "Upon completion of investigations, we will decide on the way forward," Amina said on Sunday. The CS further said that the ministry will conduct a review of schools' security to avert any possibilities of break-ins. "This is a wake up call and the ministry is now looking into ways it can ensure security of students and safety from any danger," Amina said. The students will be home for one week as investigations continue. Earlier reports showed that three girls were attacked by a man who entered their dormitory on Friday night. A parent of one of the affected girls said that a test conducted at the Nairobi Women's hospital confirmed that her daughter was raped. The girl was referred to Kenyatta National Hospital for further tests amid complaints by parents of an attempt by the school to cover up the incident.
