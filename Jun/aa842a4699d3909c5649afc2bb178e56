NASA leader Raila Odinga has cautioned politicians against talk on 2022 presidential race saying it is premature and risks polarising the country. He said in Siaya on Saturday that "the time for campaigns will come and those who think are men enough should wait for the right time." "Those
polarising the country with cheap 2022 politics must give residents
time to enough the fruits of development," Raila said. Raila said: "If I relinquished my political stand for the sake of development, why should other people hover around with early
campaigns?" The Opposition chief rebuffed
claims by his closest allies that his eyes were trained on the
presidency and that he has started strategising for 2022.
