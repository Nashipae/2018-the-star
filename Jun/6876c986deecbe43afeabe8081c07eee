A Migori executive member was yesterday locked out of her office by water company employees over six months salaries and allowances arrears. Water and Energy executive Rebecca Maroa had to hire three AP officers to enable her access her office. The 60 workers from the Migori Water and Sanitation Company (Miwasco) locked her office with several padlocks and thorns. “We have not been paid for six months and our statutory deductions have not been remitted. We have had several meetings with our boss but she has not helped,” employee Dan Ombina said. Ombina said for six months, the workers have been living from hand to mouth. Their families are suffering because they are unable to provide basic needs. The workers, who were carrying twigs and placards, appealed to Governor Okoth Obado to come to their aid. They said they will camp outside Maroa’s office and would not allow her or other top officials in. But at 10am, Maroa arrived in her official car with three police officers. She refused to step out of her car or talk to the workers. She called a wielder to cut the padlocks. “We are not going to leave this office until were are paid. Please tell her [Maroa] that we don’t have energy to work without pay,” a worker shouted to the police officers. Employee Cyprian Amwaba said Maroa would have to be accompanied by police officers to work daily because they are determined to bar her from working until they are paid. Attempts to get a comment from Maroa failed as she instructed the police officers to turn the press away. “The executive is not ready to talk to the press. She has instructed us not to allow you in her office. You are free to leave,” one officer said.
