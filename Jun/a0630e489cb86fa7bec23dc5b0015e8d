Brookside Dairy has signed a three-year partnership with the Kenya Association of Hotel keepers and Caterers to support its activities. Brookside has set aside Sh1 million for KAHC promotional activities and Sh1 per year to sponsor the KAHC symposium. Group chief operating officer Faiz Taib said, “Our Memorandum of Understanding with the KAHC solidifies the relationship between the two bodies in the provision of high quality dairy products to the tourism industry. Quality products translate to happy customers who patronise our hotels.” He spoke yesterday in Mombasa during this year’s KAHC national symposium. Taib commended KAHC for bringing together players in the hospitality industry to grow the tourism sector. “As the market leader in the dairy industry, we are delighted to play a role in the development of the hospitality industry through provision of products that guarantee quality to our diverse customers, besides being readily available in all corners of our country,” he said. Tourism CS Najib Balala, who opened the symposium, encouraged international brands to spread out to other parts of the country beyond Nairobi. He said sector players should encourage the spirit of cooperation instead of engaging in cutthroat competition. “As players in the tourism industry, we must develop a working framework with international brands to expose our hospitality graduates to international standards in the sector. The curriculum offered at Kenya Utalii College should match current international trends in the industry,” Balala said.
