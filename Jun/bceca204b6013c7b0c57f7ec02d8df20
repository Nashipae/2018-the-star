Gracious Amani touched the hearts of many after a video of her rendition of Alicia Key’s hit song Girl On Fire went viral. Many celebrities have reached out and want to support her talent. Among them is State House brand strategy director Thomas Kwaka, best known as Big Ted, who runs the African Creative Arts and Innovation College. Speaking to Word Is, he said: "I looked for the girl and I found the mother, who told me she is a very bright class 8 pupil. Therefore, I found it fair to let her finish her exams first and then I take it up afterwards. "Once she is through, I will put her and other talented kids in a programme called Small Stars Think and Bright Futures. It is meant to help young, talented children achieve their full potential while still young, so when they grow up they do not stumble on their potential. "We will also help them identify who they are and their talents so that when they become celebrities, life will not shock them like it did to some of us." Well, Gracious was recorded by a visiting tourist, Britt Chantel, who blew her away. She wrote on her Facebook page: “So before I came to Kenya, I decided to try and limit my social media usage to be present and really take in this amazing experience with our influence. But we’re coming to an end and I had to post this beautiful moment!! "While finishing up one of our service projects with Fountain Youth this little girl came up to us as we were leaving and asked to sing a song. Then she blew us away… #undiscoveredtalent "Share, share, help us make her viral!”
