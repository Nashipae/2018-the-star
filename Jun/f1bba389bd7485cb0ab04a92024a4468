Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has been accused of hoodwinking the Coast to remain politically relevant after 2022. Some youths urged him to stop the “theatrics” and focus on development. The youths spoke on Saturday at Karisa Maitha Grounds in Kilifi. Kilifi County University and Colleges Students Association chairman Jacobs Fikirini said the governor has been contradicting himself on county growth plans. Kingi said the push for a coastal party and unity is unstoppable. The youths disputed the governor’s sentiments that the region is divided. Fikirini said talk on disunity is only fronted by politicians, while the electorate is united. “During his inauguration last year, he [Kingi] said secession is the way to go. Months later, he said a Coastal party is the way to go, and now he is singing about unity. At no time did the communities stand against each other,” he said. Fikirini said politicians’ disunity is to blame for Coast problems. He added that Coast leaders’ unity is only discussed at funerals, a clear indication the problem is with the politicians. “Why can’t Kingi, Salim Mvurya [Kwale Governor], Gideon Mung’aro [Jubilee politician] and other politicians discuss the issue?” Fikirini said. Johnson Charo, who attended the meeting, said the governor should develop the county before touring. “Kilifi is underdeveloped and Kingi is talking about unity. He should first tell us how lost funds will be recovered,” he said. Kingi says Coast unity is vital in making decisions ahead of the 2022 General Election. He added there are individuals out to scuttle the Coast vote to their advantage.
