Nairobi Majority leader Abdi Guyo has asked leaders to put aside their 2022 political interests and focus on service delivery to residents. "There is no time for threats and small talks. Where there is petty politics, work cannot progress," Guyo said. "As leaders, we need to be honest. Let us be given credit where it is deserved as a result of our own efforts." He made the remarks at Kayole North primary school during the Madaraka Day celebrations on Friday. The MCA spoke at a time ward projects are picking up as the assembly is in the process of drafting the 2018/2109 county budget. The Majority leader asked city residents to be on the lookout for contractors who are executing shoddy works in their respective wards. "Report any contractor who will not execute their jobs properly. Whether it’s on roads or any other area," Guyo said. On Miguna Miguna’s nomination as Nairobi’s Deputy Governor, Guyo assured the residents that the assembly will not approve his name. Mihango MCA Paul Kardos urged Nairobians to adopt the “handshake spirit” and spread unity in order to work effectively as a county. The event was attended by several Nairobi MCAs among them Benson Mwangi (Mowlem), John Kamau (Komarock), and Jeremiah Karani (Kayole Central). Click here for the latest political news
