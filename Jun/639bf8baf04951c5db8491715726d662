National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale has allegedly tabled before a parliamentary committees a list of those he said are behind the importation of poisonous sugar. Speaking during the launch of Garissa High School alumni, Duale, who is also the Garissa Township MP said all those behind the importation of sugar, which is said to be contaminated with mercury and copper, will be known on tomorrow. Duale said he tabled before the Parliamentary Committee on Trade and Agriculture a list of over 60 importers and a person who brought in 185 metric tonnes of poisonous sugar. “A report of people who imported sugar that is not fit for human consumption is with the committee of Parliament and their names will be known on Tuesday,” Duale said. There has been uproar over importation of sugar that contained mercury and copper. “The sugar tycoons will account for their corrupt business dealings before the parliamentary committee,” he said. Industrialization CS Aden Mohamed last this week contradicted his Interior counterpart Fred Matiang'i, saying tests on alleged poisonous sugar had turned out negative.
