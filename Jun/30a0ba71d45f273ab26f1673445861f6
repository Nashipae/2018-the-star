Twenty-five ex-soldiers, who were charged with
desertion but later acquitted, want the appellate court to dismiss an
appeal against them as it lacks jurisdiction. The former military men said the
appellant,the office of the director of prosecution did not have
rights to appeal their acquittal. They they say the Kenya Defence Forces Act (2012) only highlights
the appeal of a conviction and sentence, but remains silent in a case
where the suspect is acquitted. Defense counsel Tom Ojienda said the
KDF law denies the Director of Public Prosecutions powers to appeal a decision by judge Martin Muya,
who acquitted them in 2015. Ojienda further told the three-judge
bench that the amendments on the KDF law in 2016 came after
the judgment. He further downplayed DPP's claims
that the former soldiers were a security threat. He noted that the DPP had not adduced
any evidence that the soldiers were indiscipline or were involved in
any subversion acts. However the DPP said the the former
soldiers were initially convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment
by the court martial. Judge Alnashir Visram,Wanjiru Karanja
and Martha Koome will give their ruling on September 27.
