Leaders from Nairobi and Murang’a counties have settled a dispute over the use of water in Ndakaini Dam. Tension has been brewing between the counties after some leaders from Murang’a demanded 10 per cent of the water be used by residents. “Leaders accepted an agreement brokered by the national government. “A percentage supplied through the Northern Water Collector Tunnel will be used in Murang’a. The issue has been settled politically,” Nairobi Water executive Larry Wambua (pictured) said. He spoke yesterday at Ndakaini Dam during a tree planting drive to conserve the water reservoir. He said the counties reached an agreement mediated by the Ministry of Water. The water level at the reservoir that supplies 84 per cent of the water to the city has risen to 92 per cent. Wambua said water rationing will be relaxed. “Areas that used to get water two days a week are now being supplied for seven days,” he said. Water levels at the dam had remained low despite the heavy rains that pounded the country in the last four months. “The national government through is constructing three dams. They are Ruiru, Sasumua and Gethi. The dams are expected to improve water supply,” Wambua said.
