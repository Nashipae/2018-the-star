Former President Daniel Moi’s press secretary Lee Njiru has accused Moi’s personal secretary John Lokorio of frustrating him. Njiru said his contract with Moi was renewed to serve from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2020. It was signed by the former State House Comptroller Lawrence Lenayapa, Njiru said. “I ask the Public Service Commission to intervene and end these wrangles. I pray the government will rescue me from this issue,” he said. Njiru said he is the bona fide press secretary for Moi. “Lokorio seems to be having a personal vendetta against me. I will continue to serve the consumer of my services until he will no longer need them. I have been portrayed as a dishonest person,” he said. But Lokorio said he has nothing against Njiru. “My office is the one to forward and receive all communications of the former President’s office. Why did he use other means to ensure he has an extension of his term? He retired in 2004 on several grounds. At that time he was 55 years but we requested for an extension of his services,” Lokorio said. His troubles started when a driver in the former President’s office was asked to go retrieve the car. He refused to hand over the car, prompting the personal secretary to issue a directive and ask the driver to record a police statement. Click here for the latest political news
