Juventus have completed the signing of German midfielder Emre Can from Liverpool on a four-year contract, the Italian champions said yesterday. The 24-year-old will join the Turin-based club on a free transfer when his contract at Anfield expires at the end of the month. Can, who joined Liverpool in 2014, made his 167th and final appearance for the Merseyside outfit when he came on as a substitute in their Champions League final defeat by Real Madrid last month. He has been capped 20 times by Germany but missed out on Joachim Loew’s World Cup squad. Can becomes Juve’s second signing of the close season following the arrival of goalkeeper Mattia Perin from Genoa. Meanwhile, Manchester United have completed the signing of Brazil midfielder Fred from Ukraine’s Shakhtar Donetsk on a five-year contract, the English Premier League club said yesterday. “This is the biggest club in the world and I am delighted to be a part of this amazing team,” said Fred. “To work with (manager) Jose Mourinho, who has won so many trophies in his time as a coach, is an opportunity not to be missed. “I cannot wait to get started and to meet my new team-mates. I would like to thank everyone at Shakhtar Donetsk for everything they have done for me over the past five years.” Fred is in the Brazil World Cup squad, but was an unused substitute for the 1-1 draw with Switzerland in their opening game. Fred will compete for a midfield place with Paul Pogba and Nemanja Matic next season as United aim to challenge champions Manchester City for the Premier League title. “Fred will complement our other midfielders’ qualities, which we need; his creative brain and passing vision will give us another dimension to our game,” Mourinho said. Fred won three Ukrainian league titles with Shakhtar after joining from Brazil’s Internacional in 2013.
