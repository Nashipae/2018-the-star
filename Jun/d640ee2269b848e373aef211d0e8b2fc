Lurambi MP Titus Khamala has proposed the relocation of the Kakamega Main Prison and approved school from the town for expansion. Khamala said the two institutions should be moved to Shikusa Prison, 10 kilometers from Kakamega town, which has enough land. He spoke during a public participation forum at Eshiandukusi Primary School on Monday. Shikusa Prison has over 2,471 acres, most of which lie fallow. Khamala said moving the two facilities will create space for construction of a school of medicine on the approved school land, which is right opposite Masinde Muliro University. “World over, prisons are never located in town. They should be isolated for maximum security. We can use the land occupied to put up a national learning institution,” he said. “We are hoping to get support from the county government to push this agenda, which is good for our people. These institutions are occupying land that is much needed by investors to develop this town.”
