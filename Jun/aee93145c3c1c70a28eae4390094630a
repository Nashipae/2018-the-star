Mowlem residents have threatened to hold demos over a neglected sewerage system. Sewers burst more than three weeks ago but they have not been fixed. Environment executive Larry Wambua yesterday said they had not been informed, but they will assess the sewers. But MCA Benson Mwangi said he told county officers to upgrade the drainage and “take the matter seriously”. In the meantime, residents continue to suffer. On Sunday, they said sewage has overflown, endangering their lives. They fear an outbreak of waterborne diseases. The residents have given the county government one week to clear the mess or face them in grand protests. “Our children no longer have a playground because of the sewage,” Mike Macharia said. The effluent and stench from the broken sewers have disrupted business. People can no longer move freely and drivers find it difficult to ferry goods. The problem worsened with the heavy rains. Many residents, who are poor, said they can no longer eke a living from their humble livelihoods. Some traders have closed up shop, while others have relocated. Kennedy Wanjohi said he could not run his butchery as the place stinks and customers have kept off. Mama mboga Mary Ndemi said she closed her stall and could not move her business elsewhere because she could not afford it. She is waiting for the drainage to be repaired to resume her work. Jemimah Auma said, “Last week, I had to move out of my house because the sewage had started getting in.”
