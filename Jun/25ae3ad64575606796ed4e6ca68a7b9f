Kenya will be leave nothing to chance when they face Namibia today in their third match of the Davis Cup where a win will propel them to the qualification stage of the Euro Africa Group II. A similar 3-0 win over Uganda and Mozambique steered Rosemary Owino’s boys to the top of Pool ‘B’ with two points and are a victory away to the qualifying match. The home boys, who enjoyed a deserved rest yesterday, come to the match aware of the danger posed by their opponents, who beat Mozambique 3-0 in their first match before recording a 3-1 win over Uganda in the second match to drop to second in the pool. Ahead of the tricky encounter, Owino believes his boys will rise to the occasion and make good use of the home advantage. “It’s not easy especially after winning the first two matches. It’s going to be a difficult match but so far so good for Team Kenya,” said Owino. “We have had a fine start and the boys are really showing confidence and character on the court. Home advantage has played a crucial role in the two wins and it’s my hope we will draw more confidence from this fact.” Owino is expected to heavily rely on top and second seeds Ismael Changawa and Sheil Kotecha in the singles before selecting the best pair from the trio of Ibrahim Kibet, Kelvin Cheruiyot and Albert Njogu for the doubles. With the winners and runners up of either pools guaranteed to play in the qualification match victory, over Namibia will see Kenya sail to the qualification with a match to spare. Kenya is set to battle with Algeria in their final match tomorrow. The winner of Pool ‘A’ will play the runners up in Pool B while the champions of Pool ‘B’will accost the runners up in Pool ‘A’ in the qualifying match. The winning pair will qualify to the Euro Africa Group II.
