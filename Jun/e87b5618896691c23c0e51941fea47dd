In the 90s, the East African music scene was popping, with stars like Jose Chameleone, Redsan and Bebe Cool ruling the airwaves. Battling for musical supremacy beside them was Mad Ice, who was topping charts hit songs including Baby Gal. He recently opened up about relocating to Finland: "Personally, I’m glad I didn’t know much about Finland prior to my relocation because maybe then I would have had some reservations about coming here," he said. "Living in Finland has taught me a lot about the people, their culture, our differences, similarities and also about myself. I’ve always believed that every situation creates an opportunity for us to learn something new. However, as a musician, if I had known how small and closed the Finnish music market is, I would definitely have thought twice about relocating here."
