The government will not relent in the crackdown on gambling machines in the country, Interior CS Fred Matiang'i said on Thursday. He said the machines have destroyed the lives of children and families as parents get 'robbed' by the children who need money for gambling. "This business is destroying the lives of our children. Some of them are not going to school. Let us stop pretending. We must stand up and call sin by its name for the sake of our children." Matiang'i spoke in Nyeri after a meeting with county commissioners.

But the CS said "the lot is complaining because they know that the business is not regulated." "At the same time, the money collected in the machines is not used in the country," Matiang'i added. He also asked religious leaders and faith-based organisations to help the government to protect children by getting rid of gambling machines. On May 31, the government banned the importation of gaming machines and also ordered a crackdown on gaming and vice dens. Matiang’i ordered the Kenya Revenue Authority, Kenya Ports Authority and Kenya Bureau of Standards not to allow the machines in the country. He also directed regional and county security teams to seize unlicensed gambling machines, popularly known as lotto machines.
