Deputy President William Ruto on Monday commissioned the construction of Lunga Lunga-Vanga-Majoreni-Kanana-Shimoni road set for completion in 2022. The Sh3.2 billion project is set to open up fishing and tourism sector in the area as it has come in time with plans for the construction of Shimoni port. Ruto said the government is optimistic with the project having hired China Civil Engineering Contractor to undertake the works on the 70-km road. "We want the work to be completed in two years and not three as stipulated because the road is very important." "All those who will work with the contractor should be from this area...people from other parts of the country can be considered after the locals are considered," he said. Ruto said Sh200 million has been set aside for roads to be built in the county to facilitate development and growth of business. "I was here two months ago and launched 30km Milalani-Mivumoni-Kilulu road which is now half way, "he said adding that," he added. Ruto said the government will also factor in the construction of Kwale-Kinango road in this year's financial budget, after a request from area MP BenjaminTayari to upgrade the road to bitumen standards. "The road is already in government plans and we will see how we will work it out in this year's financial budget," Ruto said. Tayari also decried the slow pace by which the 53-km Samburu-Kinango road is being constructed and asked the deputy president to intervene. Ruto said the government is committed to its pledges in making sure more people are connected to electricity across the country. "In Kwale only 16,000 people had electricity, 46,000 are now connected.Â  Sh500m has been given to the county for 10,000 locals to have electricity," he said. He also promised to revive cashewnut processing factory that stalled almost 10 years ago in the county through a partnership with the county government of Kwale.
