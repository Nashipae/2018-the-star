Embu MCAs have petitioned state security agencies to protect dried coffee beans in farmers’ cooperative societies following rampant theft. Ruguru-Ngandori MCA Sammy Muturi and his Kyeni South colleague Salesio Kimaru said because of the current high prices of coffee beans, gangs have emerged that target factories and make away with hundreds of bags. Muturi appealled to the county assembly to draft a law compelling armed police officers to protect dried coffee beans in farmers’ cooperative societies across the county. Speaking at the County Assembly on Thursday, Muturi decried the escalation of cases of theft of coffee from stores from factories and described the issue as a matter of county importance.
