On Friday, Mzazi Willy Tuva launched the Mseto East Africa Awards at the Swiss Lenana Hotel in Nairobi. The awards will give fans a chance to nominate their favourite artistes around the region. The host country will be on rotation among the EAC member states. This aims to provide an opportunity for the countries to showcase the beauty, culture and tradition of the specific region. Tuva said, “The music industry in East Africa is one of the vibrant industries in the continent, and this could not have come at a better time, when we have some of our best artistes conquering the world stages with their talents.” Present were Willy Paul, Ugandan Vinka and AY, among other artistes, as well as media personalities.
