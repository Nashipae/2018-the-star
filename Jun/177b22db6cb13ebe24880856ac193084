Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga has hinted she will be going for the governor seat in 2022. Her supporters, including MCAs, have been at the forefront, urging her to go for the seat. Last week, the county MP urged her supporters “to prepare their best clothes and get ready for the 2022 journey”. Last week, during a fundraiser at Kosewe Catholic in Ndhiwa, Alego Usonga MP Samwel Atandi said Nyanza is ready for a woman governor. He added that “Wanga fits the position”. “As Nyanza leaders, we have held discussions and received direction from our party leader Raila Odinga that in the next election, we must field at least one woman governor,” Atandi said. Wanga has in the past avoided comments on the 2022 elections, saying she is focusing on her Woman Representative role. The main challenge will come up during ODM nominations as other prominent leaders have declared their interest in the Homa Bay governor race. They include ODM national chairman John Mbadi and the incumbent Cyprian Awiti. An appeal case is pending at the Kisumu law courts, after former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga successfully petitioned Awiti’s re-election. Homa Bay Town MP Opondo Kaluma and businessman Enosh Bolo are also eyeing the position. If Wanga decides to run for the seat she will be a force to be reckoned with following the support she mostly enjoys from the women.
