The Anglo Leasing contract was a fraud, a Nairobi court heard yesterday. Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua said the government realised this after carrying out an audit. He was testifying in a case in which a former Finance minister, the late David Mwiraria, former PSs Dave Mwangi, Joseph Magari and David Onyonka, and three traders are charged with conspiracy to defraud the government of Sh3.8 billion. Sound Day Corporation and Apex Finance Corporation, the two firms that signed the contract, are said to have been direct beneficiaries of the money. Sound Day had been contracted to supply police security equipment. The contract was executed on December 7, 2003. Kinyua said he did not know whether Sound Day supplied any goods, as the audit report showed none was made available. He also did not know the Commissioner of Police had confirmed that his department received Sh800 million equipment and that Sound Day had delivered goods from 1993. He said after a probe by the then Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission, he requested former AG Amos Wako to advise on stoppage of promissory notes issued to the firm. The AG did not cancel the tender despite his request, he said. But Wako said the legal opinion his office gave regarding the promissory notes was valid. “I signed the promissory notes. The notes are legal, binding and enforceable on government,” he said. Wako produced correspondence between his office, the Finance ministry and the office of President involving the contracts. The prosecution was barred from producing photocopy documents after their authenticity was questioned. Click here for the latest political news
