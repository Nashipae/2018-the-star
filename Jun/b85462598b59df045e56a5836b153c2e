Kenya Railways Corporation was yesterday tasked by MPs to explain why parcels of its land had been irregularly leased to private developers. Corporation executive director Atanas Maina appeared before the National Assembly Public Investments Committee to account for the parcels of land which have not been recovered. In his report for the 2015-16 financial year, Auditor General Edward Ouko said huge chunks of land were owned by private developers. Ouko cited three acres within Limuru Railway Station constituting industrial plots. He further observed private buildings have been put on two acres within Kikuyu Railway Station. Developers are also said to have encroached on two parcels measuring an acre and 0.75 acres adjacent to Mombasa Railway Station. “Various parcels of land have been allocated to private developers by either the Commission of Lands or local authorities without the consent of the corporation,” the report reads. Maina told the committee chaired by Mvita MP Abdhulswamad Nassir the corporation will work with four surveyors and register all land. One hundred and fifty railway stations will be surveyed. “We will ensure all land irregularly allocated to third parties is identified, illegal surveys cancelled and titles revoked,” Maina said. The exercise will start in the coming financial year. Maina said the corporation will work with the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to probe land irregularly allocated to third parties. “We have requested the ministry of lands to revoke titles of all the land that was irregularly allocated by the Commissioner of Lands,” Maina said.
