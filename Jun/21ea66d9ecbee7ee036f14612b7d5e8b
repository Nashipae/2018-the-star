Allies of Deputy President William Ruto have said they have no apologies. Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua told his Nyeri counterpart Ngunjiri Wambugu to concentrate on his constituency. Laikipia North MP Sarak Korere said they would ensure Ruto becomes President. “I have heard some of us are being referred to as ‘Tangatanga Squad’ [Loitering Squad]. I'll say without fear, we will move round the country until Ruto becomes President,” Korere said. Nyeri Woman Representative Rahab Mukami said it is normal for elected leaders to “loiter” because they must meet voters. The leaders spoke during the ordination of priests and deacons at Christ the King Major Seminary in Nyeri town on Saturday. Wambugu has criticised leaders for engaging in early succession politics. A post on his Facebook page has ruffled feathers. “Today, I see my Kikuyu colleagues Tangatangaing [loitering] and rallying our region to support Ruto in 2022. I have just one question for them. “#KimaniIchungwa, #RigathiGachagua & co; what demands have you made on William Ruto on behalf of our community, in return for our votes? Are those demands personal to your squad alone or do they include the rest of us?” he asked. He said there are fears that the leaders are drumming up support for Ruto in the region for their own personal interests. On May 30, President Uhuru Kenyatta threw a jibe at Ruto and publicly accused him of loitering across the country in weekend politicking. In a surprise barb, the President said Kenyans should tell Ruto their problems when he is travelling around. “Hii Kijana anaitwa Ruto unajua kila weekend anatangatanga kila pahali atakuwa anapitia hizi machoro choro mkiona kuna kitu inaenda kona kona mumwambie,” Uhuru said. (“This young man called Ruto, you know, loiters aimlessly everywhere. He will be passing through these alleys, if you see something wrong happening, tell him.”)
