Celebrated Radio and TV sports presenter, Carol Radull, did not mince her words when she predicted the outcome between Germany and South Korea ahead of their final group 'F' match this evening. Germany who are the defending champions had the worst start into this year's campaign after a shocking 1-0 loss to Mexico. They went on to register a 2-1 win over Sweden in a dramatic match which saw Jerome Boateng see red at the closing stages. Mexico lead the way with 6 points with Germany and Sweden third and fourth consecutively with three points apiece and the die mannschaft  will be hoping to comfortably beat South Korea and also hope Mexico tame Sweden in order to progress. With mathematics coming in play, Radull a die hard France fan is confident that the struggling Germany side will easily dispatch South Korea who are yet to collect a single point in this campaign. "Germany are gonna smash South Korea." Said Radull. "Germany started off slow, they have been a bit unlucky and they do have a little bit of an ageing squad. I will never forgive them for leaving Leroy Sane at home, because you can see that they have a gap in the midfield but South Korea is gonna be no competition they will go through I don't doubt that at all." She added.
