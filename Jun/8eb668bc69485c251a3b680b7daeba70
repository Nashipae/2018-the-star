Embu Woman Representative Jane Wanjuki will provide money for training of boda boda riders to reduce road accidents. She said the budget would depend on the number of riders willing to register for the course. Wanjuki said it is alarming that there is a special ward for boda boda accident victims at Embu Level Five Teaching and Referral Hospital. She spoke at the Kenya School of Government in Embu on Wednesday. Wanjuki hosted Public Service, Youth and Gender CS Margaret Kobia who distributed Sh40 million cheques for the National Government Affirmative Action Fund, Women Enterprise Fund and Youth Enterprise Fund to groups in Embu. Wanjuki said lives are being needlessly lost daily in boda boda accidents. Some victims are left disabled, she said The woman rep said many boda boda riders lack training and do not know traffic rules. The training will be done in all the four subcounties of Embu starting with Manyatta. “I visited Embu Level Five Teaching and Referral Hospitals and found a ward for motorbike accident victims. The number of casualties is high. We should all be concerned about this. As a mother, I have decided to facilitate riders’ training,” Wanjuki said. She said her office would partner with the ministry of Information and Communication to set up an ICT centre where youth can use computers free of charge. Wanjuki said most government and private sector transactions including applying for jobs, are done online. Many poor youth cannot afford their own laptops or cyber cafés fees, she said. The women rep said she would organise annual camps for the youth to be sensitised on negative effects of female genital mutilation. She said female circumcision the practice is rampant in Embu although it is outlawed.
