A group of 125 adolescent girls in Kilifi have said they engage in early sexual relations in exchange for money to buy sanitary towels and basic needs. The girls from rural areas in Kilifi South constituency said men seduce them when they go to fetch water, firewood or on their way to school. They spoke during an adolescents’ summit organised by Winners Youth Empowerment initiative at Makio Hall in Kanamae, Kilifi South. The girls demanded for protection of their rights so they can fulfill their dreams. The Standard Seven pupils said sometimes they are forced to engage in unprotected sex. This has increased teenage pregnancies and early marriage. Orphans face the highest risk. A 15-year-old girl narrated how her parents died of an Aids-related illness. Her grandparents cannot afford to cater for her needs. “We have pregnant girls in our school, yet they are candidates,” she said. She said girls need to be empowered to be able to speak out and reject unwanted advances from predators. Other girls said they are often lured into sex by boda boda riders who give them free rides to school. The girls are members of a non-governmental organisation which is campaigning against injustices among adolescent girls in Kilifi county. Chairperson of the programme Doreen Maghanga said they are educating girls in five zones about their rights. She said they meet every Sunday to share views.
