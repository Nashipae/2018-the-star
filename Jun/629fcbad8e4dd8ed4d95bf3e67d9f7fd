Kenya Sevens bagged three points after beating Scotland 21-20 to finish 13th in the Paris Sevens yesterday. Kenya were slow off the blocks and fell behind to an energised Scottish team who took the lead after barely two minutes of play through winger James Farndale, who touched down for an unconverted try. Joe Nayacavow was next to cross the whitewash for the Scots following a handling error by Andrew Amonde as Scotland widened the lead to 10-0. Kenya re-grouped and began to dominate territory and possession. Willy Ambaka then touched down following good work by skipper Oscar Ayodi with Eden Agero kicking over the conversion for a 10-7 score. The Scots pressed Shujaa and from a turnover penalty won by Amonde deep in his own half, Injera ran unchallenged to touch down at the centre with Eden Agero converting for a 14-10 lead at the interval.On resumption, the Scots came out firing on all cylinders and were rewarded when Robbie Ferguson touched down down at the corner for unconverted try for 14-15 lead in favour of the Scots. Herman Humwa was to score Shujaa’s third try following a mixup in the Scottish midfield. Humwa controlled the ball and powered his way over the line with Agero converting for a for a 21-15. The Scots were not going d down without a fight and Farndale scored his second try of the afternoon with the conversion missed as Kenya held out for the win. Kenya had beaten Russia 26-14 in the semi-finals with Agero scoring twice. Eric Ombasa and Augustine Lugonzo added a try each. Kenya had lost 19-12 to Argentina in the Challenge Cup quarters. Shujaa finished the season with a 104 points—their highest ever tally since joining the circuit 15 years ago.
