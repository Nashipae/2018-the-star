NYS suspects on Wednesday asked the court to issue directives that they be provided with water and biscuits. They told the Chief Magistrate of the Anti-Corruption Court Douglas Ogoti that they left court very late on Tuesday and missed supper. They also informed the court that they missed breakfast on Wednesday morning because they left their remand cells very early. The suspects are apprehensive that they may also miss lunch and supper because the pre-trial conference may end very late.
