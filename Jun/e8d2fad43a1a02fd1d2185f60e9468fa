Cabinet Secretaries yesterday said the Budget presented by Henry Rotich will help Jubilee deliver on its promises. East African Community and Northern Corridor Development CS Peter Munya said it is “people-friendly” and will help President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration fulfil its 2017 manifesto. “It is tailored to meet the Big Four agenda. It has given substantive resources to food security, manufacturing, housing and other projects the government is set to roll-out,” Munya told the Star at Parliament Buildings. He praised Rotich for allocating sufficient resources to agencies tasked with fighting corruption. “This war on corruption is big. At times, resources are allocated but they end up not being used for the intended purpose. This time round, I hope the institutions responsible in fighting corruption will play their part effectively,” Munya said. Water CS Simon Chelugui termed the budget “proactive towards the common man’s issues”. He said the allocation to his docket will be utilised to mitigate the effects of the recent floods. “The vision that I shared with Kenyans when I was taking up this job is right on course. The race has now started for us to ensure that Kenyans have water as per the international standards,” Chelugui said. He said Kenyans to expect major changes in the next three years.
