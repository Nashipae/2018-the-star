The fight against corruption and contraband goods is directed towards Deputy President William Ruto so as to derail his 2022 presidential bid, Mathira CDF chairman Wahome Mwangi has said. Mwangi said there are people determined to ensure Ruto does not succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022. The government has intensified war on corruption and contraband products, including sugar, where senior government officials have been arrested and charged. Tonnes of suspected contraband sugar, some contaminated, have been impounded by security officials. But speaking in Othaya, Nyeri, yesterday, Mwangi urgedthe Kikuyu community not to abandon the Deputy President, saying he stood with the President in 2013 and last year. “There are people saying that a son of a poor person cannot ascend to presidency. Does that mean the children we sire will never be presidents because we are from poor back rounds?” he asked.
