Haji said the multi-agency team should guard the warehouses to avoid “mysterious disappearance of the produce”. “The fear that those impounded products might disappear from the stores before we even conduct our field visit is real,” Haji told the joint committee.  SAFE? “We need to come up with a strategy to compel various organs probing the matter to secure those stores.” Aldai MP and vice chairman of Trade committee Cornelly Serem said they would hold impromptu visits to the warehouses, collect samples of the sugar produce and share them with the government chemist for further tests. “What Kenyans need to know is whether indeed the sugar the market is safe for their consumption. The field visits would greatly help us,” Serem said. But Busia woman representative Florence Mutua interjected: “Do you sincerely imagine that the sugar is in those warehouses? You will find nothing if you went to those warehouses”. Also read : Sugar has no mercury but contains copper, lead - KEBS Click here for the latest political news
