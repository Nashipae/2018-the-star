At least 45 children in Nguu Tatu, Kisauni constituency, have nowhere to spend their night and to learn from after police on Friday demolished their houses and school. Police brought down permanent and semi-permanent ones, saying the owners had invaded the land, part of the parcel measuring about 342 acres belonging to Hussein Dairy Farm. About 70 houses were brought down. According to Joyce Juma, a teacher at the demolished Oasis Education Complex, police came on Thursday and threatened to arrest the tutors on allegations they had invaded private land. “They told us they would come today (Friday) to demolish all the houses on this  land. We asked the children not to come to school today fearing for the worst,” Juma told the Star. The school, which has Kindergarten One to Class Five, is the only one in a 5-km radius in the area. About 60 squatter families were affected. The squatters said they have a court order allowing them to stay on the land until a case they filed in court is heard and determined. Police say they have eviction orders. The squatters’ chairman Martin Chimponda they have been tussling with the Hussein Dairy Farm since 2013. “Today, police come with bulldozers and flattened our houses. We are stranded. We don’t know what to do,” Chimponda said. “We will not move from this place,” he said. Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo is set to meet the leaders of the squatters this week to get to the bottom of the matter. The MP said the government cannot demolish houses when there is a court order in place. “We are going to sit down with the leaders of the squatters so we can get a permanent solution,” Mbogo said. Rose Kerubo, whose house was flattened, said her Class Two son cried when he saw police destroying their house.
