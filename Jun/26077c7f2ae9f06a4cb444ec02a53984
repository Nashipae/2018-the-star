Wang Yang, who is a member of the standing Committee of the Political Bureau, is expected in the country on Saturday afternoon. He will be received by Speaker of the National Assembly Justin Muturi on arrival from Uganda. Yang, who is leading a Chinese delegation, will meet and engage with President Uhuru Kenyatta and other leaders on deepening mutual cooperation and share governance experience. "We believe this important visit will give a vigorous boost to China-Kenya relations.
