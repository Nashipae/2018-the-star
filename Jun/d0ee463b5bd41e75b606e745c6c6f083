Kenya Airways is interested in the Bombardier CSeries or Embraer’s E2 jet for a short-haul order of 15-20 aircraft, chief executive Sebastian Mikosz said yesterday. “The performance of the CSeries has to be studied,” he told Reuters on the sidelines of the annual IATA airlines meeting in Sydney. Mikosz said he was inspired by Air Baltic’s order of up to 60 CS300 jets. He said one of the issues was the availability in Africa of maintenance for the CSeries, but that with EgyptAir having placed an order and Ethiopian Airlines studying the jet, that could change the case. “I don’t care if they are able to fly to London. My question is do I have maintenance in Bangui, Juba, Abidjan? But the more African carriers are looking at it, it means the maintenance base will be growing.” Bombardier is expected to close within days a deal to sell control of the CSeries programme to Europe’s Airbus.
