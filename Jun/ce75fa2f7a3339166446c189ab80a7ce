NASA leader Raila Odinga has asked Turkana residents to demand development projects instead of direct cash transfer of oil resources. Raila said if not handled carefully, the oil fortune in the region could turn into a 'curse'. "There are many countries that have oil but they haven't gone far in terms of development, they have many problems. Oil can be a blessing or a curse to the community," Raila said on Saturday at Loima sub-county during the burial of ODM General secretary in Turkana David Lochuch. Other countries that have good initiative plans for oil resources are wealthy and stable as oil resources can benefit the present and coming generation, he said.

Raila said Nigeria is a good example where many problems have been portrayed due to oil resources sharing. He said that despite early oil exploration, they haven't achieved any development. He said Norway is the best country that Kenya should learn from sharing revenue resources that have pumped more projects for citizens. "Turkana has been marginalised for long period since the colonial period and up to the government of Uhuru Kenyatta. Turkana leaders should firmly come together to sensitise residents on matters of revenue sharing. Leaders should be selfless to serve their residents and not their interest." he said.
