National Assembly Minority leader John Mbadi has told President Uhuru Kenyatta not to shield any graft suspect. He said those implicated must pay for their sins however high-ranking are. Mbadi said there is a plot to have some senior state officers evade justice. That is not good for the anti-corruption crackdown, he said. He said Health CS Sicily Kariuki might not face the law, despite having headed the NYS when “Sh9 billion” was looted. “If the President wants to demonstrate he is actually blind to who is involved in corruption, then that lady [Sicily] and others involved must answer questions,” Mbadi said. “She should be put to her defence. I side with the MPs saying she’s being shielded.” Last week, MPs Tindi Mwale (Butere), Sylvanus Osoro (South Mugirango), Abdikadir Osman (Fafi), Bashir Abdullah (Mandera North) and Moses Kirima (Central Imenti) told Uhuru to sack Sicily.
