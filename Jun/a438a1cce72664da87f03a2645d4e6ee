The Mombasa County Inspectorate Department has started rounding up street children. By noon on Monday when reporters were briefed, at least 10 had been arrested and taken to Tononoka Children's Court. The street urchins beg outside supermarkets and other locations with high traffic. In some cases, parents watch from a distance and collect money given by passersby. Mombasa being a tourist town, many have complained that its image is being ruined by the heavy presence of these children. The county is preparing to host SKAL International World Congres in October. Residents have also complained of crimes, motorists reporting that their windscreens have been smashed and parts of their vehicles stolen. "There was public outcry after they started committing crimes," department Director Mohamed Amir said by phone. Amir said some of the street children were found with their parents. The lack of centres to house them remains the biggest challenge but he reported that "some" children's homes offered to help. Only two homes are widely known in the county - Wema and SOS Children's Village. The Director said: "Technically, we are not charging but committing them for assistance. We are removing them from the streets and ensure they are safe. We want to find a better place for them." On the flip side, the street children are missing out on their rights to food, shelter, clothing and education and Amir added that some have been knocked down by drivers. The official said the operation will go on for the "next few days" and that other stakeholders are involved. Operation zones include Sabasaba, Moi Avenue, Makadara, Posta and Mama Ngina.â€‹ The exact number of the street children is unknown, Amir said. The action comes while Street Families Rehabilitation Trust Fund forms county chapters to coordinate rehabilitation activities and conduct public education on the issues of street families. The Fund's CEO Robert Njogu said the Devolution ministry disbursed over Sh270 million for this. He added that the first ever national census for street children is nearing completion, five months after kick off. The chapters will be co-chaired by county commissioners and county governments. The Fund's board will also have one representative from the Children Department, a faith-based organisation, community leaders and police. The board will serve for a renewable term of three years. Member Caren Ogoti said the chapters operate in former provincial headquarters with Rift Valley and Eastern split into two.
