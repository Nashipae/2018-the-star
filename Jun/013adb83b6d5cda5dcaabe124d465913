Livestock traders yesterday urged the national government to swiftly rebuild infrastructure destroyed by floods. Led by Livestock Marketing Council chairman Dubat Amey, they said movement of livestock from Mandera to Garissa market has stalled due to impassable roads. “If the roads are impassable, then the economy will be affected because trucks that ferry animals to the market cannot move,” Amey said. He said without usable roads, other services will suffer. “Patients requiring specialised treatment cannot access facilities because of the roads. Those responsible for maintaining the roads should come and do their work instead of shifting blame to other institutions,” Amey said. He spoke at the Garissa livestock market. A check at the livestock market showed the number of animals had drastically reduced. The Garissa livestock market is one of the largest in East and Central Africa. It serves Garissa, Wajir, Mandera and Southern Gedo region in Somalia. Charles Mwangi, a trader from Naivasha, said on normal market days, he used to purchase up to 70 donkeys but because of the poor state of the roads, he hardly gets 15 animals. “This is not good for business. Something must be done urgently to restore our economy. This trend will have ripple effects on the country’s economy if it is allowed to continue,” he said. Truck owners also complained of lack of business because of dwindling numbers of animals to transport to the market. In April, the Kenya National Highways Authority closed the Garissa-Bura highway following extensive damage. Residents heading to Bura from Garissa were forced to use the Nairobi-Mombasa route, while those coming from Bura had to use the Hola-Malindi-Mombasa route. Click here for more political news
