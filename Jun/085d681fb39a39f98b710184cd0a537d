Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi’s wife Priscilla has urged women to step up and take leadership position. She spoke in Meru on Thursday during a three-day training for women called “Meru Twaweza Initiative”. Women were taught on sustainable development and economic independency. Priscilla said women continue to struggle because of poverty, unemployment, limited access to health services, discrimination and gender-based violence. “It is unfortunate that a lot of women’s dat to day activities go largely unappreciated. We want women to be recognised and appreciated for their contribution to a healthy society and economy. Women should stand up against violence,” she said. Priscilla said negative cultural practices such as early marriages, female genital mutilation and sexual violence prevent women crushes women’s confidence.. “Relevant government agencies should educate women of human rights, existing initiatives for economic empowerment, rights in marriage, inheritance, property ownership and right to political participation,” she said. Priscilla said there is widespread FGM, teenage pregnancy, HIV and early marriages in Meru. She said it is wrong to embarrass and stigmatise girls who lack sanitary towels, resulting in school dropouts. Priscilla said the male-dominated society and stereotype had potrayed women as always dependent. At least 500 women in the county thanked the governor’s wife for championing their cause. Meru Twaweza board chairperson Josephine Mbaya said the training aims to create awareness on women’s key contributions.
