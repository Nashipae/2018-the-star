Detectives have arrested former Olkejuado Teacher's Sacco chairman Bernard Kool over theft of Sh21 million. DCI officers raided Kool's home in Kitengela on Friday following a warrant of arrest issued by the Cooperative tribunal Court in Nairobi. The court issued the arrest warrant after Kool jumped bail. Kool will appear before the tribunal court on Monday to explain why he should not surrender his land title deed which was the surety for his bond. The sacco's chairman Isaiah Katampoi accompanied police during the raid. He said the case has been in court for a decade. Kool often miss hearings, he said. Katampoi said they had recovered Sh4 million from four other officials involved in the theft. â€œOur membership has reduced to 250 from 1,500 because our welfare can no longer meet the financial obligations of members," Katampoi said.
