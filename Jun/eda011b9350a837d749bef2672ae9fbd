Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has said he will nominate another nominee for the position of deputy governor after the assembly rejected Miguna Miguna. Sonko said he has accepted the decision of the Nairobi County Assembly on the same. The assembly rejected the nomination on the basis that he holds a dual citizen as spelled in Article 78 of the Constitution.

MCAs allied to Jubilee Party had on different occasions stated that they will reject Migunaâ€™s name once brought to the assembly. Their argument was that the lawyer, who sought the Nairobi governor seat as an independent candidate in August last year, is not a member of Jubilee Party. Sonko clinched the city seat through the party which is led by President Uhuru Kenyatta.
