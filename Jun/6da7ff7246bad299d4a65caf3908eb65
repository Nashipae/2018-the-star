The national government has imposed a dusk-to-dawn ban on sugarcane transportation in Bungoma over increased night road accidents. Bungoma county commissioner James Kianda said there will be no movement of tractors and lorries transporting cane from 6pm to 6am. He said this is aimed at reducing road accidents. Twenty-five people have lost their lives in the recent past in accidents on the Kitale-Bungoma highway. Kianda spoke in Webuye town on Thursday after he met deputy county commissioners from Bungoma East, Kimilili, Tongaren and Bungoma North subcounties, police bosses and West Kenya Sugar Company officials.
