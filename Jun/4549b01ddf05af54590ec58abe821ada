Police and Kitui officers have arrested a man and impounded his vehicle with 23 bags of charcoal (pictured). Kariuki Karubu was nabbed on the Kitui-Thika road on Monday on his way to Kiambu. He denied any wrongdoing. Kitui has banned charcoal trade. Karubu said he had visited his girlfriend and some residents lured him to buy charcoal for as little as Sh300 a bag. His pick-up was loaded with the charcoal. “I’m innocent. I had come to Kitui for the first time, only to be tricked,” he said. Karubu unsuccessfully pleaded for his release. He also requested reporters not to cover the story.
