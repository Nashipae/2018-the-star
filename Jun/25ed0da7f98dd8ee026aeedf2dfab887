Lamu police yesterday seized more than 80 bags of contraband sugar in the first phase of a crackdown launched on Wednesday. The 4,025kg sugar was estimated to be worth Sh402,500. Five suspects were arrested. County police commander Muchangi Kioi said 44 bags were nabbed in Mpeketoni, 33 in Kiunga, 3.5 in a retail store on Lamu Island. Police also seized gaming machines in Hindi town and arrested three suspects. He thanked the public for being on the lookout. “We acted on a tip off from members of the public,” Kioi said. Kioi said unscrupulous merchants from Mombasa were behind the distribution and sale of contraband sugar in Lamu. He warned wholesalers and retailers against stocking harmful products. The crackdown will cover every shop, he said.
