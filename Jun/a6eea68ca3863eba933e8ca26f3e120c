A trifling Sh99 brought handsome rewards for Nairobi-based businessman Allan Olela as he struck a Sh20m Betin jackpot. Olela became the fourth Betin jackpot winner after correctly predicting outcomes of matches in the ongoing Fifa World Cup. He started betting two years ago and the father of one is glad that he can now fulfill his dream of starting a vehicle spare part venture as well as expanding his existing electronics businesses. Olela could not hide his excitement as the firm’s brand ambassador and Kenyan international MacDonald Mariga handed him the cheque. “I am elated to be announced the new jackpot winner. Actually I could not believe when I realized Sh20 million had been debited into my account. I couldn’t believe it until I called the firm to confirm whether I had struck the jackpot,” said Olela. “I am planning to invest three quarters of this money in beginning a spare parts shop as well as expand my electronics business. I would urge gamblers to use little stakes and do thorough research before placing their bets. I am also looking forward in clinching the subsequent jackpots.” Betin managing director, Leandro Giovando observed that there was an increase in the number of stakers trying their jackpot lucks. “We have seen a huge increase in participation in our jackpot category and are pleased to have another winner join our illustrious jackpot millionaires,” said Giovando.
