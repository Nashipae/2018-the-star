Eldoret police and the Energy Regulatory Commission officials last week raided fuel stations and ‘dens’ selling adulterated petrol.
They inspected all fuel stations on the Eldoret-Malaba highway. The operation was carried out in Jua Kali, Tairi Mbili, Maili Nne and Musembe areas, where 12 dens were identified and demolished.
 Uasin Gishu AP commander Augustine Nthumbi on Saturday told the press suspects were arrested during the crackdown. “Several people have been taken to court and we hope they will be convicted,” he said.
Nthumbi said apart from demolishing the dens, they recovered the tank used in mixing petrol with kerosene and diesel. He said they are investigating how those involved in the illegal business get the fuel.
A fortnight ago, ERC’s Robert Oimeke said they had identified 23 illegal fuel dens that would soon be shut down.
