Foreign Affairs CAS Ababu Namwamba wants Kenyans to boycott the use of Sugar and its products until they are assured of its quality and safety. Ababu said the lives of Kenyans were at risk after confirmation that Sugar being sold in the market was contaminated with 'dangerous chemicals'. He says the local sugar industry is also on the verge of collapse because of importation of cheap sugar. "They say extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. Kenyans should take a different resolve and boycott use of Sugar," Ababu.
