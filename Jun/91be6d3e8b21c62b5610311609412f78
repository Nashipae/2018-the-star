Police in Ijara have received more than Sh20 million food and non-food items, especially to support anti-terror efforts. MP Sophia Abdinoor made the donation yesterday, saying it will complement the national government’s efforts to tackle terrorism. A bigger share would be taken to police stations and posts close to Boni Forest where al Shabaab has hideouts. Donations include rice, wheat flour, cooking oil and dates. Security agencies have been fighting Shabaab militants hiding in the Boni Forest for almost three years. “We consider police stations, especially near Boni Forest where officers have been battling Shabaab militants,” Abdinoor said. Orphanages and poor households will also get a share. Last week, Abdinoor gave out bursaries for students and promised full sponsorships for those pursuing nursing and teaching courses. Hospitals and schools in the region are understaffed after an exodus of non-natives. Frequent terror attacks left them frightened. Non-natives, especially non-Muslims, have been targetted. The exodus has disrupted learning and medical services. Abdinoor said she will ensure the shortages are ended. Residents must get quality education and care, she said. “This [sponsorship] is the best way to address the shortages of teachers and health workers,” Abdinoor said. She is the first elected woman lawmaker in Northeastern Kenya.
