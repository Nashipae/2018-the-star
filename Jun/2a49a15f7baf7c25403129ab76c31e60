Rift Valley Jubilee MPs have dismissed claims that the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga has caused divisions within the coalition. The leaders who met on Wednesday evening to discuss alleged scuffle within the coalition said the party was intact and their purpose was to lead their constituencies. “Our strong stand against these connivances as well as their perpetrators is therefore fully consistent with our total loyalty and commitment,” Senate Majority leader and chairman of the Rift Valley MPs caucus Kipchumba Murkomen said in a statement. MPs and Senators from Rift Valley had earlier resolved to remove Murkomen as chairman of the Rift Valley Senators and MPs Parliamentary Group.

Murkomen had also suggested that the proposed lifestyle audit was meant to undermine and target his community and Ruto. “The lifestyle audit is about 2022 elections, it is a principal called kicking-the-ladder symptom as there are people who want to ascend to those positions of power and they want to curtail other people."
