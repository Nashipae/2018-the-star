A court has ordered police to produce Mombasa resident Husni Mbarak, who was taken by unknown people on May 25. Mbarak is said to have been kidnapped Saphire hotel along Mwembe tayari road in Mombasa county. The incident took place in broad daylight, with several people and security personnel at the hotel watching. Judge Erick Ogola wants him produced dead or alive before Friday. The order came on Monday after his father Mbarak Khalid filed an application seeking habeas corpus orders. In the application filed under certificate of urgency, Khalid said the IG and police illegally arrested or abducted his son. He also sued the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution. Khalid said he reported the matter at Central police station where he recorded a statement
and was issued with an OB number. Police, however, denied involvement. "Police say they do not know who was involved or where the body could be," Khalid said, noting they had not given any information on Mbarak's whereabouts or on suspects. “The application should be heard as a
matter of urgency because police have wrongly, illegally and
without cause continued to detain Mbarak," he said. The matter will be mentioned on June
29. Mbarak had just turned 18 and was observing his eighth day of fasting during the holy month of Ramadhan when he was taken. He resisted as three strangers tried to bundle him into a waiting white Toyota Fielder, registration number KCP 254W. He complied when he realised that they had guns.
