Western leaders have been urged to take advantage of the handshake deal to push for Luhya unity. Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa said the March 9 handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga has set the pace for reconciliation of leaders in different political camps. Amani National Congress leaders Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang'ula are leading the Luhya unity quest. The two have said they will merge their parties. Eugene said it was time the leaders took advantage of the political stability to forge for unity. He said the handshake has brought reconciliation among leaders with long-standing political differences. Eugene said the handshake has gone international following last week's meeting in
Singapore between North Korean President Kim Jong-Un and US Donald Trump. "We want to see more handshakes here in Western so that leaders can put
aside their differences for unity and peace," Eugene said. "I'll look for
Wetang'ula, Mudavadi, Cyrus Jirongo, Ken Lusaka, Musikari
Kombo, Ken Marende and other leaders from Western so that we can speak with one voice." Eugene praised Uhuru and Raila, saying they showed Kenyans a good example when they agreed to work together. He said the handshake has ended petty political tussles. "Even Sultan Hassan Joho who caused a lot of trouble for Jubilee recently had a handshake with Uhuru, ending their differences," the CS said. Eugene said leaders should stop politicking and focus on the government's Big Four agenda. "We want all Kenyans to put aside political differences. We want to see our industries working so that youths can get employment. Improved healthcare and food security remain our biggest focus," he said. The CS spoke on Friday when he addressed parents, teachers and students at St
Theresa Girls School in Kimilili.
