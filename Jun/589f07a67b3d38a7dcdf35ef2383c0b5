C omedian Chipukeezy, real name Vincent Mutua, is now a board member of Nacada. This is after he was appointed by the President last week. Well, we all know about him as a comedian who started appearing on our TV’s at the popular local TV show Churchill. He also has a comedy show at a local TV Chipukeezy show, in which he invites different local comedians. “It is quite a joke for people to make a joke out of a joke. It is quite laughable for anyone to think I am a stripper simply because I made a joke out of this....Quite hilarious, I was simply opening up to the reality that is strip dance in East Africa, and it is only if you are keen enough that you will get the joke. Crazy!” Chipukeezy said in an interview. He is the same guy who was called out by a Kenyans in Hollywood for lying on national TV how a white woman helped him meet US comedian Kevin Hart. He said: “First of all vile alimaliza kunibuyia hio book a stranger came ‘are you the guy from Africa?’ so we go inside, Kevin Hart was seeing guys for like two minutes so they would say hi, how are you doing but we spoke for 10 minutes,” Chipukeezy said on national TV. However, in her narration, Ms Wawira said she is the one who informed Chipukeezy that Hart would be having a book signing event in LA, adding that she had even told Chipukeezy that she was not connected enough to secure him any comedy deals, as even her she attends major events as a seat filler for when celebrities step out to visit the washroom and such. What pained her most was to see Chipukeezy crediting whites for his Hart meet-up, yet she helped him out as a fellow Kenyan who is trying to make it in Hollywood. “We stood in line just like everyone stood in line to meet Kevin. Chipukeezy talked to Kevin just a minute like everyone else and nobody got his contact,” she said.
