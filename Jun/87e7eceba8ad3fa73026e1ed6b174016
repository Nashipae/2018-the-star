The crisis at the Music Copyright Society of Kenya has deepened after one board member resigned amid reports others would follow suit over alleged graft. Bernard Mukaisi, who is a board member and the director in charge of Rift Valley regin, resigned due to accountability issues at the institution. In his letter, Mukaisi said the move was in solidarity with the members who for months have cried foul over the running of MCSK. “Due to unavoidable circumstances arising from persistence governance issues and a non-committal in serving the members, I have tendered my resignation,” reads the letter. Mukaisi was however quick to add that despite his resignation, he would remain committed to fighting for the rights of musicians. “I have been involved in a lone-ranger spirited fight against a number of issues facing our members and this has ended up in a fallout between me and the rest of the board,” he said. Yesterday, Mukaisi confirmed the resignation adding he could no longer work with the current board. Click here for the latest political news
