Nyeri woman representative’s office will spend Sh900,000 from the National Government Affirmative Action Fund to train boda boda riders. Area Woman Rep Rahab Mukami yesterday said the money will be used to take the riders to driving schools to be trained on road safety, first aid and disaster management. They will also be assisted to get driving licences, business skills and the importance of saving their income. “I will also conduct civic education to enlighten them on importance of subscribing to the NHIF, so that in case of accidents and sickness, they can have themselves and their families covered by the scheme,” Mukami said. She spoke during the launch of the programme outside her offices in Nyeri town. She said 60 people, two from every ward, will benefit, and the number will be double next year to cover more. Most boda bodas riders operate without riding licences. “I am also discouraging them against taking drugs and alcohol, and giving them hope. I will also help them start sacco so that they can have saving culture,” she said. About 300 riders, who are officials of various boda boda groups, were present, and Mukami told them to pass the information to their colleagues at the grassroots. She expressed optimism the training will help reduce accidents mostly caused by boda boda riders. She also promised to give full secondary education sponsorship to 250 needy children, mostly orphans and people with disability. “When you are riding a pillion passenger, you should know you have the life of that person in your hands. And if you drink and ride, you should know you are likely to cause a road accident and die,” she said.
