A lack of a ruthless mentality at the crucial moments came to haunt another Kenyan side as AFC Leopards were bundled out of the SportPesa Super Cup 4-2 on post match penalties after a goal-less draw in regulation time. Siraj Adam, Shafik Batambuze, Dani Liyanga and Sumbi Alinyesi converted for Singida with Robinson Kamura and Whyvone Isuza, who missed a pivotal one in regulation time responding for Ingwe. Now, an even more difficult task lies ahead for Singinda as the defending champions Gor Mahia lie in wait in the semi finals as the battle to win the ticket to Goodison Park catches fire. Unlike their more illustrious compatriots, the already eliminated Yanga and domestic champions Simba, who sailed through on penalties, Singida were up for this clash and took the game to Leopards from the off. Diminutive captain Duke Kasekye was buzzing up front with menacing intent and it was his cross that curved the first chance of the match for Singida but Mundia Lumida headed too close to Ingwe shot-stopper Ezekiel Owade. The normally telepathic Leopards attack looked disjointed with passes going astray and decision making generally wanting. It took Ingwe nearly 20 minutes to bring their fans off the seat when Brian Marita beat Shafik Batambuze for pace and delivered a sumptuous cross into the box. Even Though Whyvone Isuza and Ray Omondi got in each otherâ€™s way in an attempt to convert the cross, the ball fortuitously ended at the feet of Jaffery Owiti but the youngster could not beat Peter Manyika from point blank range.
