Two former Attorneys General –Amos Wako and Githu Muigai – yesterday told a court they requested foreign goverments to trace money in the Anglo Leasing matter. They produced before Milimani magistrate Martha Mutuku letters written to Switzerland, American and the British Virgin Islands. Githu said after receiving the bundle of material evidence from the governments, he hadnded over the first batch to EACC deputy CEO Michael Mabea and chief Halakhe Waqo. He said the evidence was brought to his office by Switzerland-based attorney Dr Marc Henzlin and an ambassador of Switzerland based in Kenya on April 13, 2012. “After receiving the evidence which was packed in cartons, I handed it over to the EACC to be used in the Anglo Leasing cases,” Githu said. Wako told the court he cancelled the initial Anglo Leasing contracts, among them E- Ecops, between the Kenya government and Infotalent Ltd. “I cancelled five contracts which had earlier been awarded to a foreign company known as Infotalent Ltd upon which the same company refunded the funds,” he said. Wako said in February 2007, he contacted Henzlin to file criminal complaints in Switzerland and act on behalf of Kenya in all matters where the government requested him on issues involving mutual legal assistance in criminal matters to or from Swiss authorities. The two were testifying in a case that relates to an alleged conspiracy to defraud the government Euros 59,688,250 through a suppliers financing agreement for the computerisation of security, law and order systems.
