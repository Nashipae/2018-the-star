A dialogue program has been launched to end FGM in Samburu and Marsabit counties. The project dubbed "Koota Injena'' is aimed at reducing FGM prevalence among Borana and Samburu communities through dialogue. Koota Injena means come, lets dialogue in Borana language. Anti-FGM board CEO Benadet Loloju said the project is aimed at influencing elders from the two communities against FGM. “After three years, we would have persuaded elders on the best alternatives. We hope to see changes because the elders are the gate keepers,” Loloju said. Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) in the ministry of Public Service, Gender and Youth Affairs Rachel Shebesh advised communities against negative aspects of culture that infringes on human’s rights such as FGM. Shebesh said government is committed to implementing anti-FGM laws in ensuring that the vice has completely stopped. “We are not apologizing for following up on FGM making sure that parents who subject their girl to FGM are prosecuted, but because we know you cannot fight culture in one day we have programs that can help communities to move away from that culture,” she said. As one of the ways to end the vice, she said government has targeted female circumcisers with alternative sources of livelihood and credit from table banking, women fund and uwezo. The dual were speaking at Archers Post town in Samburu East Sub County where the program was launched over the weekend. Elders, girls and women from both Borana and Samburu communities in Samburu and Marsabit counties were present to support anti-FGM initiatives in their communities.
