A businessman yesterday was charged before a Makadara court with tax evasion of Sh15 billion. Keval Kumar was accused of omitting Sh15,369,511,856 from his income tax returns. He failed to declare the amount as required by the Income Tax Act. Kumar allegedly committed the offence between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2017, in Industrial Area, Nairobi. He denied the charges before chief magistrate Heston Nyaga. Through lawyer Kibiru Njenga, he told the court he is willing to engage with the KRA and settle the tax. “My client is willing to negotiate with the taxman to pay the amount he owes,” Njenga told court. He was released on Sh5 million bail or Sh15 million bond. The magistrate ordered Kumar to deposit his passport in court and appear for a pretrial hearing on April 19.
