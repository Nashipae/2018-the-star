The death toll in a Sunday accident involving Gor Mahia fans who were crushed between two matatus in Mlolongo has risen to three. This followed the death of another fan who died while being rushed to Shalom Community Hospital in Athi River. Their bodies were moved to the facility's mortuary by the police. The victims met their death after the 44-seater matatu they were hanging from passed too close to another stationary matatu on the right-hand side. Mlolongo chief Peter Ndunda said the driver swerved to avoid a head on collision with an oncoming trailer. The other matatu, also a 44-seater, had stopped to pick passengers at a stage in front of Mulleys Supermarket. The Gor Mahia fans were squeezed between the two vehicles and fell; two died on the spot. The matatu was ferrying the fans from Kawangware to a match at the Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos town. Other passengers who sustained injuries following the impact are still admitted at Shalom Community Hospital. The driver of the stationary matatu is among the victims who sustained serious injuries.
