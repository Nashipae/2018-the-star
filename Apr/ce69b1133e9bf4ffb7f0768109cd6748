Tanzanian actress-cum-socialite Wema Sepetu has spoken out for the first time since she suffered her second miscarriage. Three months ago the former Miss Tanzanian miscarried after two months and she has been trying to come to terms with the loss. That explains why she has been on and off the social scene. In an interview with Ijumaa Wikendi, Wema revealed that she has been trying to get a child since the age of 23, but she has been unlucky. "I have struggled so much. I don't have the words. I have fasted several times and woken up in the dead of night to keep vigil and pray because I love children and I'm yet to get one," Wema said. "I intend to open two big shops to sell kids clothes, which will be [labelled] Little Sweetheart and I'm at the final stages." Rumours have been going round that Wema has become a regular visitor at Diamond Platnumz's Madale home and so is the singer at her place, but she set the record straight. The award-winning actress said she has been at Diamond's home once and it was during a pool party. "Nasibu has never come to my house. I'm the one who went to his mansion in Madale for a pool party. That is the only day I went to his home." Wema also opened up about her feelings for the Tanzanian crooner and said she cannot marry him no matter what. Sepetu said she has been in a relationship with Diamond and she knows him as someone who will not change his ways and stay in a monogamous relationship.
