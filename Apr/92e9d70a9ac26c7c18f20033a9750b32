Police in Kitui said yesterday said they did not trick Governor Charity
Ngilu or renege on a promise not to release a lorry seized for ferrying
charcoal. Acting county police commander Muthuri
Mwongera blamed county workers of messing up an agreement by acting unlawfully. He said they used unorthodox tactics by blocking the detained lorry with other vehicles to prevent it from leaving. This prompted police to
release the lorry and escort it out of Kitui on Wednesday night. The previous day, Kitui principal magistrate Jonson Munguti ordered the
lorry impounded by county enforcement officers following a ban on charcoal burning and trade, be released. Munguti said there was no basis
to continue holding the vehicle. As police prepared to release the lorry after a mechanical problem was rectified on Wednesday afternoon, Kitui residents protested and attempted to storm Kitui police station. The angry crowd only dispersed after the police fired in the air and lobbed teargas at them. Ngilu joined the protesters and confronted Mwongera. The police boss assured Ngilu he would not release the
vehicle but told her to challenge Munguti’s order at a higher court. “We listened to the governor’s
concerns, which appeared genuine. We decided to detain the lorry further because she promised to serve us with a counter order from court the following day,” Mwongera said yesterday. But the gentleman's agreement was breached when county government drivers blocked the lorry. Mwongera said ordered the county vehicles be towed away to allow the lorry be escorted out of Kitui. “That was a sign of bad faith. It appeared the county officials did not trust our word. The blocking of the lorry pushed police to enforce the court order," Mwongera said. Police are in charge of security, they cannot fold the arms and watch county officials committing lawless acts, he said.
