Groundbreaking for long-awaited 10,000 low-cost residential buildings will begin next month, Housing executive Charles Kerich has said. The project will begin at Suna and Pangani estates, he said on Thursday last week. The two are among the seven old estates the county plans to redevelop in the first phase of the project. Others are old and new Ngara, Pangani, Jeevanjee-Bachelors, Ngong Road Inspectorate staff quarters, Uhuru and Suna roads. The public-private partnership project was initially expected to begin in July 2016, but stalled after the county failed to obtain ownership documents for estates’ land. Tenants also refused to move out until they were compensated. “Some estates still have some pending cases in court. In other case, we are yet to obtain ownership documents, while in the rest we are in the final stages of relocating tenants,” Kerich said. He said Kibera’s Toi market on Suna Road will be brought down and a multi-storey market and residents flats constructed.
