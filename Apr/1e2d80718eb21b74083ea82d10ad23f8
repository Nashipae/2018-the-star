The National Fund for the Disabled of Kenya Board of Trustees chairperson Kristina Pratt (pictured) has told parents with disabled children to take them to school, not hide them. Pratt, President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s sister, on Wednesday said many parents with physically and mentally handicapped children keep them locked at home. She spoke at Maria Magdalena Special School for the Mentally Handicapped in Munyu, Thika East. Pratt commissioned a new dormitory built at a cost of Sh2.5 million from the NFDK. Pratt said parents should not be ashamed of their disabled children. There are many facilities where they can get help, Pratt said.
