The Kenya Airports Authority has increased parking fee within Jomo Kenyatta International Airport for its visitors. For those picking and dropping travellers at the airport, it would cost them Sh100 to stay at the airport for 20 minutes, Sh250 between 20 minutes and 40 minutes, Sh350 between 40 minutes and an hour. If you take one hour to two, one will be required to pay Sh500. Parking would now cost Sh100 within 30 minutes, Sh150 between for 30 minutes and an hour, and Sh200 for between one hour and two hours. Those wishing to park for more than 24 hours, they will pay Sh1,000. The move is aimed at checking on idleness and it would cost Sh1,000 to have a car unclamped.
