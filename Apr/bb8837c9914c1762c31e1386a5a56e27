An assistant chief from Seme subcounty in Kisumu has been charged with attempting to rape a 15-year-old girl. Ang’oga sublocation’s Caleb Oyende is said to have committed the offence on March 31. The girl is in standard eight. He denied the charge before Maseno senior resident magistrate Reuben Kipng’eno yesterday. Oyende was released on Sh200,000 bond but the magistrate forbade him from contacting the girl or other witnesses. The case will be mentioned on April 17. Oyende was arrested earlier on Sunday and was out on Sh10,000 police bond, Seme police boss Hellen Rotich said. The girl has been placed in safe custody in Kisumu. She said Oyende lured her with Sh50, which he said he wanted the girl to give to her father. He gave her the money, but as she was leaving, he pulled her back. The county and area residents have raised concern over continuous cases of defilement, which others claim end up unreported. In February, a second chief in South West Seme was accused of repeatedly raping a 14-year-old girl in 2015. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Click here for the latest political news
