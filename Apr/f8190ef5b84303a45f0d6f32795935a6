Correctional Services Principal Secretary Alfred Cheruyiot on Thursday evening was spotted cooking 'Ugali' at Kamiti Maximum Prison. Cheruyiot who removed his coat and was seen struggling to turn the wooden cooking stick in the huge cooking pot. Holding the stick with his two hands, Cheruyiot tried to turn the Maize flour, but it was not an easy task. As he did this, his security and those of the prison were looking at him and taking pictures. Normally, when the cooks prepare food for the prisoners, they hold the thick wooden stick with two hands and at times step on the huge cooking pot to be able to cook properly. This is not the work for the weak, it needs strength for the food to be properly cooked. Speaking after the ordeal, Cheruyiot emphasized the need to turn prisons into self-sustaining entities. Cheruyiot said correctional facilities should be able to source for their own revenue. He, however, outlined some of the challenges being faced as including accumulation of pending bills, transport, shortage in housing and overcrowding. The PS encouraged the officers to see the problems at hand as opportunities towards moving the department to greater heights. It was his first visit to a prison facility and was accompanied by the Commissioner General of Prisons Isaiah Osugo.
