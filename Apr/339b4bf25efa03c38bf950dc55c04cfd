A Kangema librarian is campaigning to encourage a reading culture. J.N. Michuki General Library’s librarian Zachary Nderu and university students are urging residents to register. They not only can read books and magazines but also take advantage of computers and free Wifi. The Sh50 million ultra-modern library remains underutilised despite having a free internet and a variety of reading materials. “We are looking for ways to encourage people to register with us and become habitual readers,” Nderu said yesterday. Registration costs Sh3,000, which provides access to all services. People can borrow books for a month. Researchers can take advantage of fast, free internet. The daily charge is Sh20. So far, only 216 adults and 516 primary school pupils have registered at the library.  The catchment area contains about 140,000 people. The construction of the library, the biggest in Murang’a county, was started by former area MP John Michuki and completed by his successor Tirus Ngahu in 2015. The library is in a serene environment conducive to learning. It has ample reading space and a capacity of 200 people. “I don’t understand why people would opt to go to expensive cyber cafes when there is free internet here,” Nderu said. The library has introduced e-reader devices that enable users to access more than 200 e-books. The library has more than 3,400 books for primary school children and 2,800 for adults, Nderu said. There is also a section for people with special needs. Many schools in Kangema do not have libraries. “We are telling students that they can access alternative reading materials here,” Nderu said. He urged residents to take advantage of the library for more exposure.
