Corruption suspects in Vihiga should be forced to throw a spear at a tree and if they’re guilty they will automatially fall dead — that’s one county anti-graft proposal. Perhaps not a serious one but it demonstrates widespread anger about corruption. The county also wants to end excessive funeral spending and stop the mushrooming of churches, especially those that just make a lot of noise and mint money from parishioners. These are among proposals to be considered by a cohesion and integration council to be formed by Governor Wilber Ottichilo. The council will look at areas of intersection between culture, politics and development. It will recommend abolition of cultural practices that do not promote development. “Funerals are the most expensive activities. We must decide how to deal with funerals, including learning from other communities. We’re spending a lot of time on them,” Ottichilo said on Friday. He said funerals have been turned into political rallies where residents go to listen to politics. He said the council will recommend traditional ways to fight graft. “I have been shown some trees to which corruption suspects are taken and asked to spear. If they are guilty, they will die,” Otichilo said. Speaking at Sosa Cottages, Ottichilo said it was time the county came up with mechanisms to deal with politics after elections. He called for the regulation of churches, saying they had been turned into money-minting activities. “A lot of noise comes from churches. We’ll passregulations to ensure you are arrested or heavily fined if you shout at night,” the governor said. The committee will also address silent feuds between clans and sub-clans in the county.
