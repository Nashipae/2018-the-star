Lewis Hamilton will be seeking to end his winless start to the formula One season at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix this weekend. The Formula One world champion is yet to win in the season’s first three races and will hope to change that in Baku on Sunday. Hamilton failed to make the podium at last year’s Azerbaijan race where he finished fifth. The 33-year-old has struggled to ignite his championship defence so far this season, finishing second, third and fourth at the Australian, Chinese and Bahrain GPs respectively. A winless start to the season has seen the Mercedes driver concede a nine-point lead to Sebastian Vettel, who triumphed in Australia and Bahrain before finishing eighth in China over a week ago. Mercedes are not a team familiar with winless streaks, but despite his lapse in form, Hamilton has insisted he wants to continue his relationship with last year’s constructors’ champions. “My hope for the future is that we continue to grow, excel and always move forwards,” Hamilton said on Mercedes’ F1 website. “Obviously, to build our relationship. But I really want to take this team the furthest it has ever been. I want to be part of this journey where Mercedes are the most successful Formula One team in history.” “I want to push it as far as I can, with the lifespan as a driver that I have, that it would take a long, long time for anyone else to catch up. I think it would really upset the red cars and the red team, so that’s my goal.”
