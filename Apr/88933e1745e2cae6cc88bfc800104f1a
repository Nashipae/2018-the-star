Health PS Julius Korir (pictured) faces upto six months in jail for refusing to pay a medical supplies company Sh43 billion for supply of drugs and equipment over 20 years ago. In a notice of motion filed at the Milimani law courts, Equip Agencies Ltd wants the PS cited for contempt of court and committed to six months civil jail for failing to pay them the money as ordered by the court. The firm also wants the court to issue summons for Korir to show cause why contempt of court proceedings should not be instituted for his failure to comply with the court order. In December 2011, the company obtained a judgment against the Ministry of Health for Sh 1.8 billion with interest backdated to March 1, 1999. In the judgement, Judge Muga Apondi awarded the firm the money, which the government owed for supplying equipment to the Ministry of Health. This is after Equip moved to court in July 1999 and sued the state. According to the company, the sum represented money owed by the ministry for supply and delivery of anti-malaria equipment and drugs. Equip said they had entered into an agreement with the government through the Ministry of Health in 1995. “After carefully considering all the evidence which has been adduced before me, there is no doubt at all that the plaintiff supplied several goods which have been clearly displayed above to the Ministry of Health,” Apondi had ruled. The judge further noted the company had fulfilled all the requirements that were in the contract.
