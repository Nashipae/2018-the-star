Two Homa Bay legislators have urged patience as the peace deal between President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga is hammered out. Woman Rep Gladys Wanga and Rangwe MP Lillian Gogo on Saturday asked residents to give the two time to unite the country. “The agreement between Raila and Uhuru requires support from all Kenyans,” Wanga said. The two spoke during a funds drive for students at Manyatta chief’s camp in Rangwe. “Everything has its time. We can’t politick all the time. We should support the elected leaders for them to develop us,” Wanga said. Gogo said ODM leaders are still loyal to Raila and will back him on the deal. She urged residents to support her projects and promised to complete those began by her predecessor. “We’ll ensure piping is done from Kosidha Dam to villages,” Gogo said.
