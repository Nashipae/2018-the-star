French President Emmanuel
Macron urged the United States to reject narrow nationalism and
engage the world, telling US lawmakers on Wednesday that
modern economic and security challenges must be a shared
responsibility. Capping a three-day visit to the United States, Macron told
a joint meeting of Congress that isolationism and nationalism
were "a tempting remedy for our fears." But he said
international engagement was the only solution. "This requires -- more than ever -- the United States'
involvement as your role was decisive for creating and guarding
today's free world. The United States is the one who invented
this multilateralism. You are the one now who has to help
preserve and reinvent it," he said. Earlier on his visit, Macron pushed President Donald Trump
to salvage the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump has criticised
harshly, and forge a new approach that would also incorporate
other US and European concerns. On Tuesday, the two leaders pledged to seek stronger
measures to contain Iran but Trump made no commitments to stay
in the 2015 nuclear deal. He also threatened Tehran with
retaliation if it restarted its nuclear program. Macron has pushed for a new approach that would see the
United States and Europe agree to block any Iranian nuclear
activity until 2025 and beyond, address Iran's ballistic missile
program and generate conditions for a political solution to
contain Iran in Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. "Whatever the decision of the United States will be, we will
not leave the floor to the actions of rogues. We will not leave
the floor to this conflict of powers in the Middle East," Macron
told Congress. "I think we can work together to build this comprehensive
deal for the whole region, for our people, because I think it
fairly addresses our concerns," he said. Click here for the latest political news
