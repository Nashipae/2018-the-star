City buildings may soon be required to have solid waste management chutes in their architectural plans. The proposal is contained in a motion to be tabled on Tuesday by Eastleigh MCA North Osman Adow. “Buildings with less than four stories to incorporate a designated solid waste holding area for temporary collection henceforth,”reads the motion.

If the motion is adapted it will go a long way in helping the governor Mike Sonko manifesto of having a clean city. Adow said that garbage is still a great environmental and health challenge hence the need to have it managed at the household level. “The implementation of solid waste management faces numerous challenge especially from the residential areas due to lack of a proper designated area for holding solid waste,” Adow said. He added that solid waste management is a collective responsibility that requires all the generators to ensure the environment free from Health risk. Sonko took over the office with a high spirit of ending garbage menace. He has since launched various initiatives such as Operation Ngarisha Jiji by the Sonko Rescue Team, unveiling 60 garbage trucks and clearing Dandora dumpsite but to date, no tangible results have been recorded. The governor has also blamed businesses in Nairobi for illegal dumping of waste in the Central Business District.
