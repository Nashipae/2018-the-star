R Kelly is facing a fresh allegation of sexual misconduct, from a former partner who claims he "intentionally" infected her with an STD in Dallas.  According to her lawyer, the unnamed woman was the victim of "unlawful restraint" during her 11-month relationship with the R&B singer.  It is claimed that Kelly, 51, attempted to make the woman a member of the "sex cult" he is alleged to have run. The Dallas Police Department has said it is looking into the allegation. In a statement issued in advance of a press conference scheduled for Wednesday, lawyer Lee Merritt claims his client was 19 when she and Kelly began a sexual relationship. Merritt goes on to accuse the singer of "predatory, controlling and abusive behaviour" and "furnishing alcohol and illegal drugs to a minor". Kelly, best known in the UK for hits including I Believe I Can Fly, has faced numerous accusations of sexual misconduct, making indecent images of children and other offences. Last year the singer - whose full name is Robert Kelly - denied allegations he was holding a number of young women in a so-called cult. The Washington Post has quoted a representative for the singer as saying that he "categorically denies all claims and allegations".  Click here for the latest political news
