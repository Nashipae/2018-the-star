Conveyance lawyers have threatened to move to court today to oppose the digitisation of the Lands ministry saying it will open the door to fraud. Lawyer Nelson Havi n told the Star on phone yesterday the Law Society Of Kenya is contemplating moving to court. “We wrote a letter to the ministry over the same matter. They did not respond or act on my letter. Instead, they invited a few conformist law firms to give views on how to implement the digitisation process,” he said. Havi, in a letter dated March 22 to the ministry, raised issues to be addressed. “While everyone understands the need to digitise the process, it is important the process is done in a manner that will lead to achievement of its goals with minimum frustration to transactions,” Havi said in his letter to the PS.
