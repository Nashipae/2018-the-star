Lawyer Miguna Miguna has taken a swipe at former Raila Odinga's aide Sarah Elderkin saying she encourages 'sedation and disobedience' of court orders. "She not only "cheers;" she encourages torture, abductions, sedation and disobedience of court orders,"Miguna said via Twitter on Monday. "...that is worse than Dictator Moi ever did. Far worse." Elderkin launched a savage attack on Miguna and defended his deportation by the Kenya government. "Miguna has failed to follow suit. So, what makes him different? Only his inflated, distorted opinion of himself, which he feels puts him above the law," Elderkin said.

Lone said Raila has repeatedly shown that he believes Miguna should have been allowed to return home by going to JKIA to try and help him. When the NRMke general was denied entry through JKIA on March 26, Raila was among top leaders who went to the airport to help secure the lawyer's release.
