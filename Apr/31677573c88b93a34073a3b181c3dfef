Two public funeral services will be held for veteran politician Kenneth Matiba next week. The first will take place at All Saints Cathedral Church in Nairobi on Wednesday and the second at Ihura Stadium in Murang’a town on Thursday. The decision was made on Tuesday during a meeting of the bereaved, led by Matiba's son Raymond, and members of the joint organising committee for the funeral. Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho chaired the meeting on behalf of Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua. In a statement, the team said a church service will take place at Matiba’s family home in Riara Ridge, Limuru, from 2pm to 4pm on Sunday. Family and friends will meet at the Limuru home from Wednesday to Friday. Messages of condolences have been tricking in since the death of the former Kiharu MP and former Cabinet Minister at Karen Hospital last Sunday. Matiba is largely credited with pushing for the introduction of multi-party democracy in Kenya during his heyday in politics. President Uhuru Kenyatta eulogised him as a true Kenyan patriot while several leaders have asked the public to honour him by sticking to his ideals.
