Newly appointed Sofapaka captain Mathias Kigonya has vowed to lead the club to Kenya Premier League glory. The Ugandan national was confirmed the new skipper three weeks ago after long-serving midfielder Hillary Echesa was promoted to the position of the team manager, replacing Willis Waliaula, who left alongside immediate former head coach Sam Ssimbwa. Kigonya believes the 2009 champions have the league winning ingredients and should not be written off. The goalkeeper, who boast of four goals this season, thanks to his penalty conversion prowess, expressed confidence of skippering the team to a claiming the KPL title. “It’s not late. We can still catch up with Gor and dethrone them. We have good players here who have what it takes to win the premiership and as the new captain, I would like to make their dream come true by toasting the title high at the end of the season. “ I thank the players and the technical bench for believing in my leadership skills and I think the best way to reward them is by getting positive results. I have personally set a target of ensuring every penalty which we get is converted successfully,” he added. The custodian heaped praises on the club’s stand-in coach John Baraza who was elevated to the position after Ssimbwa resigned three weeks ago. Kigonya said Baraza played a major role in ensuring the team escaped relegation in 2016 when his coaching credentials were severely tested. He tipped Baraza to lead them to realising their dream of winning the league. “I worked with Baraza in 2016 and he saved us when we were on the verge of sliding into the National Super League. He is a youthful coach and the playing unit believes in him. Under him, we stand a chance of winning the league since he is an ambitious man who believes the title is not far from reach.”
