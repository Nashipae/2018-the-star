Former Homa Bay governor hopeful Oyugi Magwanga has dismissed reports the EACC is investigating him for alleged forgery of academic papers. Governor and presidential candidates must have a degree. Magwanga said the High Court cleared him. Magwanga yesterday said, “Nobody is investigating me about forged academic documents. I’m as clean as snow.” The former Kasipul MP who successfully petitioned Governor Cyprian Awiti’s victory questioned the motive of the allegation reported in a section of the media. Magwanga said the report is malicious. “I wonder why it has been it has come up again. It had been dealt with before I was allowed to contest for the governor seat,” he said. The report said Magwanga presented forged documents to the IEBC for clearance for the August 8 polls last year. Magwanga said his rivals are fighting him because of his popularity. “The forgery claims are engineered by those who feel uneasy with my popularity in Homa Bay. I will still defeat them,” he said. Awiti appealled the nullification of his win. Magwanga alleged the EACC is being used to cut his political ambitions. He urged the EACC to avoid meddling. EACC spokesman Yasin Amaro said investigations have been completed. Magwanga could be charged with forging documents and providing false information if found guilty.
