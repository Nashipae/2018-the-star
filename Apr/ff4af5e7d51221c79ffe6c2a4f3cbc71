Ugandan mega star Jose Chameleone has welcomed his fifth child with his wife Daniella Atim Mayanja. The two have been married for 10 years and have withstood divorce rumours that spread like wildfire. Jose Chameleone shut down the rumours, claiming that a friend he trusted was the source of the vile reports. “On 2nd August 2017, some ill-intended people accessed my Facebook account and page, on which they made a very disturbing update post purely intended to not only distract my family but fans at large. “They tried to damage [my reputation] by portraying that I walked out on my wife Daniella. Which is not true!!! Contrary to the rumour that my wife Daniella and I have parted ways, we are still and will always be together in marriage and most importantly happy.” Yesterday, an elated Jose Chameleone announced the arrival of baby number five. “Look what God has done for me. Xara Amani Mayanja has joined us today morning at exactly 7.14am. Thanks Daniella Atim for your patience, kindness, loving me and above all giving me all the happiness a wife can ever give to her husband. Congratulations for this beautiful princess. Welcome Princess Xara Amani Mayanja. Thanks everybody for your prayers.”
