Larry Madowo is at the beginning of a new stage in his career. The former NTV journalist has moved to South Africa to work for the BBC. This is his second job for an international TV station. Previously, he worked for CNBC Africa in Nairobi. The British media house said in a statement: “Larry has vast experience in broadcasting, having worked with various well-established local and international media organisations, and has made many appearances previously on the BBC. He is also a pioneering digital journalist on the continent with an impressive following of over 3 million on social media." Larry himself said, "I’m thrilled to be joining the BBC and look forward to amplifying stories about entrepreneurship, ingenuity and innovation that I’ve witnessed as I have travelled all over Africa. I grew up admiring the quality of journalism the BBC produces around the world, and it is an honour to be a part of a bold new team that will tell authentic African stories for audiences across multiple platforms.” Solomon Mugera, regional editor for BBC News Africa, said, “Larry is a fantastic addition to our new team and will be key in leading our new focus on business news and how it affects the lives of ordinary Africans. Our new language services and content will ensure we reach new audiences with our bold, innovative and relevant news.” May this step he has taken be a fruitful one for the fiery and very independent-minded journalist as the head of the business desk.
