Bulgarian club Slavia Sofia have sacked Kenya international Aboud Omar, accusing the defender of insulting his teammates and coaches. In a statement, the club said the problems had been going on for several months and that he had also shown disrespect to Bulgaria. "I decided to remove Aboud Omar from the team and his contractual relations with the club will be suspended under the existing legal order," Slavia president Ventseslav Stefanov said in a statement. The 25-year-old left back, who is yet to comment on the club's decision, became the first Kenyan player in the Bulgarian league when he joined them in 2016. He was instrumental in helping the seven-times Bulgarian champions qualify for the Europa League a few months later. "For no apparent reason, the player became cruel and arrogant," Stefanov said. "He learned the most vulgar phrases in Bulgarian and began to address them to his teammates without exception. "The impudent Kenyan began to curse everything, related to life in our country and did not try to conceal his dislike for the Bulgarian state at all..." Stefanov said that all Slavia players unanimously supported his decision to dismiss Omar, capped more than 30 times by Kenya.  Click here for the latest political news
