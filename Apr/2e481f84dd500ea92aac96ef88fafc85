Kenya Tourism Board has partnered with Google, Safaricom, Kenya Wildlife Service and Tourism Finance Corporation to introduce an online training programme aimed at promoting domestic tourism. KTB chief executive Betty Radier said the programme will leverage on increased use of internet by Kenyan holiday makers in line with their strategic objective to enhance visitors’ experience and increase their stay. “Many Kenyans have access to internet through their mobile phones providing us with a great opportunity to engage them with travel related content and experiences. KTB will work with the identified partners to engage players in the tourism and travel sector to enable them utilize the internet to their advantage,” she said. The roll-out to be carried in Nairobi, Mombasa, Naivasha and Kisumu comes at a time when domestic tourism is on a steady rise. KTB expects the programme to deliver a 20 per cent growth in returns and 5 million bed nights booked in 2018. Tourism CS Najib Balala previously asserted that the industry’s potential in the country is underutilized. In a presentation to the senate committee on the performance, Balala said the industry was underperforming due to poor marketing activities and the Magical Kenya brand being weak. In February, Balala revealed in a National Tourism Stakeholders Forum that digital marketing was the key strategy to enabling the sector realize three million tourists annually. The industry has also been piggybacking tourism products on other successful Kenyan events including Barclays Kenya Open 2018 as part of Sport Tourism to boost Kenya in the global tourism arena. Tourism receipts increased by 20 per cent to hit Sh119 billion in 2017 from Sh99.7 billion recorded in 2016.
