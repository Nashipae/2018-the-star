Embu MCAs have asked the county government to repair roads, saying transport had become difficult because of the poor state of infrastructure. Gaturi South MCA Mugendi Kamwigunyi (pictured) and his Ruguru/Ngandori counterpart Harrison Muturi said residents take hours to travel over short distances because of poor roads. Residents have protested to the county, demanding roads be repaired. The two MCAs asked the county to heed the cry of residents. Speaking at Nembure ACK on Monday, Kamwigunyi said the state of roads have worsened due to heavy rains.. “Matatus have taken advantage of the poor state of roads to hike fares. It is time the county moved in and repaired the roads,” Kamwigunyi said.
