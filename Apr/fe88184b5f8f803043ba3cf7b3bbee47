The majority of urban areas cannot achieve city or town status because of the huge financial investments required. Council of Governors chairman Josphat Nanok said the Urban Areas and Cities Act creates many offices and functions that cannot be financed without increasing allocations to the counties. For instance, to classify an area an urban centre, counties must hire managers, constitute management boards and citizens fora for that centre. The cities must have national and referral hospitals, stadiums, theatres, university colleges and national schools. An area that lacks the requirements might be doomed to remain a village. Nanok said there are conflicting laws on revenue management. “We are at different stages of operationalising the Act. The challenges are financing and capacity building and currently there are conflicting laws, especially in revenue collection,” he said yesterday. He spoke at the regional strategic meeting of the United Cities and Local Governments of Africa for the Eastern Africa Region in Nairobi. The meeting is organised by the CoG, UCLG Africa, the Pan African representative and the ‘voice of local governments’ in Africa. It aims to take stock of decentralisation in Africa and evaluate how local governments can work smoothly with national governments among others. The Urban Areas and Cities Act 2011 states that for an urban area to be classified as a city, it must also demonstrate capacity to generate sufficient revenue to sustain its operation. Nairobi collected the highest revenue - Sh11.7 billion - in the 2015-16 financial year.
