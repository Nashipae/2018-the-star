Kenya’s Eliud Kipchoge and Mary Keitany were crowned Abbott World Marathon Majors Series XI champions following the conclusion of the Virgin Money London Marathon on Sunday. Kipchoge won his third consecutive series title after winning the 2017 Berlin Marathon and the 2018 London Marathon last weekend. He bagged the coveted award with 50 points. World marathon champion Geoffrey Kirui finished second in the series on 41 points with Japan’s Yuki Kawauchi third with 25 points. A five-way tie for third place in the standings triggered a vote by the race directors of the six meetings to decide who would be awarded third spot. It was ultimately given to Japan’s Yuki Kawauchi, winner of this year’s Boston Marathon. Kipchoge has won nine out 10 marathons since 2013 with his only defeat coming in the 2013 Berlin Marathon, where he lost to Wilson Kipsang. Like Kipchoge, Keitany also secured her third World Marathon Majors series title despite failing to win the London Marathon over the weekend. Keitany was on world record breaking pace for the better part of the event but faded in the second half of the race to come home in fifth in 2:24:27. She won the 2017 London Marathon and finished second at the 2017 New York City Marathon. Keitany finished level on 41 points with Tirunesh Dibaba but her win over the Ethiopian in London in 2017 means she wins on a head-to-head comparison. Dibaba took second place, while Brigid Kosgei was awarded third place, again on a race directors’ vote. Kosgei was second both in Chicago last year and in London last weekend. “It has been another sensational series,” said Tim Hadzima, general manager of the Abbott World Marathon Majors. “We started in London with a women’s world record from Mary Keitany in 2017 and continued with some astonishing races in each of our six cities. “We are excited ahead of the start of Series XII in Berlin and to see how the elite competitions will unfold once more.”
