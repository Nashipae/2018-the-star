Women have been advised to seek medical attention whenever they experience abnormal vaginal bleeding. Aga Khan Hospital's Isaac Kamau said most women ignore "this critical signs of cervical cancer." He advised women not to treat such instances as an irregular menstrual cycle as is the case in many occasions. "It is better to get tested and know that you are safe than ignore an issue and have it progress over a period of time," Dr Kamau said. He spoke during a medical camp organised by Aga Khan University Hospital and Karatina University at Dedan Kimathi Grounds in Nyeri town. The camp was meant to train people on primary prevention of cancer, heart, and other lifestyle diseases. Kamau said cancer and heart diseases are treatable if diagnosed in early stages. "On cancer, we are focusing on people who may have family history of cancer and may not be aware of such history," he said. Peninah Obudho, Karatina University DVC Academic Affairs, said the camp was part of the universityâ€™s community outreach program. Other than screening and early treatment, the two institutions have also been training care givers on how to take care of cancer patients. Obudho said the university has started an initiative called "Carry Your Candle" to create awareness on cancer. The phrase was chosen following the realisation that cancer is a leading killer in the country of which most people are suffering in silence. "Cancer patients feel rejected and, lonely, and feel in their dark world," she said. The university don observed that though cancer is a leading killer disease, there is little being done to make more Kenyans informed about the condition. Click here for the latest political news
