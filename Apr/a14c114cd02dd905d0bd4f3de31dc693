The Murang’a edition of the ‘Keep Kenya Breathing’ campaign was launched on Saturday.
The national campaign aims to raise awareness on the need to conserve forests. It will rally Kenyans to plant one billion trees.
Through partnership with Ahadi Kenya, WWF-Kenya will be engage more than five women’s groups in Murang’a in distributing 3,000 Hass avocado seedlings. They will also give out 30,000 indigenous and 30,000 exotic tree seedlings.
The seedlings have been purchased from the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology and the Kenya Forest Service.
The Murang’a campaign aims to increase forest cover through tree planting as a way to protect water towers, wildlife habitats and mitigating against impacts of climate change.
Mathioya MP Peter Kimari and WWF-Kenya board member Mary Kimonye attended the event.
“Women are the backbone of the rural economy, especially in Kenya. Women’s groups are among the most active civil society organisations in tree planting and an obvious fit for the Keep Kenya Breathing Campaign,” Kimonye said. She said many tree nurseries are run by women.
WWF-Kenya’s planting of fruit trees is empowering women in a programme called ‘Fruit Trees for Livelihoods Improvement’.
After the maturity of the avocados, WWF-Kenya will link the fruit farmers to the market. Ahadi Kenya CEO Stanley Kamau encouraged residents to take up fruit trees farming to alleviate poverty.
Since its inception in 1962, WWF Kenya’s mission has been to stop the degradation of the environment. The current rate of forest destruction points to catastrophic and irreversible losses of biodiversity and worsening climate change.
The drying-up of rivers as a result of drought is a major indicator of the effects of forest destruction.WWF-Kenya says forest resources must be sustainably managed to keep Kenya moving in the right direction.
