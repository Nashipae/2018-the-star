Three-time former Kenyan champion Baldev Singh Chager finally took his first Top Fry Classic Safari Rally victory with a dominant performance in a Porsche 911 yesterday. South African oldie, Geoff Bell, settled for second place after fighting his way up the leaderboard with zest and vigour. Chager navigated by Ravi Soni had his campaign effectively sewn up when Carl ‘Flash’ Tundo and Ian Duncan ran into mechanical problems while defending champion, Raaji Bharij failed to master the demanding conditions. “I wasn’t sure I was going to win when we set out on Thursday in Nanyuki,” said Chager, adding: “I knew that my opponents would continue to attack and that a Safari Rally is never over till its over.” It was Chager’s first victory in the Top Fry  Rally and was a maiden win for a Porsche on the Menengai Oil Refineries-sponsored event. Chager joins Bharij in the roll of honor as the second winner of the event. “Another crappy end after a massive effort by the whole team,” said Bharij. “But we ain’t giving up, see you all at the next one!! Massive thanks to our team, Sammy, Nashon Oreyo, Sam Karangatha, Lionel Sphinx Pereira for the massive effort and faultless service and navigator Rajay Sehmi for the privilege.” Chager, who was part of the three-car Porsche Kabras team, controlled the rally from the first stage proper on Thursday and had his race adversaries trailing in his dust. Tundo’s troubles allowed Onkar Rai and Bell to close in, but Chager clung onto his lead to win by a massive 24 minutes. Onkar and Alastair Cavenagh were third and fourth respectively while Frank Tundo, Jayant Shah, Aslam Khan, Rob Linck, Jonathan Savage and Quentin Savags completed the top 10 list.
