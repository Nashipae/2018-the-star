Daystar University campuses in Athi River and Nairobi were closed indefinitely on Thursday following student unrest. A standoff ensued at the university's Nairobi campus on Wednesday night when police stormed and hurled tear gas canisters at students. "....the senate sitting closes the university by noon today. The Senate consequently ask both students and staff to vacate both Nairobi and Athi River campuses by the indicated time," VC James Kombo said. Kombo, in a circular, said international students residing in Athi River campus  should vacate and report to a designated desk in Nairobi by 2pm. Police stormed a meeting at the DAC Building where the students were discussing issues that have seen them boycott classes and turn against the management. Student body President Alloys Otieno said the Senate invited their association to discuss the demands they had tabled. "We started the meeting ... the students demanded that Senate members lift suspensions of staff and student associations and hand over the forensic audit report as had been promised," Otieno told the Star by phone. "It was unfortunate that acting VC James Kombo had confidently indicated that the report was ready but did not produce it when asked for it."
