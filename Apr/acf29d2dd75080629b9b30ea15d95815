Francis Hamisi, alias Frasha, has been married to the love of his life, Maggie, for 16 years now. They have three children together. His first daughter joined high school this year. "I have three kids, two girls and one boy," he said. "My first daughter is in form one. She joined high school this year, and I am so happy about that. It is kind of weird me being a father, but I try to be not a father but a friend to my kids. Yes, there are times I have to be a father, but most of the times, I try to be friends to my kids. I try to be an understanding father." Is it different raising children now as compared to back when he was growing up? "For us when we grew up, we had tough fathers. Like, I would see my dad and run. Those are some of the things I would never want my kids to experience, though back then, kama hawangekua hivo, tungekua wabaya pengine. It is a cool thing to be a dad and a very satisfying job." Has he had problems raising a teenage daughter? "There are challenges, especially because my child has grown knowing me as a friend to her, and even now as she gets into her teenage years, she still considers me a cool dad. Sometimes I am not able to give her the things she wants, not because I don't want to but because sometimes I cannot afford it. It's challenging having kids in this era, but as we say, when God gives you kids, he provides for them," Frasha said.
