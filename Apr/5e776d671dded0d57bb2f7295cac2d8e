A Catholic missionary has criticised NASA leaders opposed to the unity pact between opposition leader Raila Odinga and PresidentUhuru Kenyatta. Speaking during the Easter Mass at Uganda Martyrs Amagoro Catholic church yesterday, Fr Bonaventure Luchidio said leaders opposed to unity talks are selfish. “The unity between Uhuru and Raila is a symbol of peace which has stabilised the country,” he said. “Being opposed to worthwhile ventures cannot bring peace. Leaders need to look at the greater good, instead of personal need.” Luchidio works at the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops. On March 11, two former Migori legislators challenged Raila to recognise Uhuru as head of state. Former Nyatike MP Edick Anyanga and former Uriri legislator John Kobado further asked the NASA leader not to renege on their unity pact. Uhuru and Raila met at Harambee House, Nairobi, and held a joint press statement and swore to end their political adversity. The meeting at the Office of the President took the country by surprise, ending with a joint address to the nation and a press statement. On the steps of Harambee House on live television Raila said the time had come to resolve their differences. The two announced a plan to overcome a deep and longstanding ethnic and political divide, but gave few details of what it might involve. Meanwhile, the cleric criticised the lack of Catholic priests in the country. The worst hit areas are Garissa, Mandera, Maralal and Lodwar. Garissa Diocese has four counties, including Tana River, Mandera and Wajir, with only seven priests. “Some Christians in Mandera went without Easter Mass due to the unavailability of priests. We need volunteer missionaries to serve in these areas,” Luchidio said.
