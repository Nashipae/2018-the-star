The fifth annual Devolution Conference starts today in Kakamega. For the first time, the conference is being organised jointly by the Council of Governors, the county assemblies and the national government. This critical meeting gives the country an opportunity to reflect on problems and progress in devolving power to the people. Great strides have been made in implementing devolution over five years. Some counties have great advancements to show, others have almost nil. Some governors seized the opportunities presented by devolution to deliver to their people, while others failed. This conference gives governors and other stakeholders the opportunity to for reflection. It gives counties and the country an opportunity to identify what has worked where, how and why — and what has failed where, how and why. It presents an opportunity to put all 47 counties on a united development path in line with the Big Four agenda. Participants should also reflect on counties' over-reliance on the national Exchequer. Counties, which complain they are being starved of cash, must decide how best to sustainably generate their own revenue and reduce their dependence on the state. Issues of corruption, over-budgeting and misuse of public resources at the county level must also be addressed. Quote of the day: “We must keep on trying to solve problems, one by one, stage by stage, if not on the basis of confidence and cooperation, at least on that of mutual toleration and self-interest.” — 14th Canadian Prime Minister Lester B Pearson (Nobel 1957) was born on April 23, 1897.
