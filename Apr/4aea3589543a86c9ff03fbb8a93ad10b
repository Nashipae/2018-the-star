Malindi residents have protested the move by the National Housing Corporation to demolish their homes to pave way for a housing project. The group held demonstrations in Ngala estate after the NHC officials pulled down four rental houses and a private school on Friday. They claimed the state corporation defied court orders and begun works at the site before the case they filed over the matter was heard. Chief magistrate Julie Oseko on March 15 ordered NHC and the defendant Martin Ndapatani (deceased) to maintain a status quo until the dispute is settled. Further, the court granted the parties fourteen days to file and serve submissions and set the matter for mention on April 10. However, NHC officials accompanied by police officers, begun fencing the area two days after the ruling. Penina Ndapatani, a widow who is one of the victims, said they suspect a local tycoon is behind the demolition. She said efforts to plead with the officers to respect the court orders were futile. "Where is justice? The government should tell me where else to go since I cannot go elsewhere to get land." The widow said she bought the properties in 1993 and 1996 respectively and wondered why she was being forcefully evicted. Elvis Shutu, a resident, said they have lived in the site since the 1970s. Aoko Otieno and Associates, who is the victims' lawyer, have since written to the National Housing Corporation informing them of the court orders. Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa has hired a lawyer to handle the matter on behalf of the affected families. "We can never to allow such injustice to occur." Click here for the latest political news
