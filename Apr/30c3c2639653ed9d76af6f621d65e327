Nzoia Water Services Company Board blames it on a mechanical fault at its pumping plant Residents have been forced to travel long distances in search of water. Vendors are making brisk business by selling a 20-litre jerrycan for Sh20. Speaking to the Star yesterday, Nzowasco commercial and public relations manager Bernard kikechi said one of their pumps at Matisi failed and has been taken to Eldoret for repairs. He said the remaining pump is smaller and cannot serve the whole town. Speaking separately, Board director Rabbecca Masibayi told the Star said the management had opted for rationing as the pump issues are sorted out. The firm is only supplying area to some specific areas such as Milimani, she said. Residents complained about persistent water shortage in the town and heavy bills. They said the excuses by Nzowasco management are insincere. "We are tired of this excuse about pumps yet company charges us highly.
