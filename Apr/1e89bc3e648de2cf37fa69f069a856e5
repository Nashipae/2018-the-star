Mwingi West MP Charles Nguna has urged farmers to use aerial soap to kill armyworms that have invaded their farms. Nguna said it had been proved that sprinkling a solution of the soap on crops kill the worms. Nguna said the government had not distributed pesticides, making the soup the only available solution. He urged the government to supply the chemicals. "Farmers are working tirelessly and the rains are promising. Any delay in dealing with the worms will lead to massive destruction," Nguna said. Armyworms attacked maize farms two weeks ago with farmers relying on conventional methods of dealing with the pest. Farmers are concerned on the use of aerial soup to kill the worm. "We'll be very happy to get pesticides from the government," Mavuni farmner Mwatha Musili said. Farmers are worried about The farmers feel that despite the heavy rains which are giving them hope for the bumper harvest, the worms can make them harvest nothing or less than they expected if they are not contained early before they spread to the whole area. A farmer Mwatha Musili from Mavuni area of Nguutani ward, said the army worm invaded some of the farms like two weeks ago and some of the farmers have been using conventional methods like sprinkling the crops with aerial soap which is making the worm disappear but invade again after some days. "If we can get pesticides from the county government or the Agricultural sector, we can be very happy. Understand that when we have enough rains, these worms always invade our farms but now they should be contained completely. Many farms in Mavuni area infested by the worms," added Musili.
