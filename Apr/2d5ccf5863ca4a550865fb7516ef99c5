Petroleum tanker drivers risk being banned from transporting the goods if found guilty of ferrying contaminated products in the market. "If found transporting adulterated petroleum, diverting the products destined for other markets into the local market you will be banned," ERC said in a  statement on Wednesday. ERC said if found having parked a petroleum tanker in an unlicensed petroleum storage facility or proven to have driven carelessly, you will not be spared. "It is an offence and the ERC shall not hesitate to prosecute such drivers," the Energy Regulation Commission said. Last month, the Commission exposed 20 petrol stations for selling contaminated fuel. The commission conducted tests from January to March to monitor the quality fuels on sale, their transportation and storage. In a newspaper notice, it said 4,476 tests were conducted at 778 sites. Among the 20 were Downer's (Kasarani, Nairobi), Perazim and Imperial (Longonot and Mzee wa Nyama, Nakuru), BM (Kanyakine, Meru), Jama (Mikinduri, Kirinyaga), Rice Enterprises (Laare, Meru) and unlicensed storage sites at Chulaimbo near Lela Market (Kisumu) and in Bukembe, Bungoma.
