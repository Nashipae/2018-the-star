STARRING: Jaina Lee Ortiz, Jason George, Grey Damon, Barrett Doss, Alberto Frezza, Jay Hayden GENRE: Action/Drama BASED ON: Grey’s Anatomy by Shonda Rhimes PREMIERE: March 22  The show is a spinoff of Shondaland’s most-coveted series, Grey’s Anatomy. It revolves around the lives of the fire fighters of Station 19, which is 3 blocks from Grey’s hospital. Captain Pruitt Herrera is the leader of the troop at Station 19. The team consists of his own daughter, Andy, her secret boyfriend, Jack, Andy’s best friend and former Olympian, Maya, former surgeon Ben, Victoria, Travis and Dean. In the first episode, Captain Herrera collapses in a fire building and is taken to the hospital, where it is revealed that he has stage 2 cancer. He is forced to step down and put Jack as acting captain until one is confirmed. But Andy asks to be put in charge, too, as she knows she can do the work. Unaware of his daughter’s relationship with Jack, Herrera decides to put the them both up as acting captains until one is officially confirmed by the department. The show is not all that bad, but it’s not too great either. It doesn’t have the same attention-grabbing effect that How to Get Away with Murder or Scandal had in their first seasons. The pace feels a bit sluggish, and dialogues are longer than they need to be. However, some of the action sequences are pretty good and engaging, and the cast is energetic. There is a little too much focus on the love triangle between Jack, Andy and Ryan, and little coverage of the other people’s lives around them. Dean’s storyline as the charismatic dog-saving firefighter, who ends up sleeping with most of the rescuees, is definitely what makes the show better. Perhaps a little insight into Victoria and Travis’s lives will save the slowly sinking boat. The show might not be as sizzling as advertised, but it’s worth the try.  Star Rating: 3/5
