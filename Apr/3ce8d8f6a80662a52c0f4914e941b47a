Majid Al Futtaim has launched the “Buy Kenya, Build Kenya” ahead of the opening of their fifth outlet in Westlands today. According to the retailer’s statistics, a big portion of the fresh produce sold at Carrefour stores is sourced locally, two-thirds bought direct from farms. Among the 35 fruits and vegetable suppliers working with Carrefour, 21 are growers who supply what they produce from their farms. Twelve of growers are small-scale growers, who have indicated they increased the number of employees since they started working with Carrefour and grown their revenues. The Buy Kenya Build Kenya campaign features testimonies of suppliers whose businesses have grown and stabilised, due to a professional business relationship with Carrefour. They say the respect for payment terms and open-ended and consistent communication, which ensures that suppliers’ interests are always upheld, irrespective of their size is among reasons they would continue working with Carrefour. “We treat our suppliers as partners, and see our role as facilitators who enable our supplier access a wider market through our stores,” Franck Moreau, country manager, Majid Al Futtaim – Retail Kenya said in a statement. Carrefour has four stores in The Hub Karen, Two Rivers Mall, Thika Road Mall and The Junction. With the new store at Sarit Centre, the staff base for the retailer will go up to 1,400 employees.
