NASA co-principals Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang’ula should wait for their time to lead or look for their own country, Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has said. The two have been criticising NASA leader Raila Odinga after he reconciled with President Uhuru Kenyatta without consulting them. Speaking in Teso South on Sunday, the governor told them to leave Raila alone. “Uhuru and Raila are now working together following the symbolic handshake. The President’s agenda is affordable healthcare, housing and food security. These are what we should embrace to benefit our people. Much time was wasted on politics and election petitions. With that now behind us, we need to focus on development in the next five years and forge a united and peaceful country,” Ojaamong said. He spoke when he joined Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa in distributing relief food to flood victims at Akiriamas Primary School.
