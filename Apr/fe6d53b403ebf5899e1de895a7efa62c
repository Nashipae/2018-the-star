Gold Coast Commonwealth Games full-bore semifinalist Christopher Saina used his experience from the Club Games last month to win the 2018 Mini Bisley shooting competition held over four days at the Defence Forces Rifle Range in Nanyuki. The three-time Kenya Open holder continued with his great form locally, recording an impressive aggregate of 555 points for 40 vee-bulls out of the highest possible score 600 for 120. Saina has won over 10 tournament in the last three years and his mastery of the how to counter range windage and the mirage has earned him respect over time. The General Service Unit officer topped a field of 90 marksmen, firing in rainy conditions. He downed 289 points for 24v in the short range (300m, 500m and 600m) and 266 for 16 in the long distance—800m and 900m. Both ranges had an out of HPS of 300 for 60 apiece. “I learnt quite a lot in Gold Coast and I applied some of the knowledge in the shoot given the weather conditions. Shooting is a life-long learning experience and I definitely gain new knowledge shooting under rainy conditions. I have learnt from others and from my own blunders on the firing line,” said Saina. Full-bore captain and two-time Kenya Open winner Sanford Otundo was second with 551 for 35v and was closely followed by Kenya Railways Police’s John Ihugo who carded 550 for 23.
