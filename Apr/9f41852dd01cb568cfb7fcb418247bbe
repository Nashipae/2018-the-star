The Jubilee administration is neither intending nor interested in changing the current structure of the Executive. JP secretary general Raphael Tuju on Wednesday said those propagating this agenda are misguided and unfair. “There are those talking about the possibility of having a different executive structure. But as far as we are concerned at this point in time, our focus is jobs, opportunities and prosperity for our people,” he said at Royal Garden Hotel, Ol kalou. Tuju had a daylong meeting with Nyandarua leaders, including Governor Francis Kimemia, MCAs and executives. He said the Jubilee leadership is not prepared to get itself derailed from its focus to engage in political issues, instead of delivering on the President’s Big Four Agenda He said he or the party will not take a stand on the debate regarding amending the law to change the existing structure of the executive. “That’s something too thin to stand on. I will fall [if I did],” Tuju said. The former MP said Kenya needs industries and other factors of economic growth. He cited Nyandarua as an example, saying the county produces 34 per cent of Kenya’s potatoes. Tuju said some areas such as Kinangop, potatoes rot and is used to feed cows, yet in Ndaragwa, children starve and suffer from malnutrition and stunted growth. “Then, for some reason, you want to tell me that what some people talked at funerals about the structure of the executive is what should be occupying my head? I think you are not being fair,” he said.
