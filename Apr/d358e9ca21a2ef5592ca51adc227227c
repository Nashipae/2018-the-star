Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda has urged Knut to iron out its internal wrangles and focus on putting the government in check. He said with President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga pledge to work together to unite the country, Kenya has been left without a party to hold the government to account. Ochanda spoke on Saturday at Majego Secondary School in Bondo. He said it is unhealthy for a country not to have a vibrant opposition. Ochanda urged civil society and national unions - including Knut - to fill the gap. His remarks come as the framework for the Raila-Uhuru relationship is being worked on. The much-hyped handshake between Uhuru and Raila in late March gave rise to hope for an end to negative ethnicity and profiling as well as lasting peace. Ochanda differed with Knut members calling for the resignation of secretary general Wilson Sossion. He said the law states someone is considered to be getting a double salary when he or she is paid from public coffers, adding Sossionâ€™s case is different.
