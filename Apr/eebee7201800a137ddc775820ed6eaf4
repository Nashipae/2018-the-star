Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion yesterday urged the Teachers Service Commission to halt mass transfer of teachers. Addressing the media at the Knut headquarters in Nairobi, he said stakeholders were not involved in policy formulation. He says the move by the TSC to adopt staffing rules without consultation with teachers and their unions is demoralising their members. “The teaching profession has been ambushed by its own employer. TSC cannot make decisions touching on teachers without involving us,” Sossion said.
