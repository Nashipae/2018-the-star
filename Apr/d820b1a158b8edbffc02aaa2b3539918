Corruption in the police service is partly to blame for the increasing number of juvenile gangs in Likoni, Muslims for Human Rights has said. Muhuri yesterday said investigations have shown some gang members are relatives of some police officers. “They offer protection to them, at times tipping them off,” the NGO said. “This has compromised raids and in the long run, some police officers were paid. There is corruption in the service,” Muhuri’s rapid response officer Fahad Changi said. In response, Likoni police boss Benjamin Rotich urged Muhuri to forward names of the corrupt officers. He said this will help in the investigations, and if they are found culpable, action will be taken. “But as far as I know, no officer in Likoni is involved in such an activity,” he said on the phone yesterday. Last Tuesday, a security meeting was held on fighting rising crime. It followed attacks on dozens of residents and the killing of one. In retaliation, police felled at least 10 suspected gangsters, causing fa urore from some residents. Human rights defenders called for an alternative to killings. The report that followed the security forum was released at Muhuri’s offices yesterday. It showed that although the crime rate had declined, drug abuse and parental negligence were security threats. Changi said harassment by police was a problem. “Mistrust and inadequate coordination and cooperation between state security actors and the community contributed to this bane,” Changi said. Muhuri’s chairman Khelef Khalifa said there are many problems within the police that makes it difficult to fight crime. “Unless the police change itself so the public can have confidence in them, it will be extremely difficult for police to succeed,” he said. Khalifa said complaints against extrajudicial killings by police and beatings are sabotaging war on crime.
