Mombasa county is doomed because most MCAs are “yes-sir” types and cannot oversight Governor Hassan Joho’s administration, an ANC official warned yesterday. ANC Coast secretary general Jimmy Azangu said residents’ lives and the economy are at stake because motions passed only benefit a few individuals. Thirty-nine of 42 MCAs are allied to ODM, a NASA affiliate. Joho is ODM’s deputy boss. ANC is also a NASA affiliate. It says the assembly has been captured, compromised and lacks opposition. Azangu criticised MCAs for “siding with anything to do with Governor Hassan Joho”. Several MCAs said they would not comment for fear of reprisal. One who spoke in confidence said, “The town is dead. Mombasa should be sold and each resident given their share of the proceeds and look for a place to go.” The statement angered some MCAs. Nominated MCA Moses Aran dismissed the claims and said there were ulterior motives. He said those pretending to advocate change are being used to undermine Joho. “Our love for Joho does not erode our independence. Many motions from the executive have been defeated,” Aran said. Deputy speaker Fahdili Mwalimu also rejected Azangu’s claims and said the assembly is run professionally. But Azangu said the assembly cannot question Joho over Mombasa’s filth and garbage. He wants its leadership changed. He told MCAs to sober up. “This fear that if I go against his will or do anything that offends or embarrasses him will land me into trouble is pathetic, unprofessional and selfish,” he said.
