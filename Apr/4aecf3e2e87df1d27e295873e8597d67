Three independent power producers are set to break ground in June for construction of power plants that will generate 105 megawatts at Menengai Geothermal Project in Nakuru. Geothermal Development Company CEO Johnson ole Nchoe (right) said they have fulfilled all the conditions for the project. Among the requirements is acquiring land lease from the Kenya Forest Service and a report by an independent consultant that shows there is enough steam that can be sustained for 25 years. Nchoe spoke on Monday during a visit by the executive director, African Development Bank East African region, Caleb Weggoro (left).
