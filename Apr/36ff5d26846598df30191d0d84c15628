Police have arrested 14 out of the 17 wanted gang members who had been terrorising Mt Elgon residents. The criminals have been arrested during the first 30 days of a three-months curfew in the area. On March 6, Interior CS Fred Matiang'i ordered a 6am-to-6pm curfew following rampant attacks targeting locals. Over 30 people had been killed since the attacks began.

The three include Tomithy Kitai alias Cheprakach who police have placed a million shillings bounty on his head and his brother Ndiwa Kitai. Bungoma county commissioner James Kianda said the government had dealt with the operations in four phases to ensure a lasting solution. “We have so far arrested fourteen out of the 17 gang members with our officers almost zeroing down on the leader Chepkarach,” Kianda said.

He said by the end of May the team will have  completed all its work and residents issued with title deeds. The affected areas include Chepyuk, Chengwoyo and Emia locations. “Our Chiefs have been holding over four public Baraza’s in a week which has seen public reconciliation being done among families to return life to normalcy,” he said. Kianda at the same time said the government had embarked on the planting of new forests cover in the areas that had been worst affected with the Shamba system that has now been banned.
