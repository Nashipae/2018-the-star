A global pharmaceutical company and a charity have extended a Bungoma healthcare programme for pregnant women and newborns for four years. They have been assisting children and pregnant mothers since 2014 to ensure safe delivery. GlaxoSmithKline and the Save the Children have given the Bungoma government a Sh500 million grant for the fight against infant and maternal mortality. The money will buy equipment and medicine. The programme has been extended to 2022. The two organisations extended the programme, following what they termed reduction of infant mortality at birth. Save the Children country director Wang Le yesterday said they extended the programme after realising they had reduced mortality rates in the region for mothers and newborns. Wang said the programme has encourage more women to give birth in health facilities. “We have been carrying out our health activities, especially, on pregnant women in Bumula, Kabuchai, Mt Elgon and Cheptais subcounties. We have made a big positive impact on residents,” she said. Statistics from the organisation show the mortality rate of mothers at delivery had declined to 400 out of 10,000 mothers in 2013 to 250 out of 10,000 mothers today. Wang said the organisation had in four years spent a total of Sh500 million. “When we came in, the mortality rate was very high. We have reduced it by almost 50 per cent and we intend to bring it to down zero by 2022,” she said. Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati said the programme has greatly improved healthcare in the county. He said his government has prioritised the healthcare system to ensure no mother or child dies at birth. “My government is committed towards ensuring we uphold the Big Four agenda. Proper healthcare is among them,” he said. The governor said he will support any organisation willing to work with the county.
