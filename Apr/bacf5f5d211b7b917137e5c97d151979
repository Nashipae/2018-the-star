Kenya is among 10 countries in East Africa set to benefit from Sh130 million investment project that targets to increase production in the agriculture sector. Yesterday, the East African Farmers Federation in partnership with the International Fund For Agriculture Development unveiled the EAFF-IFAD Youth project workshop. The project intends to reach about 10,000 youths across the 10 East African countries within the next three years. Uganda, Burundi,Rwanda, South-Sudan, Tanzania, Djibouti and Ethiopia are some of the countries set to benefit from the project. The federation has received Sh100 million of the funding from IFAD and has contributed the remaining Sh30 million. Speaking to the press during the launch of the project, EAFF chief boss Steve Muchiri said they intend to use the capital for training of the young farmers with a long term goal of achieving Food and nutrition security which is among Kenya's government big four agenda. “The intention of this project is to help the young people in the agriculture sector to develop business and investor ready kind of plans by presenting them opportunities available in the public, private and investment sectors,” Muchiri said. He further explained that the project is targeting 15 rural areas groups of about 10 to 30 people in the 10 countries. After a successful pitching by the end of this year, Muchiri said only 10 of the 15 groups will be selected in the first approach dubbed the competitive process while the remaining five will be absorbed in the second approach labeled the purposeful selection process. The training process will include mentorship, follow ups by industry experts and exchange visits in major agricultural institutions across the 10 countries. At the end of the training set to end in 2021, EAFF intends to look for funders to invest in the youth groups.
