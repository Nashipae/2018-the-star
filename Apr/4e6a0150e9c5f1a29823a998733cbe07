Change is inevitable was a dominant theme in day two of the 59th edition of the National Drama Festival yesterday at Lenana School. The quote by Benjamin Disraeli (former British PM 1804-1881 ) got a new twist through a dance by Bungoma Boys’ High School that addressed the disputed teacher transfers by the TSC. The message of the Bukusu dance Kamabeka was that despite change being inevitable, it always faces challenges. It highlighted the problems of the delocalisation programme. In the dance, a new school principal meets hostility from the local community because he is not one of them. A proposal to introduce paid holiday tuition further aggravates the bad blood between the community and the principal. The dance written by Meshach Wafula, a student at the school, ends with the community crafting a guide on the way forward that enables the principal to serve peacefully. The dance was choreographed by Toili Khisa and Violet Moga. Wafula yesterday told the Star he was inspired by the stress students suffered after their studies were disrupted because locals were hostile to new principals. “It is the students who suffer in all these struggles between the TSC, unions and teachers and we remain out of the picture,” he told the Star. Religion and science came to the fore when Lenana School took to the stage. The students performed a play about a learner who died after shunning medicine, vaccination and treatment because the parents subscribed to a faith that disapproves of modern drugs. Other performances included plays, stand-up comedy and narratives. Some 140,000 participants are taking part in the drama festival, which began on Tuesday. Moi Girls’ Marsabit fused Arabic and modern dance, while Shimo la Tewa performed a play called Blackspots. The rib-cracking play sought to address the HIV-Aids pandemic, stigmatisation and control through ARVs. Usenge High School presented a stand-up comedy called Chemotography on addiction to gambling.
