The Kiambu assembly has approved appointment of the Finance chief officer without public input as required by law.
The Assembly Committee on Finance, Budget and Appropriation, submitted a report to the house on vetting of nominee Faith Njeri on Thursday last week. That was the day the public was supposed to submit its views on the nominee. The committee is chaired by MCA Daniel Ngugi,
“During the entire vetting, the committee held several meetings considered the nominee’s curriculum vitae, filled in questionnaire and testimonials. It also heard oral submissions of the nominee during approval hearing on Thursday April 5, 2018,” the report reads. The report shows no public participation but  says an advert was placed in the Star newspaper on April 5. No advert was placed in the paper on that day.
