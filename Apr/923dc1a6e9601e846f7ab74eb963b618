Australian Boxer Taylah Robertson clinched the first medal of the Commonwealth games even before the opening ceremony was conducted. Robertson was granted a bye for her division, giving her immediate entry to the semi-finals. There were seven competitors in the women’s 51kg division and the young boxer received the random bye. This means Robertson will go on to compete in the semi-finals where both losers will win a bronze medal. The next challenge for the athlete is to turn the bronze into a silver or gold medal when the Commonwealth Games officially begin today. “It’s just the luck of the draw,” coach Mark Evans said. “We’ve got a guaranteed bronze but I’m tipping that colour might change.” Robertson is the youngest female boxer to represent the country this year. “She’s proved she should be there, she beat the country’s best 51kg girls and beat them convincingly,” Evans added. The young athlete first got into boxing when she saw an advertisement posted at her local gym at Bribie Island, Queensland, when she was 12-years-old. The 19-year-old has already competed all over the world competing in boxing tournaments in Ireland and India and is a three-time Australian champion. “I put so much training into my craft to demonstrate to people that boxing is not just a slug fest, but a chess game,” she previously told Daily Mail Australia. The teenage athlete will be representing the country on Friday 13 at the Gold Coast. “Tokyo 2020, that’s the endgame,” Robertson said. “To get a gold medal there, it would be amazing, it would be a dream come true.”
