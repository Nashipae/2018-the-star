Daddy Owen is among the celebrities who keep their families off social media. He has been in the music industry for more than a decade. Most of his fans have not seen his wife after the couple wedded, and they keep wondering why he does not post photos of her. Speaking to Word Is, Owen said, "Marriage is amazing, though it has its ups and down. What I always say is that marriage is like a jiko, lazima upepete. If you do not pepeta, the fire will die, and similar to marriage, the work of a husband is to make sure the fire does not die." Asked why he does not post his wife on social media, he said, "My wife is private. Yeye ni daktari, mimi ni musician, and therefore, I chose to be who I am today but for her, she did not choose this kind of life of always being in public. "Even my son, no one has ever seen him on social media, and you might never see him there. I like my family to be private and that is why they love it that way. The moment you start exposing your family to the public, you expect the same backlash you get, they also get. For me, I know how to handle the public, but for them, they do not, and that will affect them." Owen urged the other celebrities to avoid posting photos of their spouses if they are not on social media.
