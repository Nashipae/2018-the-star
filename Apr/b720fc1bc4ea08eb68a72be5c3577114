Street children in Eldoret are supplying drugs and selling illicit alcohol in flasks used for tea, Uasin Gishu County Commissioner Abdi Hassan has reported. Hassan added on Tuesday that bushes around Sosiani River are being used as hiding places for street families who engage in this businesses and other crimes. “We have sent workers to clear the bushes and arrest the youths or street boys operating in such places," he said after meeting chiefs in the town. They launched a crackdown on people in the illegal businesses. Hassan said more than 80 people were arrested and charged in courts in the last two weeks with crimes including the sale of illicit alcohol. Governor Jackson Mandago warned drug peddlers of tough punishments and asked them to keep off Eldoret. "They have been targeting students, youth and athletes," he said, “Their aim is to ruin the lives of our youth, especially athletes. They should keep off this region as they will face serious consequences." Mandago noted that some athletes in the county have been accused of doping, ruining the reputation of the county that has been the home of champions. “My administration will deal ruthlessly with anyone using drugs. We are proud that our county is associated with athletics so we will do all we can to protect it,” he said. “I call upon athletes from the region to refrain from using drugs. They should practise and win clean." The Governor said a special security team was formed to track down those selling substances including bhang and heroine among other banned substances. He spoke after opening Oslo petrol station which is owned by veteran athlete Vivian Cheruiyot.
