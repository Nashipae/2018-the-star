Recruitment agency BrighterMonday has ranked Safaricom as the best company to work for. In its latest report, the United Nations Office in Nairobi emerged second and was followed by Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen), Google and the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) in that order. Centum took position six and was followed by Kenya Power, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Unilever and Coca-Cola respectively. The report titled '2018 Best 100 Companies To Work For' is a compilation of sought-after employers in Kenya. At least 2,067 respondents, mainly current and former employees, were interviewed throughout 2017. The winners were determined based on factors such as how proud employees feel to work in the companies. One of the questions cited in the report is: "Is their sense of belonging strong enough for them to recommend someone else to work for their employer?" The culture, career growth, diversity, inclusion and the pay package were among the factors that were also considered. Categorically, Google topped the ICT sector and then came Microsoft, Oracle, Andela and IBM in that order. Kenya Commercial Bank led financial companies and was followed by World Bank, Central Bank, Equity Bank and Barclays. In the manufacturing sector, Unilever was ranked the best and then came Coca-Cola, British American Tobacco and Bidco. The top three companies in the fast-moving consumer goods sector included Kenya Wine Agencies Limited, Tata chemicals and Heineken. The report further revealed that 60 per cent of the employed earn salaries of less than Sh50,000 while 21 per cent earn between Sh50,000 and Sh100,000. Eight per cent earn between Sh101,000 and Sh105,000 and six per cent between Sh151,000 and Sh250,000. Three per cent of the respondents reported earning Sh251,000 to Sh400,000 while only two per cent said they earned more. The study found that both men and women were not overwhelmingly satisfied with their places of work. Click here for the latest political news
