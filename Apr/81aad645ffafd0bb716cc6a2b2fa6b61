National Super League leaders Western Stima confront a misfiring Administration Police today at Moi Stadium Kisumu as they seek to extend their advantage at the top of the 19-team table. Stima are currently perched atop the standings with 20 points, three ahead of second-placed Kibera Black Stars, and will hope to spice their promotion to the Kenyan Premier League with another three points. Buoyed by their 1-0 win over Nakuru All Stars in their last match, the Richard Makumbi-coached side will hope to capitalise on their hosts’ poor form where they have won two out of their nine matches. Kibera Black Stars will go for nothing short of three points when they host Coast Stima at Hope Centre. Under the stewardship of Godfrey Oduor, Kibera have defied odds to close the gap on leaders Western Stima and will be hoping to take advantage of any slip-ups. Oduor believes his side will give the best despite missing Esan Karani who is nursing an injury. “We are ready, the boys have been training for the match and I believe they will pick from where we left against Green Commandos. We will miss Karani, who is nursing an injury, but I am happy I have good players who can fill in for him. We are not under pressure to catch up with Stima. We normally approach each game at a time.” At the same venue, Kangemi All Stars play Nairobi Stima while Nairobi City Stars accost GFE 105 at Camp Toyoyo before paving way for KCB, who host winless and bottom-placed Nakuru All Stars. Isibania host Talanta at Awendo while unbeaten Kenya Police will hope to arrest Bidco United at Karuturi Grounds. Click here for the latest political news
