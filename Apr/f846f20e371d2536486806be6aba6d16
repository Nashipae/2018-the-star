Kirinyaga Deputy Governor Peter Ndambiri has denied he is the naked man in a video clip that has gone viral on social media. In the video released on Wednesday, the man and woman are busted in a lodging while naked. Armed men are seen roughing up the man and forcing him to speak on camera. Yesterday, the Kirinyaga county government on its Twitter handle said the images are doctored and that Ndambiri was not involved. This is not the first time the woman is involved in such an incident. In September 2014, she was caught in a lodging with ACK Pumwani Pastor Charles Githinji. He was half naked. The cleric said she invited him to the room for prayers. The woman is suspected of being a member of an extortion racket that targets men to be recorded in the nude and later blackmailed. Three men said to be accomplices in the extortion racket have been charged before a Thika court with violent robbery. The case will be mentioned on May 3. A woman identified as Liz Njuguna is listed in the police files at Ruiru police station as a prosecution witness. The three men are said to have extorted Sh400,000 from a pastor in Membley estate after storming into a house where the woman and a pastor were found naked. Sources at Ruiru police said the woman and a group of men lure men into sex, film them and extort money. Two police officers from Ruiru station have also been linked to the cartel. One officer has since been fired for other criminal activities. A woman officer accused of colluding with the gang was transferred. Ndambiri accused a Nairobi blogger of circulating the video of the naked man alongside a naked woman. Click here for the latest political news
