Nairobi is a model in the war on corruption, Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula after his meeting with Governor Mike Sonko. The Ford Kenya boss praised Sonko for his efforts when he paid him a courtesy call at his City Hall office. The two had a good working relationship when Sonko was Senator. Wetang'ula, a Nasa principal, said the Jubilee Party lawmaker united Kenyans despite their religious, family and political backgrounds. “This is my maiden visit since you were elected Governor. You have done a lot especially in uniting Kenyans. When you were a Senator we used to work so closely. Nairobi is the eye of Kenya," he told Sonko.

Sonko said his administration is working closely with other partners in developing the capital. “Even if they work round the clock to overturn my leadership, they won’t succeed. I'm the anointed one. Those who were involved in swindling the tax-payers' money will face full wrath of the law." Wetang'ula visited Sonko a day after his co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka did. The Wiper leader told Sonko to focus on service delivery and not give in on cheep propaganda. “You have done a lot. Continue serving Nairobians and don’t give room for corrupt individuals," Kalonzo said. At Tuesday's meeting, the county boss apologised for the mess in Nairobi but blamed his predecessor. He said former Governor Evans Kidero failed to fix problems such as clogged drainage systems that have resulted in flooding after rains.
