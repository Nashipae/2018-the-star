A 52-year-old breast cancer survivor is campaigning in Murang’a county to create awareness of the treatable disease. Miriam Wambui from Kangema has been battling cancer since 2009. She wants to give hope to other patients and educate residents. Yesterday, Wambui told the Star cancer is a wearying illness and patients require dedicated support, not stigma, from society and their loved ones to be able to fight it. She urged residents to go for regular checkups so they can be treated effectively if the disease is diagnosed early. "It is dangerous to ignore changes you notice in their bodies however slight They could be symptoms of cancer,” Wambui cautioned. She said anyone developing lumps, abnormal pains and itches should seek medical help immediately. Wambui underwent several rounds of chemotherapy until 2015 when it was found the disease, in its fourth stage, had spread to her lungs. She was taken to India for surgery. This could not help, and she had more chemotherapy. "Doctors told me my cancer was not progressing, but they were not able to suppress it. They said it had become stagnant,” Wambui said. She was to go back to India last December but was unable to travel and was put on more chemotherapy at Kenyatta National Hospital. Her 10-year fight with cancer has been difficult and she often suffers from severe headaches and vomiting, and has lost all her hair. Currently, she feels no pain. Wambui is set to undergo a medical review this week to establish if the disease is in remission. "In treatment, I used to wonder what to do when I get better. My family and I decided it would be a worthy cause to tell others about the disease and give patients hope,” she said. Wambui wants to be an example to others who lead positive lives even after diagnosis, knowing it is a sickness like any other. It can be overcome, she said.
