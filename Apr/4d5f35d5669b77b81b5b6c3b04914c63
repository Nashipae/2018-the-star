Bishop David Gakuyo's Ekeza Sacco has moved to court to block its deregistration by the commissioner for cooperative society Mary Mungai. The sacco, which is at the centre of a real estate scam, wants the court to quash the decision published on March 23. It also wants the court to bar the commissioner from making any publications or comments either on print media or electronic or publicising their alleged failure to comply with regulations until the case is heard and determined. The sacco has sued Mungai. Sacco CEO Gladys Muriithi accused Mungai of acting out of political pressure. She said Mungai had last year admitted there were political interests against the sacco given Gakuyo's interest in the Kiambu gubernatorial race. “The respondent admitted during a meeting with the board that the purported audit she instituted in March 2017 was as a result of the political pressure," Muriithi said. Affidavits indicate the sacco has more than 50,000 members comprising small scale traders in the informal sector. The sacco has an operating capital of more than Sh2 billion, including members' savings and contributions. “The respondent has displayed bad faith by appearing on electronic media and radio to give the purported reasons for the cancellation of the our certificate,” the petition reads.
