Zimbabwean nurses have called off a strike against poor working conditions and will return to work on Monday, a nurses union said on Sunday. Vice President Constantino Chiwenga last week announced the sacking of 16,000 striking nurses, accusing them of a “politically motivated” walkout.

The union said it had filed a court application to force the government to reverse its decision to fire the nurses. President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government is seeking to keep a lid on labour unrest in the build-up to the first elections since the fall of Robert Mugabe. The elections, which will pit Mnangagwa against several opposition candidates, are set for July. The nurses strike came days after junior doctors wrapped up a month-long walkout over pay and working conditions. Click here for the latest local political news
