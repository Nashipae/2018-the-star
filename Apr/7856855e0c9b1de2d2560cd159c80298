IEBC has refuted claims that Ezra Chiloba aides were forced to take leave. The commission, in a tweet on Saturday, said the staff were assigned new duties. "If they took leave, it was on their own volition," the commission chaired by Wafula Chebukati said. It said the group could be utilising their leave days and have not been compelled to take a rest as claimed. The Star on Friday learned that Chilobaâ€™s two personal assistants, two secretaries, and an office assistant were asked to take leave. The claims is that Chebukati is apprehensive they could pass information to their boss who was sent on compulsory leave three weeks ago. Reached for comment, Chiloba said the action reeked of witch-hunt. More on this: IEBC crisis deepens as Chiloba aides forced to take leave Click here for the latest political news
