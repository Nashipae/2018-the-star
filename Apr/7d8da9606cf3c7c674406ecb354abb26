Westlands MP Tim Wanyonyi has asked Nasa co-principals and supporters to back the Uhuru- Raila peace pact to end the political standoff that held the country at ransom for months. President Uhuru Kenyatta and Nasa leader Raila Odinga signed an agreement on March 9 and picked a team to lead unity talks. But Nasa co-principals Musalia Mudavadi, Kalonzo Musyoka and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetangula rejected the deal. "We in Nasa are not saying Nasa has been dissolved, we are still together. We are waiting [for the pact's details] and soon we will go everywhere in the country to tell the wananchi that we are working with the government but where they go wrong we will stand aside and correct them," Wanyonyi said. The legislature said Raila met and shook hands with Uhuru in a show of unity, and said it is time to unite Kenyans so that the country can move on.

"We want to work together but this cooperation should be fruitful. The pact between Raila and Uhuru was of inclusiveness, equality, and uniting wananchi in the whole country. We are all Kenyans regardless of our tribes. Politics should not divide us." He went on: "But there are others who are very bitter. I have seen there is a cabinet secretary in Uhuru's cabinet called [Fred] Matiangi. He is bitter than Uhuru himself. The other day he was rebelling against a  [Parliamentary] committee on National Security and Administration. He has grown devilish horns." The lawmaker said Mating'i should be in jail for "declaring" he will not respect the judiciary. "If you cannot respect the Judiciary and the rule of law, you are not fit to hold the office you hold now," he said.  Click here for the latest political news
