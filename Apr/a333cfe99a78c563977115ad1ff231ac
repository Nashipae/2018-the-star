NASA leaders Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang’ula have planned a series of rallies in Trans Nzoia and Uasin Gishu ahead of the planned merger between ANC and Ford Kenya. The rallies will begin on Saturday. The purpose is to inform residents on the planned merger, Luhya unity bid and address national issues. Mudavadi will attend a church function in Eldoret on Sunday. ANC secretary general Barrack Muluka yesterday told the Star arrangements are ongoing. Mudavadi, Wetang’ula and former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale visited Nandi a fortnight ago, where the two NASA leaders hinted at merging their parties. “The visit was very significant as leaders they need to come out and meet the people so we can have our communities work together in unity,” former Kapsabet Mayor David Ngetich said. Mudavadi and Wetang’ula said they are already in talks with other political leaders and the merger will be announced at the right time. "Every other time we have been fielding many candidates as a community, but this time around we decided it will not happen again. Wetang’ula and I will walk together in the journey to unite our people,” Mudavadi said. The two accused NASA leader Raila Odinga of betraying them. Wetang’ula said the Luhya community had been bruised in battle. “We will heal and move on. We are in talks with my brother Mudavadi and others like Khalwale as well as with other Luhya leaders. We will soon give our people the way forward,” he said. They spoke at Tuloi Primary School during the homecoming of Kaptuiywa MCA Geoffrey Kevolwe. Nandi Governor Stephen Sang’ and Senator Samson Cherargei were present. Sang and Chergei urged the Luhya community to back Deputy President William Ruto 2022 presidential bid.
