Kenya Red Cross Society Central Kenya regional manager Gitonga Mugambi has said 20 people have lost their lives in flood disasters and about 18,000 displaced since onset of the heavy rains. "In Meru, we have recorded three deaths and 2,400 people displaced. In the neighbouring Tharaka Nithi county, one person died of drowning. Some 200 people have been affected in Chogoria, Maara constituency, after a hailstorm. About 3,000 hectares of land have been destroyed, as well as the crops," Mugambi said on Sunday. Accompanied by Meru County director of Special Programmes Anthony Kimathi, they gave food to residents of Tractor village, Tigania East subcounty, who have been affected by the ongoing rains. At least 28 locals have been displaced. Mugambi urged residents to avoid crossing flooded rivers or flood waters. He cautioned against ignoring the weather man, especially now that they risk being swept away. "In my region alone, the ongoing heavy downpour has up to date claimed 20 lives and displaced 18,000 families. I urge those who live in hilly and unstable places to be extra vigilant and keep off building houses on the waterways or trenches. We were here during the last rainy season but you see people are hesistant to vacate risky areas," Mugambi said. The officers distributed 24 bags of maize and 12 bags of beans, cutlery, cookers and blankets to the affected families. They further advised area leaders to report and liaise with them early enough instead of waiting until locals are affected for them ask for interventions. Kimathi said Governor Kiraitu Murungi's administration is taking measures to protect locals and ensure their well-being. "We want to have long-term actions to prevent flood disasters from wreaked havoc and destruction. This why we will enhance our partnership with Red Cross to mitigate disasters so that people do not suffer," Kimathi said.
