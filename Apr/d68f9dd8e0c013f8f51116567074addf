Out of this, 28,136 students (44.76) per cent will pursue science courses while 34,716 students will study humanities. According to the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service, 28,866 applied to join TVET and were placed. KUCCPS CEO John Muraguri said in Nairobi on Monday that the placement process was over a period of three months. The admission of students, who are part of the 669,307 students who sat the examinations in 2017, is set to begin in May. Placement process was guided by the list of student applicants. Muraguri said all students were placed in university places based on the course choices during the first and revise selection process. This will be the first time the government will sponsor students pursuing certificate courses in national polytechnics. This year's placement also focussed on the placement of students to technical colleges that have been infamous in the country. According to TVET Principal Secretary Kevit Desai, the institutions currently have only taken in 5 per cent capacity of their potential. Click here for the latest political news
