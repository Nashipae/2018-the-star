NASA principal Musalia Mudavadi has told the government to respect court orders and improve lecturers’ terms of employment. The Amani leader said the 2017-2021 CBA mediated by the court after the 2016-17 strikes should be honoured. He said yesterday the defiance mirrors a tradition established by the Jubilee government in regard to respect for court rulings. “The government players in the university education saga are only borrowing a leaf from a system that is decidedly hellbent on ignoring court orders,” Musalia said. He said the government “is inviting the law of the jungle” by constantly ignoring court orders. “A caring government would have closed all campuses until the industrial dispute with lecturers is resolved,” Mudavadi said. “This would have saved students and parents the agony of unprofitable expenses.” Mudavadi said the strike, which started on March 1, has hurt students, who will have to spend more time on campus. “The students are also paying for accommodation yet they are not learning. It is very bad since no one will compensate them for losses,” he said. Mudavadi said the government should pay lecturers better salaries, and invest in modern facilities as well as research. Mudavadi’s remarks came a day after lecturers remained adamant they will continue with their strike until their grievances are addressed. “One wonders whether the government is serious that it will actually admit students into public universities where there is no learning,” Mudavadi said.
