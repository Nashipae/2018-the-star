A Murang’a court has put on probation the man accused of killing his wife and dumping her body in a pit latrine. Principal Magistrate Anthony Mwichigi put Stephen Mwangi on two years' probation in a ruling on Wednesday. The decision came days after the prosecution tried in vain to find the body of Mwangi's wife Christine Ruguru. The exercise led by DCIO Japheth Maingi and
public health officers saw police officers dig out the pit latrine and two other
locations in the home before calling it off.

Mwichigi ordered the suspect to report to Murang’a police station every two weeks until his probation period ends. He asked the investigating officer to
continue looking into the disappearance of Ruguru two years ago. The suspect was charged two weeks ago with murdering his wife after it was reported that he was heard
bragging about killing her and dumping her body in a toilet while drunk. The victim disappeared after she and Mwangi had a
disagreement and separated for six months. Ruguru had been in a relationship with another man. Neighbours claim Mwangi followed Ruguru
to her maternal home in a bid to repair their broken marriage but ended up
killing her. Damaris Wanjiku said her daughter had grown tired of
their turbulent marriage and had planned to make their separation official through the
chief’s office. But Mwangi was unable to move on
even after learning of Ruguru's new relationship, she said. As police tried to find the body, she asked them not to give up so she can find closure. Mwangi and Ruguru's three children now live
with their grandparents. Click here for the latest political news
