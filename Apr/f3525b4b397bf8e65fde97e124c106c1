Cotu boss Francis Atwoli has objected a move by the National Hospital Insurance Fund to introduce more accounts under the health cover. Atwoli told journalists on Wednesday that the move will see workers' lose money without their consent. He added that the NHIF board has not yet proven it has the capacity to handle many accounts. "We have been told they already have a maternity and kidney account and are adding a students' account. This will automatically eat into regular money that comes from workers," he said. Atwoli said if the NHIF insists on the move, workers will be compelled to have insurance covers to protect them from government fraud. "They want to clump all accounts like what happened at the NSSF, where old people's accounts were lumped together, giving people with long fingers an opportunity to 'eat' money," he said. The workers' union Secretary General said the NHIF board will meet and issue a comprehensive statement on the matter. His sentiments came days after Kwale Woman Representative Zulekha Juma wrote to Speaker Justin Muturi seeking amendments to the NHIF Act. Zulekha is seeking the introduction of a mandatory requirement for all public officers to be entitled to payment of benefits for medical expenses only at public hospitals. "With the dwindling health services in the country, it is hoped that the amendment will not only ensure public hospitals get added funding to be better staffed and equipped, but also ensure constant oversight of service delivery by leaders across the country in this crucial sector," she notes in her proposal.
