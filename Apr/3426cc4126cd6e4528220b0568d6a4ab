WPP Scangroup Limited has reached agreement to acquire a majority stake in leading market research agency Research and Marketing Group Investment Limited. It operates Kantar TNS in several African countries. The transaction is subject to approval by WPP Scangroup shareholders and Capital Markets Authority. Upon approval, WPP Scangroup will acquire the 70 per cent shareholding in Research and Marketing Group Investment Limited, held by Russell Square Holdings BV, a subsidiary of WPP and 10 per cent of the 30 per cent shareholding held by International Research and Marketing Group Holdings. WPP Scangroup currently provides market research services through Kantar Millward Brown. The proposed acquisition of Kantar TNS will enable WPP Scangroup align the two market research businesses, for enhanced service for clients and increased operational efficiency. Kantar TNS and Kantar Millward Brown are each part of Kantar Group, WPP Plc’s data management division and one of the world's largest insight, information and consultancy groups. Kantar TNS operates in Nigeria and Kenya, which are primary markets for WPP Scangroup, and other countries including Senegal, Cameroun, Cote d’Ivoire and Ghana. WPP Scangroup’s CEO Bharat Thakrar said: “The proposed acquisition of Kantar TNS presents a tremendous opportunity for business growth and investment in markets such as Nigeria and Kenya. The focus on research and data driven operations perfectly fits our goal of providing horizontal, integrated communications services and products across the sub-Saharan region.” The proposed acquisition will increase WPP Scangroup’s presence and capability in the region and enable it to build a leading position in market research business.
