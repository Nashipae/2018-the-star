The government has directed that all key institutions in Nairobi get constant water supply. Beneficiaries will include big hotels, airports and hospitals. The city is experiencing a water shortage — about 250 million litres daily. Water CS Simon Chelugui on Tuesday said this will protect the image of the country as the government strives to increase supply. “You can imagine a visitor coming all the way from Europe going home with a bloated stomach or suffering because they visited Kenya. They will go home with a bad image of the country,” he told the Senate Committee on Land, Environment and Natural Resources in Mombasa. “We have an affirmative decision to ensure our CBD and urban areas of Westlands and Upper Hill get permanent water supply.” Nairobi county residents require about 750 million litres daily. Karimeni Dam has been identified as the best and most immediate source of water. It will provide 70 million litres daily to reduce the deficit. “We also identified the Northern Collector Tunnel, which will provide Nairobi with 140 million litres of water per day,” Chelugui said. The senators want laws made to compel the government to harvest rainwater. But Chelugui said harvesting is not possible because of too much air pollution.
