Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo yesterday dismissed claims Siaya Senator James Orengo is out to scuttle the unity deal between Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta. He told the Star on the phone Orengo has been at the forefront in “prosecuting issues of rationality” and has never been against the pact. Odhiambo said he has accompanied Orengo “in virtually all the public functions he has attended since Raila and Uhuru agreed to work together” and there is nowhere Orengo dismissed the deal. Orengo is a loyal lieutenant and there is no way he can be against something meant to spur development in the country, he said.
