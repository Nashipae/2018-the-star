The presidency is not a dynasty or an hereditary seat, National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale has said. “[Deputy President] William Ruto’s father was a peasant and the next election is not about who your father is, but what you have done to Kenyans,” he said. Duale took a jibe at Kanu chairman and Baringo Senator Gideon Moi on Saturday during Garissa Agriculture executive Issa Yarrow’s thanksgiving in Kasha, Balambala constituency, on Saturday. Gideon was in Garissa for a separate function as the chief guest at Fafi MP Abdikarim Osman’s homecoming party in Bura East. He was accompanied by 14 Kanu members – including Tiaty MP WiIliam Kamket – who criticised Duale for opposing changes to the Constitution. “If Kenyans have welcomed the idea and want the changes, who is Duale to oppose them?” Kamket said.  WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? He said leaders elected on the Kanu ticket will support Gideon’s presidential bid in 2022. Gideon did not dwell on 2022 politics, but promised not to disappoint his supporters. But Duale, who led his colleagues including two Kanu MPs Mohamed Dahiye (Dadaab) and Mohamed Hire (Lagdera), said the pastoral community has already made up its mind to support Ruto. “Kenyans will elect you depending on what you have done for Kenyans for these five years. We will ensure President Uhuru Kenyatta leaves a legacy,” he said. Duale said Gideon would not get votes, even from Baringo county. Garissa Governor Ali Korane, MPs Fatuma Gedi (Wajir Woman Representative), Abdi Shurie (Balambala) and Ahmed Qolosho (Wajir West) attended Yarrow’s thanksgiving. Gedi said Gideon has not started development projects and “only hides under the name of his father”. She said the Baringo senator has not added value to the Senate. "As leaders from Northeastern led by our very able Duale, we have made a decision to support Ruto in the coming polls. That is the direction we will lead our people towards when the times comes,”
