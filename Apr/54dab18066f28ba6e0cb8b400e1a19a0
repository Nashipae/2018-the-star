Catholic bishops want an all-inclusive round table conference to iron out differences threatening to tear the country down the middle. Matters that need urgent attention, the clergy said, are constitutional review. Under the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops, the clergy on Friday said there is need to look at the whole electoral system and whether “it is the best way of getting the right leaders to rule the country”. “Such a conference should look at how the presidency can be structured so that it is above political parties; so that it is not a position of power struggle that is bitterly contested as it happened in the 2007 and 2017 presidential elections,” KCCB chairman Philip Anyolo said. Anyolo and KCCB vice chairman John Owaa read the joint statement on the state of the nation on behalf of 24 other Bishops at Queen of Apostle Church, Kasarani. He said there has been a tendency to open manipulate, which has entrenched the “evil of vote buying and other forms of bribery.” “The round table conference should also look at how we should invest in democratic institutions and how to strengthen the place and role of the opposition in order to keep in check the government in power,”Anyolo said, adding the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA chief Raila Odinga provides an opportunity. Raila rejected the results of the August 2017 election and withdrew from the October repeat polls. He later took an oath as People’s President on January 30 at Uhuru Park. On March 9, however, Raila and Uhuru held a closed-door meeting at Harambee House and had the historic handshake. Details of the deal discussed remain scant. Bishops are unhappy about politicians putting the country in a campaign mood. Click here for the latest political news
