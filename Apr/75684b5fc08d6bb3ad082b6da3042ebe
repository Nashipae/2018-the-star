Kenyan’s environmental activists face harassment and death threats and Unep wants to educate people and government to defend whistle-blowers. Mombasa-based activist Phyllis Omido led a campaign to close a dangerous lead-smelting factory in Mombasa last year. She said she lives under constant threat and has gone into hiding several times. “Countless environmental activists are harassed and threatened for defending the environment against logging, mining and uncontrolled development,” she said recently. Last week Unep last week rolled out an initiative to support environmental activists. It said at least four environmental defenders are being killed per week globally and many more are harassed, intimidated and forced from their lands. The Gigiri-based body said it was taking a stand against threats, intimidation, harassment and murder of environmental defenders globally. The initiative launched on March 27 will help people understand their rights and how to defend them. Unep will work with media to improve coverage of rights and encourage the private sector to champion environmental rights. It will assist governments implement their rights and obligations.Unep cited growing attempts by some countries to limit the activities of NGOs. “Between 1993 and 2016, 48 countries enacted laws restricting the activities of local NGOs receiving foreign funding,” Unep said. Immediately Jubilee came to power in 2013, it proposed laws to cut foreign funding to local NGOs to a maximum of 15 per cent. Omido, founder of Centre for Justice Governance and Environmental Action, said grassroots movements focusing on business and human rights are seen as anti-development actors and thus get no support from the state and even international actors. Elite widlife conservationists are supported, she said.
