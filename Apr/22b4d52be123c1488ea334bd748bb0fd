PostBank is among banks that will disburse bimonthly allowances for the elderly in the Inua Jamii cash transfer programme. The initiative is in line with social interventions that the government is implementing for persons over the age of 70 years. The senior citizens will receive Sh4,000 every two months, in a programme expected to benefit over half a million elderly citizens. This is equivalent of Sh2,000 every month. Four banks that have been selected will assist the elderly to register their details to open an account with their preferred lender. The bank will leverage on its network of branches and boasts a huge pension portfolio, said the MD, Ann Karanja. "By combining our experience and knowledge with government ministries including social protection, we will see exponential growth in financial inclusion and enhancing livelihoods of Kenyans," she said in a statement. She said there are an estimated 523,129 beneficiaries across the country.
