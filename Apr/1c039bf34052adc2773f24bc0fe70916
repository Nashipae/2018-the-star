A man charged will illegal firearms possession schemed to have ammunition recovered in his sister’s house to cause her deportation, a court has heard. An investigating officer told Mombasa senior principal magistrate Charles Ndegwa that Noor Mohamed wanted his sister Zahara Pote to be deported. "The plan was that he could assume ownership of Sh100 million property," the officer testified during the hearing last Friday. The siblings are embroiled in a dispute over ownership of the property. Zahara is married to retired US soldier Allen Pote. Mohamed was arrested after being found in possession of 504 rounds of ammunition. Mombasa deputy DCIO Francis Kipsang said Mohamed wanted the ammunition to be discovered in his sister’s house. The plans were thwarted. The bullets were recovered from Mohamed’s house on January 5,2016. The recovery came a few days after the man reported to CID officers that his sister and her husband had given him a green box containing the bullets for safekeeping. Mohamed faces charges of being found with blank cartridges in circumstances that were prejudicial to public order. He faces a second charge of giving false information to the police. He is accused of trying to frame her sister and the husband. The couple retired to Kenya in 2013. "The accused person wanted to frame-up her sister so that she could be arrested and thrown out of the country because they were having several disputes in relation to ownership of properties," Kipsang said. The officer said Mohamed confessed to detectives that he sourced the firearms and wanted to get rid of his sister. "Although the bullets were manufactured in the US, they are available locally for use by police and military officers during training," ballistic expert Florence Karimi said. Mohamed has since denied the charges and is out on a Sh100,000 surety bond. The case continues on June 19.
