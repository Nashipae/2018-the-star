Kiambaa MP Paul Koinange has asked the government to study family interactions and watch for anger during land transactions. He says a lot of land disagreements have resulted in family members killing and injuring each other. “It is very sad that people from the same family turn on each other in an inhumane way during subdivision of land and property” he said. The legislator was speaking on Saturday in Karuri town, Kiambu where he invited DCI George Kinoti to a security baraza. Koinange urged county commissioners to ensure all parties involved attend land boards and reach agreement before they subdivide their land for sale or inheritance. “It is very important to invite all family members to avoid disputes later. Issues can been avoided if due process was followed,” he said.
