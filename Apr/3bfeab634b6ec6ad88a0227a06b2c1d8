Omari Faraji, 17, who disappeared on April 6 from their home in Ganjoni was not abducted, forced to disappear by police or recruited by militant groups. He escaped after he gambled with the Sh20,0000 his mother, Safia Mohamed, sent to him for upkeep. The teen was found in Diani on Sunday. He had left for college, leaving behind his laptop and phone, when he vanished. Mohamed said Faraji spent most of his time on the two devices, but she thought that was normal for teen. When he was found by Muslims for Human Rights chairman Khelef Khalifa in Diani, Faraji lied he had been kidnapped. He said he had not eaten for days. When Mohamed saw her son at Diani on Sunday, she hugged him. Then she fainted. He was frail and starved. Faraji recovered after he was taken to Diani Beach Hospital. He initially said his “abductors” dropped off him at a shed in Diani Beach after “failing to get ransom from my mother”. But yesterday, at a press conference in Muhuri’s offices, Faraji said all the nine days were spent at the shed. “I used to sleep at the beach. I was afraid of my mother and decided to run away. Please forgive me,” he said in tears. Faraji said it was the first time he spent the cash to gamble. Khalifa questioned why an under-age was allowed to gamble. “This game has proven to be very dangerous. The government must act immediately and ensure children are not part of gambling,” he said. Khalifa accused the police of failing to handle the case adequately. Mohamed said she has forgiven her son. She will take him for counselling. “I’m lucky my son is not dead. Some commit suicide after losing money in a bet,” she said.
