City traders are requesting for compensation from the county government after their business structures along bus terminus were destroyed during a demolition exercise last week. A spot check by the Star at the Central Bus Station revealed that the traders whose structures were demolished hope to reconstruct their structures. The traders, who are mostly small scale, have since remained stranded without premises to conduct their businesses. They say that the same structures demolished by city askaris, they were given licenses for them. They also complained on the short notice given to them and are now asking the county to secure a place for them to continue conducting their businesses. " We were never informed on the demolition process. We got a short notice 24 hours prior to the exercise which never gave us enough time to prepare for to vacate," Mary Mwangi, a trader said. Over the weekend, Starehe Mp Charles Njagua was chased away by the traders as they demanded he comes with Governor Mike Sonko to address the issue. Speaking to Njagua yesterday, he said the demolitions were done to create an enabling environment for the transport sector. "The demolitions took place within my constituency and as much as I support bring back law and order within the city, the small scale traders should also be considered for compensation," he said. However, City Hall's Director of Operations Peter Mbaya told the Star that the demolition exercise is yet to continue. "Why should the County Government give out licenses and go back to demolish them? It does not make sense," he said.
