Kibor is embroiled in more than
eight court cases with his family, including wives. Speaking at the Eldoret law courts on Friday, he said his sons Evans and Raymond Kibor are colluding with his third wife Naomi
Jeptoo to destroy his wealth. Evans and Raymond were charged with malicious damage to his property and destroying the tractor.  They denied the charge before Eldoret chief magistrate Charles Obulutsa and were released on Sh10,000 bond each.
The case will be mentioned April 19. â€œThey are colluding to frustrate me but I will fight on," Kibor said. The 83-year-old politician added that he will use the legal system to protect his property.  A month ago, Kibor filed
for divorce against his third wife, five months after he divorced his
second one. Kibor wants
to divorce Jeptoo, whom he married 43 years ago. On October 6 last
year, Kibor convinced an Eldoret court to dissolve his marriage with his second
wife, Josephine Jepkoech, with whom he had been married for 52 years. Kibor says Jeptoo left their
matrimonial home and denied him conjugal rights. He also says she has not been
supportive, is extremely hostile and intolerant and has caused him serious
psychological suffering. Kibor accused Jeptoo of plotting to
kill him on several occasions. He says she has been beating him. Obulutsa last year allowed Kibor to
divorce Jepkoech on grounds she had been hostile. The court said he
had proved his claims of cruelty. She has appealed against the ruling.
