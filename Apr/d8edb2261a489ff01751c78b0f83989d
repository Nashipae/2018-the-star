Three people died after a landslide swept away a house at Inoi village in Kahuro sub-county, Murang'a county on Saturday.

Speaking to the Star, Kandie said the landslide, which stretched for over a kilometre, affected a tea farm where the five were residing. He said rescue efforts, led by the county disaster management team and security officers, is still ongoing. In another incident, rescuers are searching for one person after another landslide swept away three farms at Gitugi area in Mathioya sub-county. Deputy County Commissioner Charles Laboso said only one person is unaccounted for. "It has been raining heavily the entire night but we are hoping the missing person will be found," he said. He added that Iyego bridge has been submerged after River Mathioya broke its banks. In Kambirwa area in Murang'a East, over 25 families have been cut off by floodwaters. The water has also swept away Karumia bridge that connects Githuri and Kambirwa villages. The footbridge was constructed in 2016 by then Kiharu MP Irungu Kang'ata to stop numerous deaths that were occurring as locals tried to cross Mathioya river. Governor Mwangi wa Iria has urged people living in the landslides-prone area to be cautious and relocate to safer grounds until the rains subside. He has also pledged to provide shelter and foodstuffs for the affected families. Also read: Weatherman warns of flash floods in Mombasa Click here for more political news
