City Hall has ordered all matatus to exit the Nairobi CBD within 10 days. Transport executive Mohamed Dagane says Nairobi is choking with traffic. He said that commuters should now walk into the city centre because that is healthier. Matatus will stop at designated bus stations outside the CBD from where passengers will be collected by 27 NYS buses. Matatus are their own worst enemies. Many are driven badly, especially when dropping and picking passengers. Other road users have little sympathy for them. But private cars constitute 90 per cent of traffic in the Nairobi centre. They only have one or two persons inside, compared to 14 or 28 travelling on public service vehicles. So congestion in the CBD is caused primarily by private cars rather than badly behaved matatus. Matatus should not be removed from the CBD until an adequate alternative public transport system is in place. For instance, the CBD should have bus lanes with multiple official buses, not just a few NYS vehicles.
