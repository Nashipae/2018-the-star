Garissa High Court Judge Justice George Dulu will on May 15 make a ruling on whether new appeal records should be admitted to a case challenging the nominations of two MCAs to Mandera county assembly. The appellant Hafidh Maalim Ibrahim through his lawyer Samuel Nyamberi urged the court to allow new records that was not part of the initial documents filed on March 19. Hafidh had appealed the case at Garissa High Court after Magistrate Peter Areri sitting in Mandera upheld the case on grounds that there was no prove of allegations of breach of political party nomination rules. Ibrahim is suing the Economic Freedom party, Independent Electoral and boundaries Commission (IEBC), Issack Dahir and Halima Billow Omar following the nominations of the two to Mandera County assembly to represent people with disability. The court heard that some of the records were omitted during the binding of appeal documents arguing that it was human error that could occur anytime which is not the first time. Nyamberi said the court should rule in favour of the appellant since they have presented evidence that raises weighty issues on how the case was handled at the lower courts. “We pray that the court to allow the inclusion of omitted records which was done during the binding of appeals documents,” he told the court. However the defense lawyers Benjamin Makoha for the respondents and Brian Odhiambo for IEBC fought off the appellant objecting to the admission of the new records on the claims that the appellants is trying to file new appeals records out of stipulated time. While quoting several Supreme Court orders on preliminary objections, Makoha argued that by allowing the appellant on the new records its same as attempt of filing appeal through backdoor after elapsing of 6odays required time after judgment by lower court.
