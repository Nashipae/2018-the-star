While admitting a delay in disbursment of funds had affected operations in counties, the Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa said the ministry was working round the clock to ensure funds are disbursed soonest possible. “We are aware of the delay but it is in the open that we had a tough season last year due to elections and there was no money to fund critical programs but now we can see things picking up and the money will be disbursed,” he said. The CS who was addressing the press on the sidelines of a workshop for government officers at Simba Lodge in Naivasha called on governors to be patient as the money will be released. “This is something that we cannot forgo as a government as we have seen how devolution has transformed the lives of many even in far flung areas of our country,” he said. And ahead of the fifth annual devolution conference in Kakamega County, Wamalwa said the government had so far sent over Sh1 trillion to counties an indication of its pledge towards devolved units. “We have even surpassed the set 15 per cent of our budget from Sh210 billion in 2013 to Sh302 billion this year and we will continue to ensure that the counties succeed,” he said. He said the conference will be unique as it will give space to the youth who will address the gathering and the President on the successes and challenges of devolution at the grassroots level.
