City Hall yesterday demolished more than 600 structures in Ngara to clear the terminus for matatus ahead of the enforcement of the PSV ban in the city centre. Deputy director of enforcement Peter Mbaya said traders had illegally occupied spaces meant for matatus. The demolitions were carried out at the Muranga Road terminus A and B, Desai Road and Park Road terminus. The demolition by a multiagency team, including police, is expected to continue in Muthurwa today. “We are clearing these spaces for matatus. There will be no more public service vehicles in the CBD,” Mbaya said. Matatus are expected to vacate the city centre by the end of this week according to a notice issued by Transport executive Mohamed Dagane last week. The move is the latest attempt to decongest the CBD. Mbaya said the traders had encroached on the bus terminus, making it hard for matatus to end their journeys at the station. Mbaya said traders are operating on spaces meant for matatus in Muthurwa. “They have disrupted the whole plan,” Mbaya said.
