Nairobi residents in possession of allotment letters will receive their title deeds by end of April, City Hall has announced. Lands CEC Charles Kerich said this will be a reprieve since the letters are no longer accepted by the banks as security for loans. The move will see over 50,000 people receive title deeds by May in line with Governor Mike Sonko's pledge to clean up land issues in Nairobi. Of these 30,000 are those on county property with the rest are those allocated by the national government in the 1970s and 1980s but have never received title deeds. Kerich told the Star on Thursday that the documentation process and preparation of leases is expected to end in a month's time. "The governor believes that title deeds will promote growth of affordable housing as the owners can now borrow money from banks to build more houses." Kerich on Wednesday led a team of lawyers assigned to facilitate the processing of the said title deeds. The applicants will be required to attach their IDs, passport photos, KRA Pin certificate, original allotment letters, and disclose names of current holders. "The documents will be collected at centres set up in Kayole, Umoja, Kariobangi, Dandora, and Mathare North," Kerich said. Sonko earlier urged residents of Eastlands area to provide documents that will enable the county government process their title deeds. President Uhuru Kenyatta earlier directed the Ministry of Lands to work closely with the Nairobi county government to process the documents. Through the president's directive, the Survey of Kenya has waived survey fees for the project areas. Click here for the latest political news
