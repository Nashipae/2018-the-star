Outgoing Nzoia Sugar Company board chairman Joash Wamang’oli has threatened to open the lid on corrupt deals at the Bungoma-based firm. Top managers have pointed an accusing finger at each other as graft claims threaten to cripple the firm. Acting MD Michael Kulundu has dared Wamang’oli to spill the beans. Wamang’oli yesterday accused workers union officials of protecting the management because they were part of the cartel fleecing farmers. He also accused Kulundu of leading the rip-off. “A clerk at the factory should not be running around trying to malign my name. I will reveal secrets that will shock leaders, farmers, the management and workers. They should not joke with me,” Wamang’oli told the Star on the phone. He spoke after secretary general of the workers’ union Macdonald Wamocho asked the government not to renew his contract. Wamacho accused Wamang’oli of running down the factory after failing to protect cane farmers by ensuring prompt payment. Wamang’oli said he was being wrongfully blamed. He said it was the mandate of the MD to carry out the day-to- day factory operations. Farmers are owed more than Sh700 million. Wamang’oli said he had brought Sh300 million to be paid to the farmers. “Where is the money? Wamang’oli said. The outgoing chairman accused Kulundu of using the union to fight him. “I will be releasing all the evidence to show how the management has been involved in graft,” Wamang’oli said. Kulundu dismissed Wamang’oli as a frustrated man who was trying to make a come-back. “Why wait all this while? Why didn’t he spill the beans while he was at the helm,” Kulundu said.
