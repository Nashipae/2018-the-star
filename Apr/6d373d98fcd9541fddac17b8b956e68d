This follows demands by the officials to the management to "release the Forensic Audit report and provide appropriate leadership". "We regret that the university council has been unresponsive to the demands of the students, faculty and staff of Daystar University. We have been all living in a state of anxiety, disbelief and uncertainty and as a result, our trust in governance in the institution is constantly eroded." The three associations said in a letter addressed to the University council dated April 3. Khroda, however, maintains that their suspension will not affect the operations of the university.
