The Judiciary has reported alleged forgery of Chief Justice David Maraga’s signature and its official letterhead by unknown individuals. Through chief registrar of judiciary Anne Amadi, it wrote a letter to the DCI, requesting an investigation into the case. “We wish to make a formal report of these incidences and request that you carry out investigations with a view to bringing those involved to book as soon as possible,” the letter read. The letter addressed to Samuel Kobina dated April 13 says that on a number of occasions, Maraga’s signature has been forged and subsequently circulated on social media platforms and used to fake statements or communications in the guise they are from the Judiciary.
