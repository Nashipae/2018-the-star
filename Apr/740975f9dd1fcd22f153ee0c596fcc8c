Kenya has been free of polio for three years and is in the process of being declared polio-free by the World Health Organization. A 10 per cent drop in immunisation could, however, negate the efforts to eradicate the disease that causes paralysis in children. Director of Medical Services Jackson Kioko on Tuesday said in Mombasa that immunisation has dropped from 78 per cent to 68 per cent in the past five years. He blamed this on lack of awareness among parents. If nothing is done, there could be an outbreak, he said. Kioko added, however, that most of the counties have intensified vaccination campaigns. “We need to go back to where we were and even surpass it because we are supposed to be at 80 per cent,” he said.
