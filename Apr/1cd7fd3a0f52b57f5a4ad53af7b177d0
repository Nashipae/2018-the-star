Lawyers have opposed plans to allow all High Court divisions to preside over land cases. The proposed change is contained in the controversial Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, 2018 tabled in the National Assembly last week by Majority leader Aden Duale. The document seeks to expand the definition of the term “court” under the Land Act to include other divisions of the High Court. Currently, the Land Act only recognises the Environment and Land Court as the division. “Court means the High Court established by Article 165 of the Constitution and the Environment and Land Court established under the Environment and Land Court Act, 2011,” the proposed amendment reads. But Law Society of Kenya yesterday told the Star the planned change cannot be made without altering Article 162 ( 2 ) the Constitution. The Land Act, however, allows the Chief Magistrate’s Court to preside over land cases, provided that the value of the property does not exceed Sh20 million. Wambua holds that the proposed changes cannot stand. “That will require an amendment of the Constitution since it requires creation of specialised divisions to deal with specialised areas. It will be counterproductive if we go back to the old system where one judge dealt with all manner of cases without specialisation,” the LSK said.
