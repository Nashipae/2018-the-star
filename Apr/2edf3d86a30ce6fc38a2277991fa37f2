Lurambi MP Titus Khamala and Navakholo MP Emmanuel Wangwe want the contractor tarmacking the Lurambi–Navakholo road suspended for shoddy work. President Uhuru Kenyatta had commissioned that road and the Ibokolo-Shianda-Nambacha road in December 2016. But the two roads remain in bad condition,one year after contractors arrived on site. Deputy President William Ruto while attending a ceremony in Kakamega on Saturday, gave the contractor two months to do the repairs or get replaced by a new contractor.
