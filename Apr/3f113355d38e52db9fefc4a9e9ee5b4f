Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho says he stayed abroad for weeks because he needed to re-energise and return with fresh thinking. Joho was interviewed by KTN on Wednesday, on the sidelines on the 5th Annual Devolution Conference that is taking place in Kakamega. "I travelled recently for work and took a vacation ... I had been travelling way before I became a politician, " he said. During Joho's absence, CECs grumbled over lack of proper accommodation and office space and factional fights over the transfer of sub-county or ward administrators also ensued. Critics had piled pressure on Joho, asking him to end his “honeymoon” abroad and return to serve the people.

"I was not missing but away for other matters. During this time, I had a functioning government ... I have competent teams. We have structures that work [whether you're there or not]." Joho, who is ODM Deputy Leader, noted he is a human being allowed to take time off to re-strategise. "If anything, we are allowed to take holidays at times. We are not only politicians but also humans who are allowed to take holidays ones in a while," he said. "... and I thank God that I am blessed enough to pay for my travels." Joho resurfaced at the wedding of musician Ali Kiba, weeks after residents complained he had left them in limbo. Joho is an outspoken politician so his absence did not go unnoticed. Sources close to him said he visited France, Spain and Australia since leaving the county in March. They said he was trying to re-energise and re-strategise politically.
