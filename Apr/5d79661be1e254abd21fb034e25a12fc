Embu Woman Representative Jane Wanjuki yesterday condemned men who rape disabled children. They should be hanged or castrated, she said. Wanjuki is disturbed by reports showing an increase in cases of such children being defiled because they seem helpless. The woman rep said in order to tame such crime, the predators should be given life sentences. “How would they feel if their daughter or sister was defiled?” Wanjuki said. It is necessary to offer tough and harsh punishment for sex pests to serve as a lesson for the rest, she added after visiting St Monicah School for disabled children, Toto Care children’s home and Jomo Kenyatta home for disabled children.
