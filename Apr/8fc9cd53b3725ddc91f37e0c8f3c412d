National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale has told ODM to give their leader Raila Odinga time to implement the cooperation deal with President Uhuru Kenyatta. Speaking during prize-giving day at Garissa HIgh School on Thursday, Duale said the unity pact decision made covers ODM. “As Jubilee, from the Deputy President to all members, we are bound to abide by what the President says and any decision made we must follow,” the Garissa MP said. On March 9, President Uhuru Kenyatta shook hands with his political rival Raila Odinga and they pledged to cooperate on a range of issues. Details are not known and Raila land Uhuru have not started travelling together in peace rallies. Duale said the recent actions by ODM and criticism of the deal were derailing the recent handshake. His comments come a day after a section of ODM lawmakers led by Busia Senator Amos Wako expressed their worry about delay in implementation the deal. Wako said that if not quickly acted upon, the fruits of the deal, if any, will be drowned out by noises about 2022 succession politics. There has been a lot of speculation about the deal and some ODM members said Raila was shortchanged. However, on Wednesday, National Assembly Committee on National Cohesian chair Maina Kamanda said the handshake had brought calm. He said those attacking the two leaders are self-seekers who don’t mean well for Kenya. “We are looking for a future Kenya where people live peacefully and in coexistence. We call on politicians to preach peace since many Kenyans are happy in the current political environment,” Kamanda said.
