13  When KBC was the
only channel back in the '90s, every Sunday afternoon it aired an
episode of The Adventures of Swiss Family Robinson. Ah…memories. Lost in
Space is a Netflix futuristic reimagination of the Robinson family. Where
instead of being stranded in a remote island, the Robinson family is stranded in
an earth-like planet somewhere in space. When earth is
threatened in the future, several families are picked to go to Alpha Centauri
to create a new colony. But during the trip, their spacecraft, the Jupiter
Mission 24 Colonial Resolute, is attacked and all the families are forced to
leave the mother ship using their own Jupiter landing crafts. The Robinson family lands on an earth-like
planet on a frozen lake. They exit the craft just before the ship sinks into
the lake. The Robinson family is made up of: Dad John, a former Navy
SEAL; mom Maureen is an aerospace engineer; their two daughters Judy and Penny
and son Will. Will stumbles across some type of robotic alien when he is separated from the family. They have no idea that the alien was the one who attacked their
spaceship, and that he too is lost in space and is looking for a way back. Lost in Space is
an ambitious effort of imagination into an unknown world. But, unfortunately, it
doesn’t quite hit its mark. The episodes seem drastically long with limited to
no excitement in the story. The show seems more like those futuristic teen
shows they have on Nickelodeon rather than a big budget show on Netflix. The
Adventures of Swiss Family Robinson is a memorable part of my childhood,
but the adventures of the Robinson family Lost in Space, unfortunately, isn’t
that memorable.
