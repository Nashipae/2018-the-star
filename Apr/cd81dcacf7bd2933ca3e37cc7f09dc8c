Deputy President William Ruto yesterday advised governors to keep their deputies busy to shrug off idleness that could lead them astray. His remarks at the closure of the 5th Annual Devolution Conference in Kakamega came in the wake of a video of Kirinyaga Deputy Governor Peter Ndambiri in a compromising situation with a woman. Ruto offered the advice in implied reference to Ndambiri's video. “Keeping them busy will avoid the great risk of the devil engaging idle minds in your offices," Ruto said. "It is important that the relationship between governors and their deputies is worked out so that the devil doesn’t have space to use any idle mind to drive any evil agenda.” The DP also warned Kenyans against watching illicit videos. “It is unlawful to watch films that have not been sanctioned by the Kenya Films Classification Board. Any reference to any films that were not authorised is reference to an illegal material,” Ruto said amid laughter from delegates. Ndambiri has since apologised to his family and constituents for the shameful video that went viral on Tuesday. “I want to say that it is an episode that has brought a lot of shame,” Ndambiri said in a statement.
