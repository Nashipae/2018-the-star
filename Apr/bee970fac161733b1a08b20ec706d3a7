The curtain came down on this year’s – the fifth — devolution
conference in Kakamega on Thursday. In terms of the interest and the news
value, this year’s conference trended far much better than past ones. What
with the controversial uncensored, unclassified episode of the nude DG! The conference also went a notch higher in grandeur. If you
consider the official cost of goods and services supplied to the conference estimated
at Sh200 million, the expenditures of the delegations of individual counties
that sent hordes of officials and their aides to the conference, cumulatively, the
much-hyped jamboree could have swallowed a billion shillings in the last one
week. In the end, just like previous conferences, one wonders whether the
proceedings at Kakamega were value for money.  The thematic breakout sessions could as well
have reached bigger audiences— and at a fraction of the cost — if they had been
beamed live to the country from television studios.  Even the President did so. After five years, it is time for a thorough review of the
concept of the annual devolution family meeting. Such an evaluation should target
the participants, goals and objectives, and achievements. It could well be that the conference is an important holiday
in the year for hard working county staff to meet, party, frolic and tithe for
one lucky county. Or just the opportunity to clean out the budget before the
new financial year. Whatever.
