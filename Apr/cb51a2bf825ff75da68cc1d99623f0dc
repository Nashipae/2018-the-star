Lawyer Nelson Havi has been summoned to the DCI headquarters to shed light on the confiscation on Miguna Miguna’s Canadian passport. But Havi has said he will not honour the summon until Interior CS Fred Matiang’i, Immigration PS Gordon Kihalangwa, IG Joseph Boinnet and DCI George Kinoti comply with court orders. Havi has sued the four top security officials in relation to the Miguna saga. “What basis and moral authority do they have to summon me when they have been disobeying court orders,” Havi said. Speaking to the Star yesterday, Havi said it was wrong for the DCI to investigate a matter that was before court. The summon was issued to him by an officer he only identified as Kuria. Havi said he was acting on behalf of Miguna Miguna who was deported. “What an advocate does on behalf of his clients is privileged,” Havi said. Police have accused Havi of lying in the affidavit he filed on behalf of Miguna, saying police confiscated his client’s passport at the JKIA.
