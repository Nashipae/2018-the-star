Otile Brown is one of the most interesting individuals we have in town. He understands the power of fashion. He is always dressing up for every occasion. He knows how to maintain a gentlemanly aesthetic that amplifies his personal brand, one that embodies good vibes. And this, more than anything else, gracefully complements his music. Otile proved to be far-sighted in his 2017 hit, “Alivyonipenda,” which featured King Kaka. Before that, he had worked on some passable tunes like “Pakate”. But in his efforts to break out from the one-hit-wonder phenomenon and demonstrate that he has wide range to offer, he has endlessly been on the grind. You might have seen this coming: Otile has spent the past year releasing singles with the apparent goal of appearing on as many shows as possible. He is now dominating the airwaves as well as grabbing the attention of bloggers ready to dig out the dirt. And it seems like he is basking in the delight of every single moment. Now more than ever, he has the girls calling. Smooth with just the right amount of vocal prowess in both uptempo and down tempo tunes, Otile delivers the blush-worthy lyrical content that sentimental fans love. He is a sucker for romance and good times. The bongo-inspired crooner has been trying out styles, collaborating with some of the crowd-approved stars like Timmy Tdat and Shetta. Not long ago, he got to release the soulful “Chaguo La Moyo”, featuring the vocal brilliance of Sanaipei Tande. The freedom he promises his significant other in his music extends to himself, and he’s better than ever at just doing what he does best. Judging from his catalogue, in the business of making immensely popular tracks, Otile is headed in the right direction. When it comes to originality and aesthetics, it would only be fair if another article is dedicated to review his artistic presence.
