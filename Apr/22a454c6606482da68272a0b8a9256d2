Embattled retailer Uchumi Supermarkets is now seeking NIC Bank's help in its debt restructuring process, latest annual reports indicate. The report says the actual process will take place once a strategic investor is on-boarded. Chief executive Mohamed Mohamed said one of the roles to be played by NIC Bank is help suppliers who are willing to convert their debt into capital do so in the right manner. He however declined to reveal how much they are seeking from the lender. The unknown strategic investor who has been the hope of Uchumi since 2017 is expected to bring in Sh3.5 billion as capital injection. It is yet to be revealed when they will assume duty. The cash strapped retailer further banks on shareholder loans from the government, debt conversions and the sale of land in Kasarani amounting to Sh2.6 billion to boost it capital muscles. “As far bringing the potential investor on board is concerned, the Group has already received a signed term sheet, it is anticipated that the company shall realise the cash flows within the first quarter of 2018, subject to a successful due diligence exercise,” the report said, adding that “ The financial and legal aspects of the due diligence are expected to be finalised before the end of the year." Government funding of Sh1.8 billion to bail out Uchumi was approved by Cabinet, and the first portion of Sh500 million released in January 2017. The second portion of Sh700 million was received in December. It is not yet clear when the remaining Sh600 million will be released. Up to 871 employees have exited the retailer in the last financial year ending June 30. The firm has a total average of 1,446 employees in 2017 down from 2,317 in 2016. The retailer reported Sh1.68 billion losses, from Sh2.83 billion in 2016. Its revenue flopped to Sh2.58 billion from Sh6.4 billion in 2016. The losses are attributed to a shortage of suppliers during certain months of the year due to delayed payments.Further to this, it reduced its operation cost to Sh2.18 billion from Sh3.23 billion.
