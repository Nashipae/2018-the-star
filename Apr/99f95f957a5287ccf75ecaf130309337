People living near forests and rivers have pledged to plant indigenous trees to protect wetlands. Friends of Kireita Forest yesterday said they will extend their tree planting drive to other forests and educate residents on the need to plant indigenous trees. Chairman Michael Ndegwa said rivers might dry up if exotic trees are planted because they use a lot of water. "People need a lot of education regarding the environment. You may find people planting exotic trees just because the government has asked them to plant trees,‚Äù he said. Ndegwa said they will reforest the Uplands Forest from May 1. He spoke at Kireita Forest in Lari. He was accompanied by group secretary Beth Wangui and member Dorcas Wambui. A week ago, the group planted 2,000 trees along the Githoito River banks and near its source. The river supplies water to a Gatamaiyu plant that pumps water to Nyanduma and Githunguri.
