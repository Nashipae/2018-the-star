The government next month will introduce 50 high-capacity buses carrying 100 passengers each in the capital, Transport CS James Macharia has said. Another batch of 50 buses will be imported by matatu operators in the next three months. The CS said the major import form India is part of government Bus Rapid Transit plans to decongest Nairobi roads that are choking with traffic. The buses are long ‘articulated’ or ‘accordion’ buses, not double-deckers.The state will waive duty on buses being imported by the matatu operators to fast-track the decongestion drive and encourage more investors. Twenty National Youth Service buses are already on Nairobi roads and another 50 will be introduced in two months. They charge a flat Sh20. For the Rapid Transit buses, there will be special lanes in the four main corridors feeding the city centre. They are Thika Superhighway, Jogoo Road, Outering Road and Mombasa Road. The Kenya Urban Road Authority, the National Highways Authority and the county government will introduce the special lanes in two weeks. Macharia said this will pave the way for the much-awaited rapid transit system to upgrade transport. The piloting of Bus Rapid Transit has been going on since June last year when City Hoppa Sacco introduced 70-seater buses. But there were no special lanes. The city loses about Sh50 million daily to congestion. The number of vehicles in the city has been increasing rapidly. There are about 500,000 vehicles, including about 30,000 PSVs. Matatu Owners Association chairman Simon Kimutai said, “We have already made an order and in the next month, we’ll have the first batch of 10 or 20 buses. We have visited the plant and are satisfied.” He said the vehicles would not belong to the sacco, but would be run by the association. The state has assured them buses will not be stuck in traffic.
