Counties in the North Rift are helping farmers tackle spread of armyworm destroying maize. The pests are threatening to wipe out maize crops. Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba has blamed the government for what he termed slow response in dealing with the infestation. Khaemba said money released by the Food and Agricultural Organization to control the pest is being held at the Agriculture ministry as farmers continue to suffer. “Instead of releasing the money from FAO, they are sending people to come and do research as if those of us who live here do not have good eyes to see the worms,” the governor said on Saturday. Governors Jackson Mandago of Uasin Gishu and Khaemba say the counties will team up with the national government to enable farmers access chemicals required to spray maize farms affected by the worms. Khaemba said they have also started educating farmers on crop diversification as one way of subduing the pest. “We are even providing seedlings for other crops to help our farmers,” he said. Khaemba said they want farmers to move away from crops they have been growing since Independence. The armyworms are spreading fast to more farms in the North Rift and farmers fear maize production may drop by more than 50 per cent. Areas affected include Uasin Gishu, Trans Nzoia, Nandi, Elgeyo Marakwet and parts of the South Rift region.
