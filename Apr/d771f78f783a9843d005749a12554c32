Garissa Senator Yussuf Haji yesterday called on residents to give time for Governor Ali Korane and his team to deliver on their manifesto. Haji, while acknowledging the country faces numerous problems, told residents to tone down their expectations because “they cannot be solved in a day.” The senator was speaking in Abdisamit, Balambala constituency, during the homecoming ceremony of county Water executive Issa Dubow. Korane said his administration will give priority to providing water across the county, saying that 50 per cent of this year’s budget will go the water sector. Haji said after the election it is important for residents to put their political differences aside and serve the residents equally. “To all residents, please give this team time to address the challenges bedeviling our country. Rome was not built in a day,” the senator said. unbecoming behaviour Haji urged the governor to ensure that he distributes resources adequately and fairly without favouring those who voted for him or discriminating against those who didn’t support him. He urged county employees to be committed to delivering services. Haji and Korane were elected on a Jubilee ticket. Haji expressed confidence in the governor’s leadership and his ability to deliver. He said the speed with which residents want better services and development was unrealistic. He criticised residents who have made it a habit of thronging the governor’s office to ask for favours, jobs and contracts. He called their behaviour “unbecoming”. Hundreds of residents have been jamming the governor’s office whenever he is around.
