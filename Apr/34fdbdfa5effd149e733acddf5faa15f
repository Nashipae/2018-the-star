The ongoing rains in parts of Naivasha have left a trail of destruction, destroying a school and killing an unknown number of animals. Travellers on sections of the Mai Mahiu-Narok road are forced to wait for hours for floodwaters to recede. But speaking on the phone, area chief Zacharia Igeria said traffic on the busy road is normal. Ten classrooms at Nguu Nyumu Primary School, Maella, were destroyed following a three-hour hailstorm. This was just hours after a Nairobi-bound bus plunged into a river in Narok and killed 19 people on Tuesday. Resident Joel Korir said heavy rains in Ngong and Suswa caused flooding. He said residents of Suswa and Satellite saw tens of zebras, goats and cattle being washed away. “Two carcasses of zebras, which had been swept by the floods, were lying on the roadside near Suswa,” Korir said.
