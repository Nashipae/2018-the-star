City Hall has now pushed the deadline for the ban of matatus in the CBD to Monday to next week after the 10-day ultimatum it gave elapsed last week. Enforcement director Peter Mbaya said the deadline was moved so as to clear illegal structures in places supposed to be used by the matatus. “We will officially implement the ban from next Monday because we have to clear the terminus first. We have started the work except in a few areas that we will clear this week,” Mbaya said. Transport executive Mohamed Dagane had on April 3 given the matatus 10 days to leave the city centre to decongest downtown. But Matatu Owners Association chairman Simon Kimutai termed the order a public relations exercise whose implementation would be difficult. “As an association, we have not been involved in all these changes City Hall is effecting. This is a side show that is meant to provoke the association into a fight. If they want to implement it, let them do it and we see if it will work,” he said.
