Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has formed a five-member committee to inspect building projects in all urban centres. The committee comes barely a week after a five-storey building under construction collapsed in Kakamega town. It emerged the owner of the building did not have the requisite approvals from the county government departments, Nema and the National Construction Authority. Closing a two-day revenue forum in Kisumu town on Wednesday, Oparanya said the inspection is necessitated by growing fears from residents on construction safety. The committee will be chaired by Oparanya’s advisors Edward Indimuli and Penina Mukabane as secretary. Other members are Paul Posho and Zaitun Afande. County Housing executive Alfred Matianyi yesterday said the committee will establish whether all ongoing building projects met the approval requirements. The team will also ascertain whether relevant payments have been made and if the developers rightly own the plots. Among the projects targeted is the Sh200 billion Mwale Medical and Technology City in Lunza, Butere subcounty. The county government insists it was never approved before implementation. The county last year threatened to pull down the project but developer Julius Mwale moved to court to stop the demolition. Matianyi said, “The report by the committee will be used to ensure all buildings are safe.” Last week, Matianyi said all developers who have been served with stop orders will have their buildings demolished. He said the building that collapsed in Kakamega a week ago is among hundreds that were erected on land that was set aside for Jua Kali sheds, not residential estates. “Our physical planning department is in the process of establishing the exact extent of the Jua Kali land before we make a decision on the demolitions,” Matianyi said.
