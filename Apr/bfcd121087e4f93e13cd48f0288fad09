Webuye East MP Alfred Sambu on Monday gave a stern caution to school heads and management board chairs against swindling money given by CDF for various projects. The legislature said those who will be caught embezzling the funds will not be given further assistance and will risk being jailed. "Don’t go round on your own saying let me steal here small Mheshimiwa will not know. I want to remain clean and my people also remain clean even the bible clearly condemns stealing and says ask and you will be given,” he said. Sambu, while giving out CDF cheques, said some school heads and board chairmen were not up to task in spending the funds given to them in the past for various projects. “I promise you that you will be my worst and best enemy if I get you stealing money meant for our children’s education. If you are in a genuine need of something come ask me and I will assist where necessary," he added. He said Sh61 million will be used the education sector.
