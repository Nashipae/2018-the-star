Thirdway Alliance party leader Ekuru Aukot wants the Constitution amended to reduce the number of MPs from 416 to 194. The Constitutional lawyer also wants the position of woman representative scrapped in the proposed changes. His argument is that Parliament is not truly living to its roles of checking on government. "We are seeking to establish a professional parliament that will perform its roles," he told journalists on Saturday. "Parliament should attract crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of our society, men and women of integrity...We have observed that our parliament has become lazy and simply politicised," he said. Aukot said his party has started collecting one million signatures electronically to ensure that the constitution is changed. "Our current parliament is bloated. In fact, some MPs have expressed concerns that they are so many that other miss a chance to talk," he said.

"Kenya can't afford 416 representatives.. our population has more pressing needs than to spend resources on few individuals," he said. He proposed that that a county be made a single constituency instead of having 290 constituencies. "No need to spend Sh8b that was requested by IEBC to review boundaries, constituencies and wards. This has to change," he said. He said each constituency will elect one man and one woman to the National Assembly. "Each constituency will elect into senate one woman and one man. Only the National Assembly will have six nominated seats from special groups," he said. "We will visit the counties to elaborate this and popularise on the referendum and give the Kenyans chance to sign the form in hard copy," he added. In February, Aukot tore into IEBC boss Wafula Chebukati for sending him explanations on a referendum, saying all he wanted was a meeting. In the document, commission chairman Wafula Chebukati refers to Aukot's letter dated February 14, on a proposed referendum to reduce the size of Parliament.
