Hundreds of families spent Wednesday night in the cold after Tana River burst its banks following spillage of dams in Kindaruma Dam. The most affected areas were Windsor and Bula Sheikh in Garissa town and Bakuyu, Ziwani and Mororo in Tana River county where houses were marooned overnight as water levels rose to crisis levels. Farmers were also hard hit as their farms have been marooned. A spot check found families salvaging their belongings to safer ground. On the Gaissa-Madogo road, families sat planning their next move. This is one of the worst floods recorded in Garissa and the neighbouring Tana River county after El Nino in 1997. “Since the Elnino floods of 1997, we have had several floods, but I have never seen such a situation,” resident Abdi Mohamed said. Ruth Wanja, a resident of Windsor estate, narrated how she lost valuables. “All my household items are submerged in water. The waters came with a lot of speed giving me no time to salvage anything,” the mother of five said. Residents have raised concerns about the outbreak of waterborne diseases and the threat of being attacked by crocodiles and snakes. The flooding has led to a housing crisis with the majority leaving their flooded houses. On Wednesday, Garissa county commissioner Joshua Chepcheing urged residents along Tana River and flood-prone areas to move to higher ground. This followed a notification by KenGen of imminent heavy spillage from Kiambere Dam. The energy company has released the excess water in Kamburu Gitaru, Kindaruma and Kiambere dams.
