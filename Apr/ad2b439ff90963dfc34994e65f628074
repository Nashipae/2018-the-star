We spend approximately a third of our lives sleeping while the brain is hard at work, overseeing a wide variety of biological upkeep and preparing for the next day. Like nutrition and physical activity, sleep is critical to our health. Rakesh Shah, the CEO of Vitafoam Limited, said: “What you are wearing, your bedroom temperature, or how much your partner snores will impact how well you sleep each night. However, we ignore the most critical component, which is the mattress. “Contrary to common beliefs, hard and firm mattresses do not always offer the best support. At the Vitafoam showroom, we have a variety of mattresses, including the five-zone spring mattress. It is layered with a memory form that moulds to the body contours, minimising pressure points and providing optimum spinal support.” The small springs in the mattress are housed in separate fabric pockets, which help minimise partner disturbance due to movement while sleeping. For durability, the springs undergo heat and anti-rust oil treatment during the manufacturing process. Another product in the vast range is the viscoool elastic foam mattress. This combines the pure comfort of visco elastic foam with the latest in bed climate technology. Viscoool is a new generation thermo regulating foam containing a blend of sustainable natural raw materials, including soybean oil and a refreshing natural balm to help you experience a deeper, more restful sleep. It is combined with a unique open cell structure that guarantees a higher level of moisture evaporation and breathability, leaving it cooler for longer.
