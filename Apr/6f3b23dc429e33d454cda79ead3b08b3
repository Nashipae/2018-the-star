The Kiambu government will instal street lights in markets to step up business at night. Lari Kirenga MCA Joseph Karichu yesterday said the project will improve residents and traders’ safety. He said Nyambare trading centre along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway will get 47 street lamps because it has a busy market, more than 300 boda boda riders, hotels, restaurants, bars and churches. “We do not know why we were left out by the previous regimes. We have never had street lights,” he said at the centre, where he distributed bursary cheques to 565 students.
