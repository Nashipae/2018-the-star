Wazir Chacha, the man accused of defrauding MPs by sending them nude photos, has claimed that Sabina Chege is trying to fix him. In a short video that emerged on Wednesday, Chacha denies sending the photos to the MPs as alleged. He said the  Murang'a Woman Representative should be his co-accused in the case. "I am innocent. The person who should be investigated is Sabina Chege. She is the person of interest. Not me," he says. Chacha further said Chege is behind all the woes MPs are going through and that he should be cleared. ".She is behind everything. She is just trying to fix me because of personal issues and differences. She should be investigated as the co-accused," he adds. Last Friday, the Murang'a MP denied knowing the conman and accused the media of "picking the wrong story and publicising it to soil my name". She said media outlets that ran the story should have sought more clarification from the Department of Criminal Investigations. "If my name was mentioned, they should have sought to prove [the claims] and contacted the DCI for clarification," the MP said.
