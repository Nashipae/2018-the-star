Former Chase Sailors and Kenyan international forward, George Mutira, has decamped to Butali Warriors as the Western Kenya-based outfit completed the signing of three experienced players. Mutira had eleven goals last season and found it necessary to remain in the Kenya Hockey Union Premier League after Sailors were dropped to the newly-formed second tier, the Super League. Butali also captured the signatures of Kenyan international goalkeeper Linus Sang from USIU-A Mashujaa and Nixon Amadi from Greensharks. The 2015 champions, who finished second behind Police last season, are rebuilding as they seek to leave a mark at the continental championships set for December in Nigeria. However, the trio is not guaranteed of starting berths and will have to work their way into the team. Mutira will muscle for first 11 slot with established Emmanuel Simiyu, who managed 10 goals last season. Sang will face less rivalry from Pakistani national Salman Akbar while Amadi faces a tall order of dispensing either Zack Aura or Maxwell Fuchaka, who have been anchoring the midfield. Head coach Godfrey Wakachunga, said: “I am happy we have signed Mutira, Sang and Amadi, who are all experienced players. We really want to dethrone Police and make some progress at the club championships. Mutira is a good striker who scored crucial goals last season and I am sure he will get us goals during tough matches.” “Sang is a good goalkeeper who has played for the national team before and I think with him, our goalkeeping problems have been solved. Amadi’s services will be heavily relied upon since there are many matches to be played in the season,” added Wakachunga. “The team resumed training last week and before the season kicks off, I want the boys to be physically and mentally fit.”
