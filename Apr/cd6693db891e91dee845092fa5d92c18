The Senate Committee on Land today started its tour of Kisii county. It seeks to gather information on the proposed variation of boundaries at Nyangweta Forest to pave way for construction of a multibillion-shilling sugar factory. The visit comes two days after Environment CS Keriako Tobiko and Governor James Ongwae differed over the proposed construction of the Nyangweta Sugar Complex. It will be carried out by an investor from India Kanoria Group at the cost of Sh10 billion. The committee will visit Nyangweta and Insaria forests and sugarcane plantations. Tobiko said there are outstanding issues to be addressed regarding the sugar miller’s impact on the environment. Ongwae defended the proposal to hive off 120 acres for the construction of the sugar complex. But Tobiko said the county has a forest cover of 2.5 per cent, against the requirement of 10 per cent. The governor said the factory will create 10,000 jobs, improve ethanol production and add 10 megawatts to the national grid. He added, “The county government plans to plant trees to improve forest cover. We have set aside enough resources to ensure the areas affected are taken care of. We also plan to gazette the remaining 13 forests to accommodate the excision of Nyangweta.” Today the committee will visit Nyangweta and Insaria forests.
