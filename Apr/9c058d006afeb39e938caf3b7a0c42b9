The lecturers’ strike has taken a new twist after their union moved to court yesterday seeking to have Education CS Amina Mohamed and other officials jailed for disobeying court orders to give them a counter proposal. Uasu claims Mohammed has refused to participate in the conciliation process and has declined to authorise a counter proposal. “She made public comments that no counter proposal will be made until a job evaluation is done by her ministry,” the court papers read. Uasu also wants Prof. PWN Kanyari, FWO Aduol, Treasury CS Henry Rotich, the Attorney General and Salaries and Remuneration Commission secretary Anne Gitau held in contempt of court.

Uasu further said the six officials and Mohamed have neither complied with the court order nor appealled for a stay of the order. “As a result, the claimant conduct negotiations cannot proceed as stated in the conciliators report dated 16th April 2018,” Uasu said. The union has also accused Mohamed and the other officials of sabotaging the reconciliation process. “Whereas the court order of 16th March 2018 was explicit that all parties were to submit themselves before the conciliator to fast track the conciliation process, the interested parties have blatantly refused to submit themselves to the conciliation process,” Uasu said. In an affidavit filed by Uasu secretary general Constantine Wasonga, he alleges the chairman of the claimant - Kanyari - has declined and neglected to submit a counter proposal and not attend the conciliation process as ordered.
