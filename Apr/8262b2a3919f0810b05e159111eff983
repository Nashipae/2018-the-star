KCB Group has entered into a partnership with the Geothermal Development Company that will see the lender increase its mortgage portfolio. The agreement between the two firms will see GDC employees across the country access housing loan facilities at affordable interest rates for a maximum of 20 years as per the Salaries & Remuneration Commission Circular dated 17th December 2014. This will enable them buy readymade houses, undertake construction of own homes, purchase plots and enjoy equity release facilities. KCB Group chief operating officer Samuel Makome said the cash-backed scheme arrangement is one of the innovative ways that KCB Bank has developed through partnership with institutions, to facilitate affordable long-term mortgage financing that allows single digit borrowing. “We are keen at delivering affordable housing to Kenyans by participating in both the supply and demand side,” he said, “At the moment the housing demand remains high and it is only through such partnerships that we will manage deal with the challenge.” In the 2016 annual report by the Central Bank of Kenya about 72.8 per cent of lending to the mortgage market was by five institutions that is, one medium sized bank (23.5 per cent) and four banks from the large banks peer group (49.3 per cent). During the review period there were 24,085 mortgage loans in the market 2016 down from 24,458 in December 2015 a decrease of 373 loan accounts or 1.5 per cent due to tighter credit standards by commercial banks. KCB is keen to roll this programme out to other corporates as well as county governments as an initiative towards the achievement of the delivery of 500,000 units through affordable mortgage financing.
