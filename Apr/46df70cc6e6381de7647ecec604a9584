Singer Sanaipei Tande has defended her decision to get married in a secret ceremony after photos leaked online. Pundits claim the photos are from a set of the music video for her collaboration with Otile Brown. Is it a music video? "Haha. That is all I can say. The reason why it is not being talked about. When you are getting married, you don't tell the whole world." Adding, "When you're getting married, you don't tell the whole world. Ni kitu ya chini ya maji, haiongelewi. Pregnancy ni siri. Ndoa pia ni siri. Ni mambo ya kurealise it's an intimate thing, for close family. I've always been private on that sector of my life. These things are not shared." Asked what people will think about her getting hitched to a man younger than her, Sanaipei, without missing a beat, said, "It is none of their business. People do what they want to do. Me, I'm not in anyone's business, that is why it was a private affair." When called for comment, Sanaipei's hubby, Otile Brown, insisted he is now a happily married man. "Thank you for congratulating me. Cha muhimu ndani ya maisha yangu ni kwamba, yule mtu muhimu ni anayehusika, yupo na yametokea. (The important thing in my life right now is that the one I treasure is involved and the wedding ceremony took place.) I ain't doing it for nobody. Nampenda [Sanaipei] kwa sababu yuko tofauti, she's real." So how did he propose to Sana? "I don't wanna talk about it. I like her; I just don't want to go into details. Sitaki iende public."
