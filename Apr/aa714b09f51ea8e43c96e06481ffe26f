WWE has been criticised for not having any female wrestlers in its Saudi Arabia show. The Greatest Royal Rumble event is one of the largest of its kind with 50 men in the headline match. No women will be taking part, despite WWE being commended by many for their development of women in the sport. In the 30 years that the Rumble has been around there has been a move to see female wrestlers like Charlotte Flair headline shows. Women once only had passive roles but have become much more well respected wrestlers. The change has been dubbed the "Women's Evolution". So the revelation of no women in the Saudi show is a stark contrast to what fans of the wrestling giant have come to expect. Women in the country are still restricted by laws on what they can and can't do - so it may not come as a surprise to other fans that females aren't in the line-up. Speaking to The Independent newspaper, company executive and performer Triple H says that he hopes that women will be taking part in the next few years. "You can't dictate to a country or a religion about how they handle things but, having said that, WWE is at the forefront of a women's evolution in the world and what you can't do is affect change anywhere by staying away from it.
