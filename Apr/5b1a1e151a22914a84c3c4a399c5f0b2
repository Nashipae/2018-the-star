Former screen siren Janet Mbugua is heavily pregnant with her second child. Janet is in her first trimester and yes, she is not shy to speak about her pregnancy. Talking on her YouTube Channel, Janet wishes that she had someone who would have talked to her about the things she would expect in her pregnancy journey. "Someone did not tell me that when you are pregnant, you could really get so damn sick. I could hear about morning sickness, but I don't really know why I could not co-relate the two because some people have it for the entire nine months, while others just the first trimester. I wish someone could have told me that, because in my first pregnancy, I was really sick and in this pregnancy, too. It is a good thing to be pregnant but I wish someone could have told me 'congratulations, but you could really get sick'. Janet said that pregnancy has slowed her down and she is not able to travel a lot, a thing she wishes she was told earlier. "This may sound different with some people because they have tonnes of energy throughout their pregnancy and that is so amazing. Some could be very tired and sick for the entire journey, which is very unfortunate. I have really slowed down in what I used to do coz right now, I cannot do the projects I wanted to do, or even execute a lot of them. I can't go out as much as I want to, which has made realise that pregnancy can really slow someone, especially those who are in business. You have no option because you have to respect your body when it comes to pregnancy. I will have to push some of the things I wanted to do this year, but I don't complain because maybe that is a heads up."
