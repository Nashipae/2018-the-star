The Tanzanian government has been urged to strengthen its anti-FGM laws to discourage Kenyans who cross over for the outlawed practice. Public Service Chief Administrative Secretary Rachael Shebesh said Kenyans living in Kuria on the Kenya-Tanzania border are moving into Tanzania to practice female genital mutilation, since anti-FGM laws are not strict. She said it is illegal to practice FGM in Kenya and urged the Tanzanian government to strengthen its anti-FGM campaigns to stop Kenyans from crossing over. Shebesh spoke at Archers post in Samburu county at the weekend. “Tanzania has become a safe haven for circumcisers living along the Kuria-Tanzanian border. This shows that our anti-FGM campaign is strong and our neighbouring brothers should do the same to avoid this cross-border problem,” she said. The government, Shebesh added, will crack down on briefcase NGOs taking advantage of the anti-FGM campaigns in Kenya to make quick money. “We know of illegal NGOs that are going round in counties where FGM is rampant taking photos of innocent girls and using them to illegally acquire money from donors,” She said.
