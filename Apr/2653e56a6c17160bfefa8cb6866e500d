Kisauni squatters chairman Hashim Makazi was on Wednesday targeted in an attack in which his two brothers were seriously injured. The attack has been linked to the row over the ownership of a 60-acre property in Nguu Tatu. Makazi lives on the land. Bandari Sacco claim they bought the property from Hussein Dairy farm in 2011 for Sh385 million. The sacco wants the squatters evicted. Unconfirmed reports indicated the attack was carried out by 10 disgruntled squatters. The squatters accuse Makazi of colluding with the sacco to have them evicted. Makazi denied the claim. He cannot turn against the squatters, whose rights he had fought for for more than a decade, he said According to Makazi, the attack was carried out by thugs. “They came looking for me in my house and attacked my brothers,” Makazi told the Star on the phone. The squatters have prevented Bandari Sacco from putting up a perimeter wall around the property despite a court order. The sacco wants the squatters pushed out to enable it take possession and develop the property. Kisauni deputy county commander Kipchumba Rutto said a meeting to resolve the impasse failed. The meeting held at Rutto’s office on Tuesday, brought together the squatters, the sacco and the security team. “It did not end well. There were massive disagreements. We have scheduled another meeting next week,” Rutto said. Bandari Sacco vice chairman Johnson Kegohi said the attack was a scheme to delay their taking over the property. “We suspect the attack was not genuine. It was a ploy to delay the rebuilding of the the wall which the squatters illegally brought down,” Kegohi told the Star on the phone on Wednesday. The tussle over the property has been on and off for the last two years. Kegohi said there were no squatters on the property in 2011. But the 3,000 squatters insist they have lived on the land for 10 years. Kegohi said the squatters are not genuine, but people hired by developers keen on grabbing the parcel.
