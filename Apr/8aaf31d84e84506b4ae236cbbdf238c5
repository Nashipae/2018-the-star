City Hall will partner with Kenya Railways to build five new railway stations in Dandora, Mwiki, Makadara, Githurai 45 and Ruiru ( see P27). The new stations will complement the existing ones â€“ Kibera, Imara Daima, Syokimau and Makadara. Nairobi county Transport executive Mohamed Dagane says commuter trains can carry 40,000 people daily if they are more frequent. This is a good start by KR and Nairobi County but 10 stations are too few. Commuter services need to go even further outside Nairobi. The old Uganda railway goes out past Kitengela and up to Kikuyu. People would be happy to park their cars at railway stations if safe, clean, reliable trains were running every 30 minutes. There could be a station every two or three kilometres. The county and KR should also look at the possibility of putting light railways above or beside major roads like Thika Highway. Nairobi is positioning itself to be the capital of East Africa. One minimum requirement is public transport that is affordable and widely accessible.
