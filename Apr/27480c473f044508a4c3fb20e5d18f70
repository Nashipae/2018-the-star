Former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga on Tuesday hit out at the Homa Bay governor Cyprian Awiti over the sacking of 309 "ghost" workers. Magwanga said Awiti is just using the "junior" workers as a scapegoat to show that he is fighting corruption and yet the "big fish" are left to roam around. Magwanga said it is worrying that after the past five years,is when Awiti is realizing that there are "ghost" workers in the payroll. "Let Awiti stop sacrificing junior county workers who earn peanuts for the sake of those earning millions in the name of fighting corruption," he said. He spoke after Awiti on Tuesday revealed that 309 former workers have been fired including the county payroll manager. This followed the December 2017 payroll audit which was launched in a bid to deal with the county's bloated payroll. The county stopped paying salaries to 640 staff to determine various aspects of their employment details. A team was established to look into the concerns raised and make recommendations to help the county cut costs. The analysis revealed that a number of workers had no appointment letters, were hired without due procedures or held posts for which they are not qualified. Click here for the latest political news
