Baringo South MP Grace Kipchoim was a committed leader who served her constituents with dedication, the President has said in his condolence message. Uhuru noted that despite cultural impediments, Kipchoim always went out of her way to serve the electorate by initiating projects that addressed their needs. “[She] was a courageous and fearless leader who never shied away from confronting issues of insecurity and always stood for the rights of her people," Uhuru said. “We will always remember her as a patriotic and loyal leader who wanted all Kenyans to live together peacefully and unite for progress." The President said it was because of the MP's servant leadership that her constituents re-elected her though she was in hospital. “[Kipchoim] never campaigned in the last election but her development record made residents give her a second term, a sign that they appreciated her leadership." Uhuru said Kenyans will also remember the lawmaker for the role she played in promoting women's rights and gender equity. To honour her, he said, the neighbouring communities of Baringo, West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet should embrace peace and live harmoniously. “The greatest gift the people of Baringo South can give in memory of their MP is to live together peacefully and continue with the development projects she initiated," he said. Kipchoim died on Friday after a long battle with colon cancer.
