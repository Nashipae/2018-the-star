The Homa Bay government has signed a memorandum of understanding with the state to build 2,000 affordable houses. Governor Cyprian Awiti and Housing and Urban Development Principal Secretary Charles Mwaura signed the deal on Saturday at the county headquarters. Construction will begin in six months. “This is a serious agreement and I want Homa Bay residents to take note of it,” Mwaura said. The project will benefit low-income earners. The PS said they will begin with Homa Bay town before proceeding to other towns. Low-cost housing is part of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four legacy agenda. Mwaura said Homa Bay will be the first county to launch the programme. “We have realised Homa Bay has readily available resources for constructing the houses. We will not disappoint the residents,” he said. The project will also create 10,000 jobs for residents. “Construction of the houses is part of our endeavour to eradicate poverty because each house will create five jobs for the locals,” Mwaura said. The county will provide 18 acres for the project. Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata and county executives were present. Awiti said, “We have identified the land for constructing these houses to ensure people with low income can afford good houses.” The governor expressed concern over a shortage of houses in Homa Bay town. He urged residents to support the project so they can improve their living standards. “Living in a good house is a constitutional right for our people. This programme will help us accord Homa Bay residents their rights,” the county chief said.
