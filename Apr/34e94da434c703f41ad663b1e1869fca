Controversial blogger Cyprian Nyakundi will remain in police custody as a Kiambu court has denied him bail. The decision on Thursday concerned charges over his offensive social media posts against Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko. Nyakundi denied charges of "publishing obscene information' before Kiambu Resident Magistrate Justus Gituku. Gituku ordered him to pull down his offensive posts against the Governor and desist from publishing any others on his social media accounts as he will face more charges. Nyakundi wrote a post last year after Sonko launched an oxygen plant at the Mama Lucy Hospital in Kayole.  The suspect is being held at Kiambu GK Prison and is expected to return to court on Friday for a ruling on his bond application. Nyakundi was arrested in Nairobi on Wednesday and detained at Muthaiga police station, where several politicians, journalists and business people have filed abuse complaints against him. A police source, who sought anonymity, said: “This boy is very arrogant. Primary investigations indicate he has frequently communicated with prominent State officers and businessmen. “This is a shocking one. Soon, several key State officials and businessmen will be summoned to record statements."
