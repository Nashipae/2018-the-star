MPs are on the spot for approving former Sports CS Hassan Wario and his former PS Richard Ekai for ambassador positions, despite the Rio de Janeiro Olympics scandal hanging on their necks. Before adjourning for a 10-day recess last week, the National Assembly approved Ekai nominated by President Uhuru Kenyatta to head an ambassadorial post at a yet-to-be-disclosed destination. Last month, the House gave Wario the greenlight to represent Kenya in Austria. But last year, then DPP Keriako Tobiko recommended the prosecution of the duo over the alleged mismanagement of Team Kenya during the 2016 Rio Olympics in Brazil. Human rights lawyer Harun Ndubi yesterday said the vetting of the two should have been thorough to ensure they adhere to ethical and moral values. “Without a conviction, everybody is presumed to be innocent. But, for purposes of public service, the standard of ethical and moral value should be set high,” Ndubi said.
