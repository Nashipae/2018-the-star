KenGen is set to increase power generation from its hydro stations thanks to heavy downpour being experienced countrywide. The heavy rains have seen a rise in water levels thus allowing optimum power generation. Levels at Masinga Dam, the largest among the Seven Forks, have risen to 1,045.86 metres against the maximum level of 1,056.50 metres. The electricity generating company said water rose above the maximum design level of 700 metres above seal level. "The move will ensure stability of power supply as this will compliment contribution of the dominant geothermal after a prolonged period of drought which affected all hydro power plants nationally," KenGen MD Rebecca Miano said. The current rains affect Kamburu, Kindaruma, Masinga, Gitaru and Kiambere which draw water from Tana and Turkwel, and Sondu and Miriu hydros that draw their water from Turkwel and Sondu rivers respectively. These rivers are currently experiencing heavy inflows and the rains are expected to continue until June. The dams also control flooding by holding bulk of water. Kiambere dam, which is part of the Tana's Seven Forks, rose by 1.6 metres since Monday evening. "The dams control the flooding by holding much of the water from the rains, without which the effects of floods would be much worse," Miano added. The heavy rains will increase contribution hydo power stations make as water levels in the dams are expected to be even higher by the end of May. Hydro dams account for 52.04 per cent of total national mix during normal hydrology. The company's total installed capacity currently stands at 820 megawatts.
