Floods have continued wreaking havoc in many parts of the country as heavy rains have persisted. Nairobi-Mombasa road was cut off at the Sultan Hamud bridge following a heavy downpour on Saturday. Video footage showed motorists in traffic and buses stuck in large pools of water. A river in the area burst its banks. In a statement, the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) asked drivers not to cross the overtopped section "Use Machakos-Wote-Makindu Road until the water level subsides," assistant communication director Charles Njogu said. The authority will give updates on the state of the road. This is the second time traffic on the busy highway has been paralysed due to heavy rains. After a similar incident on November 11, 2017, motorists had to use the alternative route to avoid a snarl up that stretched several kilometers. Affected motorists and passengers spent the night on the road.
