The government should forgive fiery lawyer Miguna Miguna and allow him back into Kenya - his country of birth - a Bishop has said. ACK Bishop Linus Okello of St Philips Church yesterday said in the spirit of Easter, the government should help bring political temperatures down and bring Miguna back. Miguna was deported to Dubai on Wednesday after initially successfully refusing to board an Emirates plane on Monday evening. Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, which was given the responsibility to ensure Miguna’s safe entry following a court order, said the lawyer refused to cooperate with immigration officials at JKIA in an eight-hour-long drama. Okello said bygones should be bygones and the spirit of forgiveness and tolerance should prevail. He spoke during a church service in Likoni. Okello said the government should obey court orders. The government has come under criticism for disregarding court orders and threatening the rule of law. Okello said tolerance and forgiveness are the keys to prosperity. “Easter is a time to foster peace, unity and reconciliation just like our Saviour showed us,” he said. The recent show of unity between President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition chief Raila Odinga gave hope for a new dawn in the country’s political sphere. However, the deportation of Miguna has reopened wounds and cast doubt on whether the two are on the same page.  DIVINE HANDSHAKE Okello said Easter should be used to seek redemption from bitterness following the 2017 General Election. “For the country to have lasting unity, people need to genuinely seek forgiveness and reconciliation,” he said. The clergyman said the General Election built hatred, bitterness and hopelessness, but it is time to move on. He said the Uhuru-Raila handshake happened within the period of Lent and was therefore divine. Lent is a period of fasting, moderation, and self-denial traditionally observed by Catholics and some Protestant denominations.
