The fifth annual devolution conference in Kakamega has pushed Western leaders to seek unity. Unlike in the past when local leaders tore into each other in public, leaders now display unity during the event, a first to be held in the former Western province. The unity was prominent a week ago when Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya convened a pre-devolution conference meeting. There were cordial speeches, uncharacteristic of local leaders. Oparanya said it was the first high-profile conference for the county and leaders were required to work together. The relationship between him, Senator Cleophas Malala, MPs and MCAs has improved this year. The governor said, “All stakeholders have participated and given their contribution towards a successful conference. This is the way we want to go. It has nothing to do with political parties.” Oparanya linked the harmony among leaders across the country to the truce signed by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga on March 9. Malala said the conference provides a perfect opportunity to work together. "This is the unity we want. We have to unite for a worthy course and not for political gain. We will front such unity so that our people benefit,” he said. Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa said, “I am glad to host this event at a time when the country is reading from the same page. We have to put in our best because it will take years to come back to Kakamega.” National Assembly chief whip and Mumias MP Ben Washiali said it is typical of the Luhya community not to quarrel before vistors. "We are all elected as leaders to push for development, which knows no political parties,” he said. Meanwhile, some MCAs from Nairobi visited Bukhulunya Primary School and planted trees to promote peace. MCA Annita Thumbi, under the Peace and Progress Foundation, asked the youth to promote coexistence. "We will visit Migori and Homa Bay to preach peace. We’re asking the youth to protect the country by preaching peace,” she said.
