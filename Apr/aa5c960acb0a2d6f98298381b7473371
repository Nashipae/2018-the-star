The 460-kilometre road when completed will link Malindi to Mombasa and Lunga Lunga on the Kenyan side then it moves to Tanga, Pangani,Bangamoyo through Sadaani national park on the Tanzanian side. Njogu said that a thirty-day notice had been issued to individuals and entities with structures along the road but they were reluctant to leave. Kenha claimed that the notice to vacate had also been issued on February 15, 2015, while the authority carried out sensitization meetings along the road in June the same year. “The authority conducted sensitization meetings between June 20 and 27 2016.The meetings venues were LungaLunga town, Musambweni(DCC offices), Ukunda Centre, Waa(chief`s office) and Likoni (Chief`s Office at Shikadabu),” Njogu said. He added that between March 29 and 6 April, 2018 the authority conducted more public sensitization forums on the impending demolitions in Ujamaa, Ngo`mbeni, Waa, Ukunda and Musambweni. “The extent of the road has been accurately set by survey and all affected persons had received notification before the start of the demolition exercise,” he said.
