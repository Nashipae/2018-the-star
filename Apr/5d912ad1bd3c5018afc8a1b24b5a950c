Nyanza county governments should focus on development to end poverty, a group of ACK clerics have said. They are Revs Mwai Abiero of Maseno South diocese, David Kodia (Bondo) and James Ochiel (Maseno East). They said there is little to show five years after the inception of devolution. They called for a joint and comprehensive strategy by the counties. The clerics said the church is commited to development, entrepreneurship and community development. "We underscore the need for cooporation between the county governments in addressing a myriad issues affecting our people in Nyanza including obsolete cultural practices which have become major threat to civilisation,” Abiero said.  NOTHING TO SHOW Kodia said the region will lag unless the leadership focuses on development. He called for a change of attitude and appreciation for working hard. Ochiel urged the counties to ensure prudent use of public funds channelled from the Treasury to start development projects improve residents’ livelihoods. He said the counties, despite receiving billions of shillings over the years, do not have tangible development records. The clerics urged politicians to lead from the front and promote development. They said ‘bad politics’ is to blame for stunted development.
