The government has set aside 1.5 billion shillings for contraction of Kainuk bridge which is in a dilapidated state. Speaking today during the Turkana Cultural festival at Lodwar, Deputy President William RutoÂ said its the role of the National government to ensure all citizens get their rights. "The Kainuk bridge that links Kenya to South Sudan, Ethiopia and Uganda will be fixed soon. We already have a contractor to work on the project," he said. For the last two days, more than 5,000 travellers and commuters have remained stranded on the banks of river Turkwel after it flooded. The heavy rains in parts of Turkana have raised the water levels rendering routes to Lodwar, Lokichogio and South Sudan impassable. On April 8, flood waters paralysed transport for at least 24 hours and swept five trailers headed to Lodwar. "Constructions of roads in Turkana is one of the initiatives to improve security matters. Nanok is taking the best measure to unite people within the borders of Turkana such as South Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, West Pokot and Baringo to end issues of cattle rustling," he said.
