Diamond Platnumz and his baby mama, Hamisa Mobetto are being trolled for behaving like horny teenagers when a video of them frolicking in bed went viral. Yesterday, Diamond was summoned by cops to write a statement about the lewd videos. A pal of Hamisa's wrote a strongly worded open letter to her.Â "Hauwezi ukawa mjinga kiasi kwamba mwanaume huyo huyo uliokua unamlilia child support, unamsaidia kubomoa na kuharibu career yake, or what do you both expect to gain from this cheap nasty publicity, only to hurt his own family, lose fans, endorsements?! Hizo hela unazozitaka haujui kuzitafuta wala kuzitunza. Kwahiyo mkiwa chumbani nyie ni kuingizana tu? Hamshauriani?" Adding, "Achane upuuzi, mnayofanya sio mapya, muda huu wapo watu wanayafanya ila hawaeki dunia nzima tujue. Watu wanauwezo kuwa na wanawake tofauti kila siku ila hawaonyeshi upumbavu huu. Diamond ni balozi wa Belaire alafu ana blame ushenzi wake on belaire? Who would want such representation? Damaging his own brand/product- for what?"
