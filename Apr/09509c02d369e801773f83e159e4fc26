Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos is on the spot for skipping the fifth devolution conference which ended on Thursday. The county was not represented. Tolgos was criticised by MCAs, led by Lawi Kibire (nominated), who accused the county chief of failing to remit subscription fees for the county to take part in the three-day event. Kibire said the county missed an opportunity to showcase its investment opportunities and learn from other counties. “It is a shame we were here idling when all other 46 counties of Kenya were in Kakamega, just because we did not subscribe for the conference,” Kibire said on Friday.
