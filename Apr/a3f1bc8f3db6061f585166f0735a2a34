It was a big deal for gospel bigwig Willy Paul when he unveiled his collaboration with Tanzanian mega star Harmonize, titled Pilipili. It has reached 600k views on YouTube, but the Malingo hitmaker is not happy. He posted: "This is so sad! Honestly speaking, let's not be people who are just after using others. Let's learn to support. And if we agree to support then let's do it wholeheartedly... It's a small world we are living in you might be at the top today but remember. Tomorrow is not guaranteed... Learn to live with people! #tafakari." Adding: "Before I forget, thank you to the whole WCB Wasafi, Diamond Platnumz and Babu Tale, Sallam for letting me use Harmonize in the song #pilipiliremix. God bless you all."
