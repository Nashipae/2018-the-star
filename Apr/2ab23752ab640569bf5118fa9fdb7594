The leaders used the forum to express their disappointment over the status of the roads and urge the government to take responsibility and make sure they are built well to avert accidents. cherish “Our roads have turned into death traps and we will not allow this anymore. The status of our roads should be improved so we do not keep burying our people,” Nyamira Senator Okong’o Omogeni said. The leaders said human life should be cherished. Nyagarama said the county government will pay all funeral expenses and hospital bills. He urged the government to ensure the roads in the country are in good condition. “It’s a great tragedy that we have lost so many lives in a single accident. We urge the government to keenly look at the state of our highways to reduce the deaths,” Nyagarama said.
