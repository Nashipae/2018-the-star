The child was struck in the birth canal with part of the head protruding outside, leading to a brain injury on the child. The hospital management referred then couple a Nairobi hospital of their choice since they could they could not handle the case. A brain scan was done on the baby by a neurologist at Kenyatta who confirmed that he had brain damage. They were advised to take the child to India for specialised treatment but Abdullahi, who is a taxi driver, says he cannot afford the cost. Contacted for comment authorities at Wajir referral hospital did not wish to speak to the media.
