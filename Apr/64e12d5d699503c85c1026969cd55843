Tax PINs have been deactivated for public servants who did not submit details for registration in the online KRA portal – iTax.Among those affected are teachers who failed to meet the registration deadline of June 2015. The Kenya Revenue Authority has said those who failed to transfer their PIN certificate details to KRA iTax portal will be required to give their details for reactivation. This will enable them access to critical public services, which they were denied after the PINs were deactivated. A number of transactions require proof of an active PIN certificate.They include registration of land title deeds, approval of development plans, registration, transfer and licensing of vehicles, and registration of business names and companies.
