A second half goal from Lilian Adera helped hosts Harambee Starlets to a slim 1-0 win over Uganda’s Crested Cranes in an African Women Cup of Nations (AWCON) qualifier first leg match at Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos yesterday. The Vihiga Queens centre-half struck a sumptuous long range in the 53rd minute to put the home team one step into the next round where Equatorial Guniea await in June. Coach David Ouma made two changes to the squad that won 3-0 in a friendly match away in Zambia a week ago, resting Pauline Musungu and Wincate Kaari as he gave starts to experienced Spedag duo of forward Esse Akida and defender Elizabeth Ambogo. The visitors were the better side in the first half with the home team’s forwards failing to click as the first half ended in a goalless stalemate. In the second, Kenya showed the urge to score and it didn’t come as a surprise when Adera scored. From then on, it was hit and miss before Ouma rested Akida for Mercy Achieng and Sheryl Andiba coming on for Cherish Avillia with 20 minutes to go. The changes did little to alter the scoreline as the home team held on to their lead. Starlets depart the country today for Uganda ahead of the second leg set for Sunday at the StarTimes, Stadium Lugogo. Should Starlets prevail over Crested Cranes in the return leg, they will battle Equatorial Guinea in the second and final round ahead of the Ghanaian bonanza later in the year.
