A middle aged man was yesterday sentenced to
life imprisonment for defiling his 10-year-old daughter. Kabarnet resident magistrate Viena Amboko said it had been proven beyond doubt that Peter Kipsoi committed the offence. The offence was committed on November 25 last year in Salawa village in Baringo. “After cross-examining
and interrogating the minor several times, she maintained that her father forced
her, on several occasions, to have sex with him,” Amboko said. Physical examination
by a clinical health officer showed the girl had injuries in
her private parts. The girl told the court her father called her and ordered her to lie down with her face upwards. He then laid on her and penetrated her private part. The girl called the act bad manners. Amboko said Kipsoi went ahead to commit the heinous act knowing it was a defilement and an incest offence. The girl's mother Risper Kipyekomen said the daughter later reported to her about the act. Kipyekomen was the second witness in the case. She accused the husband of threatening to kill the daughter if she refused to have sex with him. Kipsoi pleaded for lenience. He accused Kipyekomen of malice, saying she wanted to fix him for marrying a second wife. Amboko said the defence was weak compared to the magnitude of the matter. But the magistrate denied
his defense saying it is weak compared to the magnitude of the matter. She said
the child has maintained statement against her father. A middle aged man was
also arraigned in the same court for allegedly defiling two minors belonging his neighbour aged 9 and
11 years old at Bondani estate in Kabarnet town in Baringo Central Sub-county. It is reported that the
suspect Suleiman Kiplagat did the heinous acts on separate dates between March and
April. If found quilt the
suspect will be charged for defilement contrary to section 8(1) of the sexual
offences act 2006. The case will be
mentioned on May 5 pending the hearing on the 9th of the same month.
