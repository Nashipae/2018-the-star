Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria and his Tetu counterpart James Gichuhi have asked their colleagues to stop politics of the 2022 general election. Speaking in separate events, they asked the leaders, who have been rallying people on the next vote's choices, to focus on serving the people. The MPs said that the season of politics is now over and leaders should put their energy on serving the public. Gichuhi spoke at Kangaita PCEA church in Tetu while Kuria made the remarks at the New Life Church in Nyeri town. The Tetu MP said the premature politics was the reason Governor Anne Waiguru was heckled during Deputy President William Ruto's Kirinyaga tour. The county boss ran into trouble at Gakoigo when a group of youths, who the governor suspects were hired by woman representative Purity Ngirici, shouted her down. The woman representative has denied the allegations. "Such actions are as a result of the premature 2022 politics," Gichuhi said.

The legislator said one year has not elapsed since the country had its general elections and so the 2022 debate should stop. "We should not be speaking about 2022 politics because we were elected by people who are looking upon us to deliver on our pledges," he said. Kuria said those dwelling so much on 2022 politics are just wasting their time. "Even if someone has got any ambitions, we shall be judged as leaders by the work we do." "So, whoever is wasting time thinking about politics of the future should know that such politics are going to be influenced by the work that we do today," he said. This comes even as the focus of the next election is emerging as not only on who will succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta, but also on the top county seats. Click here for the latest political news
