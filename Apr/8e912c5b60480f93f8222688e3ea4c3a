Commuters were stranded on Thursday morning after matatu operators blocked the Kasarani-Mwiki route over its poor state. They parked buses on the road and also put stones on it, saying the contractor was taking too long to fix it. All exits from estates were blocked, preventing motorists from accessing Kangundo and Thika roads. "We have to walk to Roysambu all the way from Mwiki," one said. "Motorcycles are charging Sh200 per person to Roysambu." Anti-riot police were deployed to restore calm and matatu operations. Click here for the latest political news
