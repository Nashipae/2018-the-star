The 5th Annual Devolution Conference is a waste of public resources that could have been used to mitigate the effects of floods. This is according to National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale who wants the Kenya Defence Forces to help victims. Duale said on Thursday that soldiers should be deployed to offer emergency services in areas affected by floods. He supported an adjournment motion by Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter for the House to discuss the effects on floods across the country. The Garissa Town MP noted that troops are constitutionally mandated to help in such situations. "This country must have its priorities right. They should not be sitting in Kakamega," he said. "More people are now IDPs. They have lost their property while some have lost their lives. We must have an emergency recovery system and the military should come on board to offer emergency services." Heavy rains are wreaking havoc across Kenya barely a year after a drought ravaged the country. The losses arising from the two disasters that have plagued the nation for many decades are colossal. The irony in these disasters is that the country never seems prepared. There are never enough water reserves when drought hits, and drainage systems are easily overrun when it floods.
