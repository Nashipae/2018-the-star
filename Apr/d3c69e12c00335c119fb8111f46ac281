Gubernatorial succession politics in Kisii have began as politicians scheme to succeed James Ongwae. Kitutu Chache South MP Richard Onyonka is the latest politician to show interest in succeeding Ongwae. Deputy Governor Joash Maangi and former South Mugirango MP Manson Nyamweya have declared their interests. Dagoretti North MP Simba Arati and Nyaribari Masaba MP Ezekiel Machogu are also in the frame. Nyamweya has taken a low profile since he lost to Ongwae in last year’s August election. Arati, the self-declared Gusii spokesman has denied eying the seat. “It’s not my agenda. In future, if the people ask me to contest, I will do so because the voice of the people is the voice of God,” Arati told the Star on the phone yesterday. The MP spent Easter in the county as his visibility grows. He has been spending his weekends attending funerals and social events in Kisii. Arati has my blessings if he wants to be govenor,” Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tong’i said. Woman Representative Janet Ong’era wants the seat to go to Gucha. “In 2022, it will be the turn of Bobasi, Bomachoge and South Mugirango to produce a governor,” Ong’era said. On Tuesday, Onyonka told those willing to succeed him as MP to start campaigning, saying he has outgrown the seat. “I’m going for the governor’s seat in 2022,” Onyonka said.
