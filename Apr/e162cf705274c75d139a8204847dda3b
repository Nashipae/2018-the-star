The Teachers Service Commission has invited tutor unions for a consultative meeting next month to eliminate holiday degree programmes.This comes after a directive by TSC to discourage teachers from studying during holidays due to interference with teaching in schools.School based programmes allow teachers to further their academic qualifications over the holidays. They were replaced with part-time classes last year following recommendations by the Commission for University Education.The commission, in a report in February 2017, raised concern over the programme due to limited time in teacher training. The government has not given guidelines for a smooth transition from holiday degree programmes to the part time studies.

In fact, the holiday degree programme was an initiative by some universities,” he said.The University of Nairobi, Egerton, Kenyatta, Moi and Kisii have been running the school based programmes, where teachers cover a semester in a year.They study for three weeks in each holiday. This is about nine weeks of learning before the end of the semester, compared to the 12 weeks needed in a normal degree course. “Talking of part-time is not a solution. If TSC says teachers studying over the holiday will interfere with teaching, then part-time will even increase absenteeism,” Sossion said.  Click here for the latest political news
