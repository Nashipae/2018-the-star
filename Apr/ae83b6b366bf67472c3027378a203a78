A family has accused Thika Level 5 Hospital of neglecting a 75-year-old patient for eight days and causing her to lose an arm. Esther Ruguru’s right arm was amputated after a finger wound worsened. Tissue became necrotic and gangrenous. The hospital dismissed claims of negligence and bribery. Ruguru’s grandson, Nelson Mugendi, said that through an intermediary doctors demanded Sh5,000 to treat her. They only took her to an operating theater after they paid Sh3,000, he said. A stick pricked Ruguru’s finger as she worked on her farm in Kibichoi, Ruiru, on March 17. She was taken to Kibichoi dispensary where she received a tetanus jab, and later to Gatundu Level 4 Hospital. On March 27 she was taken to Thika. Her daughter, Miriam Njeri, told the Star on Monday the family sought to have hospital amputate the finger. Instead, her arm was amputated on April 13. Doctors ignored her for eight days, Njeri said. Rugut is recovering at the facility. “For eight days, doctors kept telling us she would be taken to the theatre, but that didn’t happen. My mum’s hand was starting to decompose. At one point, her ward was inhabitable due to a foul smell from her wound,” Njeri said. She and other family members complained to the nurse in charge who assured them their mother would be treated. “She had grown weak and wouldn’t eat. We feared we would lose her. I went to the matron and asked whether they wanted my mother to die,” Njeri said. Hospital Medical Superintendant Dr Patrick Nyaga said Ruguru was attended to by about six doctors. He told the Star she had two other untreated chronic diseases. “Doctors could not operate immediately because of her condition. Her high blood had to be stabilised ... Treating the elderly is a balancing act,” Dr Nyaga said. He said bribery allegations would be investigated.
