A two-week standoff in downtown Nairobi has caused five public toilets to be padlocked causing the public great discomfort ( see P27). Nairobi county has apparently allocated the toilets to youth groups as a form of empowerment but the youths are demanding Sh2 million from the previous operators to continue their work. A public toilet in the Nairobi CBD can generate net revenue of around Sh300,000 per month if it is clean and well managed. Each visit costs Sh10. This confusion is not good for Nairobi. Globally a mark of a well-run capital city is clean public toilets, drinking fountains and safe pleasant public parks. These are basic amenities which Nairobi should provide. They should not be considered as profit centres to be fought over. They should be provided free, or at a minimal cost, to city residents. The closure of these downtown toilets is a serious embarrassment. Governor Mike Sonko is a man of the people. He should now step in to help the people and get these toilets reopened.
