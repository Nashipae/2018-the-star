The Bungoma government and the national government yesterday started upgrading rural roads. The roads across the 45 wards will be murramed. Governor Wycliffe Wangamati said phase one will cost Sh70 million. The phase will take two months to complete. Wangamati said they expect to upgrade between 225km and 250km in phase one. He spoke in Kimukungi during the launch. He said bridges across the county are in pathetic condition and his government will set aside Sh100 million in the next financial year to ensure they are repaired. Wangamati also told those who have encroached on roads to move out to allow for the upgrade. Roads executive Collins Mukhongo said his ministry will work with MCAs and area administrators to ensure those who have encroached roads are removed. “When we start opening up these roads, we don’t want to pull down structures on road reserves. That is why we asking those who have encroached to move before we arrive,” he said. Mukhongo also said the department will ensure all roads in the urban areas are tarmacked in the next five years. He urged MCAs to pass the supplementary budget to ensure the roads project is successful. Mukhongo said the upgrade of the roads will improve lives. “We have enough machinery to carry out the work,” he said Mukhongo further said they are also going to open up roads in Mt Elgon to ease movement of security personnel to deal with criminals. He said poor communication has been a major factor of dealing with the criminal gang that has been terrorising residents.
