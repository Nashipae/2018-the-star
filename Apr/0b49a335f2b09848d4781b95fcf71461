Proposed amendments to the Wildlife Conservation and Management Act will slash the compensation that can be paid for damage and injury by wildlife. Crops and property damage will not be compensated at all, according to the amendments. However livestock losses will still be compensated. Injury or death caused by snakes, wild pigs and poisonous fish will also no longer be compensated. Kenya Wildlife Service technically owes around Sh5 billion in outstanding compensation payments for damage and injury by wild animals. Most of this damage or injury happened outside the parks and reserves for which the KWS is responsible. The situation is unsustainable and has made KWS effectively bankrupt. KWS will obviously continue to work to minimise wildlife conflict with humans around national parks but the laws for compensation were overdue for revision. The amendments also provide for Community Wildlife Conservation Committees that will work to minimise human-wildlife conflict. No one wants to see anyone hurt by a wild animal but these amendments are prudent and sensible  Quote of the day: "The violence associated with the ANC is minimal, infinitesimal next to the violence of the apartheid regime." - South African leader Oliver Tambo, died on 24 April, 1993.
