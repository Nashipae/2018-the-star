Residents of Kerio Valley are reeling from pain caused by heavy rains. Raging waters have eroded soil and caused gullies that have claimed three lives. Kabosgey-Kerio chief Richard Chepcheng yesterday said more than 8,000 residents, including schoolchildren, have been displaced and are in need of help. Residents want action taken to help end massive soil erosion when it rains. They say villagers have fallen into the gullies and died. Two people were killed last year, and five the year before that. “The problem began as far back as 1980. Many people have fallen into the ditches and numerous incidents have gone unreported,” Chepcheng said.  SERIOUS INJURIES Last May, 60-year-old Simotwo Kimuge from Marigut fell into a 70-foot-deep gully at night and died on the spot. His body was spotted the following day by children who had gone to fetch water. The body of 70-year-old Talaa Kalwaro was also found in the same place. “It is believed the partially blind granny fell into the ditch while looking for firewood the previous evening. We found her body the next day,” Johana Chesang said. Other residents who fell into the gullies and died include Samuel Chepyegon, Teriki Chebotibin, Sote Kangogo, Loseko Somokweta, Chelugo Kangwony, Jepkok Kipngow, Victor Chelanga, Chebii Kipchatimoi and Paulina Chebor. Some victims, especially the old, are nursing wounds after they cheated death. Sote Kipyekomen and Kabon Arwokol — each aged above 70 — can no longer walk. They suffered serious leg and hand injures after plunging into the ravines. Ongoing heavy rains have also left roads in ruins. Pregnant women risk their lives using boda bodas to seek care at health facilities. “Many of them deliver on their way to clinics and the difficult terrain is partly to blame,” Chepcheng said. Crops have been swept away. Chepyegon Ngeremucho said his 30-acre farm has been destroyed. He wants soil conservation efforts intensified.
