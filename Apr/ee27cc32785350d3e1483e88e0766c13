Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has told Baringo Senator Gideon Moi that being a son of a former President does not guarantee him the presidency. He urged Gideon to respect up-and-coming leaders because Kenyans supported his father, former President Daniel Moi to rule for 24 years. “Some of us from humble backgrounds would also like to test how it feels to be President,” Murkomen told Gideon on Saturday at an event in Chemolingot, Tiaty. He advised Gideon to drop his presidential ambitions and back DP William Ruto in 2022. Jubilee leaders who attended the event included MPs William Cheptumo (Baringo North), Caleb Kositany (Soi), Sabina Chege (Murang’a) and Rahab Wachira (Nyeri). Gideon was backed by West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo, Kapenguria MP Samwel Moroto, Fred Ouda (Kisumu Central), Rehema Jaldesa (Isiolo) and Kangogo Bowen.  Click here for the latest political news
