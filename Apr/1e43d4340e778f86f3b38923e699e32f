A Bungoma politician has lauded Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetangula for ending political ties with ODM's Raila Odinga. Kennedy Wanjala, who is Bungoma Maendeleo Chap Chap chairman, said the move by Wetangula was long overdue. He argued that "Raila has used the community and its leaders for a while to gain political mileage only to dump them in the cold later on." Wetangula on Saturday said that "Mulembe marriage with Raila is officially over and will not be renewed by any means." The senator accused Raila of being a traitor to other NASA principals for "sneaking to meet Uhuru over his own personal issues."

The Webuye West MP hopeful in the 2017 polls said leaders from the region should work together under one political party. He said that if Mudavadi and Weta dissolve their parties and form one Luhya party, it will give the community a higher pedestal in the 2022 vote. "After the merger, the two should look for like-minded leaders from outside the Luhya community and work together so that they ascend to state house." Wanjala called upon Western residents and leaders who are in various parties to join hands with Wetangula and Mudavadi.
