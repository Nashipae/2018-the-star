Over 200 participants are expected for the inaugural Athletics Kenya (AK) Mountain Running championships this Saturday. Event organiser Peter Angwenyi said he expects bumper entries especially in the senior men and women’s categories. “The turnout is expected to be good in the senior categories. There is a lot of stake including representing the country at the world championships in Andorra in September. I expect the event to be competitive as we select the best athletes to represent the country,” said Angwenyi. The event starts at Cornerstone Preparatory Academy on Mai Mahiu- Naivasha Road and goes through 10km trials at Mount Longonot. The terrain will see athletes tackle 9km of uphill and downhill with last the kilometre being a demanding steep uphill. Senior women’s will cover 6km while junior men will run 6km with their women’s counterparts running 3km. Some of the stars who will grace the event include reigning World Mountain running 10km champion Lucy Wambui, Robert Surum and Stephen Ndege.
