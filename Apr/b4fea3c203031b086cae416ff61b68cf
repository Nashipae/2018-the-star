This month will be the month Kenya experiences a high-profile wedding. President Uhuru Kenyatta's son, Jomo, will marry Achola Ngobi on Sunday in a white wedding. Our source whispered, "The Jomo Kenyatta wedding will be on April 8th. You guys should look out for it. The venue has been kept hush-hush for obvious reasons." This comes after a much-talked about traditional wedding ceremony in 2016. Achola got a warm reception at Uhuru’s rural home in Ichaweri, Gatundu, during the traditional ceremony, known as the Itara. A joyful Achola was ushered into the President's Gatundu home by elderly women as she walked hand-in-hand with her fiancé, Jomo. She was received by hundreds of people, including the President’s family members, friends and neighbours. The ceremony is one in which the bride’s family visits the groom's home to see where their daughter will settle. The bride and groom were decked out in Kikuyu traditional regalia. They shared food from the kaihuri (calabash) and curu wa mugagatio (sour porridge) from the kinya (gourds). In November last year, days before President Uhuru Kenyatta was about to be sworn in for his second term, he welcomed his first grandchild, a daughter who was named Wanjiru, taking Margaret Kenyatta’s middle name. Fiona delivered the baby girl at Nairobi's Aga Khan Hospital. Achola is the granddaughter of the late Luo political giant, William Omamo.
