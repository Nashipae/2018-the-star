Somewhere in the Kenyan Constitution, promulgated with much fanfare and
international acclaim on August 27, 2010, there is enshrined the famous
sentence that “Kenyans have a right to affordable, efficient and quality
healthcare." This right, currently, remains a pipe dream to many, even to those who
can afford insurance to make healthcare affordable at many levels of health
service delivery. Why do I say this? This is because healthcare "
deliverers", both medical personnel and insurance companies, do not always
rise up to the occasion when they should. Nor are they filial to their
constitutional obligation. I would like to draw the attention of the Medical
Practitioners and Dentists Board to this matter, especially the CEO, Daniel
Yumbya. In the meantime, an illustration will help to dramatize the gravity of
the matter.
Children, particularly babies, are delicate creatures. We all begin our lives
there. In Cuba, where infant mortality is lowest globally, the death of a child
in a hospital, or even at home, inevitably causes a crisis in the Cuban
government. Children are not supposed to die. In Kenya, when a child survives soon
after birth, it is a big celebration: It is the exception that proves the rule that
not all children die at birth. But what is even more worrying is that hospitals
that go by the name "children's hospital" can afford to employ
doctors who have zero passion for kids care. One such hospital is Gertrude's Garden Children's Hospital.
A recent ugly incident at that hospital needs the urgent attention and proper
inquiry by Yumbya and his team. The story runs as follows.
On Sunday March 25, this year, a young couple noticed that their fourâ€‹-month-old
baby, Malaika (correct identity hidden for privacy), had a limp left leg.
They rushed the child to Gertrude’s Garden getting there at 8am. The casualty
nurse, who received them, was courteous and did all she could to alleviate the
pain by administering the needed paracetamol. The attending doctor then
requested for an X-ray to discover the problem, which was a broken femur. Soon after that the baby was admitted awaiting the arrival of the
orthopedic surgeon. A physiotherapist then showed up several hours later,
around 1pm, and announced that she would perform tracking on the baby. This
essentially meant using weights and pulleys to pull the baby's tender bones to
align them. A rather painful procedure, which the parents rejected purely as a
result of their parental instincts, and requested that they be given a chance
to consult with the orthopedic surgeon on the baby's treatment plan before any
procedures are done. It was now 2pm and the orthopedic surgeon was nowhere to be seen. On further
inquiry, the nurses assured the young couple that the surgeon was still on his
way. By 3pm he was still "on his way." Please note here that the
hospital nurses also failed to give the follow up paracetemol, which we
understood was to be administered at 2:30. Bâ€‹y 4pm Bwana Daktari finally showed up completely unapologetic and
nonchalant about the problem at hand. The father of the baby was standing,
exasperated, with his hand on his hip. This drew the attention of the doctor,
who proceeded to tell the young man " to stand properly in his
presence," and that "in his culture" it is considered rude to
stand like that. The young father responded that " in his own culture thereâ€‹
is nothing wrong â€‹with â€‹the way he stood." Bwana Daktari then proceeded to
physically take the hand of the young father from the hip, shoving it down
and â€‹forcing it to hang beside the young man. If this
is not physical assault, then I definitely do not know the English language!
The young father, undisturbed, resumed his original posture. After some discussion, it became very clear to the parents that Bwana Daktari
was in no mood to look after the baby with tender loving care. If anything, he
was spoiling for unnecessary controversy and actually then stormed out of the
room. The parents then requested to seek help in another hospital, which Bwana
Daktari consented to provided the parents signed a form saying that they had
left Getrude's Garden "voluntarily and against medical advice", or
something to that effect. Desperate to leave, the parents could have signed any
form. At the discharge desk, however, they were compelled to pay around Sh23,000
after spending close to eight hours in the hospital without getting the
emergency care they needed. What is even worse is that their insurance company,
Hapa na Pale Insurance Company, could not agree to cover that expense and could
not even intervene with Getrude's to see sense.
But behind every cloud there is always a silver lining. Within one hour of the
horrible experience at Getrude's they were checked in at MP Shah, where I
frequently check in my mother, and they got some gold standard treatment. The
rest, as they say, now becomes history.
After the couple returned home, they immediately wrote a detailed letter to
Gertrude's, explaining what had transpired at their facility, believing that
the hospital would take some steps to rectify what had happened. Nonchalantly,
the officers at Gertrude's wrote back, completely oblivious to the gravity of
the issue; particularly its implications to the rights of Kenyans under the
Constitution. It is as if we all live in a jungle without any constitutional
order. Those who render services and charge an arm and a leg to make
unbelievable profits — here I include banks — never " feel" for the
plight of Wananchi. When this uncaring feeling descends to health service
delivery in hospitals and insurance firms, then we are really in trouble. I am
wondering whether the KMPDB has ever cared to carry out a genuine study of
charges in private hospitals and how they relate to the incomes of ordinary
Kenyans. Do the managers of these hospitals live in Kenya, where people walk on
two legs and drink water to quench their thirst, or are they tourists from Mars,
who descend on a daily basis to do the health care delivery business on earth
and then resume safe existence in their distant planet? Can Yumbya and his team
help us solve this riddle?
Back to the Getrude’s affair. I am willing to give all the original documents
to the KMPDB for further investigation, but I am also ready to take a class
action lawsuit as an aggrieved consumer of health delivery in our beloved
nation. If one of us consumers is injured, then we are all injured. Healthcare
consumers unite; we have nothing to lose but our indignity and neglect at the
hands of some callous health personnel who have no regard for our
constitutional rights.
Some of us were born and bred to fight for, defend and promote the rights of
ordinary Wananchi. It is a mission we are ready to carry out till death do us
part. So Bwana Daktari, be warned: We are here to carry out the struggle
"mpaka mwisho". If you want to improve your vocabulary with some
Portuguese sentence, please learn "A Luta Continua". It will let you
know that getting to our desired destiny is not easy and many a stumbling block
like you have always stood on our way to make life batter for the common man.
In the end, however, we have always succeeded. Even this battle at Getrude's we
shall win, God willing. But we shall win it for the sake of the health delivery
system as a whole, which do not require those given the charge to care for our
children the option to be callous to innocent babies. Remember what Jesus said:
"Suffer ye little children to come unto me"; and he pleaded with the
disciples to allow the mothers of Salem to bring the little children to him.
Bwana Daktari, whose disciple are you at Getrude's Garden Children's Hospital?
It would be very unfortunate if you decide to treat your patients based on the
sound of their names, the colour of their skins or the manner in which they
stand. You are a doctor, bound by your Hippocratic oath to render service
selflessly and to the best of your ability. On March 25, you broke that oath.
In a properly functioning medical system and culture, you should be
deregistered from the role of doctors. I rest my case.
