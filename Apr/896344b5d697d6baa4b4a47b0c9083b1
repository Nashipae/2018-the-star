Kakamega MCAs yesterday accused Governor Wycliffe Oparanya of frustrating devolution by centralising decisions on development. They said Oparanya has killed the spirit of devolution after he scrapped the Ward Development Fund and bursaries. “What he has done means we don’t have any connection with our voters and only a few contractors can access tenders from his office,” Butsotso MCA Walter Andati said. In retaliation for the scrapping, the war representatives have delayed approving the 2018-22 County Integrated Development Plan, the Annual Development Plan and the County Fiscal Strategic Paper 2018. On Wednesday, the Budget and Appropriations committee rejected an explanation by Health executive Rachel Okumu about discrepancies in the three documents regarding her docket. Sheywe MCA Job Mwamto said though the CIDP and the ADP indicate the department intends to spend Sh5.3 billion in the next financial year, the CFSP indicates Sh6.1 billion. “The minister failed to explain the Sh800 million difference,” he said. “We’re aware the governor is planning to take all House committee chairmen to a secret location to scrutinise the budget documents and bulldoze their approval using the ODM majority.” MCAs are in Kisumu for two days to discuss the three documents. On March 7, they declined to adopt the papers and accused the executive of ambushing and arm-twisting tactics. March 7 is the deadline set by the Public Finance Management Act and the County Governments Act for the county treasuries to publish and publicise their fiscal strategy papers after MCAs’ approval.
