A dispute has erupted over a 350-acre land earmarked for an industrial zone on the Elgeyo Marakwet-Uasin Gishu border. The land owned by Elgeyo Sawmills is alleged to have been acquired by a powerful politician under unclear circumstances upon the expiry of a 100-year lease two years ago. Elgeyo Marakwet county had struck a deal with Export Processing Zone Authority in February 14 to establish a processing zone on the land. The transfer of land to the private investor sparked angry reactions among leaders led by Moiben MP Silas Tiren. Tiren said the transfer of land to the powerful politician was marred with secrecy and dishonesty. The lawmaker said locals should have been allowed to buy the land.
