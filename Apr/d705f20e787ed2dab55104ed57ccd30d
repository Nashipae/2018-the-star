Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi has plans to amend the Constitution saying it is "not time to create positions for certain groups of people to join government". The Ford Kenya politician said if there must be a referendum, all Kenyans must be involved and the issues in question be those of benefit to wananchi. "The changes should not be for a few selected leaders.  We need to identify one area which needs to be reviewed and looked at for the benefit of Kenyans." The legislator spoke to the press on Saturday at the Kanduyi CDF offices after giving out bursary cheques to needy college and polytechnic students. This followed ODM leader Raila Odinga's proposal for a three-tier government, setting stage for an expansion to the current devolved structure. He said Kenya should retain the current counties but establish 14 regional or provincial blocks as units of
disbursement of resources, and the National government.

Deputy President William Ruto has opposed the proposal saying the magic of devolution is in service delivery and that this is what Kenya needs. "Rearranging devolution cannot be by creating another layer. It should be by taking the counties to the wards. We cannot take devolution upwards." Wamunyinyi calls for amendment of the Constitution needs to have a majority of supporters backing it and not only a few leaders. He said Kenyans in 2010 agreed that about 90 per cent of the Constitution was good and the percentage that needed to be looked at will be done by including everyone. On Saturday, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetangula also vehemently opposed the referendum proposal.
