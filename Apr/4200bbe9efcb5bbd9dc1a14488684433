The government should increase tax on alcohol and cigarettes to save youths from ruin, National Task Force on Community Policing chairman Joseph Kaguthi has said. He singled out Central Kenya, saying many youths are unproductive because they are hooked to alcohol and drugs. He urged churches and leaders to unite and fight against the illicit liquor menace.  ENEMIES OF COMMUNITY “The time to act is now to save our children who are chained to the liquor plague before and during their productive ages. Children are not in school and families are shrinking,” Kaguthi said. He urged liquor traders in Central to switch businesses, adding it is not right for a few individuals to get rich from a lethal trade. “They are enemies of the community and they cannot be blessed. Why can’t they look at the harm they’ve brought to our community and cease engaging in the trade of death,” Kaguthi posed. Kaguthi rallied support for Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu’s campaign against illicit brews and drugs saying like-minded leaders should join him.  NEW LICENCES “I was shocked to see some people chasing him from a meeting in Kikuyu. Our people should now realise lethal brews are only dragging us behind and killing the young generation. Total support on any course designed to fight the killer brews is required,” he said. The Kiambu County Alcoholic Drinks Control Act was passed last month to manage the sale and consumption of alcohol. It called for the immediate closure of all bars pending fresh reapplication for licences. However, bar owners said they would defy any move to close their businesses.
