Kirinyaga woman representative Purity Ngirici has dismissed claims by Governor Anne Waiguru that she and her husband paid goons to disrupt a meeting attended by DP William Ruto on Friday. The governor was shouted down by boda boda riders at Gakoigo by youths who appeared drunk when Ruto invited her to address the crowd. In a statement on Saturday, Ngirici denied Waiguru’s claims that she and her husband Andrew Ngirici hired the youths to disrupt the meeting. “We are dismayed by the statement attributed to the governor and state that we were at no time involved in the planning of the disruption,” Ngirici said.

But Ngirici said; “Contrary to what governor Waiguru has alluded to that we do not support development, we have been engaged in different development projects.” She challenged the governor to produce evidence linking them to the heckling noting that she and her husband are peace loving leaders. “We urge the governor of Kirinyaga to focus on delivering her promises to the people of Kirinyaga and avoid sideshows.” Ngirici further called on the youth not to be used by selfish politicians and leaders and instead demand services that will uplift their lives. “We appeal to the people of Kirinyaga to remain calm and also urge the police to investigate the matter,” Ngirici said.
