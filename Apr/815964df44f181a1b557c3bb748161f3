The Education ministry will allocate 70 per cent of its PhD scholarships to academic staff in public universities. This will increase the number of PhD holders in the institutions, as the country plans to make it a requirement for lecturers to have PhDs. CS Amina Mohamed yesterday said in Nairobi they plan to improve teaching standards. “The quality of graduate programmes, which we rely on to build capacity of staff to teach in universities, is at the lowest possible standard,” she said. Successful applicants will have to get back to teach in public universities. “This will ensure we support personal development, which is currently nonexistent in our public universities,” Amina said. The Commission for University Education said there is low enrolment for doctoral degrees in public universities. Chairperson Chacha Nyaigoti told the Star only one per cent of students are in doctorate programmes. Last year, Kenya produced a paltry 230 doctorates, against a target of 1,000, he said. “We have slow progress when it comes to students and academicians who want to progress and undertake PhD. This has affected the quality of education drastically. Most of those teaching only have masters’ degrees,” Nyaigoti. A report launched in 2016 — ‘the State of Higher Education in Kenya’ — indicates that in 2015, public universities only graduated 417 PhD students, up from 385 in 2014. Overall, public universities have only produced 1,203 PhDs since 2012. Over the same period, universities produced 16,561 masters graduates. Some 120,328 students have graduated in the past four years with bachelor degrees. The situation is also dire at private universities. In 2015, they graduated only 52 PhD students, compared to 42 PhDs in 2014. Since 2012, they have produced 157 PhDs, 8,484 masters’ graduates and 62,064 bachelor degrees.
