The Kenya Revenue Authority has won a case to recover Sh2.5 billion in tax from sugar importer Darasa Investment. A three-judge bench of the Court of Appeal in Mombasa yesterday set aside High Court orders stopping KRA from collecting the tax for 40,000 tonnes of brown sugar. The importer claimed the consignment was imported during tax exemption period in February last year. High Court judge Erick Ogola ordered that the importer offload the sugar as it was proven to have been imported within the waiver period. Darasa wanted the court to shield it from the tax man and stop any payment of duties on the 800,000 bags. The offloading was done in August. The importer said the offloading could not be done in February because the ship could not berth due to its large size. KRA wanted Darasa to pay tax, saying the consignment was imported beyond the gazette notice period of May 12, last year. The appellate judges said Darasa had failed to follow the procedures to appeal the commissioner's decision to tax them. In a judgment read by Justice Martha Koome, the court said Darasa failed to confirm that they had indeed import the cargo within exemption period.
