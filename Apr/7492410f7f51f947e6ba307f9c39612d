The Education ministry has formed a committee in Lari subcounty to devise a strategy to improve education standards. This followed residentsâ€™ outcry over poor results in the KCPE and KCSE exams. In one secondary school, 34 students had grade E. The committee is made up of teachers, professionals, youths, clerics, and officials from Knut and the TSC. "The team we have will help us know the real problem. We have enough teachers and students, as well as a good learning environment. Our aim is to ensure our students perform well," subcounty director of education Omari Borura said yesterday when he introduced the team at the constituency headquarters. Parents and students attended. MP Jonah Mburu issued Sh4 million bursaries. He was accompanied by deputy county commissioner Aaron Koros. Residents said they will not sit back and watch their schools perform poorly. Mburu urged residents to support the measures to ensure success.
