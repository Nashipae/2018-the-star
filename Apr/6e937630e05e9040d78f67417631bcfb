Senate Speaker Hon Kenneth Lusaka has urged national and county leaders to focus on supporting the realisation of the Big Four development agenda. Lusaka on Saturday said the country had just come from one of the most expensive elections in the world. "I do not deny that change is good as rest. Calls for referendum this soon after the 2017 elections are, however, premature," he said.

(ADC) in Boyani, Vihiga county. He presided over the closing
ceremony of the Youth Leadersâ€™ national convention. "The country is usually on tenterhooks whenever elections are imminent. The best thing for the country right now is to support the realisation of the Big Four agenda." Speaker Lusaka reminded the convention, that brings together 1,000 youth from across the country, how Kenya was divided into "Oranges and Bananas" during the 2005 referendum. He said the referendum push will be retrogressive to the unity demonstrated by the historic President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga handshake. Shamakhokho MCA Douglas Beru, on his part, asked the congregation to support the government of the day.
