Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa (pictured) on Monday announced she would prioritise Education as her Big One agenda in her five-year term. Jumwa will ensure teachers and students work together to uplift the constituency’s education standards. She spoke at the launch of the Sh10 million 2016-17 bursary allocation for high school students. Speaking at Barani Secondary School, Jumwa said she will meet teachers and students in all the schools to discuss the importance of quality education. She equated her Big One Agenda to President Uhuru’s Big Four agenda meant to stamp his legacy. The legislator’s plan includes building schools, keeping children in class and motivating teachers. Jumwa will build the first teachers’ headquarters in Malindi in July. “Teachers will have a day for motivation. I will take them for a retreat to energise them to deliver,” she said. Jumwa will push for the amendment of the Education Act to offer full scholarships to needy students, a project she equated to Equity Banks’ Wings to Fly programme. “I will call for the review of the Act and policies to ensure poor children have shoes, school uniform and fees,” she said. The MP told teachers to stop squandering money meant for bursaries. Some principals collude with the bursary officers to engage in corruption and write block cheques to avoid being detected.
