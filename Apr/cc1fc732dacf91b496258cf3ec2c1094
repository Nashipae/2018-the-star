Miss World 2017 Manushi Chillar, alongside Julia Morley, Miss World Chair and the founder of Beauty with a Purpose ambassador programme, is slated to visit Kenya from May 8 to 13. They will weigh in on Kenya’s fight against FGM, while promoting feminine hygiene among girls. During their four-day visit, the beauty icons will tour various charities, among them House of Hope Rescue Centre in Narok county, where the Beauty with a Purpose programme has made significant impact in improving the lives of girls rescued from FGM prone environments. They will also be hosted to a gala dinner set to be graced by Gender CS Margaret Kobia. Miss World Kenya franchise director Terry Mungai said their visit comes at an opportune time when the country has made significant strides on the gender agenda. She said The Tour also creates an opportunity for tourism investment in Kenya, as the country aggressively pushes to host Miss World Global Competition. “The mission this year is to bring Kenya closer to achieving the Global Goal of Gender Equality. We are happy that Miss World is coming soon after President Uhuru Kenyatta zero-rated sanitary towels. As a country, we have also seen tremendous progress in reducing the prevalence of FGM. Their visit sends out a strong message that our country is committed to upholding the rights of women and girls,” Terry said. “Over the 15 years of participating in the Miss World Beauty pageant, Kenya has been on a record-breaking trend at the global competition, having clinched the Miss World Africa Title two times in a row, and winning in the Beauty with a Purpose category more than three times."
