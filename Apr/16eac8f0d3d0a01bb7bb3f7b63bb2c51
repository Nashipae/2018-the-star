The Agricultural Finance Corporation MD, Lucas Meso, has said Budalang’i is a major rice growing zone and can feed the entire Western region. He attended a farmers’ forum at St Benedict Budalang’i High School in Bunyala subcounty. Meso urged rice farmers in Magombe Multi Purpose, Ruambwa Mudembi and Sisenye schemes to ensure Budalang’i has a properly branded rice within two years. The subcounty has 4,500 active rice farmers. Meso said officers from the Agricultural Finance Corporation will visit the rice schemes in Bunyala to assess the farmers’ needs. A few farmers from the respective rice schemes in Budalang’i will be taken to other areas on an exchange programme to learn more from successful farmers.
