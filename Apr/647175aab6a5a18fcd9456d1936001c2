MPs yesterday clashed with representatives of private firms claiming Sh3.2 billion compensation from the state for prime land hosting two city public schools. The National Assembly Lands committee, chaired by Kitui South MP Rachael Nyamai, accused the directors of Afrison Export and Import Ltd and Huelands Ltd of frustrating their probe. “What you are doing now is a delay strategy so that we don’t get anywhere with this investigation. This committee has dedicated enough time on this matter but you are not coopertaing,” Nyamai said.

On Thursday last week, the committee declined to meet lawyers Joseph Nzioka and Nicholas Nyamai representing the director of the two firms, Mark Mungai Mburu. Yesterday, the lawyers appeared before the committee but were dismissed and fresh invitations sent to directors Francis Mburu, Mark Mungai Mburu and Justin Mungai Mburu for tomorrow. Lawyer Nyamai adduced a sworn affidavit from the firms’ managing director, Francis, dated April 16, claiming ownership of the land hosting Ruaraka High School and Drive Inn Primary School. He said Mburu was unwell and had authorised him to represent him. “Chair, we also have the right to be heard. We are willing to cooperate, but you must also hear us. It is almost like you are fighting us,” the lawyer said.

We are not joking because this committee is equivalent to a High Court.”
