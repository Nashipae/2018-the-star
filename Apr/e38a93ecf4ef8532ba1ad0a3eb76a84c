Police are hunting down the men who attacked Nairobi Central Business District Association chair Timothy Muriuki on Monday. Muriuki was assaulted during a press briefing at Boulevard Hotel on accusations he was tarnishing Governor Mike Sonko's name. Central OCPD Harrison Thuku said the suspects will be charged with assault and damage of property. The heavily built men stormed the venue of the media meeting and roughed up Muriuki shortly after he started addressing the press. They tore his statement and dragged him by the collar of his coat. Muriuki said he called the meeting to address the problems business people face. He has recorded a statement at Central Police Station over the attack. "We have launched a hunt on his attackers," Thuku said. See: [VIDEO] CBD association chairman beaten up 'for tarnishing Sonko name' Click here for the latest political news
