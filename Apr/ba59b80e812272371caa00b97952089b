South Africa's Constitutional court has dismissed an application by paralympic gold medallist Oscar Pistorius to appeal his sentence for murdering his girlfriend, legal documents showed on Monday. Pistorious was initially jailed for six years for shooting dead Reeva Steenkamp, but prosecutors argued that sentence had been "shockingly lenient" and an appeal court agreed in November to more than double the term to 15 years. Pistorius challenged the appeals court's ruling in the Constitutional Court. "The Constitutional Court has considered the application for condonation and leave to appeal. It has concluded that ... the application for leave to appeal should be dismissed as it does not engage this court's jurisdiction," read the court's order dated March 28 and made public by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) on Monday. The NPA said it was pleased with the order. "We have always contended as the NPA that their leave to appeal has no prospects of success, and the Constitutional Court has just confirmed that," NPA spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku said. Pistorius was given
the minimum 15 years prescribed for murder by the Supreme Court,
reduced to 13 years and five months, taking into account time
served. The athlete was jailed in July 2016 after being found
guilty on appeal of murdering model and law graduate Steenkamp
on Valentine's Day 2013 by firing four shots through a locked
bathroom door. Read: Pistorius to appeal increased sentence at South Africa's highest court Click here for the latest political news
