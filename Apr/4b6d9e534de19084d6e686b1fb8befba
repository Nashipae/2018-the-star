The Garissa department of trade yesterday issued a one-month notice for all traders to present their weighing machines for verification. Trade and Enterprise Development chief officer Mahat Salah said despite the department being a devolved function, the county is using the National Trade Act of Weights and Measures. Speaking after launching the annual verification, Salah urged traders to  voluntarily avail their equipment for re-verification.   The chief officer said the free exercise is meant to protect the customers as well as the traders, adding that “machines have ware and tear.” “This is a lawful exercise and the traders are required to make sure that they do it. Failure to do so will attract some penalties,” Salah said.
