Tana River leaders have told residents the ban on charcoal business remains in force and no amount of pressure will sway them. Governor Dhado Godhana and Woman MP Rehema Hassan yesterday said the devastation caused by tree felling is evident and they will not allow it to continue. The county suffers from increasing water shortage. The water level of the main supplier, the River Tana, has dropped. Leaders addressed a baraza in Mororo trading centre, Madogo subcounty. Dhado blamed residents for allowing themselves to be used by outsiders to destroy their environment, especially the indigenous trees. “Charcoal cartels from towns such as Nairobi, Nakuru and Machakos engage our people in charcoal burning business. They reap huge profits while our own people continue to languish in abject poverty,” he said. He said he has the names of cartel figures given to him by a team he ordered to look into the problem. “You can’t believe the amount of money we have been losing through these individuals.” Charcoal for domestic use is not banned and residents can buy from neighbouring counties, the governor said.
