A rebel Jubilee MCA who two months ago was de-whipped from a committee for not toeing the party line has been replaced. Hamza MCA Mark Ndungu, who was Transport committee chairman, has been replaced with Kiamaiko MCA James Mwangi. Ndungu was kicked out of the team in February after he criticised the party leadership in the assembly for questioning EALA MP Simon Mbugua’s role at City Hall. Ndungu criticised the Jubilee leadership, saying it was dictatorial. “These people are threatening us everyday. If you criticise them, they threaten to remove you from the committee. We will not be cowed. We need freedom,” he had said. “I want to promise the people of Nairobi that I will diligently serve them in this is new position. I will ensure roads in this county are tarmacked,” Mwangi said.
