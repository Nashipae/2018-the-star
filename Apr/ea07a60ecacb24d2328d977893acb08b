Hundreds of city residents were on yesterday forced to spend the night out in the cold after their homes were flooded following a heavy downpour in the capital. Commuters were also stranded for the better part of yesterday morning after most roads were rendered impassable by the raging waters. Residents of Civil Servants estate in Kariobangi South and Pioneer in Buruburu were woken up by floods in their homes yesterday morning. “I was woken up by cries of my children who were sleeping in the sitting room. When I got there, they were almost submerged in water,” resident and mother of five Jane Anzemo said. “I don’t know where I will take my children. I am stranded. Please help me.” Anzemo said she made some of her children stand on tables, but water volumes kept increasing. All her belongings were trapped in her house that was completely submerged in water. The entire estate could be likened to a small lake. Some tried in vain to remove water from their houses using buckets. Resident Haron Sirucha said the estate has never experienced floods of such a magnitude. Residents blamed private developers whom they said have built flats too close to a nearby stream “We have a stream that is normally the route used by water. But these people have built on top of it and some even tried to do away with it. When it rains, water forces its way through and the result is what we are seeing here today,” Sirucha said. Youths used carts to rescue children who were trapped in the houses - at a fee.
