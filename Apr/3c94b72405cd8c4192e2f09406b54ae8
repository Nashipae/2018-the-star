IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati’s apparent inconsistent narrative on why CEO Ezra Chiloba was sent on compulsory leave has been exposed in internal memos to staff. This, after Chebukati recalled an earlier memo he sent to staff on Monday in which he explained circumstances under which Chiloba was sent on compulsory leave. Chebukati had initially told staff Chiloba was kicked out for failing to provide proper explanations on queries raised in an internal audit. But in a fresh communication dated Tuesday this week, Chebukati rescinded his earlier narrative saying Chiloba was suspended because of issues raised in the audit report. The decision, Chebukati said, was, therefore, meant to allow for what he described as a substantive audit.  ALLOWANCES STOPPED “I write under instructions from the chair’s office to issue a clarification on the Communication ref:IEBC/CP/SM/VOL1( 48 ) earlier issued to staff,” an email to staff from Wilfred Lusi, the manager in Chebukati’s office, reads. He goes on, “The commission CEO Mr Ezra Chiloba was asked to proceed on compulsory leave by the Commission plenary on the basis of the issues revealed in the preliminary audit report dated 5th April, 2018, to allow for a substantive audit on the issue abounding therefrom.” The flip-flopping has reportedly triggered disquiet among a section of secretariat staff. “The chairman is exposing himself. How can you suspend someone without giving him an opportunity to respond to the audit queries,” a source within the IEBC told the Star.
