A human rights group has raised the red flag over increased cases of online sexual exploitation of children in Kenya. Terre des Hommes Netherlands, in its report, ‘The Dark Side of the Internet for Children  – Online Sexual Exploitation in Kenya’,  says children live stream sexual acts. This takes place in private residences and through the unregulated cybercafÃ© industry. The organisation has carried out a research on online sexual exploitation and will release its report at the Laico Regency on Thursday. The report says rapid development in internet and technology coupled with cheap smartphones have fuelled the problem. "Unfortunately, the digitally advanced environment represents a double-edged sword. Children from poor and marginalised communities are especially vulnerable to commercial sexual exploitation,” Terre des Hommes Netherlands country manager Angela Nyamu said. OCSE refers to the very broad phenomenon of the use of the internet as a means to exploit children sexually. This includes live online child exploitation, which specifically involves live performance by children of sexual acts in front of a web-cam or cell phone camera, and is instantaneously transmitted to (paying) adult viewers who can watch and engage while the abuse is occurring. "CybercafÃ©s and cell phones offer access to public chat rooms, social media, video chatting and other file sharing software," she said. Nyamu said some cybercafÃ©s in Kenya provide private back rooms that are not restricted and anyone, including children, can enter as long as they can pay. "We will launch an intensively researched report. We believe the report will be key in augmenting discussion relating to OCSE in the Kenya Computer and Cybercrimes Bill of 2017 currently before The House," she added. The group will, during the launch of the report, showcase how online predators hunt their prey through a "Live chat session." A live chat session will be set up to demonstrate how young children behave as a conversational partner in cyber space.
