Politicians and businessmen with large tracts of land on the Mwea Settlement Scheme have been blamed for the shooting of squatters. Nyangi Ndiiriri Council of Elders chairman Andrew Ireri said they are behind the hastening of resettlement of squatters. He on Friday said the county government was acting under the influence of the prominent landowners. Ireri said the prominent personalities - who are allegedly among the 9,232 beneficiaries - wanted the exercise completed quickly to take up their land. The elders said the resettlement was stopped by Interior CS Fred Matiang’i and his Lands colleague Farida Koroney after seven squatters were shot by police on April 17 while preventing the landowners from accessing their property. The heavily armed security men - who escorted some of the 9,232 beneficiaries allocated land to their parcels also beat some residents in Mashamba area. Following the attack, Matiang’i and Karoney, in a communication by Interior spokesman Mwenda Njoka on Twitter, suspended the exercise indefinitely. The elders supported the postponement of resettlement and called for fresh distribution of the land to those who deserve it. They also called for the establishment of a task force to find out why distribution has been unsuccessful.
