Kiambu woman representative has asked men from Central Kenya to marry more than one wife so as to increase the region's population. Gathoni Wamuchomba added that the marriages will also reduce cases of infidelity and of children born out of wedlock. The legislator said it is regrettable that more women are yearning to get married but most men are heavily dependent on illicit brews. "The situation has forced young women to sire children with married men who end up abandoning them to raise the babies single-handedly." "As much as we are talking about our church and our culture, we must go back to the drawing board and get solutions to some of these problems," the MP said. The legislator said she wondered which crime the community's forefathers who were polygamous committed. "Let all able men to marry more than one wife and bring up children...go ahead and marry even five wives," she said. Wamuchomba spoke at Wangunyu social hall, Kiambaa constituency on SaturdayÂ during an enrolment of alcohol addicts into rehab. The MP said she has been talking to family members of alcoholic addicts with view to helping them seek help for their alcoholism problem. She said her office bought 200 beds, mattresses, and blankets and has secured food for the patients during their three-months stay in rehab. Click here for the latest political news
