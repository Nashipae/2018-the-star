President Uhuru Kenyatta and Nasa leader Raila Odinga should roll out the peace pact they signed on March 9, Busia Senator Amos Wako has said. Wako on Thursday said the two leaders must now engage other Kenyans after the historic handshake at Harambee house. "It is important that we now focus on engaging in the constructive dialogue on the important issues identified in the deal," he said. He added; premature electioneering and positioning for 2022 has started, leaders are engaging in many negative and unproductive activities which are attracting the attention of the populace and unnecessarily depleting and draining their energies detracting their attention from the main issues.
