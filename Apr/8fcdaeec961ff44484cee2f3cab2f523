Retailers in the dates business are unhappy with the government's offer to pay tax for imported dates. In a letter sent to Kenya Revenue Authority Commissioner by Treasury PS Kamau Thugge, and that was seen by journalists at the Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya offices, the government will pay for dates imported during the month of Ramadhan. "As a gesture of manifesting goodwill to our Muslim brothers during the month of Ramadhan, an important period in the Muslim calendar, taxes relating to dates imported between now and the end of Ramadhan will be paid by the government. This letter constitutes an undertaking to do so," said the letter dated April 13. CIPK organising secretary Mohamed Khalifa warned all businessmen against selling this commodity at a higher price. “Now that the government has paid for the taxes of the dates we urge businessmen not to sell dates in a way that the Muslim community will suffer,” he said in Mombasa. However, the retailers said they have never seen prices of the dates go down. “Last year we were told that the government has catered for the pricing of date but we did not see the effects in pricing,” he said. Omar said he has no reason to sell the dates at a higher price once he gets the dates at an affordable price. He has been in the business for more than 10 years and is selling them at Sh400 per kilo. “When the prices go down I will also reduce the prices so that the less fortunate can also benefit from it during this Holy Month,” he said.
