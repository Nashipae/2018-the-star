A boda-boda rider died on the spot and his pillion passengers critically injured at Nyacheki shopping centre on Friday afternoon after their bike collided with another while escaping from Kisii County askaris. Following the incident, activities at the shopping centre were disrupted for several hours as the operators protested the death of their colleague. The busy Keroka Nyangusu road was also barricaded for several hours forcing police to intervene. The protestors attacked and injured three Kisii County revenue collectors, said Kisii County secretary Patrick Lumumba. Lumumba who addressed journalists in Kisii town said the rider died while he was being rushed to the hospital. Lumumba noted that the other rider was also injured. “The boda-boda rider was trying to evade inspection for a revenue sticker when he collided with another rider,” Lumumba explained. He added that the mob took away two points of the sale machines and destroyed a market office among other properties at Nyacheki. Lumumba who was accompanied by Chief Officer Administration Geoffrey Mogire denied claims that the revenue collectors threw spokes at the motorbike leading to the accident. “Action will be taken against any county staff if found culpable. The county will not condone any unwarranted behaviour,” added Lumumba. “We regret the incident and take earliest opportunity to condole with the bereaved family. We appeal for calm as police carry out investigations,” he added.  Click here for the latest political news
