Eleven people have been charged with the murder of a Kisii-based pastor. The suspects were accused of killing Esther Bochaberi last month. Bochaberi's decomposing body was discovered in a sugarcane plantation in Awendo, Migori county, two weeks ago. She had been missing for a month. James Mogita, Edward Onyango, Edwin Mayienda, Peter Nyamarere, Robert Orwaru, Vincent Maobe, Fredrick Nyambati, Benson Machuka, Joseph Moire, Reuben Onduso and Christopher Oyugi were charded before Homa Bay High Court Judge Helen Omondi on Friday. Bochaberi was a pastor at Ebenezer Apostle Mission. Omondi directed that Mogita, Nyamarere, Maobe and Oyugi be accorded urgent medical attention. The court also directed all the accused to undergo a mental test. "The accused shall be escorted to hospital for mental assessment. A report should then be filed in court within seven days,” Omondi said. Omondi also directed officers at Gesonso police station to investigate allegations that families of the accused were being harassed by neighbours. Nine of the suspects will be remanded at the Kisii GK prison while the other two at Gesonso police station. "All accused shall be remanded in custody at Kisii GK prison except the third and fourth accused who shall be held at Gesonso police station as required by the Director of Public Prosecutions to assist with investigations,” Omondi said. The accused will take plea on May 2 before a presiding judge in Kisii.
