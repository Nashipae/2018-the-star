Mwingi west MP Charles Nguna has called upon the Government to forge ahead with developments and forget all about handshakes and other things which are not helping at all. He spoke at Itong'olani primary school where he decried high poverty level saying at the moment everything has stagnated and the country needs to develop. At the moment he called for the increase of CDF kitty from sh 86million to something better since the amount is too little looking at the impending developments. "Look at this school and tell me where to start and end. It needs lots of money pumped in and remember that over sh 20 million went to burseries. The poverty level is very high and all the important developments needs to be funded. It's even shocking that there are so many developments which have not even started however much we focus on the priority, the funds are still too little," added Nguna. He called upon the leaders to recollect themselves and look at the macro and micro economic variables in the country and see what to do to improve it. He said as a leader he is very dissapointed by how the price of basic commodities are shooting everyday making the citizens to dig their empty pockets deeper while some cannot even afford to put food on their tables. "Though the rains could be promising I pray that we consider such things before some sleep on empty stomachs. We have to forget our internal wars and fight for those who God has mandated us to lead," he added.
