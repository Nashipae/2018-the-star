President Yoweri Museveni has splashed millions of Ugandan shillings on athletes who won various medals at the recently concluded Commonwealth Games. The winners will be paid Ush5 million (Sh135,000) for each gold, Sh80,000 (bronze), and Sh26,000 (silver) won at the Gold Coast, Australia 2018 meet. Museveni said that the monthly payments will be effected in the government's payroll. He also assured the sports men that the Ugandan government will eventually clear their monthly stipend arrears that have accumulated over the years. "I made a promise that whoever wins a gold medal at an international competition would get a monthly salary. The five medalists today will get onto the payroll." "I have also been told of some arrears to other athletes, they will be cleared," Museveni said via twitter. The Ugandan president said the government will tackle the issue of taxes on sports equipment, some of which he said will be manufactured in the neighbouring country. "Why should we import balls when we have leather here? And this will help create jobs here instead of exporting employment opportunities to other countries." Joshua Cheptegei earned Uganda gold medals in the 10,000m and 5000m (Men) while Stella Chesang won the Women’s 10,000m. Solomon Mutai won silver in the men’s marathon whereas Mercyline Chelangat bagged Bronze in the Women’s 10,000m. Boxer Juma Miiro got bronze in the Men’s 46-49kg, a competition that saw Kenyans perform dismally compared to the country's past games.
