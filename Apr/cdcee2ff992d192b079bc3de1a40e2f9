Nyota Ndogo is very close to accomplishing her goal of being a landlady. The songstress has invested a cool Sh10 million in two-bedroom rental units in Kaloleni, Voi. "I have built five such houses to rent out. I'm almost done. It has been a long gruelling but satisfying journey," she told Word Is. Nyota explained how she came up with the capital. "Many people think just because I'm married to a mzungu - Henning Nielsen â€“ I would crave a lavish life. That is far from it, my desire is to be financially stable. Most girls always crave for a lifestyle that is out there, from living in a house in Nyali to driving big cars, and all that. But that is not me." The Watu na Viatu star added, "If I wanted I would have lived a fancy life in Nyali like most chics but for me that is not my goal. I asked my hubby to help boost my investments to make the rentals dream actualize. Now here we are." In an online advertisement, Nyota tells her prospective tenants: "Karibuni Nyota's Home. Tunasubiri umeme tu. Hizo ni tatu. Nimeanza msingi wa zengine mbili nyuma ya hizo. Zikiisha niwape mziki. Zipo Voi Kaloleni." Nyota said so far she has invested Sh7 million but estimates the cost will rise to Sh10 million by the time she completes the units. She will charge Sh20,000 per house. "If these same units were in Mombasa they would charge between 25,000 to 30,000, but I will charge less than that." Despite being a landlady, the songstress still sings and goes on tours.
