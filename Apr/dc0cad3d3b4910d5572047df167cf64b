A middle aged casual laborer was yesterday found dead in an old van in Limuru market, Kiambu county. Simon Mucheru who was also suspected to have been sodomised, was noticed by traders who were opening their shops. He was in the front seat of the vehicle, with his clothes having been removed. Business at the market came to a stand still, with market loaders describing Mucheru as a hardworking. “We knew him as Morris, that was his nickname. He was murdered by unknown people. We sleep here in the market as we wait for lorries that arrive from 4am to offload them. He is one of the most hardworking,” John Kariuki, a loader said The traders called the police who arrived shortly led by area AP commander Gitonga Gathumi, Limuru sub county administrator Peter Gichuki and nominated MCA Nduta Muongi. The van owner Samuel Kiiru said he had gone to buy cabbages at Soko Mjinga in Lari constituency, when he was called by traders that a man had been found dead inside his van. “I have been using the van for the last five years. I finished selling cabbages on Saturday, and so I didn't open again. I was coming to open today. I know Mucheru, but he wasn't my employee” he said. Mucheru's aunt, Hannah Wambui asked the police to investigate the incident and arrest the suspects behind the murder of her nephew. Gathumi said investigations into the incident has been launched. However, Gichuki warned that the use of old vehicles will be discussed by the government in bid to remove them since street boys and market loaders were sleeping there. He said traders brought old vehicles as sheds while others build sheds outside the market, since the market is under rehabilitation. “The government is working to ensure the market is complete and in use, so as to ensure trade goes on inside it. Security for traders will be enhanced” he said. Gathumi said investigations into the incident has been launched.
