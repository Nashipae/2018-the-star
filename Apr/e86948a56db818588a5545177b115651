Kenyan 10,000m trio Jonathan Ndiku, Josephat Bett and Rodgers Kwemoi are plotting revenge against neighbours Uganda, who ran away with the crown at the last Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Uganda won gold through Moses Kipsiro in Glasgow with Bett settling for silver. “I know what happened during the previous event and I have worked on my weaknesses,” said Bett. He said this time round, rivals will need to have prepared well to shake him off, especially in the last 400m. “It was very painful last time losing by the skin of the teeth to Kipsiro and I am looking forward to make amends,” said Bett. Like Bett, Ndiku is equally beaming with confidence. Ndiku, who won the 3,000m steeplechase in Glasgow four years ago, said he is no pushover despite upgrading 7000m higher. “I have settled in the 10,000m and I know what I want. Since exiting the 3,000m steeplechase, I have featured in a number of 10,000m races and I believe I have what it takes not only to win a medal but gold,” he said. He said he is in the process of transitioning to marathon and believes his current decision to shift to 10,000m will held him. “I didn’t get it difficult transitioning from steeplechase to 10,000m because I am basically a long distance runner and I have never quite trained to run steeplechase,” he added. “Even when I was running 3,000m steeplechase I used to train in 5,000 and 10,000m. I am easy and we are hopeful of winning this race.” Ndiku said his target is to run in the marathon at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. “In 2020 Tokyo Olympics, which is my current base, I will still run the 10,000m race but from 2021, I will focus on marathon and also engage in big city races,” he added. He urged Kenyans to be patient because they have only tackled a quarter of their races here. “Medals will come and there is no cause for alarm,” he noted. The three Kenyans will be up against Ugandan trio of Joshua Cheptegei, who won the 5,000m gold earlier this week, Jacob Kiplimo and Timothy Toroitich. The silver medallist in the 5,000m, Canadian Mohammed Ahmed, will also be seeking more accolades in the race.
