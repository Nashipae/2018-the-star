Siblings Nicholas Bett and Aaron Koech parade today in the 400m hurdles final at Carrara Stadium as they seek to give Kenya their first gold medal at the ongoing Club Games. Bett, a former world champion and Koech, the Africa bronze medallist remained upbeat of delivering the elusive medal. Bett won his semifinal in 49.24 ahead of Jeffrey Gibson (49.75) of Bahamas while Koech (49.28) finished second in his semi behind England’s Jack Green (49.24). Meanwhile, Wycliffe Kinyamal and Jonathan Kitilit are hoping to snatch the 800m crown from the defending champion, Botswana’s Nijel Amos. Kinyamal won his heat on Tuesday in a time of 1:45.56 to send a warning to the rest of the field ahead of Kyle Langford of England, who posted 1:46.61. Amos, who stunned two-time Olympic champion David Rudisha two years ago in Glasgow led Aussie Luke Mathews (1:46.53) and Kenya’s Cornelius Tuwei to the tape in the slowest heat prompting the latter to be locked out. Kinyamal said he is ready for the fight but he has had a bit of back problems. “I hope they will not recur during the final. I am all set and I believe we will fight tooth and nail to deliver the elusive gold medal,” he noted. Kitilit said he had discovered that other athletes were upping the pace in a bid to burn out Kenyans. “We are ready for the race. Slow or fast, we will be with them and may the best athlete win,” he said. Kitilit won heat three in 1:45.12 ahead of Scotland’s Jake Wightman (1:47.43). Stephen Gram of Great Britain holds the championship record of 1:43.22 set in Edinburgh in 1986.
