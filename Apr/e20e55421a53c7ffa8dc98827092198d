Animosity is brewing between the Nakuru assembly and the executive. This is after MCAs vowed to impeach Finance executive Joseph Kiuna whom they accuse of sabotaging county development plans. They have started collecting signatures. They said they are unable to show residents development projects eight months after they were elected. The MCAs accused Kiuna of failing to submit budget estimates, the county development paper and fiscal plans on time. Efforts to reach Kiuna for comment were unsuccessful. The assembly on Wednesday adjourned normal business to discuss a matter of county importance. Budget and Appropriations Committee chairman Moses Ndung’u said his panel - and by extension the assembly - has been continually frustrated by Kiuna’s delays in submitting budget documents as set out in the Public Finance Management Act. Ndung’u informed the house the assembly was yet to receive the County Integrated Development Plan which the law specifies should have been submitted to the assembly by September last year. The annual development plan which should accompany the CIDP and be submitted by the same date had also not been submitted. Ndung’u said the other documents the Office of the Finance executive is yet to submit include the Fiscal Strategy Paper and County Debt Resolution Paper whose deadline for submission was February 28. finance bill Ndung’u said the documents should be used to guide the budget process which is now in confusion and uncertainty with its deadline for submission - April 30 - fast approaching. These delays, the chairman told MCAs, were posing a serious problem to the assembly in the execution of its mandate. Late submissions are a hindrance to the assembly’s proper planning and carrying out the constitutionally required public participation as the house had to rush against legal deadlines to pass the documents. Ndung’u said the Finance Bill was also submitted to the House long after the submission window had expired ( 90 days after the passing of the Appropriation Bill) and during the assembly’s long December recess.
