One person died while 12 were injured in a road accident in Narok county on Tuesday morning. The accident occurred near Katakala trading centre on Narok-Bomet road, about 10 kilometres from Narok town. The group had been on their way from Narok town, to a funeral service in Bomet, in a vehicle hired from Sokoro Wabera Investments. Narok Police Commander Thomas Ngeiywa said the accident took place at about 9 am when one of the vehicle's rear tyres burst, causing the driver to lose control. “The vehicle rolled several times before it veered off the road for a few metres,” he said. A witness added: "The vehicle flew before overturning and hitting a edge on the road reserve." Nine people, including the driver of the vehicle the group was in, suffered minor injuries while three were seriously wounded. They were taken to Narok County Referral Hospital where sources said they suffered limb and head injuries but were stable. Ngeiywa warned against careless driving and urged motorists to obey traffic rules, warning that those who do not will be severely punished. “Exercise caution as the road is smooth to avoid senseless deaths,” he said. The bodies were taken to the hospital's mortuary and the wreckage to Narok police station. The accident took place days after one which left two people dead and four seriously injured. This incident took place at Kotamugul area in Narok West sub county after a tyre burst. Two weeks ago, at least 17 people died while 63 were injured when the bus they were travelling in plunged into Siyapei river from Narok-Mai Mahiu road. The driver of the Daima Connections bus lost control while trying to avoid an oncoming lorry as he headed to Nairobi from Kendu Bay.
