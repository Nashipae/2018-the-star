Two more suspects have been arrested over a series of burglaries in several Nairobi estates. The crimes have taken place in parts including Kilimani, Kileleshwa, Lavington Riverside and Westlands. The two - Tolbert Odhiambo and Don Ouma - are believed to be accomplices of Lavender Akinyi, who was arrested two weeks and termed the gang leader. They were arrested within the Central Business District where they run businesses. Odhiambo runs a salon and matatu businesses. The suspects will be arraigned on Monday morning to answer to charges of breaking into houses and stealing. The robbers have stolen electronics, cash and other valuables which are sold to unsuspecting buyers in Kenya and Tanzania, police say. Akinyi was charged last week with several counts of burglary alongside Tanzanians Shimton Ambasa, Teresa Richard and Rose Richard.
