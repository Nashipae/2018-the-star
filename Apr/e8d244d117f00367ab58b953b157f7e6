President Uhuru Kenyatta has skipped the devolution conferenceÂ in Kakamega due to bad weather. Uhuru is set to address the 5th annual meeting from State House in Nairobi via video link. He was to open the conference at midday and thereafter participate in a high level discussion on intergovernmental relations as a panelist. But the heavy rains pounding many parts of the country made visibility impossible for his chopper to fly to Kakamega. Among those who have addressed the meeting at Kakamega High School so far are UK Ambassador Nic Hailey, Siaya Senator James Orengo, Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago. They have talked about the next steps following Uhuru and Opposition leader Raila Odinga's handshake and the relationship between Senators and Governors.
