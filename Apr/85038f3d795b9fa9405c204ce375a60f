Kakamega-based Kenya Premier League side Homeboyz’ striker Hassan Kikoyo has revealed his desire to help his side finish the league in a respectable position. Kikoyo, who scored the winning goal against Kariobangi Sharks flat weekend after replacing Keiphas Mutuu, expressed excitement for having rediscovered his form. Kikoyo has so far scored three goals for Homeboyz in the Premier League. “It has not been easy to break in the first 11 but starting from the bench enables me to study my opponents’ weak points and this motivates me a lot,” he said. “Homeboyz are emerging as a big team and just like any other professional clubs, the competition for the first 11 is very stiff and requires a lot sacrifice, commitment and hard work,” he noted. He thanked the entire Homeboyz technical bench under Mike Mururi for helping him settle in faster than he had expected. “Kenyan premier league is very competitive and stiff compared to others in this region and as young player, who is still developing, I am happy for this experience which will enable me go places. “We struggled at the beginning of our campaign but I believe the bad spell is over and we look forward to a good run in our remaining matches,” he added. Kikoyo, who falls under Allan Wanga and Keiphas Mutuu in pecking order, said he is determined to continue scoring as he seeks to uplift Homeboyz. Kakamega Homeboyz are currently placed in the 10th position with 16 points from 11 matches and face Kericho Zoo at Bukhungu Stadium thus weekend.
