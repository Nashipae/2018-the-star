Gospel singer Size 8 has made an explosive admission — her mother almost had an aborting when she was pregnant with her. Her mum, now deceased, was going through a rough patch with Size 8's dad and was not sure she could provide for her unborn child. Size 8 made this revelation on Pambio Live, which she co-hosts with DJ Ruff every Sunday. "My mother went to the hospital and luckily she met a doctor who told her of the consequences of abortion. The doctor told her that she would die if she went ahead to abort me and looking at the fact that she had other five children she decided not to do it.” Size 8 continued, "She told the doctor that it would be better if she stayed alive, so she could take care of my other siblings at home. On her deathbed, before she left us, my mum confessed to me that she wanted to let me go before I was born. She looked back and couldn’t imagine that the same baby that she wanted to remove from her womb was the same one who was paying her hospital bills."
