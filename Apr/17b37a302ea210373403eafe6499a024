Maize farmers in the Rift Valley have appealled to President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto to intervene and pay them the Sh4 billion owed by the NCPB. The farmers said they are unable to buy fertiliser and this year’s planting season has already started. Hundreds of farmers have been queuing at the NCPB depots in the North Rift waiting to deliver more maize. “Farmers are now desperate and there will be a crisis in the region when the long rains start in two weeks yet farmers have not prepared to start planting due to lack of money,” Kenya Farmers Association director Kipkorir Menjo said on Saturday. He said the subsidised fertiliser being supplied is inadequate. Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri three weeks ago said a supplementary budget would be tabled in Parliament for farmers’ cash to be released, but Menjo said nothing had been done yet.  CHEAP IMPORTS Moiben MP Sila Tiren said Uhuru and Ruto should ensure farmers are paid. “We are not seeing any response from the government yet the farmers are in a crisis. We can see a drop in maize production this year because many farmers may give up,” he said. Last week, the government directed the NCPB to vet farmers delivering maize to its depots in the North Rift. This follows an increasing number of trucks delivering maize at the Eldoret and Moi’s Bridge depots. Most is suspected to have been bought cheaply in Uganda by unscrupulous traders. NCPB officials are concerned the maize owners are not farmers, but traders. The importers could be making as much as 100 per cent profit since they buy the maize for Sh1,600 per 90kg bag and sell to the NCPB at Sh3,200. “The queues are getting longer but we are now vetting the owners of the lorries to ensure that only genuine local farmers deliver maize to the depots,” CEO Newton Terer told the Star. The queue at the Eldoret depot is almost two kilometres long.
