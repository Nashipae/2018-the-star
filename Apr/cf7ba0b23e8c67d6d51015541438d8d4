One of those blocked accused the campus' deputy principal of blocking them from writing this semester's examinations for failing to heed the directive. "All Muslim female medical students across the county use veils to cover their hair. Why us?" a student, who asked not to be named, said. "It is an Islamic requirement for us to cover our hair and this being a conservative society, we see a violation of the girls rights." The students did not attended their classes on Friday, being the fifth day of them being locked out of the school. Abdulahi Hassan, a class representative, said they have reported the matter to the deputy county commissioner among other leaders but no action has been taken. "We would like KMTC headquarters to clarify to us why we are being prevented from attending classes," Abdulahi said. "Let them tell us the required size of the hijab since madam deputy says the veils are too long. To the male were told to shave their beards yet nobody cares about the non- Muslim." Abdullah decried the high level of discrimination at the school saying they are frisked at the gate while non-Muslim students freely enter the school compound. The campus' principal could not be reached on phone. Journalist were are also locked out of the school compound. Prof Philip Kaloke, the campus board chair, said he had talked to the principal to let the students go back to class. He said they will hold a meeting next week to discuss the matter.
