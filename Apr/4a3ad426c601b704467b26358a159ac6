An MP from Garissa has urged residents to take up teaching courses and be ready to take on jobs in case non-local tutors continue to demand transfers. Balambala’s Abdi Shurie yesterday said the education crisis in Northeastern can only be solved if locals take teaching courses. He faulted the Teachers Service Commission for telling nonlocals to seek transfers. “The government of Uhuru Kenyatta has done a lot in terms of security. Terror is a global threat and teachers leaving en masse will deny innocent children a chance to learn. This means al Shabaab wins and we must fight this at all costs,” Shurie said. “I’m disappointed when the TSC transfers teachers as if Northeastern is not Kenya. For this reason, I would like to appeal to locals to pursue teaching courses.” Shurie said he is working on subsidising teaching courses.
