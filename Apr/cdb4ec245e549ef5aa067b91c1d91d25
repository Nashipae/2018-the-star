A police officer was injured in a fierce gunbattle after suspected al Shabaab militants attacked the Mangai Rapid Border Patrol Unit camp at 2.40am on Tuesday. Residents in nearby villages have started fleeing. Lamu East police boss Gideon Mugambi said about 20 attackers fired indiscriminately at the camp, intending to overrun it. They were repulsed. After an exchange of gunfire, the attackers were overpowered and fled towards Boni Forest. Mugambi urged residents to be vigilant and report suspicious persons or activities that might threaten security. Police assured residents it is safe to return. “I have talked to the village elder who said residents are terrified and have started fleeing. We have enough security officers in all areas within Boni Forest and beyond,” Mugambi said. The attack comes days after Lamu leaders led by Deputy Governor Abdulhakim Aboud and Lamu East MP Athman Shariff urged the national government to intensity the crackdown on al Shabaab militants. The fighters are hiding inside the dense Boni Forest and Basuba ward has been turned into a terror zone. On September 15, 2015, a multi-agency security operation called Operation Linda Boni was launched to flush out militants from the forest. Officials sometimes proclaimed near success but the problem persists and they even considered bombing, which was rejected. Recent attacks have forced them to admit they have to go back to the drawing board. In January one person was killed and police officers injured when militants ambushed buses in Lamu on the way to Malindi and Mombasa. The attackers opened fire on the police officers who were escorting the convoy. Two vehicles were torched.
