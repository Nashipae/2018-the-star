The Wajir County Assembly has been turned into a boxing ring because of endless wrangles, even fi stfi ghts — and residents are sick of it. They want to move to court to have the chamber dissolved. Speaking to the press in Wajir town yesterday, the residents led by Abdi Farah said they were tired of the endless dramas. Farah represents persons living with disability. “It is unfortunate that our good MCAs have now turned the honorable house into a fi ghting ring and an avenue to advance their interests and settle political scores,” he said. “They need to be reminded they are the image of the county and their actions portray us negatively,” Farah said. The residents said time that could have been used to pass bills beneficial to the county was instead being wasted on wrangles. Jubilee and allies have 33 members, opposition parties have 15. On Tuesday last week, MCAs mainly from Jubilee wanted to replace the Majority leader, Majority chief whip and Public Service Board. This led to an exchange of blows. Speaker Ibrahim Yaqub adjourned the house to April 24. Earlier, the house had been adjourned on March 8 to allow members to calm down following a similar confrontation over composition of the Public Service Board. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Agency investigated MCA’s conduct last month. Its report has not yet been released. The county Powers and Privileges Committee is yet to discuss the stand-off , despite a month long retreat at a luxury Mombasa hotel.
