The National Assembly’s Departmental Committee on Lands yesterday said Embakasi East MP Babu Owino has no moral authority to comment on matters regarding the Ruaraka High School and Drive Inn Primary School land as he does not attend committee meetings. The committee, through its chairperson Rachael Nyamai, distanced itself from remarks made by Babu in the Star on Thursday. She said they do not reflect that of the committee and that investigations are ongoing. Nyamai said the committee is yet to grill other interested parties in the matter. “We are yet to meet stakeholders involved in the matter, including the Ministry of Lands, Ministry of Education, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the company that received the payment [Afrison Export Ltd],” she said in a statement. Babu said, “We assure Kenyans that we will leave no stone unturned as we unravel what appears to be a mega-scandal of huge proportion.” He added that Kenyans are staring at losing more than Sh3.3 billion through unscrupulous dealings involving powerful individuals. But Nyamayi said, “It is for this reason that we would like to state that investigations are not yet complete, and the member was out of order to issue such a statement that can easily be misconstrued as the official position of the committee”. She assurd all those involved in the land tussle that the committee will “remain unbiased”. Click here for the latest political news
