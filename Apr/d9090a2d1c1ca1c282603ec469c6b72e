It should have been a simple matter that's usually solved amicably but a cousin of former Kiambu Woman Rep Nyokabi Gathecha chose to pull rank. The offended party did not give a hoot. Joe Nyaga, Nyokabi's cousin, and musician Bon-Eye fought over a fender bender outside Mbukaki Bar and Restaurant on Kiambu Road. Nyokabi is a relative of President Uhuru Kenyatta. "I was seated inside the restaurant when a taxi guy came and informed
me that someone had hit my car. I exited to check and found that it was
true. When I requested the individual [Joe] for us to have an agreement
on how best he will compensate he refused,"  Bon-Eye said. Nyaga, who was visibly inebriated, declared he did not give a hoot about hitting Bon-Eye's Volvo SUV with his Toyota Ipsum. He pulled rank and asked Bon-Eye, "Do you know who I am?" This lead to a shouting match and the two almost came to blows. "I asked for his driving licence and he declined. I then asked for
his Identity card and again he declined, asking me if I know who he is?" a visibly angry Bon-Eye said. The scuffle got physical and Nyaga suffered the indignity of being held by the scruff of his neck by the P Unit member. He also lost a few shirt buttons. Nyaga then cooperated and started to negotiate with Bon-Eye. "I
expect him to cover the costs of the repair. I will take my car to my
mechanic and send him the bill," the musician said. The drama ended with Bon-Eye took photos of the accident, and Nyaga's ID number and insurance details.
