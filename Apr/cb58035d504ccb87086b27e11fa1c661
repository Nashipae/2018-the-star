Two children were last night burnt to death while a third one is fighting for her life in hospital following a fire incident in Mukuru slums, Nairobi. The two boys aged two and three were left in their house by their mother who stepped out leaving a burning candle in Tetrapark area. Their elder sister is in hospital. The candle is said to have dropped on their bed starting the fire that burnt the two killing them. Efforts by the locals to contain the fire did not bear any fruits. The remains were moved to the mortuary. Fire incidents are common in informal settlements and efforts to contain them are usually curtailed by lack of access roads. In January, several people were injured in a fire at Mukuru slum. Police said they tried to contain the fire that left several of them homeless. The cause was not immediately clear but it started in one structure and spread to the others. More on this:Â Mukuru slum fire leaves families homeless  Click here for the latest political news
