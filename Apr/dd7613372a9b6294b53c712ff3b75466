The government will launch the National Water Storage and Harvesting Authority within one month, Water CS Simon Chilugui has said. He said the National Water Conservation and Pipeline Cooperation will be transformed to do the job. "We are ready for the launch. All arrangements have been done. I believe within a short period of one month, we should be ready," he said. The levels of dams are declining, river sources depleting and population increasing, he said. Due to the drought and despite recent rains some dams like Ndakaini and Sasumua have seen their levels dipped to a low of 30 per cent and 57.7 per cent respectively. But despite assurance from the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company, the CS said the country can no longer rely on rainwater. Weather patterns have changed.
