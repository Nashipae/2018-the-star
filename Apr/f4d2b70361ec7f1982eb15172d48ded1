The Auditor General has raised questions on how Kenyatta National Hospital spent over Sh6.6 million on lunch allowances for security officers at the facility. Edward Ouko, in the audit report of the financial year ending June 30, 2016, said the regulations that support the payments were not availed for review. "No explanation has been provided for paying security officers meal allowances for working in their duty stations." "Consequently, the propriety of expenditure totaling Sh6,690,000 could not be confirmed," the report stated. The report also questioned why an eleven member board team spent Sh14.7 million on board expenses in the financial year under review. Ouko's report came in the wake of an outcry over deteriorating security at the facility. Early this year, claims of breastfeeding mothers being raped at the hospital emerged, sparking a heated debate in the country. Reports indicated that mothers who go through Cesarean are at a risk when they go to breastfeed their newborns. Read: Why rape breastfeeding mothers?

Ouko said the loan was to be paid at an interest of 3 per cent per year for the first six years. However, the records indicated that no interest had been paid or accrued in the 8 financial years between 2009/9 to 2015/16. Ouko said the facility sought some help from the health ministry to help settle the loan but no information has been provided for audit review. "As a result it has not been possible to confirm the accuracy of the borrowings balance reflected in the statement as at June 30, 2016 and that the balance of Sh1,199,863,000 is fairly stated at the same date," the report said. The hospital is also said to lost over Sh7.6 billion on employee cost. According to the report, the hospital paid Sh422.14 million as overtime allowance and another Sh78.11 million as staff medical out-patient allowance but was not presented for review. Some Sh238.35 million was paid as overtime and unexplained Sh183.78 paid to the hospital doctors and nurses for overtime services. "The payment of staff medical outpatient allowance of Sh 78,117,605 amounted to double payment as the hospital has also incurred staff medical in/outpatient expenses of Sh229,385,000 on the staff," Ouko said. KNH has 4,754 staff comprising of 200 doctors, 25 dentists, 14 pharmacists, 1,718 nurses, 463 administrative staff, and 586 paramedics. Ouko argues that parameters for the staff establishment, as approved by the Ministry of Health, was not made available for review. "The hospital has two doctors that have attained the mandatory retirement age of 60 years but are still in office," the report indicated. "The hospital did not get value for Sh11,597,155,000 it spent on the hot water system which only worked for months after installation before breaking down," the report further states. The report said the hospital could further not explain why Sh525,633,000 was paid to law firms for legal representation without the AG's approval. As a result the report said in the process, Sh21,341,00 cannot be accounted for. Ouko also revealed that KNH further lost Sh841,422,000 on the medical service contract out of which Sh411,777,000 relates to losses from NHIF. In terms of free maternity services, KNH lost Sh415,566,000 following an MoU with the government to refund the hospital Sh17,500 for every delivery.
