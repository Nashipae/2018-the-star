Embu Health Executive Dr Jamleck Muturi has partnered with Baringo Advocacy and Development Organization to provide pupils in his former primary school with 120 beehives. The ‘Elimu na Asali’ [Education and Honey] project seeks to prompt the standard five pupils from Karau Primary school in Embu North Sub-county to protect the environment, save money and like science subjects. The project will also encourage the pupils topl ant more trees as well as start earning money from the honey that will be harvested.
