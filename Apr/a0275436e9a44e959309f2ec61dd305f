Diversity in the mobile money lending sector went a notch higher on Friday with the launch of a new mobile money-lending app. The Cashap Investment Consultant allows registered customers to borrow up to Sh100,000 in 30 days. Directors of the Nairobi-based consultancy firm said the initiative is a reliable instant emergency loans lender that does not require guarantors as long as the borrower has paid membership fee to act as security. “Emergency loans can be in form of school fees, medical bills and rent. We will also offer free financial and legal advice, free screening on any investment, and free guarantee on bank loans," said Sammy Aloyo, one of the directors. Aloyo, a financier, co-founded the investment with Eddy Orinda, an advocate. The app also offers secured loans with no asset deposits or guarantors as long as the borrowing is within the mobile banking risk lending schedule. Aloyo said the initiative targets members across the country and offers 6 per cent annual interest on deposits. "We also target people blocked by CRBs," he added. Borrowers who default on repaying loans from financial service providers are normally blacklisted by the Credit Reference Bureau. This means they cannot access credit from any financial institution until after they clear their outstanding loans. Government’s move to cap lending rates in 2016 has seen banks pick up competition with mobile phone service providers like Safaricom in embracing mobile money lending apps in a bid to cut costs. Cashap joins other established money lending apps in the market such as Tala, Branch, Saida, Utunzi, Okolea and Jazika.
