A group of Kisii and Nyamira politicians have opposed plans to change the Constitution and introduce a three-tier government. MPs Joash Nyamoko (North Mugirango), Shadrack Mose (Kitutu Masaba), Alfah Miruka (Bomachoge Chache), Innocent Obiri (Bobasi) and Ezekiel Machogu (Nyaribari Masaba) said devolution should be made stronger and more funds disbursed to counties. They said on Sunday the Constitution has not been fully implemented. The leaders spoke at Nyamagwa and Bombaba Catholic churches during fundraisers. Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi was the chief guest. But Dagoretti North MP Simba Arati backed the changes proposed by NASA chief Raila Odinga during his speech at the Fifth Annual Devolution Conference in Kakamega last week. Raila said Kenya should retain the current counties, but establish 14 regional or provincial blocs. “We must change the Constitution to address the loopholes therein. The proposed changes are not about the 2022 elections, but are geared towards strengthening devolution,” Arati said. “Those opposed to the changes should understand the proposals, including a three-tier system of government.” Nyamoko said, “the proposed changes should be shelved. We have not implemented the current Constitution as envisaged. Those agitating for changes are anti-devolution.” Mose said the changes will reverse the gains from devolution and hurt the economy. “We cannot engage in endless politicking. We have just come out of two grueling elections that polarised the country. This country is not for another cycle of politics,” the MP said. Maangi urged leaders to work together irrespective of political affiliations. Machogu said there should be more empahsis on service delivery and the Big Four agenda. “Instead of politics, we should be conducting civic education to allow our people to understand the concept behind devolution.”
