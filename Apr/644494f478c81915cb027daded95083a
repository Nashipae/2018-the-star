Transport on Kisumu-Kakamage highway was paralysed on Monday following protests over the poor state of a road. Locals blocked the highway at the Mamboleo junction, where the road in question starts from, causing a traffic snarl up. They also blocked the Mamboleo- Miwani- Chemelil road - the one in a poor state, with stones while others planted trees. The road links Kisumu and Nandi counties and by sugarcane trucks as a shorter route to transport cane to Kibos Sugar factory.
