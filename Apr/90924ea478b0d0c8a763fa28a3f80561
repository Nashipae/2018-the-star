Akothee, aka the president of single hustlers, is not her manager Nelly Oaks’s lover. In an interview with Word Is, the mother of five said, “Nelly Oaks has not proposed to me, therefore I am not going to get into his plans. Maybe he has no plans for me. However, he is a good guy and if he proposes to me, why not marry him?” Asked about dating a younger guy, the Oyoyo songstress said “Oaks is not young”. “Who told you he is young? Furthermore, we are not dating. We are just friends but our fans pushed us to say we are dating. We are not really dating. Maybe I do not know the meaning of dating but for us, we are just pals. Just because people see us walking and working together does not mean we are dating. We are business partners,” Akothee said. “Marriage is a formality and an institution that has to be put down on paper to tell people you are together, married. We are enjoying our time and we are happy. People want to anticipate my marriage so that if we are not together tomorrow, they say I got dumped.”
