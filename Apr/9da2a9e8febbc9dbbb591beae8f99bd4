Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen openly clashed with Moiben MP Silas Tiren in the presence of Deputy President William Ruto on Sunday. This is after Tiren said he would only work with Jubilee when farmers’ problems are resolved. The clash was in Uasin Gishu during PS Chris Kiptoo’s thanksgiving. Murkomen accused Tiren of working with those he termed ‘outsiders and political brokers’ to undermine Ruto.  This is a week after Tiren accompanied opposition chief Raila Odinga to visit former President Moi at his Kabarak home. Murkomen told Tiren to stop “lecturing” Ruto. But Tiren said he would not give up fighting for farmers’ rights even after Jubilee removed him from the Agriculture Committee in Parliament.
