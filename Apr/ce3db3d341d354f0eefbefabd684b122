Carrefour has officially taken over the space that Uchumi Supermarket occupied at Sarit Centre in Nairobi. Customers were seen at the location following the opening on Thursday. In January, Carrefour opened its fourth store at the Junction Mall, which was previously occupied by struggling rival Nakumatt Holdings. The company's other outlets are at The Hub in Karen, Two Rivers Mall and Thika Road Mall. With the new store at Sarit Centre, the retailer's staff base will increase to 1,400 employees. Uchumi closed the Sarit Centre branch in January after operations of more than 30 years. CEO Mohammed Mohammed said the decision was part of the retail storeâ€™s comprehensive turnaround plan and new cost management strategy.
