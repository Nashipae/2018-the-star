The hearing of appeal by Homabay Governor Cyprian Awiti has been set to May 11 with his opponent lawyers insisting that he should deposit Sh 20 million before the hearing of the case starts. Awiti lost his seat after a successful petition by former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga. He appealed against Justice Joseph Karanja’s decision to nullify his elections. The judge found that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission did not conduct free and fair elections. However during the pre-trail conference, Magwanga’s lawyer Charles Kanjama stated that they had made an application for security for cost in the appellant court. Kanjama said they also applied for the cost to be deposited to the court and the amount to be enhanced to a higher sum to about Sh 20 million. When Magwanga successful won the election petition against Awiti and the IEBC, he was awarded cost of Sh 4 million “We are not sure whether we will get back the cost hence the application and the judges have said it will be heard on priority before the main application probably next week in Nairobi, “he added. Justice Erastus Githinji who presided over the session on Tuesday stated that the hearing of the application was moved to Nairobi as the Judges in Kisumu were already overwhelmed. “The Kisumu bench already has at least 15 election appeals they are set to hear. The matter should therefore be moved to Nairobi as an urgent one,” stated Justice Githinji. Githinji however stated that the President of the Court of Appeal William Ouko will give the final verdict concerning the date when the matter will be brought before the court.
