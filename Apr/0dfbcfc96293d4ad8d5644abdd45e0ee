Cotu boss Francis Atwoli has accused a top government official of plotting the ejection of workers and employer representatives from NSSF to loot the multibillion-shilling fund. Atwoli yesterday linked ‘a highly ranked Jubilee politician’ – whom he did not name - to the proposal to kick out Cotu and the Federation of Kenya Employers from the board of trustees.

The Bill is sponsored by National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale. Atwoli vowed to team up with FKE and pull out workers from the pension scheme and form a rival joint scheme if political interference in the management of the fund persists. In a statement, the fiery trade unionist termed the proposed changes unconstitutional, claiming key stakeholders - Cotu and FKE - were not consulted.  Click here for the latest political news
