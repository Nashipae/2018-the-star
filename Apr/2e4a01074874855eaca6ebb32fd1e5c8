Kenya Forest Service officers in Migori on Tuesday impounded a lorry with over 800 poles suspected to be from government-owned forests. The officers, acting on a tip off from members of the public, trailed the lorry as it tried to make it to Migori town to offload the poles which trade at Sh15,000. One person was arrested whereas the lorry driver escaped amid concerns that charcoal traders are using boda boda riders at wee hours to evade arrests. County forest conservator Abuto Omolo said the suspect will be taken to court once the officer complete investigations. The arrest brings to ten, cases of similar nature in Migori since the government banned logging in a bid to save trees. "We have successfully prosecuted over ten cases linked to illegal logging and charcoal burning. Most of the cases are in Kuria, Awendo, and Nyatike sub-counties," Omolo said. He warned businessmen who still engage in illegal logging and outlawed charcoal burning in government restricted forest that they will be prosecuted. The official said his office is working with public administrators and security organs to safeguard 32 forest conservation sites in Migori county.
