Senate Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen has asked IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati to lead the remaining commissioners in resigning. Murkomen said Chebukati, Abdi Guliye and Boya Molu have no option but to resign after the exit of their three colleagues. He was reacting to the resignation of Vice Chair Consolata Nkatha and commissioners Margaret Mwachanya and Paul Kurgat. "Chebukati, Molu and Guliye MUST resign from IEBC within the next seven days or we form a tribunal to investigate them [sic]," the Elgeyo Marakwet Senator said in a tweet on Monday. Nkatha, Mwachanya and Kurgat said they left the commission because they had no faith in Chebukati and his leadership. The three commissioners said that the Chairman has, in several instances, failed to be the steady and stable hand needed to steer the commission.
