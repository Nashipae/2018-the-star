Senators next week will meet governors and National Treasury officials to end the stalemate over delayed disbursement of county government funds. Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka (pictured) said they will meet in Kakamega county during the Annual Devolution Conference from April 23-27. He said the meeting will involve all parties so they can be told what caused the delay. Lusaka spoke yesterday in Malindi during the beginning of a two-day induction workshop for the Senate Justice, Legal Affairs and Human Rights Committee. The Senate is mandated to protect devolution as stipulated in the Constitution, the Speaker said. Since January, there has been an outcry from many counties about shortage of funds. Some counties have been unable to pay their employees and contractors for months. “Everybody will speak candidly on the issue so we can find out where the problem is and come up with a solution,” Lusaka said. He said the meeting will also bring to an end the blame game as everyone will be there to table their concerns. Lusaka told off those calling for the scrapping the Senate by amending the Constitution. He said such thoughts are “dreams” that will never come true. Lusaka said the Senate plays a critical role of protecting devolution. “The Constitution is a legal document, the previous Senate dealt with issues that were supposed to be dealt with,” he said.
