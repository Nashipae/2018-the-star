Diamond's official photographer, Kifesi, has quit his job under unclear circumstances. Kifesi has always been a strong supporter of Zari, even after parting ways with Diamond Platnumz, and it’s not clear whether he fell out with the singer because of his strong support for Zari. In a long resignation letter, Kifesi wrote, "Nimeamua rasmi kuacha kazi kama mpiga picha wa Diamond Platnumz na mwajiriwa wa WCB. Well, it’s insane to be leaving a stable job you love but that’s reality for me naacha kazi kwa mtu alokua zaidi ya rafiki kwangu. Naacha kazi ambayo ni ndoto ya vijana wengi out there but to me..I see miaka yangu 4/5 ya kufanya kazi hapa inatosha niachie nafasi kwa vijana wengine nimeamua kufata moyo wangu."
