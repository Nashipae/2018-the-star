The government will build 5,000 modern housing units in Eldoret to ease shortage in the town. Deputy President William Ruto on Sunday said the project will employ more than 20,000 youths for four years. The houses are part of the government's plan to develop 500,000 housing units countrywide. “We are already in the process of providing land for project to kick off,” Uasin Governor Jackson Mandago said. The two spoke at Ziwa in Eldoret. Mandago said the county has signed an MoU with the ministry of Transport, Housing and Urban Development. The MoU provides for the actualisation of affordable housing with another 2,000 housing units to be developed every year for the next five years. The project will also be part of the Kenya Urban Support Programme (KUSP). “Eldoret population is growing rapidly and the project is expected to ease the housing burden,” Mandago said. Present during the signing were County Secretary Peter Leley and the county executive for Lands Engineer Joseph Maritim. According to a survey by the county, Eldoret has a shortage of more than 300,000 houses and governor Mandago says he is worried with quick mushrooming of slums in the region. The governor has directed the county planning department to put in place measures that will ensure the development of slums is stopped. “We have now been forced to come up with something called slum upgrading projects yet as a country we can stick to development plans and put up decent housing so that in future we do not have slums to upgrade”, said Mandago.
