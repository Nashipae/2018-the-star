A woman yesterday moved to court and sued a senior Kenya Airways pilot for child neglect. Doreen Nkatha through lawyer Danson Nga’ang’a also sought orders to have Japheth Mutisya pay Sh35,000 monthly interim maintenance cash, pending conclusion of the case. She wants Mutisya compelled to provide school fees and comprehensive medical cover for their two children. The last-born is sickly, she said. Nkatha says the pilot is a man of means but has refused to provide for the children. She says, “I met Mutisya in 2008 in Dohnholm. I was operating a cereal shop. He was my customer.” She adds that their friendship turned into an intimate relationship and Mutisya would visit her house even after she relocated to Kisaju, Kajiado. The first child was born in 2012 and the second in 2016.
