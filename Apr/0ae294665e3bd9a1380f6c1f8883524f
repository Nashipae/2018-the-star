The Standard Gauge Railway
freight service received a major boost after the largest container shipping line ran two full block trains from Mombasa to
Nairobi Inland Container Depot. This was the first time
the SGR freight train was carrying cargo exclusive to a shipping line. The whole
consignment belongs to clients who had nominated the Nairobi ICD as their final
destination. The two trains, with 108 exclusive Maersk Cargo each, left Mombasa at 2:00pm and 4:00pm respectively,
destined for Nairobi. Kenya Railways business, commercial
and operations team leader James Siele said the cargo was being offloaded
straight from the ship and loaded directly on SGR freight trains. “This saves time
and we expect the first train to reach Nairobi before the ship sets sail from
the port,” said Siele. He said Kenya Railways is
now transporting daily freights and plans to increase to five trains. “We are now doing four
trains that transport 432 containers daily. Next month we will increase to five trains,” he said. KPA general manager operations
Captain William Ruto said the offloading of cargo straight from the ship to the
SGR train shows improved efficiency in cargo handling. “The containers are being
offloaded directly from the ship and loaded straight on the cargo train in what
has proved to be advantageous in terms of saving time and cost,” said Ruto. He said KPA, working with
KRC and Kenya Railways to ensure smooth flow of cargo. The national
assembly committee on transport will follow up on the cargo clearance issue at
the port of Mombasa and Nairobi's Embakasi Internal Container Depot over
the issue of inefficiency. The committee which
was on tour at the KPA said they were pleased with the cargo movement from
Mombasa to Nairobi. David Pkosing, the
committee chair told journalists at Bandari College that they were pleased that
the SGR cargo train is now transporting over 400 containers in a day. "In two months the target will be 630 containers," he said.
