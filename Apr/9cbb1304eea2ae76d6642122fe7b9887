Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has terminated the contract of Finance executive Danvas Makori and nominated Newton Munene to replace him. Charles Kerich, who is in charge of the lands docket, will serve in acting capacity until the Assembly approves Munene's appointment. Sonko sent Munene's name to Speaker Beatrice Elachi on Tuesday. In a letter dated April 5, Sonko sacked Makori saying he did not have a choice after reviewing his performance. “In view of this, your service as a CEM is hereby terminated with effect from the date of this letter. Upon clearance and satisfactory handover of all county government property and information in your custody, you will be paid,” he told Makori. The Governor said the former executive will be paid for the days he worked, up to and including April 5, a month's salary in lieu of notices and dues for accrued leave as at April 5.
