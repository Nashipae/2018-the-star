On January 27, the Education ministry announced an ambitious and well-meaning requirement for 12 million learners to acquire birth certificates to register in school. Parents had to submit documents in 30 days, an unachievable deadline. Millions of children lacked documents and couldn't register. The deadline was extended to March 31, also unachievable. At least six million have yet to register. Huduma Centres and county offices have been inundated by long-suffering parents, many forking out Sh150 or paying Sh1,000 bribes to acquire certificates. The quest for certificates has been turned into a money-minting enterprise. But staff too have been run ragged. Families are frantic; the deadline premise isn't working. Education CS Amina Mohamed needs a more realistic approach that doesn't hold parents hostage. Another one-month extension won't solve the problem as only a limited number of documents can be produced daily. Ministry, parents and teachers should work out reasonable approach so children are not locked out of school â€” even if it takes six months.
