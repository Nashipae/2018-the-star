After dominating two of Kenya’s strongholds, Ugandans are now threatening to run away with the 3,000m steeplechase in a bid to humiliate their neigbours further. “Steeplechase is next target for us. We want to win both the men and women’s title just to show you how fast we are growing,” said a member of the Ugandan contingent. The women’s steeplechase is scheduled for today while the men will run on Friday. Kenya’s women’s team comprises of Fancy Cherono, Purity Cherotich and Celliphine Chepsol while World and Olympic champion Conseslus Kipruto will lead Amos Kirui and Abraham Kibiwott in the men’s race. The Ugandans reckoned that they are currently training with Kenyans in the North Rift and they are reading their tricks every day. “From the two gold medals we won in the 5,000m through Joshua Cheptegei and women’s 10,000m through Stella Chesang, you can tell we are doing something right thing after learning from the best,” added the official. There were earlier rumours that Cheptigei was planning to double up in steeplechase as they seek to open the gap against Kenya on the medal table but the Kenyans dismissed the move as hot air. However, one of the Kenyan coaches, Joshua Chelanga assured Kenyans that the country’s gold rush starts today with the women’s 3,000m steeplechase. “We have no competition in steeplechase and as much as Ugandans may have rising steeplechasers, they are no match for us. Let them watch as we sweep the board. They should be contended with the two gold medals they won and should count themselves lucky,” he added.
