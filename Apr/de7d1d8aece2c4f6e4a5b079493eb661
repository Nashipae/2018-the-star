Coffee prices declined in the first half of the 2017-18 financial year, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange has said. They fell from Sh11.9 billion to Sh10.5 billion. NCE chief executive officer Daniel Mbithi said coffee earnings recorded a decline of 11.47 per cent between October and end of March, compared to the same period last year. The earnings went down from Sh11.9 billion registered between October and March 2016-17 to Sh10.5 billion for the current crop year. Mbithi attributed the decline to a slight drop in volumes offered compared to the same period ending in March last year. “This may have been caused by the lower prices experienced during this period compared to the same time last year, leading to more coffee being withdrawn from the sales,” he said. Mbithi said the price of a 50kg bag of coffee declined from Sh26,595.32 to Sh24,926.80 during the 2016-17 October-March production period. “International prices have been at their lowest for the last two to three years, but prices at the Nairobi Coffee Auction held firm due to quality of the beans, especially from the Mt Kenya region, which have been fetching high prices since the beginning of the current coffee year,” he said. Grade AA fetched the highest price of Sh67,900 (US$679 ) during 2017- 18 period, though it was a decrease of 9.6 per cent compared to maximum price of Sh75,100 recorded in a similar period in 2016-17 coffee year. The volumes of 60kg bags also declined by 20,592 bags from 365,412 bags in 2016-17 period to 344,820 bags in 2017-18 production period.  FINE ARABICA COFFEE Some of the farmers’ cooperative societies that fetched the highest prices during the review period include Gititu Society in Kiambu county, Kiangai, Karimikui and Aguthi in Kirinyaga county. Mbithi said Kenyan coffee is highly sought after in the international market. Kenya is known globally for producing fine Arabica coffee that fetches premium prices, locally and internationally. It is used for blending other coffee. There is a huge market in the US and other countries around the world. The government plans to increase coffee exports to the US to more than 25 per cent from the current less than 10 per cent, an Agriculture and Food Authority official said.
