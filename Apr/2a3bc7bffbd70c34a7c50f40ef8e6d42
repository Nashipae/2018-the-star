She wrote: "I think it's high time parents consider dividing land for a girlchild just in case things don't work out! I Esther Akoth Kokeyo has divided land for my 3 daughter's Each one of them has 3 acres! "As their birthday gifts as they graduate from being children, they can build their homes and develop the rest ! I will not build houses for them that's spoon feeding which is dangerous, I am investing in their education so that they get good background of having an independent mind, get employed or self employment, save and build their homes !
