The government wants residents to plant 31.6 million indigenous trees to conserve the Mau Forest and water tower. Planting is to start in this rainy season. Chief Administration Secretary in the Environment ministry, William Kiprono, on Tuesday urged residents and schools within the Mau complex to plant more trees. The national and the county governments will supply seedlings, he said. Kiprono also warned residents in the Mau Forest against cutting trees. The forest is home to over 700,000 people. A 90-day logging moratorium has been in place since February 24. “It is a Godly requisite that mankind should take good care of the environment, so it’s obligation for every person to conserve the forest by planting more trees,” he said. The former Kenya Wildlife director represented Environment CS Keriako Tobiko at a conservation event at Maji Mazuri in Eldama-Ravine, Baringo county. President were Baringo Governor Stanley Kipis and deputy conservator of the Mau complex Patrick Kariuki. Kiptis said the county ensure forest cover reaches the target of 1,800 hectares ( 4,447 acres ). He said counties should conserve forests and reduce consumption. “It is impossible to task counties with forest conservation, but at the end of the day they don’t collect any revenue from it and the people also do not benefit with anything” he said. In 2007, hundreds of residents were evicted from the Mau Forest, following a government order to reclaim forest cover and its environs. Large swathes of forest were destroyed by agriculture, livestock raising, logging, illegal encroachment and settlement. This contributed to drought, rivers drying and changing rain patterns. The logging moratorium was imposed to allow assessment of forest damage and recommendations on conservation. Forest cover is seven percent, the goal is to achieve 15 per cent by 2022.
