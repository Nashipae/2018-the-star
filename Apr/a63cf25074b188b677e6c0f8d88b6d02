There was drama at Young Muslim Secondary School in Garissa on Friday when a group of people displaced by floods confronted leaders who toured the area. Angry residents did not want Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa, Garissa Governor Ali Korane, Garissa Township MP Aden Duale, and Chief Administrative Secretary for Devolution Hussein Dado to address them. They blamed the government for the spillage of water from Kiambere, Kamburu Gitaru, and Kindaruma dams. KenGen released excess water from the dams. On Wednesday, Garissa county commissioner Joshua Chepchieng’ urged residents living along Tana River move to higher ground after it burst its banks. Residents protested that despite their suffering, the government has done little to help. Authorities have not provided clean water, food or shelter, they said. “We spend two nights in the cold without government officials visiting us. We they finally came they brought a few bags of rice. How will this be distributed?An angry elder asked the leaders. “If you want to assist us, then do so properly. If you are here for a publicity stunt, just to be pictured distributing relief food, then we are not interested.You can as well go back with it.” Finally, when the crowd calmed down, Wamalwa promised to raise the KenGen issue with Energy CS Charles Keter to find a lasting solution. Duale and Korane threatened to sue the firm. “We will ask for Sh40 billion from KenGen for damages,” they said
