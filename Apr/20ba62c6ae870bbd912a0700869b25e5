Former City Hall chief finance officer Jimmy Kiamba has lost a fresh bid to unfreeze his assets. Kiamba is being investigated by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission over Sh400 million. Anti-Corruption Court Judge Hedwig Ong’udi dismissed an application by Kiamba, his wife Tracy Musau and two firms they own. They sought to lift a May 2016 freeze order on their assets and bank accounts.

The EACC and the Kenya Revenue Authority obtained freeze orders on Kiamba’s 10 bank accounts in two separate cases. Kiamba later filed a petition to stop the two government agencies from further probing him. Justice Ong’udi agreed with the EACC in its ruling that Kiamba’s petition against the EACC and KRA is the reason the other suits against him have stalled, hence, he cannot claim the orders have lapsed. The judge, however, allowed Kiamba access to Sh3 million. The former City Hall CFO had asked for access to Sh60 million. The freezing came after the EACC told the High Court the former City Hall officer had transacted Sh400 million between January and November 2014, despite being on a Sh85,000 monthly salary. Kiamba said he had trouble paying his children’s school fees. But Ong’udi said, “It can’t be said the injunction lapsed on May 20, 2017, yet there were lawful orders stopping the process. It should also be noted all the delays in the proceedings have been conveniently caused by the applicants. “I believe the applicants ought to have demonstrated further they are in dire need of the funds.” More: Kiamba and KRA discuss an out-of-court settlement Click here for the latest political news
