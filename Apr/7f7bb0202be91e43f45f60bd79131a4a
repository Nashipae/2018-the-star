Some 137 architectural master's students at JKUAT have sued the university to challenge the change of the description of their course. The course title was changed from Architectural Technology
and Master in Architecture (Profession) to Bachelor of Architectural Studies. The first and second year master's students said they enrolled in SABS-JKUAT in 2012 and
2013 and were put on the second phase of the two-year programme upon
completion of the studies. They say everything was going well until late 2017,
when the class of 2012 enrolled for two years of the master's pragramme and
they found out the two classes would graduate with a
Bachelor of Architecture.
