Daystar University acting vice chancellor James Kombo yesterday ordered the indefinite closure of the institution’s Athi River and Nairobi campuses following student unrest. Kombo, who is also the chairman of the university Senate, issued a memo directing all students to leave the facility’s premises by noon yesterday. “The Senate consequently asks both students and staff to vacate both Nairobi and Athi River campuses by the indicated time. International students residing in Athi River campus are instructed to vacate and report to a designated desk in Nairobi by 2pm,” the memo reads. The students on April 5 boycotted classes demanding the resignation of vice chancellor Timothy Wachira over alleged mismanagement of funds and poor leadership. Wachira was sent on sabbatical leave in December after students boycotted classes and exams. Student leaders and the senate were to meet last week on Wednesday to discuss the contents of an audit report on financial management, but the meeting failed to take place. Police on Wednesday night stormed a meeting taking place on the seventh floor of the DAC Building at the university’s Valley Road campus and threw tear gas canisters at the students. Kombo said the council has shown commitment to getting to the bottom of the issues raised by students. He said the report was released to the vice chancellor on April 8. “We held a meeting yesterday [Wednesday] to try and unclog the existing stalemate and we discovered that the issue is touching on indiscipline and class attendance among students as well as staff,” Kombo said. Student leaders said they have been threatened and told they will be “dealt with”. Student president Alloys Otieno said the Wednesday night meeting had been successful until the police came in.
