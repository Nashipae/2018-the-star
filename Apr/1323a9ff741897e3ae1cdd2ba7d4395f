Deputy President William Ruto on Saturday will visit Kakamega for the second time in just over a month. Ruto was in Kakamega on March 3 for Sports and Heritage CS Rashid Achesa’s homecoming in Mumias West subcounty. This weekend he will attend the homecoming party of Education CS Amina Mohammed at Township Primary School in Kakamega town. Ruto has toured parts of Western, Coast and Central since assuming office for a second term as DP. Analysts say he may be laying the ground for his 2022 presidential bid. The homecoming organising committee led by Moi University chancellor Miriam Were yesterday said it is unclear whether President Uhuru Kenyatta will attend. Committee secretary Raphael Welimo said, “We have mobilised more than 10,000 people to attend the event. Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya will be the host.” The team is made up of Jubilee and NASA politicians, Kuppet, Knut, Kepsha officials and religious leaders. Leaders said they expect Ruto to unveil the government’s development agenda for the region for the next five years. Lugari MP Ayub Savula said residents expect Ruto to give the official government position on the ailing Mumias Sugar Company. They also want his views on the tarmacking of Lurambi-Nambacha-Misikoma and Turbo-Sikhendu roads, which has stalled for two years. Shinyalu MP Justus Kizito said he expects the DP to preach peace and not politick.
