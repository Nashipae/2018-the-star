Police are investigating circumstances around the forceful eviction of a woman from Buruburu police lines in Nairobi. The NPS took action after a video emerged, showing the woman in a scuffle with two police officers. In the video, a policeman and policewoman manhandle their colleague’s wife and are seen dragging her down the staircase of an apartment building. "The woman in the video is said to be the wife of Constable Charles Ochieng. The constable deserted duty as from January 12. A warrant for his arrest was obtained on January 31 and is still in force," the NPS said in a tweet on Monday. The service explained that the woman was allowed to continue living in the house until the closure of schools at the end of the first term of study. Police reported that the woman claimed she did not know where Ochieng was. "The claim that the officer was hospitalised is not known to us. The family has not reported his whereabouts since January," another tweet read. "We are investigating the matter to establish the whereabouts of the officer and possibly have him taken to hospital for medical checkup." Click here for the latest political news
