Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti on Monday suspended 309 workers after a three month audit report revealed they were irregularly hired. The county payroll manager Joseph Omondi was also suspended for allegedly authorizing payments to people who do not merit earning public funds. Awiti said the irregular payments had culminated in cash ending up in the hands of people who do not work for the county. “The report realized serious misuse of funds in the county and cannot be entertained anymore. We’re sending them home to pave way for further investigations,” he said. A taskforce, led by the county deputy secretary James Mokaya scrutinised a total of 640 staffs from January. The audit revealed that the county had been paying 104 ghost workers and a total of 169 workers lacked appointment letters and could not explain how their names ended up in the county payroll. Twenty-six workers were also employed for positions above their academic credentials. The remaining workers were found with various anomalies including using forged academic documents. The county had stopped paying salaries to the workers during the scrutiny and demand they prove how they got their contracts. The governor, however, said the 227 workers whose contracts were validated by the audit will be paid. Awiti, who was flanked by his deputy Hamilton Orata, and his cabinet said the suspension of workers came from all departments, adding that there have been rising wage bill in the previous two financial years. The county spends 45 per cent of its revenue on salaries as opposed to the required 35 per cent as stipulated in PFM Act. The cabinet also resolved to formed another taskforce to investigate disparities on salaries and wages earned by employees in the area. Orata said the action was taken as a way of fighting corruption warning residents against politicising the move.
