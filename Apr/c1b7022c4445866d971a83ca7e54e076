Lugari MP Ayub Savula has dismissed the 14-member team formed by President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA chief Raila Odinga. The team is meant to champion the unity deal between the two leaders. But Savula (pictured) said on Saturday forming such a task force is a waste of time. He added that Kenyans are united and coexist peacefully. “The differences caused by personal egos between the Luos and the Kikuyus must not be extrapolated to the entire Kenyan citizenry in pursuit of personal interests,” he said.
