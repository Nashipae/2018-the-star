The hearing of a judicial inquest into British tycoon Harry Veeversâ€™s death has been set for September. Resident magistrate Charles Ndegwa said the inquest will be heard for three days. The inquest started in 2016 but encountered many problems. A magistrate was forced to bow out after her clerk was accused of intimidating one party. Five years down the line,the remains of the tycoon who had vast interests in real estate still lie at the Coast General Hospital morgue in Mombasa. After divorcing his first wife Marvis Florence, Veevers moved to Kenya in the early 1990s and married a Muslim woman.
