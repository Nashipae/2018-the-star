Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Murithi on Friday warned over anticipated increase in wage bill as hundreds of civil servants are set to vacate in the next three years as they attain the mandatory retirement age of sixty years. Muriithi said his administration might suffer pressure in the wage bill if they would resolve to employ new employees adding that those set for retirement by 2020 represents 25 per cent of the total 1800 employees. “It will be very expensive to hire and train new staff when the old ones totaling 450 are still in office. It is a big challenge for us to have an orderly transition when so many people are leaving the public service but we will find the way out,” Muriithi told journalists. If the county chooses to go for recruitment, there would be a challenge in the increase of wage bill from the current Sh2.7billion which has in the past eaten into development funds. The county boss noted that the looming retirements would have far reaching repercussions adding that agriculture department would be the most affected. “There is a big gap due to lack of no mid- level officers. Agriculture department might experience a shortfall in the extension services after the government stopped employing middle level officers in the 90s.” The county chief noted that digitization of staff appraisal forms could ease access by supervisors so that the many service gaps in the system could be addressed. However he said his efforts to make changes in his administration has been frustrated by the public service board noting that they ought to be proactive to ensure there is no vacuum in the public service sector.
