Chesoi-Kapsowar road in Marakwet has been covered by mudslide debris while a bridge on Chesongoch-Tot in Kerio Valley was destroyed by floodwaters. Rainwater from the Kerio escarpments aswept away two cows in Murkutwo on Tuesday evening. Area chief Abraham Yano yesterday said residents in the Valley fear for landslides as the rains persist. “The situation here is getting worse every day. The rains have paralysed transport and cut off water supplies,” he said.
