The High Court has declined to issue orders to reinstate Ezra Chiloba back to work. In his ruling, Justice Steve Radido said Chiloba will not suffer any prejudice if he serves the three months compulsory leave. "During the three months compulsory leave there's no suggestion that Chiloba will be deprived of his salary and remuneration, "Radido ruled. The judge further noted that the petition shows that there is a complex clash between Chiloba and some of the commissioners and he needs to hear both parties before issuing any orders. Chiloba moved to court on Thursday to block his suspension after being sent on compulsory leave on Monday over alleged procurement flaws. He wanted temporary orders to allow him to resume work. In his suit papers, Chiloba named IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati, commissioners Abdi Guliye, and Boya Molu as respondents.
