Retired President Mwai Kibaki and Opposition leader Raila Odinga are meeting in Muthaiga, Nairobi, and will issue a statement at around 1pm. It is not clear what they are discussing but Raila has met leaders such as former President Daniel arap Moi and discussed the state of the nation as well as the 2022 election with them. The meetings followed his handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta at Harambee House on March 9. After the lengthy and deadly 2017 elections seasons, the two resolved to unite and push for peace, unity and development. The truce between Uhuru and Raila and the meeting on April 12, between Raila and Moi, are shifting the political landscape. The country is in campaign mode four years too soon. A suspected clandestine deal among the Kenyatta, Moi and Odinga families, if it takes shape, would be a powerful force in 2022, a juggernaut crushing competitors. With Uhuru exiting and Raila indicating he might not run for State House, politicians are trying to sense which way the wind is blowing and positioning themselves as potential heirs. The scheming and expected betrayal back-stabbing are reminiscent of the Jomo Kenyatta, Moi and Kibaki succession wars.
