Three suspected robbers were shot dead on Sunday night after a gang broke into a godown in Kamakis area, Ruiru. Kiambu county police coordinator Adiel Njagi said the gang cut through an electric fence and then scaled a wall. They tied up watchmen before stealing items, including cosmetics, that belonged to Nice & Lovely. The robbers loaded the items onto a truck that belonged to the factory as their accomplice waited in another one. The CEO of the company learned of the attack through CCTV and called police; the three were killed in an exchange of fire. The driver of the second truck fled in the vehicle but police pursued him. A suspect was arrested and an AK 47 rifle found. Three months ago, robbers broke into the godown and stole goods and three trucks, items which were not recovered.
