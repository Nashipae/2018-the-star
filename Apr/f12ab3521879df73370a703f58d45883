The National Environment Management Authority will approve performance trials for genetically modified cotton by next month. Chief compliance officer Margaret Njuki yesterday said they are waiting for feedback from the public before they can give a go-ahead. Last month, Nema issued a Gazette notice to the public to submit comments on an environmental impact assessment for the proposed national performance trials on genetically modified cotton at nine sites. The sites proposed for the field test include Mwea, Katumani, Kampi ya Mawe, Bura, Perkerra, Kibos, Alupe, Barwessa and Matuga. The GM cotton variety is resistant to the bollworm, which lowers the crop’s productivity by 50 to 90 per cent. “Nema invites members of the public to submit oral or written comments within 30 days to assist in decision-making,” the notice read. Simon Gichuki from the Kenya Agriculture and Livestock and Research Organisation said yesterday the initial plan was to start the NPTs this month to target the long rains. But due to the delay in approval, some areas such as Kampi ya Mawe, Katumani and Matuga may miss out because of the “erratic” weather condition. He spoke during an Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology in Nairobi. Rajeev Arora, an adviser on textile value chain at the ministry of Industry and Trade said a cotton task force was formed last year to ensure the implementation of a roadmap that will be in operation for the next five years. “The plan is to initially develop cotton using hybrids and conventional seeds and, by 2019, to grow Bt cotton after its commercialisation, which will have three times production yield compared to present conventional varieties,” he said. Arora said production will take place in more than 494,210 acres in the five years. Last year, cotton production stood at about 30,000 bales of lint against a potential of 368,000.
