Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni wa Muchomba has accused the police, chiefs and their assistants of abetting the brewing and sale of illicit liquor. She yesterday reaised concerns about the upsurge of drug abuse and alcohol consumption in Gatundu. She spoke at Wamwangi Secondary School where she presided over post-Easter celebrations for the elderly organised by Family Live and Educators and Counsellors. Wa Muchomba said while the police and chiefs have arrested suspected alcohol and drug dealers, what is taken to court as exhibits is just a fraction of the haul. She said the rest finds its way back into the hands of the same dealers. “We expect to see burning of confiscated illegal drugs in public,” she said.
