Hundreds of passengers on Sunday night were stranded for hours at Kainuk Bridge along the border of West Pokot and Turkana counties. The passengers using the Kitale-Lodwar highway were unable to cross the Kainuk bridge due to raging floods. The floods almost swept away a lorry and swamped the bridge, forcing the passengers to wait in the cold for the waters to recede. According to some passengers the volume of water kept increasing as the heavy rains continue to pound the area. The bridge has been repaired two times by KeNHA, most recently in November 2017. Lorry driver Paul Ndungu caught in the snarl-up said he will incur a Sh30,000 loss. He said is goods will go bad. “I am carrying vegetables, tomatoes and bread. I have been here for almost 14 hours and there are no signs of us crossing to the other side.” “How about those people in Lodwar town? They will have nothing to eat be cause all vehicles supplying food are blocked on the other side,” Ndungu said. James Kisike, who was traveling to Kalimongor from Kapenguria on the Mwanake bus, said he was caught up in the mess at 3am when they were just approaching the bridge. Some passengers had nothing to eat. Passengers and drivers urged the government to build a permanent bridge, saying that bridge has been collapsing every rainy season. They demanded a durable solution. Last week, residents in Wathorego in Kisumu East were counting their losses after heavy rains swept away crops and animals. The bridge connecting Kajulu East and Kajulu West was also partially washed, paralysing transport.
