Sensational national women’s volleyball team setter Jane Wacu is undergoing FIVB Coaching Course Level 1 away in Seychelles. Wacu, who is attached to club Anse Royale (ARSU), said she saw it fit to undergo the five-day course in order to add knowledge to her playing career. “It feels good when you learn coaching ropes while still a player. This is why I decided to make use of the opportunity here in Seychelles,” said Wacu. She said: “Playing and coaching go hand in hand and I believe I will be at a better place when the course ends on Friday. I knows the knowledge I will get here will go a long way in helping me when I finally quit playing.” Meanwhile, Kenya will field teams (boys and girls) in the next month’s Zone 5 African Youth Championship in Uganda. The qualifier, which will bring together five nations including hosts Uganda, Kenya, South Sudan, Egypt and Rwanda, will see the top teams in each gender represent the zone in African Youth Championship in Algeria in July. Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) first vice chairman, Martin Makokha, confirmed Kenya will send teams to the qualifiers. “The teams are currently training at the YMCA and they are set to break camp on Friday as the players will be reporting back to school next week. As we are aware, these are players who have been drawn from different schools across the nation and its only fair that they also attend classes,” said Makokha. “But we will be talking to their respective school principals to see if we can assemble again for 10 days prior to teams departure to tighten the lose ends.” The qualifiers are set for May 23-27 and it will feature boys who were born January 1,2001and girls born January 1,2002. The girls are under the stewardship of former international Cathrine Mabwi and Kwanthanze Secondary school coach Justine Kigwari, while Moses Lukorito and William Kemboi will guide the boys.
