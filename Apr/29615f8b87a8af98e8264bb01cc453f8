Businesses will bear the brunt as the last Uchumi Supermarket in Mombasa was locked after the landlord evicted the retailer over a Sh12 million rent debt. Businessmen who had their personal businesses near the supermarket, among them shoes and water business, will be required to look for new rental places after their relationship with the retailer ended on Tuesday. Speaking to the Star, one of the businessmen affected, who did not want to be named, said they were given a notice by the supermarket that they should move their merchandise as the supermarket was facing eviction. “We were notified by the supermarket to remove our stock,” the businessman said. On Tuesday, the branch manager watched helplessly as goods worth millions, including carpets, bottled drinks, fresh loaves of bread, cosmetics, vegetables along with the shelves were carted away in a truck after hired youths loaded the stuff on trucks and even l helped themselves to some of the edible goods. The auctioneer’s spokesman Tom Nyandika said they will await decision from courts on whether the supermarket will manage to pay and take the stock back. “They had been given 14-day notice as the law requires but they said they needed two to three more months but still they have not complied,” he said. Uchumi has so far seen 24 of its branches closed across the country. In February, the retailer closed its Sarit Centre branch after more than 30 years. Efforts to reach the branch manager were futile, but his junior said his boss was not in a position to speak to the media.
