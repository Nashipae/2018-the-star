A man pretending to be mentally ill and another posing as a boda boda rider are among four being held by Ol Kalou police for drug peddling and abuse. The four were arrested on Saturday evening in the CBD. Maina Kimaru, 34, was found in possesion of 165 rolls of bhang, and Sh3,500 believed to be proceeds of the trade. He poses as a boda boda rider, but uses his motorbike to peddle the drug. Teresiah Wanjiru, who is between 25 and 29 years old, was arrested with 700g of bhang. Nyandarua Central police boss Wilson Kosgei yesterday said Wanjiru has been on officers’ radar for months. Bhang user Danson Njoroge was found with five sticks which he bought from Kimaru. Police pounced on him as the drug was being delivered. The fourth suspect, Samuel Wanjiru, 36, is from Rurii. Police said he peddles hard drugs. His arrest shocked residents because he masqueraded as a mentally ill person. He walked around town barefoot and begged for food in hotels. “We got one man whom people in Ol Kalou believe has a mental problem. Ni kaa chizi (he is like a mad man),” he said Wanjiru was found in a shop believed to be a drug den. The front has a pool table set up, but at the back, youths chew miraa and muguka all day long. Wanjiru was found with Sh33,900 and the notes were folded many times. “When you see him, you think he is mentally sick. Our own assessment is that there is a drug baron who is using this guy,” Kosgei said. “Where we found him is a den of drugs.”
