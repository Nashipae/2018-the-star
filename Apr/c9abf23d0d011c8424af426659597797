Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati will face an uphill task working withÂ  county Public Service Board members he has been at loggerheads with. This is after a court last week reinstated it after months of a legal tussle . Wangamati had accused the board of graft. The Employment and Labour Relations Court on Thursday ordered the six to resume work immediately. They are: Gideon Sirai, Janet Manyasi, Elizabeth Wanyonyi, Peter Masengeli, Steven Wesonga and Bonvenja Wasikoyo. The six had filed an interim application to prevent their termination as the hearing continues. Justice Nduma Nderi ruled the county government has no mandate or jurisdiction to disband the board or fire members. He ruled they were wrongfully dismissed and should be reinstated and paid their salaries.
