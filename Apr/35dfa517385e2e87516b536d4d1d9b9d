There is an increase of school children in gold mines in Migori county. The mines pose a major threat to education in the region as scores of students skip school to look for work. Since schools are closed for holidays children are not afraid of being arrested and or of non-governmental organisations that fight against child labour. They have not invaded the mines in full swing. They are attracted by quick money. Many of them come are driven to the mined by poverty despite risks of mines collapsing and dangers to their health. At Kehancha gold mines in Kuria West, children help their parents to sift ore for gold or they help in digging the tunnels. “I am assisting my parents to take care of the family, I am afraid I may drop out of school if I don’t go to the mines during the holidays,” Victor Mwita, not his real name, said. The Class Five pupil at the neighbouring Kehancha Primary School, where he dropped out for weeks in first term to work in the mines, said he worked with three girls - his school mates. The situation is the same in Macalder and Masara mines in Nyatike and Suna West as well as Komito and Kanyasrega Nyokal mines in Rongo and Awendo. Childrens’ rights activist Japhet Olima blamed mine owners for hiring children. Click here for the latest political news
