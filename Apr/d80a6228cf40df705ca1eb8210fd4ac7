The Foreign Affairs ministry is in the process of changing its programmes to deliver on President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda. Chief Administrative Secretary Ababu Namwamba yesterday told the Star the ministry was working on an elaborate programme to align all diplomatic missions with the agenda. The ministry aims to strengthen ties with other countries. Namwamba said the move was key in realising the favourable climate and resources to deliver on the Big Four. The ministry will, later this year, host an international conference for stakeholders and build lasting relationships. “For instance, considerable work is going on in building partnerships in preparations for the historic Blue Economy Conference to be hosted by President Uhuru Kenyatta later this year. It is part of the efforts to broaden and deepen the manufacturing and food security agenda,” Namwamba said. The government was already working on the programme to successfully host the event. “We are looking at an avenue where all investors, farmers, professionals and consumers among others come together to discover opportunities and exploit ways of working together in a one shop stop setting,” a source told the Star. The ministry will also liaise with others to audit points of production to provide a chain for easy markets globally. Uhuru’s Big Four agenda include universal healthcare, affordable housing, manufacturing and food security. “Specific projects should be expected across board. We want an aggressive and sustained value addition in the production chain for leather, textiles, tea, coffee, fish and the like,” Namwamba said. The ministry is also looking for partnerships that embrace modern housing technology within the frameworks of the United Nations. Read:Let’s make Big Four a reality, urges DP Ruto
