Residents of Bukhowa in Budalang’i are living in fear of starvation as a result of destruction of crops by floods. Several farms have been flooded after River Nzoia burst its bank following heavy rains. Johannes Owino said the floods destroyed maize and beans in his one acre farm. “We’re anticipating acute hunger in the coming days,” Owino said. Dykes built along the river have become weak. Owino appealed to the government to rehabilitate the dykes. Last week, Bunyala Central MCA Felix Omanyi promised to table a bill requiring Busia county to compensate farmers.
