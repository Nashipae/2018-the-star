One person was killed on Saturday night by armed robbers in Munugi village in Sabatia sub-county, Vihiga County. According to witnesses, the attackers who were armed with an AK47 rifle disappeared moments before police arrived at the scene. Vihiga Woman representative Beatrice Adagala decried the increase in insecurity in the region. “We have had so many attacks. Recently in Lusengeli there was an attack where women and children were injured and the same thing has happened here in Munugi. The government should investigate why our people are being attacked by guns randomly,” she said. She called on Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to beef up security in the county to prevent loss of more lives. “If the government can deploy over 50 police officers to guard Miguna Miguna, why can’t the Interior ministry do the same to our people?” Residents in Sabatia sub-county demanded for the urgent transfer of police in the area following the increased cases of gang rape in the area. “I was offloading goods from my car when the attackers came and shot at my car from behind. They hit me with a gun butt and I rolled under the vehicle. They stole Sh1,500 from me and a phone worth Sh48,000,” one of the victims said.  Click here for the latest political news
