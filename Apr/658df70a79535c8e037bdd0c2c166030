The Nairobi water company says the county owes it Sh210 million, a debt that has made its operations "very difficult". Nahashon Muguna, Managing Director of the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company (NCWSC), said this on Tuesday and put the county on the spot. “The company has pending bills and contractors to pay. This debt by the county government is a major setback to our operations," Muguna said without breaking down the figure. He spoke at City Hall before members of the Water and sanitation committee. "The government should pay the company for its services in order for it to progress with other projects." The MD further put the county on the spot over stalled borehole projects that were to cost Sh50 million. Muguna told the committee that the national government and the company had already made their shares of payments. “The national government was to pay Sh100 million and the NCWSC and Nairobi county were each to pay Sh50 million,” he said. The county currently has only seven functional boreholes. Each of the 85 wards is to receive Sh3 billion for the drilling of boreholes.

Muguna added that rationing will continue until 2026 due to sever shortages in the main water catchment areas.
