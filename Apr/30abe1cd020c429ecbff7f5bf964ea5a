The government is set to issue title deeds to more than 3,000 members of the Ogiek community living in forests in Uasin Gishu county. Most of the Ogiek families were evicted from Tarakwa division in Kesses constituency 10 years ago. Others had been evicted from forests in Nandi county. Kesses MP Swarrup Mishra on Saturday said Lands CS Farida Karoney has approved the plan to issue the title deeds this month. Most were evicted from Kipkuere Forest in Uasin Gishu and Nandi, but have been resettled on alternative land near the forests. “It has taken long, but we thank the new CS Karoney and her team for being committed on tackling the problem the affected communities have been going through,” Mishra said in Eldoret. Nandi Governor Stephen Sang has launched the registration and documentation of historical injustices relating to abuses of land rights affecting individuals, public institutions and communities in the county. Sang said a team will be formed to get details on the injustices and ensure they are well documented. He says large-scale tea farms taken over by multinationals were originally owned by local communities. “The issue of land and historical injustices has hampered the quest for prosperity and harmonious co-existence and I pledged political goodwill and use of county resources to ensure the matter is resolved,” Sang said.
