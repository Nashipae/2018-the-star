The students want a report that followed a forensic audit released to the entire community and its recommendations implemented. "Dusa understands these are delay tactics to doctor the report and individually target students," it said in a statement. "In addition, we condemn the continued, threats, violation of students’ rights to education and protection of those who have embezzled and mismanaged university resources." The students also want a guarantee that leaders of Dusa, Dugsa and Ssadu will be safe inside and outside the university.

Dusa further asked the Education and Interior ministries to intervene "to save the lives of young people in Daystar University".
