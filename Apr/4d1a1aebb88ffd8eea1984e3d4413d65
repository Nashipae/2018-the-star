MPs from West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet counties have promised to eradicate FGM and banditry in the North Rift region. Led by West Pokot Woman Representative Lilian Tomitom and Elgeyo
Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, the leaders condemned FGM, saying it had ruined many lives. They said banditry had forced many development projects to stall. They promised to
hold joint cultural activities to strengthen peace and unity among residents. Murkomen
said gains had been made in efforts to tackle FGM, which he termed an outdated cultural practice. “We have
rich cultures among our two communities but we do not want conflicts. We don't want FGM to be part
of our valued culture,” Murkomen said. Tomitom
said frequent banditry attacks were
perpetrated by gangsters and not innocent community members. “The bandits are criminals who should be dealt with as such,” Tomitom said. The leaders spoke at a Marakwet cultural festival in Eldoret on
Saturday. Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos, Woman Representative Jane Chebaibai and Kerio Valley Development Authority CEO David Kimosop were present. Tolgos said they will partner with KVDA to set up a museum in Iten to preserve some of the rich cultures
for future generations. “We will take up the issue of the museum seriously
and have it set up as soon as possible so that our youth can have somewhere to
learn about our cultures,” Tolgos said. Tolgos and Murkomen said the cultural festival for Marakwets
was held in Eldoret town so that they youth from the community who reside in
the town can be accessed and mobilized to participate and learn from the
cultural event. The leaders from both communities praised the
current peace and reconciliation within the Kerio Valley region where fights
between the two communities over cattle rustling have caused the death of many
people and destruction of property. “As a county and leaders we will strive to build on
the peace plan so that we initiate development programmes”, said Tolgos.
