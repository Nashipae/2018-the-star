Syrian state TV has described the attack by the US and its allies as a 'flagrant violation' of international law. The United States and its allies waged up to 120 air strikes on Syria on Friday in a 'one time shot' that the Pentagon said followed conclusive evidence that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was responsible for a chemical weapons attack using at least chlorine gas. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Marine General Joseph Dunford said three main chemical weapons facilities were targeted by both missiles from the sea and fired from aircraft, which triggered Syrian air defences. The Pentagon could not confirm how many missiles hit their targets, but Russian military forces claimÂ Syrian air defence systems managed to shoot down 71 out of 103 missiles. Yet Syrian state TV said it shot down 13 missiles, which were taken down in the Kiswah area south of Damascus, the capital. Syrian state TV said three civilians have been wounded on the attack on a military base in Homs.  Click here for latest political news
