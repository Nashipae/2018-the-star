Busia Public Works executive George Okwara has sought divine intervention to deliver his mandate. He said the task at hand is difficult and Governor Sospeter Ojaamong and MCAs have high expectations. Okwara spoke on Sunday at the Uganda Martyrs Catholic Church Amagoro sub-parish. As Ojaamong appointed him, he said, “ I am giving you a docket that has a lot of cartels but I trust you have what it takes to discharge your duties diligently and make county residents happy.” Okwara said, “I will not have strength without your prayers. When I go wrong, have the courage to come correct me rather than waiting until things go wrong.”
