The prolonged rivalry between top nurses’ union officials yesterday went a notch higher when they clashed before a Senate committee. Kenya National Union of Nurses secretary general Seth Panyako and chairman John Bii clashed before the Senate Labour Committee when presenting nurses’ views on a draft Bill on a pension scheme for county government employees. The County Government Retirement Scheme Bill 2018 seeks to cater for all retirement benefits of employees hired by the 47 county governments, staff of former local authorities and civil servants absorbed by the devolved units.

He said the courts ordered the closure of the union’s Uasin Gishu branch out of the 52 branches in the country. The comment angered Bii who hit back at Panyako warning him not to introduce the matter of the legality of him being the union’s chairman because the issue is still pending in court. “We are not here for a beauty contest. We are here as Kenyans and as nurses who are working,” Bii said. Panyako insisted Bii was sacked and his position is held by Joseph Ngwasi in an acting capacity. Sakaja intervened saying, “This committee is not concerned with who is an imposter or not because every Kenyan has a right to present views.” Also Read:Nurses’ union chairman Bii wants Panyako to quit
