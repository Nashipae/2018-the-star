A Swedish woman has appealed for help to return home and seek medication after squandering her money on holiday in Kwale. Anne Rundeck is stranded at a Diani resort. She is planning to sell her clothes and phone to raise money. The woman, in her 60s, told the Star on Wednesday that her Kenyan boyfriend has abandoned her after she ran out of money. Hamisi Zuya denied the claim. "I'm a hustler. I need time to get a reliable job in order to provide for her," Zuya who was with Rundeck said. Rundeck accused her lover of six years for not giving her the deserved attention. “After squandering my money, he no longer has time for me. I’m really suffering,” Rundeck said. Rundeck came to Kenya six years ago and has been enjoying life at the coastal resort with Zuya. She ran out of money two years ago after her children stopped sending her money after learning about her extravagance. She can no longer receive her pension. "My ex-husband sold our home. That affected my address," Rundeck said. The woman has called on well-wishers to come to her aid. The hotel has withheld her passport due to a Sh50,000 loan. “I need to redeem my passport and raise fare for air ticket. It’s not that I miss Europe but I would like to go there get treatment,” she said.
