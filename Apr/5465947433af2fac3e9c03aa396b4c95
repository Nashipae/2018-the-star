Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua will today lead a delegation on a two-day bench marking event in Kakamega county. Mutua and his delegation will tour flagship projects. Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya revealed the plans during a revenue improvement forum in Kisumu on Tuesday. The visit could be one of Oparanya’s efforts to build networks among other county bosses to support his 2022 presidential bid. Oparanya wants opposition leaders Raila Odinga, Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang’ula to back his bid. Mutua will visit the Sh6.1bn Kakamega County Teaching and Referral Hospital, Shamakhubu Level 4 Sub county Hospital, the Sh 1.6bn Bukhungu Stadium, Matungu Smart Dairy project and the Khayega-Shinyalu tarmacked road. Mutua becomes the first governor to benchmark in Kakamega since the advent of devolution. The revenue enhancement forum agreed on an immediate action plan to seal revenue leakages through illegal printing of receipts and use of unauthorised stamps by cartels. The forum also agreed on the speedy rollout of a cashless revenue collection system to ensure accountability and efficiency. The forum brought together the chairperson and vice chairman of the Kakamega Public Service Board, executives, chief officers, county secretaries, sub-county and ward administrators. Oparanya has said every department must come up with strategies to create revenue and improve collection.
