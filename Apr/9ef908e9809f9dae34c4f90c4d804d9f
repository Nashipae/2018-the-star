Chiefs and their assistants supporting FGM will be fired, Kajiado county commissioner David Kipkemei has said. Speaking at Ngatataek trading centre in Kajiado Central on Wednesday, Kipkemei said some chiefs frustrate the fight against female genital mutilation. He addressed a public baraza attended by the public, senior security officials and all chiefs and their assistants. “The government has banned such practices, but the chiefs and their assistants collude with the circumcisers,” Kipkemei said. He said without the support of honest chiefs, Maasai girls will continue suffering. The commissioner will use informers to monitor chiefs’ activities. Those aiding circumcisers will be sacked. On early marriage, Kipkemei said some cultures still keep girls away from school. “The government has provided free education for children and some of you are still marrying them out,” he said. Kipkemei also cautioned residents against selling ancestral land.
