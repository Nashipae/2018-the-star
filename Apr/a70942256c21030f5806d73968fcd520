More thans 600 families at Vidziyani in Msambweni subcounty, Kwale, are stranded. They received a court order to vacate their land in a week. The residents want the government to intervene, saying the land belongs to their great-grandparents. Kwale Woman Representative Zuleikha Juma has asked Deputy President William Ruto to settle the matter. Residents said the land dispute has been ongoing for more than 90 years. Some families have been forcibly evicted, prompting them to take the matter to court. They had no money to pay lawyers and lost the case. “These families have lived here even before independence. Now they are told the land is not theirs. Where will they go?” Juma said. She said politicians willnot sit back as investors turn residents into squatters
