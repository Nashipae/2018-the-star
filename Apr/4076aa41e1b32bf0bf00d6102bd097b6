Residents have threatened to stop the Sh6.5 billion upgrade of Mombasa-Jomvu highway following demolition of houses and businesses in Bangladesh, Jomvu subcounty, on Monday and Tuesday. The contractor, the third Engineering Bureau of China City Construction Group, admitted it blundered in pulling down the structures and promised to take responsibility. Residents are seeking compensation before allowing construction to continue. They said they had not been notifi ed in advance. Rapid Response Team coordinator Andrew Mativo said AP officers supervised the destruction. “They said those who remove their structures on time will be given Sh5,000,” Mativo said. He said 15 water pipes also were destroyed during demolition. The destruction triggered an emergency meeting on Wednesday at Darajani. The contractor was criticised for not giving notice. The company’s public relations officer Rose Dorori told the Star the firm was not in charge of land compensation and declined to comment further. The meeting was attended by residents, Mombasa Water Sewerage Company representatives, Muslims for Human Rights and Amnesty International. KeNHA coast region manager Jared Makori on the phone that compensation is ongoing, but cited a minor cash-fl ow problem. “I know the challenge has been money but let us just wait for the compensation. We don’t want to stop construction,” he said.
