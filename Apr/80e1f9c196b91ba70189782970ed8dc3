Mercy Cherono, one of the most beautiful Kenyan athletes, is the latest mother in town. Mercy
and her businessman husband Edmond Ngetich welcomed their bundle of joy on Saturday, and the excited father took to social media to share the
great news. "Kimberly
Cherop. The
best gift from God this Easter. Welcome to the world, princess. And to my
lovely wife Cherono Ngetich Mercy, congratulations!" read his message. The
two-time world junior champion in the 3000 metres (2008, 2010) and her
husband, have been living quiet, married life, and photos of Mercy
Cherono's baby bump surfaced on Valentine's Day. Last
year, Cherono travelled to Nigeria to seek divine intervention in
her marriage and career, and it seems, after being prayed for by Prophet
TB Joshua, all has been well. "My husband advised me
to come here for my career breakthrough because I was having
problems with my career and marriage, too. And the man of God prayed for
me and delivered me from bondage," Mercy Cherono told the congregation
in Nigeria at Scoan. Fans of Mercy Cherono have
congratulated her on giving birth, and we wish her all the
best as she starts her motherhood journey.
