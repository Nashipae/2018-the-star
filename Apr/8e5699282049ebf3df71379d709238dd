Chief government pathologist Dr Johansen Oduor has done numerous
postmortems in his career, but the ones for Garissa University students
are still vivid in his memory. Oduor told the Star it was the most
traumatising moment in his career. "Three years down but I can recall
it. The events are still fresh in my memory. Three years are not enough
to heal that pain. It was really tragic and sad the lives of such
innocent children seeking knowledge had to be brutally terminated," he
said. Read: Garissa attack death toll rises to 147, four gunmen killed Oduor told the Star that the bodies were in bad shape as they had badly decomposed. He,
however, said the team of pathologists which he led tried their best to
identify the bodies apart from the two cases where the bodies had to be
exhumed. "This remains to be the worst encounter in my line of
duty. The extent of the injuries on the bodies was unimaginable. The
students were told to lie down and the attackers mostly aimed at their
heads and upper side of the bodies," Oduor said. Kenya is marking the 3rd anniversary after the fateful attack by al Shabaab that left 148 people dead. Two lawyers and a student were among the five terrorists who stormed the institution on April 2, 2015 and shot indiscriminately at students and security personnel.
