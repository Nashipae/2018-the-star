Two SportPesa customers have each walked home Sh10,040,195 richer for winning this week's jackpot that ended on Thursday night. Stanley Irungu and Joseph Kubai correctly predicted the outcome of 13 select football matches in the mid-week jackpot whose payout had risen to Ksh20,080,391. The two shared the money equally. "I have not slept since Thursday night when I got the congratulatory message from SportPesa. I am truly grateful to God for this win," Kubai, a primary school teacher from Meru, said. On his part, Irungu - an engineer and businessman based in Kitengela, said he is happy that his passion for football has earned him millions. "I love to place various stakes as I watch my favourite sport of football. It is nice to earn money from a hobby," Irungu said. Following this win, the mid-week Jackpot has reset to the starting minimum of Sh10 million while the mega jackpot which was last won in February stands at Sh137,535,858. The Mega Jackpot is won by correctly predicting the outcomes of 17 select football matches picked from various leagues globally. In February, Gordon Ogada - a social worker from Kibera, made history by winning the highest ever jackpot amount in Kenya when he won Sh230,742,881.
