A five-storey building under construction in Kakamega town collapsed on Tuesday night. The house at Jua Kali estate caved in under its own weight at around 11pm. No injuries were reported as workers were not on site and the building is yet to be occupied. Land CEC Alfred Matianyi said they suspect the contractor did not adhere to the set standards, hence the collapse. Police said a watchman on duty at an adjacent building alerted occupants of nearby houses to seek safety. Investigations into the incident revealed the house belongs to one Stephen Mwaniki. He is said to have gone underground after the building collapsed and is being hunted by police. Kakamega Central police boss Joseph Chebii said the owner will be taken to court immediately he is arrested. "We are waiting for a report from the National Construction Authority (NCA), Nema, and the county government for us to act," he said. Cases of buildings crumbling owing to structural defects among other causes are rampant in Kenya. Most of the incidents have been reported in Nairobi with other cases in Kisii, Nakuru, and Kiambu.
