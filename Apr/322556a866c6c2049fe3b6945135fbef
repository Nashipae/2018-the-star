Away from music and all the hustle, Nameless is married to the lovely Wahu Kagwi, and the couple have been blessed with two adorable daughters, Tumiso and Nyakio. The girls are adorable to the family, and the couple never shy off from speaking about them. In a recent interview with Chito Ndhlovu on Kiss FM, Nameless said children are very important in every marriage. "One thing I wish I could have done is I think I should have had my kids earlier. Our kids change our lives so my much, and especially how you look at life. As I always say, there are things I see in my kids that explain so much about me. Like I look at my children and say, this is exactly me, and you begin to understand your strengths and weaknesses," he said. "If it is something they do, and I know this is my weakness and I do not want them to have that, I look at them and see the intelligence of life, and the physical intelligence, which is basically, fitness, which comes from eating well to increase that. Then there is mental intelligence, which is basically things like school. Then there is emotional intelligence, which is how you relate with people. There is also spiritual intelligence, which I would really want to gift my kids with to be able to understand life well." Nameless said his children have to be able to know how to deal with people and to also remember that their bodies are to be respected. "My mum always reminded me that my body is a temple of God and if you do not take care of your body, then it will affect many other aspects of your life. I always try and encourage them to keep trying and striving," he said. "Those are the principles I want to instil in my kids' life, so that nikiwaacha, they will live a full life. A life where they touch people and they are genuinely happy, not necessarily rich but happy and successful."
