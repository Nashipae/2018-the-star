An 18-year-old Form Four student in Matuga has faced a setback after she got pregnant. The Mwamgunga Girls Secondary School girl said she hoped to become a doctor. She is to sit her KCSE exam later in the year. Although she has been allowed back in school, her dream of becoming a doctor has been ruined, she said. Principal Fatuma Roki yesterday said government policy prohibits them from expelling pregnant girls. She said that was the first pregnancy case in the school. She wants a dormitory built in the day school to accommodate students so they don’t fall victims to sex pests when they leave for their homes. Roki said the school needs to be fenced to control students’ movement and confine them in one place. Matuga MP Kassim Tandaza expressed shock at the incident and wondered why the man behind the pregnancy has not been charged. Deputy county commissioner Benson Maisori said on Monday they could not arrest the man because of his age and that of the girl. He said the two had reached the legal age of consent and are both considered legally old enough to decide whether to engage in sex. “Our hands are tied in this situation. We cannot help out the victim even though we would want to. This is because of the dictates of the law,” Maisori said. Tandaza called for a review of the law to ensure those having sex with schoolgirls are punished whether they have reached the consenting age or not. “Schoolgirls, irrespective of age, should be protected against sex pests, who are hellbent on taking the legal age loophole to abuse them in the knowledge that they will go unpunished,” he said. The MP said he will consider funding projects that would help protect girls, including building a dormitory and fencing schools. He plans to allocate CDF cash.
