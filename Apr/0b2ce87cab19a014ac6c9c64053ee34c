Hundreds of residents in Ngaremara ward, Isiolo county have been displaced by floods after a heavy downpour in the area. Ngaremara village chairman Alex Lopeiyo said all their household belongings and livestock have been destroyed by the floods, which he attributes to climate change. Lopeiyo said he has never witnessed such flooding saying the region has been having long dry spells that lead to droughts and death of livestock. "A long term solution like a dam that can be used for irrigation activities should be put up. Proper drainage structures to avert future disasters should also be placed," he said. Seventy-year-old Pricilla Ekuru said they could now contract water borne diseases due to the storm water. She appealed to authorities to visit the area and correct the drainage system. Norha Esokoni, a community health volunteer in the village said residents are suffering as a result of an outbreak of water borne diseases and insect bites following the flooding. "More than sixty people in the area have complained of diarrhea and vomiting following contamination of their wells. I appeal to the public health department to visit the area and find a lasting solution," he said. Another resident, Lobun Atelle said this is the first time since her childhood to experience flooding in the area. She said the floods swept away most of her belongings including her bed and utensils, which she tried to salvage through the flooded village with the help of some youth. Emmanuel Bahati, a resident of Ngaremara market claims with only a week left to the re-opening of schools, it will be very difficult for students to access their school as the roads leading to their schools are flooded. "The toilets are overflowing with flood water that is now contaminating the environment," he said. Grace Nakior a resident of Ngaremara market said the floods swept away her childrenâ€™s books and birth certificates that she struggled so much to get leaving her to wonder what next step she will take.
