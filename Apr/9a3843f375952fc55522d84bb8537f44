Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga is today expected to give a keynote speech at the 5th Devolution Conference in Kakamega. The ex-PM will deliver his speech in the morning on governance and accountability. Deputy President William Ruto will tomorrow officially close the forum. Yesterday, Raila’s allies said the handshake between him and President Uhuru Kenyatta has steered improved relations among the country’s political class. “Without the handshake, I could be looking behind to see who is there,” said Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya. After Raila’s address, the governors are expected to go into high-level sector discussions that will entail the Big Four agenda – housing, food security, manufacturing and universal healthcare. Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana, who has been praised for pioneering universal healthcare, will be among the panelists.
