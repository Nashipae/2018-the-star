Movements along Mwanzi, Lower Kabete, Peponi Roads and Brookside Drive in Westlands were Friday morning disrupted after floods cut off the pathways. The roads and the entire area near Westgate could be likened to a small lake as the raging waters flooded the entire place. Commuters, who had awakened early to go to work, were stranded. Some tried to use the services of a handcart to cross over, but raging waters could not allow them. “Something needs to be done here, because every time it rains, this is normally the situation,” a stranded commuter Jane Wangari lamented. Some of the residents who work near Westgate blamed encroachments on riparian reserves by private developers for the problem. On Tuesday, several homes were flooded in Kariobangi South and BuruBuru estates following a heavy downpour on Monday night. Several roads were also rendered impassable after they were flooded. According to Kenya Red Cross, at least 70 people have died and more 150,000 have been displaced by the heavy rains pounds various parts of the country.
