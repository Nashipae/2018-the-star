ACK Archbishop Jackson Ole Sapit has warned that calls to men to embrace polygamy will result intoÂ break up of many marriages. The clergyman said polygamy is not biblical and hence should not be practised by Christians. He spoke during the launch of the ACK Cathedral in Bungoma town on Tuesday. Sapit lashed at those supporting the practice saying it will have adverse consequences on families. "The Bible says one man shall marry one wife. The debate over whether polygamy can be allowed or not should not even exist among Christians." Sapit was reacting to remarks by Kiambu woman representative Gathoni wa Muchomba who has suggested that men should marry many wives if they can take care of them. The sentiments elicited mixed reactions from Kenyans who have either supported or opposed the call. Sapit said that marriage, being the basic cornerstone of a family, should only involve two consenting adults. "Polygamy is not a way of solving any problems in a marriage," he said. On Wednesday, Mombasa woman MP Asha Hussein, in a joinder on the polygamy question, challenged President Uhuru Kenyatta to take another wife.

"As a church, we only encourage sex among people of the opposite gender. After all, the purpose of marriage is procreation," the ACK head said. He urged church members to lead in efforts of spreading the message of peace and unity, especially after President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga's handshake. Sapit said communities that were torn apart because of political differences should now get back to each other in reconciliation and till their farms to end food shortages.
