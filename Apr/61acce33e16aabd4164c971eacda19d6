Farmers in Rift Valley have renewed their demand to take over ownership of the New KCC dairy company. Initial plans was to have the Sh8 billion company privatised however, farmers now want President Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto to ensure it is handed back to them. Kenya National Farmers Union chairman Musa Barno said their demands contained in a 12-point memorandum has been handed over to the Agriculture Parliamentary Committee. The committee will then table it before Members of Parliament for adoption. “The government has gone quiet on this issue of KCC but we will remind them that as farmers we are waiting for the company to be reverted back to us as its rightful owners”, Barno said. Kenya Farmers Association Director Kipkorir Menjo also signed the document alongside other farmers representatives Barno, Grey Maina, Kimutai Kolum and Thomas Korgoren. The new KCC had collapsed in 1998 due to mismanagement and political interference. However, it was revived in 2003 by former President Mwai Kibaki's government who promised to hand it back to the farmers. In July 2017, President Uhuru in a move to revive collapsed factories, injected Sh400 million in the new KCC that would increase the company's milk capacity to 200,000 litres daily. The company was drowning in a Sh500 million debt. The state proposed to privatize the company but farmers have rejected the move saying it was a plan by powerful individuals to take over New KCC assets and frustrate dairy producers. The farmers also want the Agricultural Finance Corporation to be managed by the Agriculture ministry and not the Treasury so its activities are aligned with farming.
