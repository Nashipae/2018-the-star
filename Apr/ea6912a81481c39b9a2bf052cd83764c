Factional wrangles threaten to rip apart the IEBC. The body charged with the health of our our ailing democracy is stumbling from one crisis to another, as if cursed to suffer the fate of its predecessors. Although its independence is enshrined in the Constitution, we cannot afford the cycle of a fractured electoral body every time we face crucial processes such as the last General Election, or the forthcoming boundaries review. The consequences of the IEBC's inept conduct of the last election are still raw. Though it has done everything to conceal the rot, clearly all is not well. The facade of a united commission with unity of purpose in concealing all that is wrong has been shattered again by fresh disputes attending the controversial suspension of CEO Ezra Chiloba on Monday. The six commissioners are divided; the secretariat seems to be at odds with the commissioners. Commissioners are pulling in different directions; many are chasing vested interests or too beholden to political godfathers to objectively perform their duties. The country, through the National Assembly, needs to sort out the IEBC mess once and for all, in good time, free from partisan interests that always dictate its composition before elections.
