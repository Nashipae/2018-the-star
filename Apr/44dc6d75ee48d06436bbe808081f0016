Popular talent search TV show America's Got Talent is coming to East Africa. The show is an invention of Simon Cowell. Cowell and comedian and talk show host Paul O'Grady will be seeking to look for the best from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania this November. A source close to Word Is whispered, "Yes, Got Talent will be having an East African show in November. So far, the plans for this are at initial stages. A lot of the logistics and contractual aspects of it are still to be signed and confirmed, but the show is indeed coming to Nairobi." In Africa, the franchise was in South Africa and Nigeria, which was later discontinued. Got Talent has spin-offs in over 58 countries, in what is now referred to as the 'Got Talent' format, similar to that described by FremantleMedia of the Idol and The X Factor formats. Unlike those shows, Got Talent showcases several artistic disciplines in addition to singing. In April 2014, the format was named the world's most successful reality TV format ever by the Guinness World Records. Hopefully, Simon Cowell will make a trip to Nairobi during the launch of the Got Talent East African franchise.
