Baringo North residents have vowed to protest until the government intervenes and puts an end to the persistent attacks by suspected Pokot bandits. They blocked Loruk-Marigat highway on Monday and demanded Interior CS Fred Matiang’i intervene. “We shall continue our demonstration until the government takes responsibility for protecting our lives and property. For now, we don’t see anything done,” protester Kipkemoi Toroitch said. The protest came after resident Reuben Rutto was shot on Saturday and pronounced dead on arrival at Baringo Referral Hospital in Kabarnet town. The bandits made away with 50 head of cattle. “We have lost an uncountable number people and livestock on the government’s watch. It is time we protest and call for arms to protect ourselves,” Toroitich said. Residents urged President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto to “stop the silence and take up the matter”. Loruk assistant chief Samuel Kamuren said there was a fierce exchange of fire before Rutto was shot in the head. He said the stolen head of cattle belong to herder Laban Sumukwo. Attempts to recover the cattle were futile as the armed bandits threatened the Pokot and Tugen chiefs pursuing them. Baringo North MP William Cheptumo accused the security apparatus of not being serious about dealing with the armed bandits, adding the herder was killed a few metres from Loruk police station. “Our people shall continue dying and losing livestock at the hands of brazen cattle rustlers,” he told the Star on the phone on Monday. His statement came after suspected armed Pokot bandits killed a Tugen herder in Ng’aratuko village and stole 50 cows on Saturday. Cheptumo said the attack took place a few kilometres from Loruk police station and “not a single officer bothered to respond”. He said residents and police reservists pursued the bandits. “This is a serious issue that suggests security officers are doing nothing,” Cheptumo said.
