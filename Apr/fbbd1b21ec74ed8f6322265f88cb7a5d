A Senate watchdog committee has threatened to surcharge top Makueni county officials unless they provide evidence showing how millions of public funds were spent. The County Public Accounts and Investment Committee chaired by Senator Moses Kajwang yesterday told Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana and his officers to provide documents to prove how an estimated Sh30 million in imprest was spent. Kibwana, while appearing before the committee to respond to Auditor General Edward Ouko’s audit queries for 2014-15 financial years, said he could not prove some of the expenditure because the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission was withholding the documents. The expenditure in imprest includes Sh11 million of Sh16 million Kibwana’s administration took from the county’s Emergency Fund to construct a school that was in a “dilapidated” state because of rains.
