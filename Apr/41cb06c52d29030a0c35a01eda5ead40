USIU-Africa has denied violating the rights of a student with disability and subjecting her to trauma by not fixing a broken elevator. Gathoni Kimani told a court she was 30 minutes late getting to an exam room and had to be carried up a flight of stairs, further humiliating her. But the university said Kimani declared she does not suffer from disability by ticking on the 'no disability' box in the student's medical information form. Kimani told the Milimani High Court she was helpless on the ground floor because she could take the lift to the first floor where the exam room was situated. She made several phone calls to the administration, which went unanswered, she said. At 6.10pm, 10 minutes after the exam had already started, the university sent two women to help her. She arrived at the exam room half an hour late. “In the process of being carried up the stairs, the petitioner went through untold pain and suffering due to her bodily injuries. The petitioner further avers that she encountered humiliating and degrading treatment before and after she sat her exam,” her suit papers read. The university says Kimani handed in her exam papers voluntarily and was never rushed. “...in fact the petitioner voluntarily submitted her paper before other students who were still writing their exam. From her answer sheet, all questions were attempted. The student submitted their answer sheets one person at a time once they had satisfactorily completed the exam,” the university says. The case will be heard on June 4.
