Inmates at Naivasha GK Prison will undergo voluntary circumcision in a joint initiative between the penal institution and Kijabe Mission Hospital. Peninah Kahura, from the hospital, said the initiative is a way of reaching out to the community, especially to the less privileged. The hospital will offer the free service on willing inmates as one way of reducing the spread of HIV in the institution that has more than 3,000 prisoners.Medics from the hospital wil counsel the prisoners. The hospital donated various materials including shaving machines to the prison. Kahura said they were alerted to the increasing number of uncircumcised inmates and decided to offer help. This would help reduce the transmission of sexually related diseases, she said. Inmates who undergo the cut will be monitored at the prison’s clinic until they recover. “We are urging as many inmates as possible to be circumcised. Stop shying away since it will benefit your health,” Kahura said. The prisons welfare officer, Mose Kodek, thanked the hospital for agreeing to partner with them to uplift the welfare of inmates. The initiative would go a long way in assisting the reform progress that has been going on at the facility for some time now, he said. At the same time, Kodek appealed to the communities where the inmates come from to accept them back once they complete their jail sentences. Kodek said prisons countrywide had become centres of transformation. This has made a positive impact on many inmates who have gone through the system. “When they leave prison they have acquired news skills and they can start income generating projects,” he said. Inmate Peter Maina praised the hospital for offering the critical service. He said it would help them overcome the challenges they face while behind bars.
