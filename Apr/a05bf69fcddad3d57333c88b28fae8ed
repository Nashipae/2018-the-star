The Union of Kenya Civil Servants and the Narok County Government Workers Union have faulted the directive by the county that more than 800 rangers withdraw from the workers’ union. Union of Kenya Civil Servants acting secretary-general Jerry Kina termed the move as “intimidation, harassment, threats on county rangers and infringement on the rights of the workers”. Kina yesterday said the move by county director of rangers Benjamin Tina is against the law, and he should be held responsible for contempt of court. “The court in 2013 ruled all officers in disciplined and uniformed forces can form or join any union of their choice,” he said.
