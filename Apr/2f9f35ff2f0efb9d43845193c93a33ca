Nairobi County in partnership with Kenya Urban Roads Authority has launched a tree planting project aimed at restoring the city back to its glory. Governor Mike Sonko said the project was in line with the pre-events in preparation for this year’s World Environment Day, on June 5, whose theme is to beat Plastic Pollution. “The work we have done today contributes to the bigger picture of beating pollution and making Nairobi the Green City in the Sun,” Sonko said. “The trees that we are plating here today will be a good carbon sink hence reducing global warming,” he added. The Governor said to ensure sustainability of the project, the County will provide water points for the planted trees and grass during the dry periods. "My administration will provide a water point at this very location to ensure the work we have done today contributes to the bigger picture of beating pollution and making Nairobi the Green City in the Sun," he added. “The beautification programme will assist in avoiding encroachment of people to build illegal structures on the roads,” KURA Director General Eng. Silas Kinoti said. He urged the public to participate in road maintenance and put an effort in making the city clean. Kinoti also pledged to offer assistance in road maintenance within Nairobi.
