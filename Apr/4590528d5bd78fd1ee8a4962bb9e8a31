Were was a Nairobi-based Star newspaper reporter before she married the fl ashy politician. “There is no need of staying with somebody’s daughter for a long time without taking something small to her parents as a sign of appreciation. Pay dowry in time to maintain cordial relations,” Nandalwe said.
