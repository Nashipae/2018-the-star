Police are seeking a rogue lorry driver who struck two pedestrians and destroyed five vehicles yesterday afternoon in a wild chase on Limuru Road. The pedestrians’ condition was not immediately known. The driver ferrying charcoal was fleeing from police pursuing him from Nairobi to Ruaka. The lorry was enroute from Nairobi to Kiambu and the driver was attempting to escape when he caused multiple accidents. A 90-day logging moratorium was imposed nationwide, ending in late May. Charcoal business has been banned in Kitui, Kilifi and Tana River.

Residents descended on the truck to loot charcoal. They fought police who tried to disperse them, but gave up. This was minutes after the driver was involved in the head-on collision with an oncoming vehicle. The truck collided with a saloon car heading to Nairobi from Limuru. Two passengers were injured. The car was extensively damaged. Kiambaa police boss Wilberforce Sicharahani said they have traced the owner of the lorry, who will help them arrest the driver. “Fortunately nobody died but five motorists reported their vehicles were destroyed by the lorry driver, who is still at large,” he said. Prior to the Ruaka accident, the driver is reported to have knocked down two pedestrians while escaping Kileleshwa police officers. Two cases of pedestrians knocked down were reported to Gigiri police. Their condition was not known.
