Migori county has been losing over Sh750 million annually from its revenues due to loopholes in the system since devolution. During the first financial year of 2013-14 the county placed an internal revenue target of Sh1billion which was never reached. Subsequent financial years have also been unable to reach that target. Speaking to the press in his office on Monday, Migori Governor Okoth Obado acknowledged the deficit saying in the last financial year, the county collected about Sh350 million but “the figure was supposed to be more.” “We have a potential of collecting even a billion shillings, so we want to put our systems in place,” he said. Obando said the main cause is revenue officials colluding to deny the county government the much needed revenue. “I know that some of my officers have been going around unfortunately some of them are so mischievous. They pick the money but don’t give out receipts,” he said. The governor said the rogue officers will now be arrested and retrenched to give room to others willing to serve the county better. Yesterday, boda boda operators in Awendo led by Eric Ochieng’ led peaceful demonstrators to call on transparency on revenue collectors after Obado on Monday said they will start paying taxes. The payment of taxes was stopped ahead of August 8 2017 elections. “We are willing to pay levies, but most revenue collectors are hell bend on corruption. Also the town and service delivery is poor from lack of street lights and poor drainage. This causes apathy,” Ochieng’ said.
