The Kenya Forestry Service has urged Lamu residents to plant trees in their homes. County manager in charge of Witu station John Mbori yesterday said planting trees in homes and farms will reduce deforestation. He said increased logging in ranches, community and gazetted forests is because locals have no trees of their own. Mbori said the objective of the ban on logging can only be achieved if residents turn to planting trees in their farms. He warned of dire consequences for anyone found disobeying the logging ban. “Once you have your own trees, you will not even think of invading ranches, community and government forests to conduct logging as is currently the case. You will only require a permit to cut your trees whether the ban will be in place or not. I am confident such a move will reduce logging in our forests,” Mbori said.
