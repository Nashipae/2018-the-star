Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu has hailed the quest by Star journalist Joseph Jamenya who is on a 400km walk to raise Sh60 million to build a cardiac centre in Vihiga. Speaking in kiambu town where he flagged off Jamenya, Waititu said that it was unfortunate that Vihiga county did not have a cardiac centre. “It is noble of Jamenya to make a personal initiative for a cause that will help many people and I appreciate his efforts,”said Waititu. Vihiga deputy governor, Patrick Saisi, who had accompanied the journalist, said the county’s administration supports the initiative, whose theme is ‘Your heart your life.’
