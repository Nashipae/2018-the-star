MCAs have differed with NASA leader Raila Odinga
over his remarks that they are arm-twisting governors and undermining development
in counties. County Assemblies Forum Secretary General Erick Mwangi denied Raila's
claims that they have been demanding to be paid to approve budgets and
other documents presented by the Executives. "[We] disagree with
him [Odinga] that MCAs are indicted for conflict of interest. Our roles
are clear and we have no intention to contradict them," Mwangi said on Sunday. While
addressing the fifth devolution conference in Kakamega on Wednesday, Raila
dressed down the ward legislators accusing them of sabotaging and
blackmailing county bosses. He said the MCAs are holding governors at ransom with pressure to be paid to pass bills and proposals by county executives. "In
the March 9 handshake, we identified corruption as an existential
threat. We must deal with it at all levels," he said. "We must encourage
whistleblowers. Soon the corrupt will find themselves on their own." More on this: Raila proposes three-tier government to enhance devolution Click here for the latest political news
