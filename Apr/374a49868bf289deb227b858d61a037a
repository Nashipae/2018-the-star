Auditor General Edward Ouko has asked Nairobi county to account for Sh35,330,000 spent on free maternity cover reimbursement for Mama Lucy Kibaki hospital. In the report for 2015/16 financial year, Ouko said the hospital was to receive Sh41,115,000 from the county but only got Sh5,785,000 as at June 30, 2016. Similarly, under the NHIF capitation for civil servants and national schemes, the hospital was to be reimbursed Sh9,401,377 but only received Sh7,051,900. This resulted in a balance of Sh2,349,477. "No explanation has been rendered for the delayed reimbursements," Ouko said. An analysis of medical stores transfers further revealed that drugs valued at Sh907,704 transferred from the hospital on diverse dates were not received at the intended pharmacies. "The stock control cards for the drugs specified had no matching entries to confirm receipt by the reported recipients," he added. The report also noted that duplicate stock control cards numbers 1257867 and 1257884 were maintained for one stores item namely Amoxicillin 625 gm tables. Ouko further noted that bank balance figure in the hospital was Sh32,268,064 but noted that there was no cash book or bank statement to support the existence of the reported balance. "I am unable to confirm the accuracy of the balance," he added. In January 2018, Mama Lucy Kibaki hospital, which was First Lady Lucy Kibaki's flagship project, was on the spot for failing to accord patients quality services. Patients complained about lack of professionalism by medical staff, negligence, and long waiting hours whenever they seek treatment. Branding the hospital as a joke, they accused nurses of being rude to them adding that the hospital has a perennial shortage of medicine. Other complaints evolved around wrong prescriptions of drugs, congested maternity wards, long laboratory waiting hours, and tribalism.

The county had resolved to remit an amount of Sh500,000 daily to the hospitals's maternity to sustain its operation. But an audit report for 2015/16 financial year noted that the county had designated the funds but they never reached the hospital as at 30 June 2016. "This impacts negatively on the hospitals operations and provision of services to tax payers," Ouko said. Ouko said during the year under review, the hospital spent user service fee of Sh 3,455,705 at sources on emergencies apparently as a result of failure to receive the earmarked funds when required. In 2015, Pumwani maternity hospital was said to be under performing as a sources of revenue to the Nairobi government. According to the county fiscal strategy paper for the financial year 2015-16 tabled in the county assembly, the hospital only generated three per cent of its projected revenue as at December 31.
