Senator Gideon Moi condoled with Kenneth Matiba's family at their home in Riara Ridge, Limuru on Monday. The Baringo senator posted a photo of him and Edith, wife of the late Matiba, on his Facebook page. The move is likely to end speculation among Kenyans who had been waiting for former President Daniel Moi's reaction to Matiba's death. Moi, who is Gideon's father, detained the second liberation fighter during the clamour for multi-party ahead of the 1992 elections. There are claims that circumstances of Matiba's detention contributed to his ill-health, and subsequent death on April 15. Matiba boycotted the 1997 polls and burned his voter's card, citing the lack of democracy in a vote in which Moi won. Due to his political rivalryÂ with the retired President, he refused to let his Saba Saba Asili party join NARC during the 2002 elections. Matiba died at Karen Hospital in Nairobi. The 85-year-old former Kiharu MP was to receive Sh945 million as compensation for torture, detention and stroke. He will be cremated in line with his wishes.
