The Court of Appeal has declined to have the hearing of an election petition against Turkana Woman Representative Joyce Emanikor moved from Eldoret over insecurity.
Emanikor is challenging a decision by the High Court in Lodwar to nullify her victory. Lawyer Phillip Nyachoti, representing her rival Pauline Lokuruka (ODM), applied to have the case moved to either Kisumu, Nairobi or Mombasa. Nyachoti said he had been threatened and intimidated alongside Lokuruka. “I fear for my life and that of my client. Our request is that the case be heard far from this region,” Nyachoti said.
Justice Hannah Okwengu rejected the plea. Last month, Justice Daniel Ogolla nullified Emanikor’s election over electoral malpractice and irregularities.
Emanikor beat her main rival in the race by getting 53,731 votes against Lokuruka’s 49,433. Nyachoti said after the High Court in Lodwar ruled in favour of Lokuruka, Emanikor’s supporters stormed the court premises to protest.
