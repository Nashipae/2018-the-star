Health workers in Wajir county were on Monday warned against taking part in a medical camp organised by Woman Representative Fatuma Gedi. In an April 2 notice, Noor Sheikh - the Medical Services Chief Officer, said the planned camp does not have the blessings of Governor Mohamed Abdi's administration. It was to take place at Township Primary School on Tuesday but in a letter to the woman MP, Sheikh said: "We cannot assure the public of the quality or safety of a camp that is to be conducted outside our facilities." He added: "It is contrary to the existing traditions on the setting up of medical camps." The county cited a violation of the Medical Practitioners and Dentist (Medical Camp) rules in its decision. The law requires that a camp director notifies and send a written application to relevant authorities, including the county government. The county authorities also held that health is a devolved function so the execution of such functions by the national government requires consultation. "As much as the county welcomes health interventions geared towards reaching out to the populations, its mandatory to involve the health department for both technical support and quality control, a requirement that has not been met so far," the official said. The county health department called off the medical camp until "adequate engagement and consultations with all stakeholders [are done]". Gedi did not respond to calls for comment on whether she notified the county of the plan. Click here for the latest political news
