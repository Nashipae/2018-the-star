US job growth slowed sharply in March, as employers added 103,000 positions over the month. The figure was smaller than expected, and left the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.1%. Analysts said the cold weather may have contributed to the slowdown, which was anticipated to some degree after February's blockbuster gains. The low unemployment rate may also be making it hard to find workers, they said. Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst for interest rate tracking website Bankrate.com, said that the March report from the US Labor Department, looked at in isolation, was "on the disappointing side". "Broader context is appropriate, however," he added. "The job market is widely regarded to be close to full employment. So, hiring gains should be slowing at this point in the expansion." The US economy has been adding jobs consistently since 2010, one of the longest expansions on record. The growth has pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level since 2000. Over the last three months, employers have created an average of 202,000 jobs, the Labor Department said. The number of jobs increased by 326,000 in February, 13,000 more than previously reported. Job openings remain plentiful, but hiring has lagged. Sophia Koropeckyj of Moody's Analytics said firms will have to offer a combination of better wages and more flexible practices, conditions and training if they want to continue to bring on workers. The average hourly wage for private sector workers was $26.82 in March, up 2.7% from a year ago. That was a slight acceleration from the previous month, but still below the rate of increase when the unemployment rate was last at this level.
