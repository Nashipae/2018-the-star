The UK is to introduce one of the toughest bans on ivory trade, tightening the noose on offenders in a move that could help end the scourge. It said it will work closely with Kenya and other countries to wipe out ivory trade. “It [the ban] should remove value of ivory and that’s a key demand suppressor. We will try to work with the Kenyan government and others to try and restrict the flow of the product and the money attached to the product,” Thérèse Coffey, the UK’s parliamentary undersecretary of state at the Environment department, said in Nairobi yesterday. She visited the Kenya Wildlife Service offices in Nairobi. The UK’s ban on legal ivory trade still needs to be signed into law. It was first announced on Tuesday. Exemptions will include items made before 1947 that are less than 10 per cent ivory and musical instruments with an ivory content of less than 20 per cent made before 1975.
