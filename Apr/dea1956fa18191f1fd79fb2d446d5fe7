Suspected members of the Al Shabaab terror group on Saturday stole fertilisers from local farmers in Gedo region, Somalia. The farmers started preparing their farms for planting three weeks ago soon after the rainy season kicked in. They mainly engage in the cultivation of bananas, watermelons, onions, and tomatoes. They had received fertiliser supplies from humanitarian aid agencies working in Somalia. However, a group of militants raided a village in Lower Shebelle and demanded for the consignment. The supplies had been delivered to the farmers the previous week by the aid agencies. Kamal Abdi, a tomato farmer, reported that four armed militants raided his home on Saturday morning while he was away at the farm. He said the militants took away all his fertiliser and repeatedly raped his teenage daughter who had been left alone at home. Security agents suspect that the militants are using the fertiliser as a component in making Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDS). The terror group is synonymous with using IEDs against enemy forces allied to AMISOM and troops from the Somali National Army. The residents are appealing to security agencies to intervene and provide sufficient security to them. Click here for the latest political news
