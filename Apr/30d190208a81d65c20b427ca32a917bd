Livestock farmers risk losing between
Sh34 billion to Sh68 billion due to drought and other effects of climate change, a study has revealed. The study released by the Kenya Market Trust showed  that Kenya risks losing about 1.7 million cattle which is about 52 percent of the total cattle population in arid and semi-arid lands (ASAL) in the next ten years. Mohammed Said, a research consultant with Kenya Market Trust said the huge loss is equivalent to 20 percent
of the money used to build the Standard Gauge Railway, which cost about Sh340 billion. He noted that due to rainfall variability and temperatures, there has been an increase in sheep and goat population by about 76 percent, 13 in camels, six in donkeys while the population of cattle has reduced by 25 percent. The study on livestock trends in the arid and semi arid areas, further showed that all the 21 counties in the ASALs have reported an increase
in temperature and in some of the counties, the increase has gone beyond the 1.5
degrees which is major concern and issue of discussion globally. These counties
are Turkana, West Pokot, Elyego Marakwet, Baringo, Laikipia and Narok. Turkana County
has been hit hard in cattle loss at 60 percent, 59 in Machakos, 57 Garissa, Kitui at 43, Kajiado at 42, Marsabit 30, West Pokot 23 and Samburu at 23 percent loss. Some of the counties that showed slight increase
in cattle were Kilifi, Laikipia, Baringo, Taita Taveta,  and Lamu. There was an increase in sheep and
goats in all the 19 out of the 21 ASAL counties, with only Kwale and Elyeyo
Marakwet showing negative trend. Mohammed stated that this has a huge implication in
the livestock market. “With declining cattle, it means the country might have to
import. At the moment we have cattle coming from Tanzania and Somalia to
subsidize what we are losing in the country,” he added. The study projected a further increase in
temperatures in the next 10 to 20 years and according to Mohammed will see some counties lose between 50 to 100 percent of the vegetation and
productivity of cattle in the affected counties will be low. Garissa, Tana River, Isiolo, Turkana, Marsabit, Wajir,
Mandera , Baringo and Samburu Counties will be hit hard by the changes in temperatures. “The number of livestock that will be impacted
will be higher in Garissa at 235,000, Wajir 192,000, Tana River 187,000,
Turkana 152,000, Kitui 123,000, Isiolo 121,000, Kilifi 102,000, Kwale 98,000, Marsabit
97,000, Kajoado 74,000 and Baringo 72,000. But the impact will be least in Narok
and Laikipia counties,” the study showed. "The livestock industry is quite important and for
us to achieve the Big Four agenda, we have to really put more emphasis and
focus on the sector and also if we are to realize the 10 percent increase in
the GDP. It has been projected that climate change might reduce the country’s
GDP to between two to five percent, hence the need for climate interventions in
our plans,” he said.
