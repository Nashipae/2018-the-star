Organisers of medical camps will require more documentation as the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency moves to stop illegal sale of donated drugs. Kemsa donates drugs and commodities that are at least six months to expiry date to be used immediately in free medical camps. The unused drugs from the camps are surrendered to the nearest health facility. Acting Kemsa CEO Fredrick Wanyonyi said dishonest organisers repackage the medicine and reselling it privately. “We will require all such requests to be made through qualified medical personnel and be approved by county medical offices,” he told the Senate Health committee yesterday. Last month, expired drugs and medical supplies worth Sh5 million were found in an apartment in Nairobi’s Parklands Estate. The drugs were being repackaged for resale. The source of the drugs remains unknown after suspect Gilbert Mboya escaped. Police also found medical gloves and X-Ray films donated by Kemsa to Enzaro and Inyali Health centres in Vihiga. The two items were not expired. Kemsa policy allows donations to medical camps that are presided over by either a clinic, dispensary or health centre. Wanyonyi and Kemsa management were called to the Senate to explain the agency’s donation practice and handling of expired drugs. The agency dispenses drugs to clients through an enterprise resource planning system that only allows drugs with a shelf-life above 75 per cent. Drugs with a shelf-life below 75 per cent and at least six months to expiry date can be donated for immediate use.
