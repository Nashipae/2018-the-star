Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga to go home after their famous handshake. He said the two should make way for other politicians eyeing the presidency, like him. Kalonzo spoke at the funeral of Mwingi Wiper election official Paul Mutemi. He said the Raila-Uhuru handshake does not mean ODM and Jubilee merged. Kalonzo urged reporters to stop reading too much from the handshake and questioning whether NASA is intact. He told Uhuru and Raila to step aside and support him in 2022, as he vies for the presidency.
