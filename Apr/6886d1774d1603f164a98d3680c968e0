Ten thousand fishermen and mangrove loggers displaced due to dredging activities at the new Lapsset site in Lamu have urged the government to urgently release of the Resettlement Action Plan.  The RAP was formulated in 2011 but is yet to be released, leaving the fishermen and loggers in limbo. The document outlined how much they would be compensated if necessary and where they would be resettled. The group on Tuesday protested against the Lapsset board's silence, describing it as deafening. Group spokesman Mohamed Mbwana said fishermen and mangrove loggers might sue to push for the speedy release of the RAP. He said the Lapsset project will hurt the group's ability to make a living. “The governmemt must produce the RAP. We have a right to know what to expect next. They have been sitting on that report for far too long yet we are aware it's ready.There's need for us to know: Is there is any compensation for the manner in which our livelihoods have been affected by the Lapsset project? If not, we are ready for a legal battle,” Mbwana said. Lamu Mangrove Cutters Association chairman Abdulrahman Aboud said many livelihoods have been destroyed since farmers were cut off from major hubs to pave way for the Lapsset. Thousands of mangrove trees were felled to pave way for the project resulting in losses of millions of shillings. “They promised to show us alternative areas where we would pursue our trade, but that hasn’t happened. Life is too hard and this is our lifeline. When you cut it short, be courteous enough to show us an alternative,” Aboud said.
