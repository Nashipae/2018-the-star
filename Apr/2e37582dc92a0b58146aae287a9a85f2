Lakeside rugby 15s outfit St. Mary’s Yala look to improve their performance this year at the Brookside Term One School Games today at Kangaru High, Embu. The Nyanza Region champions finished third at the 2017 national games held at Nairobi School and they are hopeful of getting to the finals and eventually grab the trophy. Coach Ken Mukok said his side is well prepared for the showpiece, where it will take more than fitness and skills to determine the champions. “Rugby 15s is very competitive. All the eight lineups are title contenders who are rightfully here by merit. There might be tournament favorites but all duels will be won on the pitch,” he said. “To reach this level, it’s no doubt that team possess the good skills level hence mental strength will play an enormous role to bring results. My team is eyeing the title this time and to get there we’ll take one match at a time,” noted Mukok.
