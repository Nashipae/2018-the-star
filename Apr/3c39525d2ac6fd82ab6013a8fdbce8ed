Kenya’s plan to plant 25 million seedlings at the forthcoming national tree planting day could be a pipe dream. Environment CS Keriako Tobiko on Saturday said the Kenya Forest Service only has one million seedlings against 25 million needed. On March 21, during the World Forest Day, the Kenya Defence Forces promised to plant three million trees at Kibiku (two million) and Ololua (one million) forests. However, they are yet to get seedlings from the KFS. The NIC Bank group manager John Gachora on Saturdays aid for every new account opened, the bank will donate one seedling. He spoke at the ChangeTheStory tree planting drive at the Michuki Park in Nairobi. Read : New forest boss vows to increase tree cover Tobiko urged NIC to supply KDF with 50,000 seedlings. ChangeTheStory is sponsored by NIC, Royal Media Services, Junior Achievement lobby group and the Green Belt Movement. More than 1,000 trees were planted at Michuki Park. At least 50 million trees are expected to be planted in the ongoing national campaign. Tobiko said President Uhuru Kenyatta will preside over the national tree planting day, slated for next Saturday. However, the availability of seedlings remains a challenge, the CS said. Tobiko added, “We need specific commitments and donations for the tree planting day so we can plant before the rains end. What is donated will be accounted for in a transparent manner." Click here for the latest political news
