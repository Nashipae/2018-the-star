Alego-Usonga MP Sam Atandi is seeking to introduce a bill in parliament aimed at creating a council that oversees grants and loans borrowed by national government. Speaking on Wednesday on Mayienga FM, Atandi said once the bill is adopted and passed as a law the council will be responsible of sharing equitably the loans and grants borrowed by the government. The MP said currently the national government skews the allocation of funds to regions perceived to be pro-government at the expense of those in the perceived opposition side. “We want a situation where the council will disburse funds fairly and equitably to various regions irrespective of its political inclinations,” added Atandi. Atandi cited Nyanza among other regions that have been neglected by successive regimes in resource allocation despite its resident paying taxes to the National government like other regions. “Every unborn child has a loan of Sh over 100,000 debt borrowed by the government yet some regions do not benefit from the loans and grants received,”added Atandi. He added that there was no need for a president to dangle goodies to regions perceived to be pro government once the bill is passed into law. Atandi added that the financial system of this country need also to be reviewed saying the treasury still determines how much funds to be channeled to the County government hence the delay of implementing most projects. The MP added that currently the budget process is written by the cabinet secretary incharge of finance and taken to parliament for rubber stamping without proper public participation. “Currently as things are constituted,the controller of budget has no say in the budget making process which is against the spirit of devolution where the public make their views,”added Atandi.
