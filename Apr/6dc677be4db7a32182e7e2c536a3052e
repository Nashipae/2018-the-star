Owners of private forests will have to register with the Kenya Forests Service if they are to continue operating, Environment Principal Secretary Charles Sunkuli (pictured) has said. They are required to give the number of trees they’ve planted. After harvesting, they will also have to demonstrate their timber products have a mark from the government and their movement permit must be supported by their land title deed number, he said. Sunkuli, who was speaking at Gatare in Aberdare Forest during a tree planting drive on Wednesday, said Kenya has exceeded its trees harvesting capacity and would have to concentrate on planting more. The PS said these measures will help the government monitor the movement of timber in and out of the country. He said the Environment ministry officials met with Kenya Tea Growers Association, KTDA, multi-national tea growing companies and major timber dealers to discuss their concerns on the 90-day ban on logging and realised even without the ban, the country would have been forced to close down the tea and timber industry in the next five years. “Large multi-national timber dealers and the tea sector rely heavily on gazzetted forests to be able to access wood and that option has now been exhausted,” Sunkuli said.
