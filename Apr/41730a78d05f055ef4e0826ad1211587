Murang’a residents have waded into the debate on suitable politicians to be Deputy President William Ruto's running mate in 2022. Locals said said of all the politicians from Mt Kenya region who have shown an interest, Murang’a Woman Representative Sabina Chege tops the list. Speaking in Mumbi estate, Murang’a town on Saturday, they said the outspoken leader is development-minded and had good qualities for the seat. Residents urged DP Ruto to pick the her as his running mate and make her Kenya's first woman Deputy President. They promised to rally behind the two. Resident James Gichuki said Chege would help bring gender equality in the country’s top leadership. “She has proven she can serve beyond the county level. Since she got to Parliament in 2013, she has had the interests on mwananchi at heart,” Gichuki said. Another resident Alice Wambui said time is ripe for Kenyans to accept women in top positions, to break the men-only leadership. As Central Kenya prepares to show gratitude for Ruto's loyalty to President Uhuru Kenyatta, he must also be ready to strengthen the unity by picking his running mate from the region, she said. “Our support for the DP is unwavering and we are optimistic he will be the country’s fifth President. But we plead with him to have a woman, our woman representative, as his deputy. We’re sure that he supports and approves women leadership,” Wambui said. She said that Mt Kenya women should drum up support for the MP for gender parity and proper representation in country. Resident Samuel Karanja called on all Central Kenya leaders to back Chege for the top job in 2022. Among Central Kenya leaders who have expressed interests in the DP's post include Tharaka Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki, former Kiambu Governor William Kabogo and Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichungw’a. Close allies of Murang’a Governor Mwangi Wairia have said he is eyeing the seat. Chege has not stated publicly that she is interested in the seat. Click here for the latest political news
