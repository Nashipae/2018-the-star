There was day and night between Kenya’s Benjamin Ochoma’s performance in the 56 kilogramme weightlifting performance and that of eventual winner, Malaysia’s Muhammad Azroy. The result was a clear indication of how poor Kenya have become in the sport associated with musclemen. Just to reflect on the results in the event held at Carrara Sports and Leisure Centre, Ochoma was last in the field of 12. Besides, he had a total lift of 138kgs compared to the winner’s 261kgs. He recorded 61kg in the snatch compared to the winner’s 117 and 76kg in the clean-and-jerk with Azroy posting 144. India’s Gururaja took silver (111kgs and 138kgs for 249kgs) with Sri Lanka’s Chaturanga Lakmal taking bronze in 114kgs and 134kgs for a total of 248kgs. In swimming, Steven Maina’s excitement was short-lived as he won Heat 3 of the 50m butterfly in 26.02 seconds. He however failed to proceed to the semis after failing to qualify among the top 16 fastest swimmers. Issa Mohammed was sixth in Heat Four of the same contest in 25.77. In bowling, Eunice Mbugua won her opening match at Broadbeach Bowls Club against Papua New Guinea’s Catherine Wimp 21-15 but succumbed to Norfolk Island’s Carmen Anderson 21-7, dropping to third place in the women’s ‘Section C’ with three points behind Anderson and Canada’s Kelly McKerihen who are on six points each.
