Western Stima face a tricky tie against Nairobi City Stars at Camp Toyoyo grounds today as they seek to extend their lead in the National Super League. Richard Makumbi’s Stima is targeting their 10th win of the season as they seek a quick return to the Kenya Premier League having been relegated last season. They lead the log with 30 points six better second-placed Bidco United and third-placed KCB. Fourth-placed Kenya Police welcome KCB at Karuturi grounds in Naivasha. Police lost their unbeaten run in the league after succumbing to a 1-2 defeat against Western Stima in Kisumu last weekend. “We don’t want to lose another game in the league,” said Police coach Charles Omondi. In another match to be played at the same venue, sixth-placed Kibera Black Stars entertain Modern Coast Rangers. At Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega, it will be a battle of strugglers as Green Commandos face Administration Police while Nakuru All Stars which recorded their first win this season targets another three points against Coast Stima. Tomorrow, Bidco United travel to Karuturi grounds for a date against Nairobi Stima as GFE105 and Talanta face off at Sudi grounds in Bungoma. Win-less in five encounters cash strapped Isibania entertains Nick Aketch’s Kisumu All Stars at Awendo Green Stadium while Ushuru and Kangeni All Stars square it out at Hope Centre.
