A Nairobi court has allowed Anglo Leasing prosecutors to take testimonies of two foreigners via video-link. Magistrate Felix Kombo granted the request on Wednesday after Deputy EACC boss Michael Mubea and Deputy Solicitor General Muthoni Kimani completed their submissions. Mubea identified two CDs containing some materials in relation to the Sh4.9 billion scandal. He also acknowledged a hard copy of a document the AG's office handed over to EACC investigators. Kimani identified correspondence from the AG's office which she sent to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission in relation to the matter. Emily Kamau, of the DPP's office, asked the court to adjourn the hearing, which was supposed to continue until Thursday, to enable her file a written application for the video-link request. She wants two witnesses from foreign countries give their evidence through video conference. The defense lawyers did not oppose the prosecution's application. The magistrate allowed the request and directed the prosecution to file it and serve the defense by April 10. The case will be mentioned on April 18 when the DPP is expected to confirm compliance with the latest orders. The accused are Former Finance Minister David Mwiraria (deceased), former Treasury PS Dave Mwangi, David Onyonka, Rasmi Chamanlal, Deepak Kumar, and Chamanlal Kamani.
