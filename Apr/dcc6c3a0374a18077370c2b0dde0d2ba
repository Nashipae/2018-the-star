Tigania East MP Gichunge Kabeabea has promised to petition the National Assembly to ensure residents are compensated for stolen cattle and lost lives. Kabeabea said he wants residents protected against bandits who steal livestock that is never recovered. “As your MP I will present a petition in Parliament requesting the government to compensate all the herders whose animals were stolen by bandits. Women have been raped, people maimed and others killed,” he told the Star on Wednesday. Kabeabea said he would lobby for a GSU camp to be set up at Ntulili to streghthen surveillance and keep away criminals who steal animals from the herders along the Isiolo-Meru border. In October last year, more than 60 armed Turkana bandits invaded Kamuten village in Laikumukumu, Tigania East and stole more than 1,000 cattle and 400 goats. Two people were shot dead. Kabeabea pledged to put microchip gadgets on the bellies of livestock for easier tracking when they are stolen. About 100 KPRs officers have been trained and deployed in Igembe North, Igembe Central, Tigania East and Tigania West to improve security. Kabeabea said he is involving the government to ensure residents get their title deeds. The MP urged residents with court cases relating to land matters to withdraw them, as amicable solutions are sought. “County and national government land adjudication and demarcation officers are on ground. We have received complaints some land committee officers who are corrupt. Four of the 22 have been demoted,” he said. He urged those planning to go to court to wait for the process to conclude.
