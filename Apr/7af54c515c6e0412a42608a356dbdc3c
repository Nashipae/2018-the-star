Machakos police boss Samuel Mukindia has trashed claims robbers behind the Sh390,000 heist were spotted manning a report desk. He said Javason Kiendi, 33, did not say the officers he found manning the desk at Machakos police station were the same people who robbed him. Mukindia said the robbery victim was misquoted by a section of the print and social media and that he (Kiendi) was only comparing the robbers with the officers. A police report showed that Kiendi reported the robbery incident at Machakos police station on Friday but was not attended to after he "saw the suspects manning the report desk."

"He went to report the matter at Machakos Police Station but didn't do so since he was impatient and left," Mukindia said. He said Kiendi became impatient after he found the officers on duty attending to an elderly and disabled man. "He left the station in protest without recording his statement. He was told to wait as the old man was being attended to but he did not." Mukindia said the robbery victim moved to DCI office at the same station but was referred back to the report office. He said Kiendi later sought assistance at Makueni DCI offices where he filed a report which was referred to Machakos DCI offices. Mukindia said the Machakos DCIO has taken over the case and has assured the victim that police will arrest the culprits and recover the stolen money. "The victim has testified that he was misquoted. He told the police officers who were interrogating him that he can identify the robbers." The county police commander said the report which was published was as a result of a communication breakdown.
