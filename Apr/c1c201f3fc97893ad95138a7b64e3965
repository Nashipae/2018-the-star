Deputy President William Ruto on Friday told schools to stop forcing parents to contribute money for development. He said schools should look for other ways of raising cash. The government rolled out free primary education to lift the fee burden from parents, Ruto said at Murang’a High School on prize-giving day. Last week Ruto said he would not visit the school after parents accused its administration of extorting money. He was initially supposed to preside over a fundraiser to expand learning facilities. Parents were required to pay Sh40,000 each. Early last month, parents were notified to clear their contributions by March 24 as the school prepared for the fundraiser. Some parents complained their sons were denied their leaving certificates for failing to clear the money. They accused the management of colluding with wealthy parents to pass a resolution compelling them to pay the money. Parents have already contributed Sh20 million. Ruto said the school only needs Sh35 million to build the facilities and should not demand more. He contributed Sh15 million. The Deputy President said the Education ministry will give Sh20 million and told the school not to ask for money from parents. “No student should be sent home to get money because the government has taken the responsibility of sponsoring pupils,” Ruto said. The school’s principal said they lack a laboratory, a swimming pool, a new bus, a multipurpose hall and more classrooms. These cost about Sh70 million, he said. Governor Mwangi wa Iria told parents to stop dragging “petty politics” into education matters. He said the county will build four classes in the school.
