Ambitious Cephas Kimani is eyeing medal bracket as he rolls off his campaign this morning at the Broadbeach Lawn Bowls Club here in Gold Coast.
Kimani said he is not afraid of his opponents because he believes he is just as good. The Kenyan is pitted against India’s Krishna Xalxo and Andrew Newell of Jamaica in the first two rounds before confronting New Zealand’s Shannon McILroy and Arum Kumar of Fiji tomorrow in third and fourth rounds respectively.
He wraps up the preliminary rounds against England’s Robert Paxton on Wednesday in fifth round.
The Kenyan said out of the line-up, only Paxton will pose a threat to him.
“I am only worried about the Englishman. However, I must say I am ready for him and if he reverts to long range, I will counter with short range and vice versa,” he added.
He said he wants to make this year’s event memorable by posting good results. “I took part at the previous games in Glasgow but not in singles. I didn’t quite perform well but I want to change that and make Kenya proud. I want to change the perception people have for bowling in Kenya,” he noted.
He said his compatriot Eunice Wambui had tried despite losing three matches and winning only two in the preliminary rounds, hence he will be keen to take the performance to the next level.
“The greens here are fast and it’s not like the speed we are used to in Nairobi and that was Wambui’s main undoing. I have prepared well for my first game and I am here for gold,” he added. He, however, noted that he knows it will not be all smooth but will fight to the end.
“I am ready and I know the challenge is huge. We are all here for the medals and all countries are represented by their best,” he added the 32 year old.
“We need proper facilities if we are to improve and that is why I want to win a medal to show that government that we can actually do it.”
