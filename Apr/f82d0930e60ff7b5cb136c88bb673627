The man accused of conning MPs has been detained four days for police to carry out investigations. Benson Masubo alias Chacha, who is said to have used personal details of female MPs to extort them, faced Resident Magistrate Christine Njagi on Tuesday. Investigating officer John Kiprop had asked for a seven-day detention period noting they were yet to record statements by witnesses. Kiprop added the suspect would likely escape if released - he was arrested on March 30 at Tarime in Tanzania while trying to escape to the Democratic Republic of Congo.

"He has no fixed abode and if released on police bail, he is likely to interfere with investigations," he also told the court. The Magistrate ordered that the suspect be held for four days and undergo mental checks. The suspect, whose trickery caused an uproar in Parliament after MPs sought intervention, is facing charges related to conspiracy to commit fraud.
