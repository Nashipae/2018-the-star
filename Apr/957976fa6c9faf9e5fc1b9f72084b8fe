Sammy Kioko was crowned the ‘Ultimate Comic’. He walks away with a car, a TV contract and Sh1 million in the winner-takes-all competition, beating six contests who made it to the semi-final stage. Sammy Kioko started off telling his jokes to his neighbours and friends in Mathare North, Nairobi, where he lives with his family. His stories are largely inspired by his surroundings and everyday life experiences. He gained confidence to do stand-up comedy from primary and secondary school, having been an active participant in the drama club and school drama festivals. “I am so honoured and absolutely happy for being crowned the Ultimate Comic. This is a great win for me, and I am grateful to Churchill and his team, as well as Maisha Magic East. It was such a great honour for me to interact and learn from some of the best comedians in Kenya. I hope to use my talent to move to greater heights in the industry and influence other comedians positively,” said an excited Sammy Kioko. M-Net East & Southern channel director Timothy Okwaro congratulated Sammy. “Much as there can only be one winner, as a channel, we are proud that Ultimate Comic has given us an opportunity to not only impact the lives of the contestants but also train and create a new pool of comic talent that the industry can tap in to,” he said. The show was a collaboration between the TV channel and Daniel ‘Churchill’ Ndambuki in a bid to discover and nurture new talent in the comedy industry. The competition was open to male and female contestants between the ages of 18 and 50.
