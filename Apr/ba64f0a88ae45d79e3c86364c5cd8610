The tobacco industry have resorted to using retailers to sell single sticks without warning labels, a study has shown. Cigarettes are being sold in single sticks, making it easier for young people to experiment before becoming regular smokers, the study launched yesterday shows. The Tobacco Control Act, 2007, bars the sale of cigarettes, except in packages of at least 10 sticks. The study, done in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Cote D’ Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, Togo and Uganda, shows single cigarettes are still common. In Kenya, the study was done in Mathare, Kibera, Buru Buru, Kawangware, Karen, Kileleshwa and CBD. It shows that tobacco companies are still providing retailers with advertising materials. “When they do so, they attract young people to experiment. Sale of one stick undermines user’s exposure to health warning labels. This may undermine their efforts to quit use of tobacco products, IILA chief executive Ema Wanyonyi said. The report which was launched at Clarion Hotel, Nairobi, also shows that lack of enforcement of the law gives tobacco companies an upper hand in armtwisting users. The investigation team visited retailers selling tobacco and witnessed what was happening. Tobacco use is a major contributor to the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. It contributes to 50-70 per cent of all hospital admissions, half of inpatient mortality and 55 per cent total mortality in the country.
