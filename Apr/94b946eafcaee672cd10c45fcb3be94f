National Super League side Kisumu All Stars have been docked three points for allegedly fielding an ineligible player in their match against Ushuru last weekend.
Football Kenya Federation (FKF) went ahead to credit Ushuru with the three points and two goals despite the encounter having ended in a one-all draw.
All Stars were punished by the governing body for fielding Billy Again, who was unavailable for selection through suspension.
Agai was sent off for two bookable offences in their match against Western Stima on April 8 and was expected to miss two matches.
“In accordance to Article 3.5 of the Rules of Kenyan Football: ‘A club which fields a suspended or ineligible player will forfeit all matches in which the player was illegally fielded. We wish to inform you that your club has forfeited the match and the same has been awarded to Ushuru on three points, two goals basis,” read part of the letter sent to Kisumu All-Stars.
Following the punitive move by FKF, Nickanor Oketch’s charges have exchanged placings with their opponents, dropping to eighth, with both teams tied on 18 points from 11 matches. All Stars, who are sponsored by Kisumu County government, was formed at the beginning of the season to fill the void left by Palos, who withdrew from the league after their sponsor, Makini Schools terminated their partnership.
