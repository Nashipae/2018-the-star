Visiting Zoo Kericho FC stunned hosts Kakamega Homeboyz 2-1 in an entertaining Kenya Premier League match at Bukhungu Stadium yesterday. Kakamega Homeboyz holding midfielder Eston Esiye would have broken the deadlock three minutes into the game but his long range effort struck the woodwork. Zoo reacted by launching a counter attack through Kenyan international Isaac Kipyegon on left flank before crossing the ball to a unmarked Michael Madoya but Homeboyz shot stopper Mac Arthur Arakaza dived to thwart the attack only for the rebound to be slotted in by Madoya. With Homeboyz missing the services of talisman Allan Wanga who is injured, Mike Mururi tasked Moses Mudavadi to get goals and the budding striker made several attempts only to be denied by hawk-eyed Zoo stopper Daniel Kiptoo. Moments later, Esiye restored the parity for the Homeboyz in the 25th minute with a brilliant free kick from the edge of the box after a foul on Collins Kisuya. The goal saw the two teams go for the break tied 1-1. Mururiâ€™s charges returned from the break a more rejuvenated side after the introduction of Hassan Kikoyo for the ineffective Keiphas Mutuu and veteran Ahmed Ali Bai for Noah Wafula but there was little impact. Danson Namasaka took matter in his own hands where he beat Kisuya on the right wing before unleashing a scorcher that got the home team goalkeeper napping in 89th minute to give Zoo a rare 2-1 away win. Zoo tactician Sammy Okoth attributed the win on the ability of his players to play to his instructions and settle early in the match. His Homeboyz counterpart Mururi blamed their defeat on defensive blunders.
