A video of a man with a striking resemblance to controversial politician Miguna Miguna has got people talking. This is because Miguna was deported to Canada earlier this year. The footage taken along a busy road in Nairobi shows a man of imposing height, with a cap similar to Miguna's signature headgear. The person recording the video can be heard engaging in an animated discussion with someone about whether or not it is Miguna. The vocal Opposition figure and NRMKe General was deported after taking part in the mock swearing-in of Nasa principal Raila Odinga as Peoples' President on January 30. Kenyan officials said the lawyer, who holds dual Canadian nationality, was not a citizen. He insists he is Kenyan and tried to return last month - but was again deported.
