Kenya ‘economy dropped to 4.9 per cent in 2017 down from 5.9 per cent the previous year, latest government data shows. The 2018 economic survey unveiled yesterday by Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich shows that President Uhuru Kenyatta’s anchor sectors for ‘the big four’ agenda performed dismally in the the twelve month period under review. Although the country’s economy is projected to recover to 5.5 per cent in 2018/19 on the back of a five year economic blue print that focuses on food security, manufacturing, housing and health, it has a long way to go if economic survey 2018 released yesterday is anything to go by. According the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) key sectors of the economy, including agriculture, manufacturing, banking and construction recorded negative growth in 2017, perhaps challenging Jubilee administration to double the effort in order to realize the big four agenda dream.

The slow growth in the country’s GDP was attributed to prolonged election cycle, negative spillover effect of interest caps on bank loans, and adverse climatic condition that affected agricultural production in the first half of the year. The agricultural sector, which was growing by four per cent in 2016 slowed to 1.6 per cent. At least 70 per cent of Kenya’s rural population depends on agriculture for survival. Generally, the sector contributes up to 26 per cent to the country’s GDP and another 27 per cent of GDP indirectly through linkages with other sectors. It employs more than 40 per cent of the total population. During the period under review, the sector saw a major decline in production of major crops such as maize, sugarcane, tea and coffee among others. For instance, Maize production declined from 37.8 million bags in 2016 to 35.4 million bags in 2017, tea and coffee production decreased by seven per cent and 11.5 per cent to 439.8 thousand tonnes and 40.8 thousand tonnes, respectively in 2017. The period also saw sugarcane deliveries to factories reduce drastically by 33.3 per cent from 7.2 million tonnes in 2016 to 4.8 million tonnes in 2017 due to a reduction in cane production. With less than five years to 2022, this means that the government has a tough task ahead to achieve its agenda on food and nutrition security. The agenda seeks to increase maize production to 67 million bags in 2022, rice from 125,000 metric tonnes to 400,000 and potatoes from 1.6 million tonnes to 2.5 million tonnes In his opening remarks during the survey launch, KNBS director general Zachary Mwangi attributed the slow growth to drought, pests and diseases incidences such as the Fall armyworm which resulted in reduced crop and livestock production. “The constrained growth was a result of depressed rainfall, characterised by late onset and poor distribution,” he said. An analysis of the survey further shows that the construction sector recorded a slower growth of 8.6 per cent in 2017 compared to a 9.8 per cent growth in 2016. In addition, cement consumption decreased by 8.2 per cent in 2017 showing a decreased appetite on construction. Going by the analysis, this is likely to slow down the government’s ambitious project on affordable housing that seeks to create 500,000 new homes by 2022. This is President Kenyatta's second Agenda on the big four. The manufacturing sector growth slowed to 0.2 per cent from 2.7 in 2016, the lowest in the past five years. Manufacture of food products declined by 10.8 per cent in 2017 on accounts of shortfalls in the domestic supply of raw materials such as sugarcane, tea, milk and rice paddy. Also under it is the beverages and tobacco sub-sector which declined by 0.9 percentage points. The survey attributed this to a 5. 2 per cent and 4.1 per cent drop of beer and cigarettes production respectively. Other sub-sectors under the manufacturing pillar which recorded a decline in production include textile that reported a 1.7 per cent decline, Leather and related products which dropped by 12 per cent, output volumes of plastic products that declined by 3.8 per cent, motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers production which registered a drop of 16.4 per cent, cement production that decreased by 8.2 per cent and the furniture sector that registered a 4.4 per cent decline.

Going by the survey, malaria, pneumonia and cancer were reported as the top three major causes of death in Kenya for the last four years. The three have cumulatively claimed at least 56,090 lives. This means that going forward; the government will have to allocate more funds from its universal healthcare coverage that is its fourth agenda. In his speech for the 2018 devolution conference , President Kenyatta said the government has replaced the health cover offered by the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) and replaced it with universal healthcare coverage. A pilot for the project is being carried out in four counties before it’s rolled out countrywide, the President said. Data from the survey shows that NHIF membership rose by 11.1 per cent from 6.1 million in 2015/2016 financial year to 6.8 million in the 2016/2017 financial year. Total contributions from the fund rose by 9.3 per cent to Sh34.9 billion in 2016/2017. The survey indicates that the national government expenditure on Health services is expected to grow by 15.9 per cent from Sh56.6 billion in 2016 to Sh65.6 billion by the end of this financial year.
