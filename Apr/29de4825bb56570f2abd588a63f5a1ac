Labour CS Ukur Yatani has urged the University Academic Staff Union to call off the lecturers' strike and order members back to work. Yatani welcomed the ruling on Friday by High Court Justice Justice Onesmus Makau ordering lecturers to call off their strike, saying the industrial action is not protected. It is unfortunate the dons' strike has gone on for more than a month, as both lecturers and the government maintain entrenched positions. The strike has hurt many people, especially thousands of students who have gone for weeks without tuition, despite their parents paying fees. Education CS Amina Mohamed needs to move fast to end this sorry state of affairs. Both parties need to drop their hard-line stands and work earnestly towards a compromise allowing education to resume. Both sides should negotiate in good faith and ensure an durable resolution. The government has been accused of not keeping its side of the bargain. Any agreement must be fully implemented by both sides to find aÂ  long-term solution to recurrent pay issues.
