City residents have said they are still grappling with garbage, traffic congestion, hawkers and bad roads, despite the change in regime at City Hall. Speaking at a public forum in Charter Hall on Wednesday, residents said they have not noticed any changes, if anything, some areas have worsened. “We don’t have streetlights and when it rains, our area is the worst affected. It floods in our homes because nobody cares to work on the drainage,” Kileleshwa resident Jane Ngugi said. Ngara resident Njimi Wa Muthoni complained about the inhumane demolition of kiosks and residential houses by county askaris. But Governor Mike Sonko said his administration will come up with a permanent solution to end the traffic jam problem.
