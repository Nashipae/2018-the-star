A group of teachers from Homa Bay yesterday defended Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion against calls for him to step down. They accused their colleagues from Kiambu and Nairobi, who want Sossion to resign, of politicising the union's affairs. Homa Bay branch executive secretary Cornel Ojuok said Knut is independent of the state. He said Sossion's nomination to the National Assembly has not interfered with his daily activities at the union. “Sossion became an MP after we voted him the secretary general. He hasn’t failed in undertaking his duties...hence we have confidence in him,” Ojuok said.
