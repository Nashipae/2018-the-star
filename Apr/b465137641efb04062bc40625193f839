The freeze on recruitment in the public service is to blame for the high rate of unemployment among youths, the Public Service Commission has said. The PSC has asked Parliament to lift the freeze, which it blames for the management crisis in most statutory organisations. Acting chairman Peter Olenkuraiya yesterday told the National Assembly Public Accounts Committee the freeze has curtailed recruitment of new staff over the last 10 years. He said there is need for a structured annual recruitment strategy to address unemployment and improve services. Olenkuraiya said there is a huge number of aging employees and staffing gaps in the grading structure due to non-replacement of exiting officers. "For 10 years now, there has been no recruitment in the public service. The freeze was enforced by the National Treasury through a circular and that is where we are currently,” Olenkuraiya said. Olenkuraiya was before the committee to discuss financial statements for the 2014-15 and 2015-16 financial years. He was accompanied by CEO Alice Otwala and commissioner Patrick Gichohi. Olenkuraiya told the committee chaired by Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi that the commission has a few available vacancies. He said the centralisation of adverts to the Government Advertising Agency has limited the commission’s reach of potential applicants. Delays in loading of quarterly budgets and Exchequer releases have also affected the implementation of planned programmes.
