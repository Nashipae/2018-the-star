Kirinyaga Governor Anne Wauguru on Saturday called for the arrest of Kirinyaga woman representative Purity Ngirici and her husband over Friday's heckling incident at a meeting attended by DP William Ruto. The governor blamed the woman MP and her husband Andrew Ngirici for allegedly paying boda boda youths to heckle her when she stood to address the crowd at Gakoigo, Kirinyaga central constituency. "Are the Ngiricis untouchable? We are demanding answers from the county security team," Waiguru said.

Speaking during a press briefing at a Sagana hotel, Waiguru said she has in her possession video clips of Ngirici's supporters shouting her down at the event. "It was a golden opportunity to have the Deputy President in the county and its unfortunate for leaders to lose focus," Waiguru said. The governor urged residents to maintain peace during Ruto's visit for a fund raiser on Sunday at Mwea Catholic church. The arrest calls came a few hours after Ngirici denied being behind the heckling incident. She urged the governor to provide evidence to prove her claims.
