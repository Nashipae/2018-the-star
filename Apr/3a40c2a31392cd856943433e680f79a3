Elgeyo Marakwet county commissioner Abdullahi Galgalo (pictured) has said the rights of residents living at the site on which a Sh35 billion dam will be built wonâ€™t be violated. Residents want the multipurpose Arror Dam redesigned to reduce the number of people who will be displaced. The dam will displace 800 families in Kipsaiya, Kamok and Kaptul villages. Galgalo on Tuesday said residents will not be shortchanged during the building of the project being funded by the Italian government and implemented by the KVDA. All residents, he said, will be consulted before construction starts. KVDA manager in charge of Arror Dam on Wednesday said the authority will adhere to international standards in compensating affected residents.
