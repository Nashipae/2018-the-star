Egyptian side El Geish are interested in the services of General Service Unit trio of Cornelius Kiplagat, Abiud Chirchir and Brian Melly. The three were part of the team that finished fifth in the recently concluded African men’s Club Championship in Cairo, Egypt. Kiplagat, a left attacker, Chirchir a right attacker and Melly the setter, were outstanding as the Kenya Volleyball Federation national champions registered a remarkable improvement from their 17th place finish two years ago. Team’s coach Gideon Tarus said the North Africans are keen to add the three players to their line-up although they are yet to communicate officially. Tarus said: “During the event, most clubs showed interest in the three players but it was Geish, who finished second behind eventual winners Al Ahly that came forward and made their intension known.” “It is a good thing to know that some of your players have caught the eyes of other clubs and more so from North Africa. We are waiting for an official communication from the club then we will see what happens from there.” GSU resume training this morning ahead of the second leg of the KVF set for April 20-23 in Baringo County where they start their title defence against Forest Rangers. The paramilitary side will then wrap up the day with a match against newcomers Kericho County. Tarus noted:“We are keen on defending our title and the first win of the season is key as it gives a team the momentum going forward. Gladly, we are fresh from participating in the continental championships and the playing unit is in competition mood.” GSU, alongside local nemesis, Kenya Prisons, skipped the first leg last month held in Bungoma County to compete at the African Club tournament.
