Two St Mary’s Hospital, Gilgil, doctors, an administrator and a businessman yesterday were charged with stealing Sh13 million theatre and lab equipment. Seth Manera, Peter Lemayan, Peter Kibet and Patrick Ng’era were accused of stealing 57 assorted theatre and lab equipment. They appeared before Nakuru senior principal magistrate Liz Gicheha. On an alternative charge, Ng’era was accused of handling stolen property. He was found in possession of hospital items on March 5 at his home at Elementaita. The alleged theft happened during the forced entry to the hospital by police and nuns, following a court order to remove the management headed by American priest Dr William Fryda. They were arrested on March 27. Gicheha ordered they be released on Sh5 million bond or Sh200,000 bail.
