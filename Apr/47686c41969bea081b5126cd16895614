An assistant chief in Kisumu has been charged with defiling a 15-year-old class eight girl after asking her to run an errand for him. Caleb Oyende from Ang’oga sublocation, Seme, allegedly committed the offence on March 31. "He called me to go and take Sh50 to his father and when I went, he gave me the cash but as I left he pulled me back, touched me and committed the offence," the girl narrated. Oyende denied the defilement charge before Maseno Senior Resident Magistrate Reuben Kipng’eno on Tuesday. He was released on a Sh200,000 bond. In February, a chief in the same sub-county was found guilty of defiling a 14-year-old in 2015 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Michael Odhiambo, from South West Seme, had been charged with defiling an orphan who had been living with her grandmother in June 2015. The standard six girl had been heading to church when the chief lured her into his house  and repeatedly defiled her.
