Kirinyaga Deputy Governor Peter Ndambiri should have fought back the people recording him after allegedly being caught with someone’s wife. That is according to National Assembly Majority deputy Whip Cecily Mbarire. Maybe he would have saved himself the humiliation had he put two padlocks on his hotel room door. That is according to Majority leader Aden Duale. MPs spent the better part of yesterday afternoon debating the video - allegedly of Ndambiri caught pants down with another man’s wife that went viral on Tuesday. Duale was to move a motion of adjournment, but started the debate that was not taken lightly by some MPs from the Luhya community. Duale said, “Hon Oparanya (Kakamega governor) must ensure that people are safe there. I even told my governor, deputy governor and MCAs not to spend another night there because that is a dangerous part of Kenya. You must ensure you have two padlocks to your room,” he said. “It should be known whether it is a matter of a leader who has played around with his integrity or a matter of extortionists.” Mbarire said, "I felt that he should have fought back because that’s what a man does especially when you know your family is at stake and your leadership is at stake.” Click here for the latest political news
