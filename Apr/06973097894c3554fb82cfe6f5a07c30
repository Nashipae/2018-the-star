ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford-K’s Moses Wetang’ula are heading nowhere without NASA chief Raila Odinga, ANC nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi has said. He warned the two politicians against trying to bring Raila down. That is impossible because they have tried it in the past and “failed terribly”, he said. “I want to tell Mudavadi — my friend and my party leader — and Wetang’ula that your political future is with Raila and you are heading nowhere without him,” Osotsi said. “Luhya leaders have decided to work with Raila as our good neighbour and we don’t want anybody to divide us.” He told Wetang’ula and Mudavadi they cannot leave a bigger coalition to merge two small parties under the pretext of uniting Luhyas. That will not work, Osotsi said. “Follow the direction of the Western people — not your personal interest,” he said.
