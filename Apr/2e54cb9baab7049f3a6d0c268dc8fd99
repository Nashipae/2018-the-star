A priest on Saturday condemned youths who heckled Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru during DP William Ruto's tour of the county on Friday. Father Jackson Wanjohi of Karira Parish said it is regretted that "politicians are not yet done with politics six months after the August polls." Wanjohi urged politicians not to misuse youths by giving them handouts to disrupt national events. The cleric urged politicians in the county to unite and focus on development that improves the lives of resident. He further said those angling for political seats in 2022 to wait till the electioneering period. Father Wanjohi spoke ahead of a fundraiser in aid of the Mwea Catholic Church which both Ruto and Waiguru will attend on Sunday. He said the church has collaborated with the county security agencies to avert any chaos during the harambee. The funds drive is meant for the construction of the church's pastoral center which has stalled for the past 3 years. The project is approximated to cost Sh180 million. Ruto, who has his eyes set on the presidency, has been making inroads in Mt Kenya region to seek for support for his bid. He commissioned the upgrading to bitumen standard and maintenance of the Njegas-Kangaita and Kiaga â€“ Mukinduri roads. During the event, youths who appeared drunk, shouted down Waiguru when the DP called her out to speak. But in a statement, Waiguru accused Kirinyaga woman rep Wangui Ngirici and her husband Andrew Ngirici of hiring the youths to shout her down. The county MP has denied the claims and has asked the governor to avoid sideshows and concentrate on serving the people.
