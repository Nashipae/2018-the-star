Absentee landlords will be taxed, the government has said. Lands CS Faridah Karoney yesterday said those with huge chunks of land will be punished if their parcels remain undeveloped. She said the ministry will introduce a taxation policy to back the plan. “Likewise, the law will give incentives to owners who have done something. Why should someone have 100,000 acres sitting idle? We need legal backup to deal with such peopleâ€‹,” Karoney said in Mombasa during the inaugural meeting of the Senate Lands committee. She said the Physical Planning Programme must be implemented and resources allocated to ensure its success. “The National Land Policy is also being revised to align it with the Constitution,” Karoney said. The CS said 3,000 squatters will be settled by the end of the year. Only 30 per cent of land in Kenya has been surveyed. Most of the land yet to be surveyed is community land at the Coast. “We want access to land by the poor to increase. Public and private land that has been reverted to us will be used for this job,” she said. Karoney said the land digital registry is secure and cannot be hacked. â€‹“The platform has been taken through various levels of security stress. On Monday, we will review it.” Read:State to tax owners of idle private land or use it for farming to boost crop yields Also Read: Idle land owners to face tax, forced lease in plan to curb food shortage Click here for the latest political stories
