Anxiety has gripped supporters of Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi and his rival Ahmed Abdullahi as the Court of Appeal in Nairobi is to rule on an election petition. Embattled Governor Abdi immediately appealed after the High Court on January 12  declared his victory which had been challenged by former Governor Abdullahi null and void. In his ruling, Justice Alfred Mabeya said Abdi was not validly cleared to vie for the seat and noted many discrepancies in forms 37B. These were used to declare him winner in the August 8 polls. Mabeya also said  Abdi’s academic papers were not complete since he doesn’t have a genuine degree. Senior party supporters from both  sides including county officials, MCAs and businessmen have already flown to Nairobi to await the verdict.
