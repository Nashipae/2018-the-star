 The Kenya Plantation and Agricultural Workers Union on Tuesday projected doom for the floriculture sector following the sacking of 2,500 Oserian farm workers. Naivasha branch Secretary General, Ferdinand Juma says a clique of flower farmers are now employing workers on contracts, thus, locking them from the annual salary increases. “The move to send home 2,500 workers by Oserian is an eye-opener and soon other farms shall follow suit meaning a crisis for hundreds of families,” he said. Juma said the trend was now spreading from one farm to the other with hundreds of workers in the sector getting laid off on a daily basis. Defending the lay off, Oserian Finance Director Tim Ndikwe on March 31 said the farm had been subdivided. He said change of use plans were amended to Industrial, Commercial and Residential uses in support of the diversification.
