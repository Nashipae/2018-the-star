Lamu Governor Fahim Twaha has expressed confidence ongoing mega projects can turn around the county’s fortunes. He cited the Lamu-Garsen road and the one in Mokowe town set to open up the county for trade, tourism and industrialisation. Kenya Urban Roads Authority officials paid him a courtesy call yesterday. Twaha said Lamu’s economy has been at its worst in the last few years. Kura is putting up the first tarmac road in Lamu’s Mokowe town since Independence. The 11km road will cost Sh1.1 billion. Twaha said the Lapsset project is a game changer.
