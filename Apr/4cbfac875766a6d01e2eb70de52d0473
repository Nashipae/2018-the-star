A Murang’a court yesterday put on probation a 33-year-old man accused of killing his wife and burying her in a pit latrine two years ago. The body was never found. Principal magistrate Anthony Mwichigi released Stephen Mwangi, putting him on two-years’ probation. Mwangi will be required to report to Murang’a police station every two weeks until his probation is over. The ruling follows an unsuccessful exhumation exercise led by DCIO Japheth Maingi and public health officers. They searched the home and grounds of the victim’s mother for the body of Christine Ruguru’s body. Police officers dug out a pit latrine and two other locations before calling off the search. Mwichigi said the prosecution had failed to fi nd the body of the victim in the place it had claimed the suspect had buried it. He asked the investigating officer to continue probing the disappearance of Ruguru who went missing two years ago. The victim, who was a mother of three, disappeared after a disagreement with the husband. The two had been separated for six months an Ruguru started a relationship with another man. Ruguru’s mother said her daughter had grown tired of their turbulent marriage and had plans to make their separation official in the chief’s office. Neighbours said that Mwangi had earlier bragged of killing his wife and dumping her body in a toilet. They said he followed Ruguru to her maternal home in a bid to repair their marriage and ended up killing her. The victim’s mother, who was speaking during the exhumation exercise, pleaded with the police to help trace her daughter’s body to give her closure. Click here for the latest political news
