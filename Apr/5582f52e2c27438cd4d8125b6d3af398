The Ministry of Lands and Physical Planning has been criticised for the Sh1.2 billion revenue collection shortfall in 2016-17. Auditor General Edward Ouko’s report shows the ministry collected Sh1.7 billion out of the projected collection of Sh2.9 billion. “The ministry failed to collect revenue to the tune of 42 per cent of the budgeted revenue,” reads the report in part. “This may have impacted negatively on the country’s budgeted development projects.” The ministry budgeted to collect Sh1.8 billion on property income, but had an actual collection of Sh902.3 million. It collected Sh945.1 million, instead of Sh718.9 million on sale of goods and services.

Lands PS Nicholas Muraguri told the National Assembly Lands Committee the ministry suffered a budget cut of Sh751.5 million in Supplementary Budget Estimates II for implementation of the Big Four programmes. “We wish to request reinstatement of the funds to enable the Ministry implement the 2017-18 programmes and clear bills,” he told the committee chaired by Kitui South MP Rachael Nyamai. In the second Supplementary Estimates for 2017-18, the Ministry will spend Sh368.7 million on processing and registration of title deeds and Sh154.2 million on digitisation of land registries. The estimates’ report approved by the National Assembly on Thursday will also see the National Lands Commission receiving Sh1.3 billion. The Budgets and Appropriations Committee chaired by Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung’wah recommended that the National Treasury allocates Sh80 million in 2018-19 to the Lands Control Board.
