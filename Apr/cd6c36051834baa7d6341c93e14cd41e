Police in Kiambu are investigating the cause of a fire that razed the house of a 94-year-old woman, killing her on Easter Monday. Lari OCPD Isaiah Odhiambo yesterday said Hannah Wanjiku was sleeping when her wooden house caught fire in Kagaa village. “People started screaming when they noticed it the old woman’s house that was on fire. She lived alone. It was around midnight,” he said. Resident Godfrey Ngure said strong winds fanned the flames and thwarted their efforts to put out the fire. “We came in large numbers armed with buckets of water. The fire was so strong that it overpowered us, otherwise we would have saved her,” he said.
