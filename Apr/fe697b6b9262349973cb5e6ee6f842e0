The National Youth Service yesterday said the rollout of public transport in Nairobi is going on well. Director Richard Ndumbai told the Star on the phone some matatus try to block the NYS buses but do not do it violently. “We operate only on Mondays to Fridays during peak hours when we know commuters are in dire need. The Sh20 we charge is for fuel and maintenance only,” he said. Matatu owners should not feel threatened because as of now only 24 NYS buses provide passenger services, he said. The government will introduce 50 more buses before the end of the month to increase coverage. The Matatu Owners’ Association is against the idea. It accuses the government of plotting to push them out of business. MOA chairman Simon Kimutai said the move is unfair and uncalled-for because residents are not in need. Ndumbai said, “All routes are not covered due to the few buses we currently have. Residents of Kayole for instance should expect four buses.” This comes after the county government gave PSVs 10 days to move out of the CBD to decongest the city. Ndumbai said they are ready to ferry passengers to termini within the city centre if the government gives them the greenlight. “We have no problem doing so should our services be required to ferry commuters. We understand some termini are a bit far from the city centre and some people might have a problem trekking,” he said. Matatu operators have vowed to paralyse transport should the order barring them from entering the CBD be enforced.
