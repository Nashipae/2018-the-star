We have read with keen interest the sentiments of former Senate Minority leader Moses Wetang'ula, contained in the Daily Nation of April 10, in which he accuses Raila Odinga of engineering his ouster from his position last month. We find the sentiments to be dishonest, frivolous and evasive. They are meant only to whip up emotions and sympathy over problems of the senator’s own making. Wetangula knows the facts and they are as follows: he was rejected by Senators from all the Nasa parties, not only ODM. To date, none of the Nasa Senators has come out to support Wetang'ula. That kind of rejection is unprecedented and pointed to a deep rooted problem between him and his colleagues. The problems came out clearly in a meeting called by Raila to broker understanding between the Senator and his colleagues. The Senators accused Wetang'ula, in his presence, of being aloof, selfish, arrogant and having the tendency to impose decisions on them under the pretext that they were directives from the Summit, which often was not the case. As head of Nasa, Raila did all he could to save Wetangula’s minority leadership, including instructing the coalition’s CEO Norman Magaya to write to the Senate to retain Wetang'ula as Minority leader. The persistent efforts by Wetang'ula to avoid the facts, and blame his problems on Raila, therefore point to a personal vendetta and a refusal to face and deal with the truth.
