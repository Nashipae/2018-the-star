Embu Governor Martin Wambora has assured investors political wrangles in the county will not hurt their operations. He said favourable policies and laws have been established. Wambora said despite the petition he is facing in court, investors should rest assured they will succeed because his administration will support them by creating a business-friendly environment. The county chief said on Friday he is battle-hardened and not scared of politics. He said he succeeded in his first term when there was also incessant feuds. The county made great strides through development and investors benefitted, he said. Wambora spoke at an investorsâ€™ conference, which began on Thursday and ended on Saturday.
