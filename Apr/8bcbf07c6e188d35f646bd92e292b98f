Only nine deathtraps have been pulled down since demolition began last month. A funds shortage has slowed down the process. The National Building Inspectorate (NBI) was to demolish all structures found unsafe for human occupation. NBI secretary and chief government quantity surveyor Moses Nyakiongora said they had identified 12 structures in Huruma built on riparian lands and wetlands. They were to be pulled down before end of January. Buildings Safety Testing acting MD Samuel Charangu said only four buildings were pulled down in Huruma, two in Zimmerman, two in Dandora and one in Kariobangi. He said the exercise is ongoing but on a “small scale”. He said it would resume in July at the beginning of the next financial year after the department receives funding. The focus is on Huruma where 711 buildings have been declared unsafe, and 388 of those declared extremely dangerous. The government has been accused of laxity and lack of commitment in demolishing unsafe structures.
