Kenya’s wait for first gold at the ongoing Commonwealth Games was embarrassingly delayed further after Jamaica’s Aisha Praught staged a coup in the 3,000m steeplechase at Carrara Stadium. The Kenyan delegation had their hands on their heads as Praught, whose country is known more for sprints, crossed the line in a personal best of 9:21.00 ahead of Kenyan duo of Celliphine Chepteek (9:22.61) and defending champion Purity Cherotich (9:25.74). The other Kenyan in the race Fancy Cherono placed sixth in 9:46.27, behind England’s Rosie Clarke ( 9:36.29) and Australia’s Genevieve Lacaze (9:42.69) . The silver and bronze won in the event felt more less like a loss. This was the Jamaican’s first victory ever, having placed 14th in the women’s 3,000m steeplechase in 9:34.20 at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. She was disqualified both at the 2015 and 2017 World Championships in Beijing and London respectively. The Kenyans blamed their defeat on miscalculation. Chespol said that she didn’t expect the Jamaican to close in on her. “I was well placed and didn’t expect the Jamaican to close the 30m gap I had opened. However, when she did with 200m to go, I was tired and I couldn’t react. It wasn’t just my day and I will leave to fight another day,” she said. Cherotich said she was well prepared to defend her title but her effort was curtailed by the weather conditions. She admitted that the race was tough and that she really pushed herself to the limit. The US-based Jamaican said she was happy to beat Kenyans and she is inspired to go for more. “I have always wanted to run steeplechase despite coming from a sprint-dominated country. I even ran 59 seconds in 400m when I was only 19 but my heart is in steeplechase,” she noted.
