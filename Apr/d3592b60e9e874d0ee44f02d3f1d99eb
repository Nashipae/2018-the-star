ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula will flop in their efforts to unite the Luhya, Sirisia MP John Waluke has said. Waluke on Thursday said Mudavadi and Wetang'ula squandered their chances to lead the community and must pave way for fresh blood in the region. “As someone said, the two are confirmed cowards with no ability to lead the Luhya nation, let alone the country,” Waluke said.

The MP further said Luhyas are not ready to unite because they have no leader at the moment. “We are grooming someone to take over from Ruto in future. Mudavadi and Wetang'ula  should retire." Waluke further said the Nasa principals have caused political confusion in Western and that that Luhyas cannot be misled again. “That is why we want a focused leader, not those who have been around for long yet have not succeeded in taking the community anywhere,”he said. But ANC officials in Uasin Gishu asked Waluke to play his politics of sycophancy in Eldoret and keep off from Western.
