Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru joined DP William Ruto and Uasin Gishu boss Jackson Mandago at the inaugural Eldoret City Marathon on Sunday. The marathon themed Climate Action is aimed at creating awareness on environmental conversation in the county. Speaking at the function in Eldoret town, the Deputy President asked Kenyans to work together to conserve the environment. “The nobility of this idea cannot be overstated. This should be the beginning of many more of such events.” Waiguru praised the organisers of the event and welcomed athletes to Kirinyaga for the Mwea marathon. “As a country, we have the responsibility of conserving our environment for future generations," she noted, adding her county had undertaken the planting of a million trees in five years. Waiguru also praised Mandago for spearheading the event to sensitise the public on environmental conservation. She planted a tree and later met 3000m steeplechase Olympic champion Ezekiel Kemboi.
