Bongo sensation Ali Kiba is set to marry his fiancé Amina Khalef, who hails from Mombasa, tomorrow evening at the Diamond Jubilee Hall, Mombasa. The news of the wedding is the talk of town and everyone wants to see the beautiful bride Ali Kiba chose. Reports indicate that Ali has been dating the woman, identified as Amina Khalef, since late 2016. What makes all this super interesting is that the two have managed to keep their relationship off the limelight, with the public not knowing how Amina looks like. Late last year, reports emerged that the two had fallen out after rumours hit the tabloids claiming that Ali Kiba had stepped out on Amina with an unidentified woman in a hotel room in Mwanza. This did not go down well with Amina. After all, Kiba has three children with different women and is a sight for sore eyes. Kiba is rumoured to have dated Tanzanian businesswoman and model Jokate Mwengelo before they allegedly broke up over religious differences. The wedding invite that was leaked reads: "The family of the late Khalef Hemed Salim and Asma Said Abeid, request the honour of your presence for the wedding reception of their daughter, Amina Kalef Ahmed Salim, on Thursday 19 April, 2018, at Diamond Hall at 7:30pm. Strictly no children allowed." As part of the wedding preparations, word on the street is that Ali Kiba has moved Amina's family to a bigger, more affluent house. According to a source close to the family, this is "so that they have a spacious abode for the family and the flurry of guests they have been receiving in preparation for the wedding". Pundits claim the wedding will be attended by the who is who in the political, entertainment and religious fraternity. Some of the expected guests include former Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete, Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho and fellow label mate Ommy Dimpoz.
