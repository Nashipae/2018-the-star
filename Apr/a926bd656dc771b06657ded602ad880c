Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has admitted there was a problem during the distribution of free fertiliser in 45 wards. The county boss said that is based on the complaints he has received over distribution of the fertiliser by the Ministry of Agriculture to vulnerable residents. He spoke during the burial of Kimaeti ward MCA Jack Wambulwa’s mother on Saturday. Wangamati said there was massive irregularities. “I have visited many areas including Tongaren, Bukembe, Musikoma and Bumula and there are complaints are all . I am not happy with that,’ he said. Wangamati said the famers who needed the fertiliser most missed out. The governor said next year, the county will need to change the distribution system so that all farmers benefit. Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa said the fertilizer was sold by powerful people in the county government. “ I want police to investigate and bring the perpetrators to book,” he said.
