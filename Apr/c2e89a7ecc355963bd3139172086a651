The Kenya
Sevens rugby team, popularly known as Shujaa, has bounced back to winning ways in the Singapore Sevens with
a 34-0 win over France in their second group B match. After losing
28-19 to England in the first match, Kenya showed how good they’ve been
this season with a 19-0 lead, thanks to tries from Jeffrey Oluoch and
Collins Injera who scored a brace. Shujaa were
not done yet as Injera added another try and there were also tries from Andrew
Amonde and Billy Odhiambo. France threatened to get a consolation try in the
final seconds of the match but the defence held on. Kenya’s next
match will be against USA at 2.44pm and a win will see them through to the main
cup quarters as they seek to register their highest points tally in the IRB
series. The national side has 83 points so far, seventeen points short of their
target of hundred points. Click here for the latest political news
