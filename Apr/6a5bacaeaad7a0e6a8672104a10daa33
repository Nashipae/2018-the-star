Ask your mother! These were the words of Murang'a woman representative Sabina Chege to a Twitter user who asked her about Wazir Chacha, the man who is facing police probe for conning MPs. The MP, via twitter, had posted a picture of her and other officials planting trees in the county on April 4. "Murang’a goes green. Mashinani Maneno’s," Sabina said. A twitter user, identified as Simon Maina, commented on the photo in Kikuyu asking if Chacha was among those in the picture. "Kau nÃ® Chacha kehau kana nÃ® maitho ndÃ®raira? (Is that Chacha I see in that photo or are my eyes deceiving me?)," Simon asked. The MP replied in Kikuyu saying "Uria nyukwa" (Ask your mother), causing an uproar on social media with users accusing the MP of being arrogant and derogatory. "Mhesh.. I can't believe you can be that derogatory...esp with a fellow woman. Could you NOT refrain yourself? Sad," @mugo_m said. @ItsKariukiA said: "LMAO...She just went rogue.." "It goes without saying that the truth hurts and that's why she is very bitter about the statement as she is a whore [sic]," @WaweruErastus said. @kariuki_ke said: "We support you Hon. Chege, and such replies to people who don't even warrant your attention may lead to you being dragged through the mud." Last week, the Murang'a MP denied knowing the conman and accused the media of "picking the wrong story and publicising it to soil my name". She said media outlets that ran the story should have sought more clarification from the Department of Criminal Investigations. "If my name was mentioned, they should have sought to prove [the claims] and contacted the DCI for clarification," the MP said.
