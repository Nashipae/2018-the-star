Migori county's procurement officer has resigned amid a corruption investigation. Eliud Obonyo informed County Secretary Christopher Rusana and the Public Service Board Secretary of his decision in a letter on Wednesday. The letter was circulated on social media a day before it was submitted. Obonyo was employed as the Deputy Supply Chain Management Officer in 2016. He took up the role of Acting County Director of Supply Management on February 28, 2016. His letter stated: "I would also request your office to compensate me for the period I acted as County Director [and for] my pending leave days." On Tuesday, sources said Obonyo met Governor Okoth Obado at his office in Migori town and indicated his intention to resign. Immediately after the meeting, which was reportedly heated, his resignation letter emerged. The official downplayed clams of corruption as the cause of his resignation saying he had found greener pastures. Click here for the latest political news
