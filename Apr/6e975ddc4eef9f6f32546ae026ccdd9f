Influential councils of public universities will lose the power to hire vice chancellors as the government streamlines recruitment of varsity bosses.In amendments headed for debate in the National Assembly, the government wants the Public Service Commission given the mandate to employ VCs, deputy VCs and principals of constituent colleges.The work of the university councils will be reduced to formal appointment in consultation with the Education CS after competitive recruitment by the PSC.“In the case of public universities, [a council will] appoint vice chancellors, deputy vice chancellors and principals and deputy principals of constituent colleges, in consultation with the Cabinet Secretary, after a competitive process conducted by the Public Service Commission,” the amendments to the University Act 2012 reads.

Then PSC chair and now Public Service CS Margret Kobia protested that the hiring had taken a worrying pattern that would weaken universities.The proposed amendments are contained in the Statute Law (Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 2018 sponsored by Majority Leader Aden Duale.But in what is likely to come as a shocker to the VCs, the amendments proposes they should be in office for a single term of five years.The current law makes VCs eligible for re-appointment after serving the first five. The proposed amendments also seek to diminish the role of university senate in the appointment of chancellors.According to the plan, when a vacancy occurs in the office of the chancellor, the senate shall, in consultation with stakeholders, identify suitable persons for appointment.“Five names shall be proposed to the Senate and submitted to the Public Service Commission for shortlisting and identification of three suitable candidates, ranked in order of merit,” the proposed amendments state.The PSC will then forward the names of the top three candidates to the Cabinet Secretary for onward transmission to the President, who shall pick one of the persons for appointment.The government also intends to make sweeping changes to the management of HELB.Among the casualties of the changes is the executive director of the Federation of Kenya Employer Jacqueline Mugo, who is on the verge of being kicked out of the NSSF board. To be appointed in the new board is the CEO of of Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service.
