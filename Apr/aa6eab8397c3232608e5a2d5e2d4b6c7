Activist Okiya Omtatah has gone to court to  compel three electoral agency commissioners to resign. Former vice chairperson Consolata Nkatha, commissioners Margaret Mwachanya and Paul Kurgat resigned last week. The move came after CEO Ezra Chiloba was sent on compulsory leave. However, according to Omtatah, the commissioners have not followed up their public resignation announcement by formally tendering their resignation to either President Uhuru Kenyatta or the commission. “The three did not and have not formally written to the President or the IEBC tendering their resignations, and they continue to draw salaries and to enjoy benefi ts that come with the offi ce of a commissioner,” Omtatah said.
