Ferry services will not stop with the construction of a 1.4km bridge across the Likoni Channel, the government has said. The government plans to put up a Sh80 billion bridge connecting Mombasa island and the South mainland.It also plans to set up electric cable cars across the channel. These plans caused speculation the ferries would be withdrawn or pedestrians will be charged to use them. But the National Assembly Transport committee on Saturday sought to allay fears. “We will have everything run concurrently. We will not collapse the ferry and people will use it for free as they have been doing,” committee chairman and Pokot South MP David Pkosing said. He spoke on Saturday during a visit to the facility. Pedestrians use the ferries free of charge, but vehicles pay a token for maintenance. The ferries transport an average of 300,000 people and 6,000 vehicles daily. “We want to have new systems. These are long-term ideas. Whatever we used to have here is archaic. We need to change,” Pkosing said. The proposed construction of the bridge across the Likoni Channel - part of the Mombasa Gate Bridge Project - is expected to ease traffic at the ferry crossing. In December last year, the national and Mombasa governments began an environmental and social impact assessment of the Gate Project managing consultant Michael Mwangi said there is no need for an additional ferry, adding it will only increase the risk of accidents. The government plans to add another ferry – MV Safari – but with an ongoing court case, construction in Turkey has temporarily stopped. The Mombasa Gate Bridge Project is jointly funded by the Kenyan and Japanese governments. Click here for the latest political news
