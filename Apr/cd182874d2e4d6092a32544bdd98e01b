Israel's prime minister has cancelled a deal with the UN to relocate African migrants living in the country, a day after reaching the agreement. Benjamin Netanyahu said he had taken the decision after consulting residents of south Tel Aviv, where many of the migrants live. He said he would now consider "all options... to remove the infiltrators". The fate of more than 30,000 migrants, who entered the country illegally, has long been a hugely contentious issue. The UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, said Mr Netanyahu's decision was a "disappointment" and urged the Israeli government to "consider the matter further". Under the five-year plan, some 16,250 African migrants who entered the country illegally, many of them seeking asylum, would be resettled in Western nations, which Mr Netanyahu had said included Germany, Italy and Canada. For each migrant resettled overseas, Israel would give "temporary residence" to a migrant in Israel. However, the arrangement had drawn opposition from anti-migrant groups and from powerful politicians within his governing coalition. It had already replaced an earlier controversial plan for mass deportations to third-party countries in Africa if individuals did not go voluntarily. This had been suspended by Israel's Supreme Court. Netanyahu said that agreement had failed because Rwanda had pulled out. Most of the African migrants in Israel are from Eritrea - a one-party state whose leaders have been accused of crimes against humanity by a UN inquiry - and war-torn Sudan. They say they fled danger at home and that it is not safe to return to another African country, but Israel considers the majority of African asylum seekers to be economic migrants. Most of them entered from Egypt several years ago, before a new fence was built along the desert border. This has ended most illegal crossings.
