We are prepared to charge him as soon as he recovers from the poisoning,” Meme said. Meme said Kiptanui is also wanted for assaulting Irene Tuyoi, a 70-year-old woman who had threatened to report the matter to authorities. Tuyoi, who sustained injuries on her right hand after the assault, said she had asked Kirui to release the minor and warned him that she would report the matter to the area chief. He added: “He had locked himself and the minor in the house and declined to open when our officers arrived. Our officers broke in and found the duo unconscious. They had just taken a bottle of acaricide.” Defilement has been on the rise in the area.
