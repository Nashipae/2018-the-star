Land disputes have taken a dangerous turn in Taita Taveta, with killings, rapes and disappearances becoming rampant. Families fight among themselves, while others fight with private developers over land ownership. Haki Africa says the county has become a deathtrap. Activist Andrew Malagho on Tuesday blamed corruption in the national government’s Lands department. “Corrupt officials do double allocation. Many people are offered title deeds to one parcel and problems arise when each party wants to develop the land,” he said. Four elderly women are among those who have been raped, Malagho said. They had refused to sell their land. “The last one, a 74-year-old, died within a few days of the ordeal,” he said. Haki Africa said if this is not stopped, the situation could worsen, especially for many elderly people who own land. “Land is fuelling disputes. Children turn against their parents and eliminate them,” programme officer Francis Auma said in Voi during a meeting with residents. He criticised the National Land Commission for failing to intervene. In more than 20 disputes, people have been slashed with pangas, Auma said. Residents blamed local leaders and tycoons for the mess. Some politicians issued title deeds to woo voters, fuelling the problem. But Lands executive Claris Mnyambo dismissed the claims as exaggerations. She said her office has received no report. “Maybe I need to do a follow-up to know the situation on the ground,” Mnyambo said. Stanley Mwamburi from Bura said young people demand inheritance. “I’ve seen my fellow youth attack their parents for refusing to give them land,” he said. Malagho said some parents kill their children. “I’ve started hearing such cases this year. Something must be done,” he said. Pauline Kulola said her eldest sister, Margaret Wanyika, disappeared mysteriously in 2016, when she was fighting off a private developer who tried to grab their land.
