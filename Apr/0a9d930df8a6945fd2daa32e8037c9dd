Contemporary artiste Julius Owino, alias Juliani, has launched a forum 'Juliani Hela' to help fans get access to his events, buy albums, T-shirts and other Juliani accessories, as well as his latest album launched this week. The star has tapped into the potential of technology to interact with his fans. It is a loyalty point-based currency earned by customers on every purchase of an event ticket. "You need Juliani Hela (JHela) to make purchases on juliani.co.ke. Think of Juliani Hela as a currency that can only be used here. One Juliani Hela is valued at Sh100. You can buy them at highly subsidised early bird fan pack rates," he said. Today, Juliani will relaunch Exponential Potential, and tomorrow, the star will release his brand new album, Masterpiece.
