Kenya may lose out on a chance to host the talent search TV show America's Got Talent, which is coming to East Africa. The show was created by Simon Cowell. Cowell and comedian and talk show host Paul O'Grady will be looking for the best from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania this November. A source close to Word Is whispered, "Yes, Got Talent will be having an East African show in November. So far, the plans for this are in the initial stages. A lot of the logistics and contractual aspects of it are still to be signed and confirmed, but the show is indeed coming to Nairobi." A source whispered that Tanzania already has a major sponsor, while Kenya is lagging behind. "At this rate the show may not take place in the country and rather Tanzania may have the pleasure of hosting it. But note, this is only if corporate sponsors don't snap up the deal," the source added. The financial implication of losing the show to Tanzania will be felt in the entertainment industry as those jobs will go elsewhere. Got Talent has spin-offs in at least 58 countries, in what is now referred to as the 'Got Talent' format, similar to that described by FremantleMedia of the Idol and The X Factor formats. Unlike those shows, Got Talent showcases several artistic disciplines in addition to singing. Entertainment pundits hope that Cowell will make a trip to Nairobi during the launch and production of the Got Talent East African franchise.
