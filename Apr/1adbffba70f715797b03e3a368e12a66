Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala has suspended the construction of the Hells Gate amusement park. The CS has also directed the Kenya Wildlife Service board to interdict three senior officers who approved the project. The amusement park was being constructed by Idyllic Mistley House. The firm has been directed to vacate the site immediately. Balala said: "Idyllic Mistley House irregularly started the project
construction without meeting the project's conditions," Balala said on
twitter handle. The company started the construction in secrecy without getting approval from the National Management Environment Authority. Balala said KWS board of trustees granted a provisional letter of commitment subject to an EIA within the provision of EMCA 2012. The construction was to be done at old staff camp. The CS said the firm contravened the requirements that the structures be eco-friendly, have environmental mitigation plans, and be approved by KWS. He visited the site today following an uproar by environmentalists over the project. More on this: KWS backs recreation park plan at Hell’s Gate Click here for more political news
