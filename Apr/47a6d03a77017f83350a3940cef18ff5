The Coast Water Services Board has sought to allay fears of a major interruption of water supply in North Coast and Mombasa following an alert sent by the Mombasa Water Supply and Sanitation Company yesterday. In the alert, the Mombasa Water Company said there was a technical breakdown at the Baricho Main Pump Station in Malindi caused by extensive power fluctuations resulting into unprecedented fire at the power plant. “Consequently, normal water pumping from Baricho has been affected and supply in areas including Kiembeni, Kisauni, Bamburi, Shanzu, Bombolulu, Kisimani, VOK, Nyali, Mishomoroni and northern parts of the island have been disrupted,” the alert reads. However, CWSB corporate affairs manager Fatma Gakuria told the Star the matter was minor and was rectified in two hours. She said the heavy rains in the Coast caused River Sabaki to burst its banks and submerged three upstream pumps, rendering them non-functional. “Those ones are not pumping and we are waiting for the waters to subside. However, the three downstream pumps are still pumping,” Gakuria said. She acknowledged there was also a fire outbreak at the treatment plant which damaged the capacitor, but was worked on immediately and normal services resumed.
