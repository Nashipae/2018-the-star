Deputy President William Ruto was the best man at former Agriculture CS Willy Bett's private wedding in Karen, Nairobi, on Wednesday. Ruto stood by Bett alongside his wife Rachel during the evening ceremony. Former Ministers Phyllis Kandie (Labour) and Jacob Kaimenyi (Lands) were among those who graced the occasion. Sources close to Bett said the wedding was to take place in December last year but was pushed due to President Uhuru Kenyatta's Cabinet reshuffle.
