Nyeri MP Ngunjiri Wambugu wants Mt Kenya politicians to stop driving other people's agenda while their backyards remain troubled. Wambugu said this on Sunday, in reference to those engaged in 2022 succession politics and the referendum debate. He advised them to instead support President Uhuru Kenyatta in the implementation of his Big Four Action Plan. "There are many services for elected leaders to deliver between now and 2022," he said in an interview. "Everyone has a right to an opinion but Mt Kenya leaders should address problems in their region." Wamburu cited boundary issues ahead of next year's census, saying Mt Kenya does not get enough money despite a high population. He linked the region's problems to the 2009 census, noting further that some parts of the country receive more money than others yet their numbers are low. Turkana county, he said, has less than a million people yet receives Sh12 billion while Kiambu gets Sh9 billion yet it has 2.9 million residents. "These discrepancies must be addressed." The lawmaker noted that devolution was aimed at fairness in the distribution. Regarding the next general election, he said: "I will vote only for people who will have made contributions."
