Marakwet East residents have threatened to kill 30 elephants if Kenya Wildlife Service doesn't stop the animals from destroying their crops. The locals
said the jumbos from Rimoi Game Reserve have destroyed crops worth millions of shillings since March this year. Kennedy Kipkore said the elephants have destroyed their paw paws, mangoes, tomatoes, cassava, watermelon, French
beans, and Green grams. "We are
asking KWS to drive away the elephants or we will be forced to hunt them. We will no longer sit down and watch the elephants destroy our crops." Kipkore said said
farmers in the area are counting losses after spending money to purchase
seeds and to cultivate their farms. "Farming
is our livelihood. So, we will be forced to protect our crops by all means. We
have used resources to till our farms and can't allow the destruction to go on." Moses Ngele, another farmer, said the elephants ate up his 200 bags of mangoes and destroyed
19 mature trees. He said
the jumbos also destroyed two acres of tomatoes in his farm. "We had
experienced insecurity for the last two years. We are now experiencing
massive crop destruction at a time when peace has been restored," Ngele said. He asked KWS officers to visit their farms and assess the level of destruction. "We
have reported the matter to the police and recorded statements at Liter police
station. KWS officers must drive these animals because locals are angry,"
Ngele said. Endoo ward
agricultural extension officer Benjamin Sum said farmers have lost about Sh27 million
worth of crops since in less than month. Elgeyo
Marakwet KWS warden John Ngalia said he will deploy a team of
officers to the area to drive the elephants back to the reserve. Ngalia said
the service will sensitise farmers on ways to avoid of avoiding human-wildlife
conflicts in the area. Click here for the latest political news
