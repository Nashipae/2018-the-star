Kenya sevens have been handed a tough draw for the Singapore Sevens where they face England, France and USA in Pool ‘B’. Fresh from bagging 19 points in Hong Kong, Shujaa will be seeking to improve their points tally from 83 as they chase their target of 100 points this season. They lie seventh on the standings. Kenya will open their campaign against England, whom they beat 12-0 in Vancouver, their first win over the Europeans in seven years . Kenya will then meet France. The two sides have clashed four times this season. France winning 21-14 in Cape Town, Kenya won in Sydney (17-14), the French edged Innocent Simiyu’s charges (19-14) in Las Vegas with Kenya winning 12-0 in Vancouver. Kenya and USA have met twice this season with the two sides drawing 19-19 and Innocent Simile’s charges winning 24-19 in the Main cup semifinals in Vancouver last month Singapore has fond memories for the side with Shujaa winning their maiden trophy in 2016 when they beat Fiji 30-7 in the final. Fiji, winners of Hong Kong this past weekend, have been handed a favourable pool and meet Spain, Russia and Japan in Pool ‘A’. Series leaders South Africa take on Argentina, Canada and Samoa in Pool C while New Zealand headline Pool ‘D’ and have a date with Scotland, Australia and Wales. Skipper Oscar Ouma and Willy Ambaka were named in the dream team of the two-day tournament. Shujaa’s focus now turns to the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast this weekend with the side facing Canada, New Zealand and Zambia with only one team advancing to the semifinals for the medal bracket matches. Ouma said: “It was tough final against Fiji. Our discipline let us down at crucial moments but it was good preparation for the Commonwealth Games and the boys are relishing the challenge. We are going for nothing short of the gold gold,” added Ouma. The team is expected to arrive in Gold Coast today.
