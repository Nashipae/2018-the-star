World and Olympic 3,000m steeplechase champion Conseslus Kipruto is upbeat that his late arrival for the Commonwealth Games here in Gold Coast will translate into good results. Kipruto said their delay back home was deliberate because they wanted to train in familiar environment. “This kind of weather in Gold Coast is always tricky and that is why we preferred to stay back and train a bit longer at home,” he said. He said they will use the next three days to acclimatise before swinging into action this Friday. “I am ready and as usual, I will be going for gold,” he noted. He said he decided to honour the Commonwealth Games despite other elite athletes staying away because it was on his schedule from the word go. “I always plan my schedule early and this time, Commonwealth Games featured prominently because it is a less busy year with no World Championships or Olympic Games,” he added. He said there is no much this year and that is why he opted for the games. “From here, I am headed for the Diamond League and I intend to do around five meetings starting with Doha next month,” he added. He said the Africa athletics Championships in Nigeria are also top on his agenda and if everything remains constant, he will honour the event. As usual, he believes steeplechase will be a Kenyan affair and sees no much opposition here. Obiri, who also arrived together with Kipruto, echoed the same sentiments. She said Commonwealth Games hold a special place in her heart and that is why she is here. Like Kipruto, she said she intends to honor the Diamond League series and the Africa Championships in the coming months. She also said she is feeling great after delaying back home for the purposes of training. Obiri and Kipruto arrived alongside Margaret Chelimo, Eva Cherono (5,000m); Amos Kirui, Abraham Kibiwott (3,000m steeplechase) and 10,000m trio of Rodgers Kwemoi, Jonathan Muia and Josphat Bett.
