A petition was filed yesterday in the National Assembly seeking to increase the number of constituencies from 290 to 300. The petition was filed by Embu resident Ezekiel Njeru. It also seeks to have MPs amend Article 98 of the Constitution on the Senate membership and Article 101 on election of members of Parliament. He wants MPs term increased from the current five years to six.
Senators’ term should be increased from five to seven years, it says. Njeru wants MPs to reduce the term of the President from five to four years. The petition has been committed to the Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs chaired by Baringo North MP William Cheptumo.
He wants to abolish academic requirements for MPs and MCAs.
Njeru wants the county assemblies allowed to use local languages in their proceedings.
National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi, who presented the petition to the House, told the MPs the petition “requires thoughtful consideration as they propose to fundamentally alter the architecture of our Constitution”.
The team has 60 days to consider the petition and report its findings to the petitioner and the House. Read: No new constituencies will be created in IEBC boundaries review, says Kapondi  Click here for the latest political news
