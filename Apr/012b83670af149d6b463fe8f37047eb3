Pressure is mounting on electoral agency CEO Ezra Chiloba to leave office after he was sent on compulsory leave to pave way for investigation of procurement irregularities. Yesterday, lobby Civil Society Reference Group demanded Chiloba immediately resign because “he has lost public trust needed to continue serving in such a crucial office.” It accused Chiloba of colluding with officers from EACC and DCI to frustrate a probe into poll officials whose actions led to the Supreme Court’s nullification of the August 8 presidential election. CSRG linked Chiloba to problems in the management of last year’s polls. “Ezra Chiloba lost the moral authority to head the IEBC Secretariat the moment he led a section of the secretariat in defying the Supreme Court directive to open the server,” lobby convener Suba Churchil said. “His resignation will be a big step in the country’s quest for democracy.” AUDIT On Friday last week, a commission plenary meeting chaired by IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati resolved to send Chiloba on three-months’ leave as it continues an audit. Chebukati confirmed the decision was based on queries in the audit report that the polls agency undertook following the protracted and disputed 2017 polls. Chebukati has previously raised questions regarding technology-related procurements. He said on Monday, “...it was decided through majority voting to expand the audit scope and that the CEO proceed on compulsory leave for three months.” Read:CEO Chiloba suspended, IEBC in chaos Also Read:Chebukati defends Chiloba's suspension, says to pave way for probe Click here for the latest political news
