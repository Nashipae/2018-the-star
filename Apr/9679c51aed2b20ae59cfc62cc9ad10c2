Nyali MP Mohamed Ali has declared war on drugs in Mombasa. It is a dangerous and difficult task. “If you are afraid of dying, let me deal with it because I don’t fear death. Mothers do not cry when I smoke out drug lords,” Ali said in Kongowea on Saturday. He spoke during the launch of the Nyali national government CDF Bursary Fund. Ali issued Sh25 million bursaries to at alrast 3,000 secondary, college and university students in Nyali the constituency. There are too many zombies on the streets of Mombasa because of the drug menace, Ali said. Ali Drugs are killing many youth. Drug lords build palatial homes "by killing children of the poor". According to anti-narcotic police, Mombasa has more than 323,000 drug addicts. Kilifi has at least 329,000 addicts, Kwale has more than 168,000, Tana River (88,000), Taita Taveta (58,000) and Lamu 32,000 adrug addicts. "If you spoil our children, Mohamed will be on your case. Let whatever will come, come. If you truly want us to finish the drugs crisis in Mombasa, give us chance when we start the operation,” Ali said. In 2015, President Uhuru Kenyatta declared total war against drugs. His administration will destroy any vessel on land, sea or air that is confirmed to be carrying drugs, Uhuru said. He made the remarks two weeks after the Kenya Navy destroyed a luxurious yacht found carrying 7.5kg of heroin with a street value estimate at Sh29 million. In February last year, the President made a similar declaration after the destruction of MV Noor. It is reported to have smuggled Sh1.3 billion heroin in Kenya, while MV Baby Iris had approximately Sh22 million heroin on board. Ali was instrumental in the amendment of the law against drug trafficking, which saw the fine for traffickers rise from Sh5 million to at least Sh30 million. “And when investigations are ongoing, all the assets of the suspect will be ceased by the government. You cannot kill our children with drugs,” the former journalist said.
