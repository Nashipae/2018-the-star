Construction of the proposed Sh35billion Arror Dam in Elgeyo Marakwet is likely to take longer as locals opposing the project have resorted to court action. The multipurpose dam is funded by the Italian government and will be implemented by Kerio Valley Development Authority. Families opposing the project have written to the Italian embassy after KVDA defied temporary court orders restraining the state agency from proceeding with the project pending a High Court case challenging the dam. Residents from three villages – Kipsaiya, Kamok and Kaptul - yesterday threatened to sue the Italian government for trespassing on their land. Resident John Kibor said KVDA is looking for land to compensate them when proper consultation has not been done. “We have heard that a committee comprising those supporting the project and KVDA are looking for land to resettle us in Trans Nzoia county without our knowledge,” he said. Kibor said locals are preparing to plant on the proposed land after KVDA failed to consult locals. Through their lawyer David Omboto, the residents went to the High Court in Eldoret to halt the project and secured orders on November 8. “Facts placed before us indicate that the construction of Arror multipurpose dam is simply opposed because there has not been adequate village representation, consultation or participation as provided for under the constitution,” the letter read. The letter signed by Omboto accused the local administration and politicians of colluding to achieve unwarranted targets to the detriment of locals. Locals told the High Court the dam will have a negative impact on the livelihood of locals.
