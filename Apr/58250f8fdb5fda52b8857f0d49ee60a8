Kitui county assembly chief whip Stephen Musili has said voters are giving elected leaders a hard time, demanding that their unschooled children be given jobs. “We need to ensure our children are well educated before asking for jobs for them,” the Kyuso MCA said. He added that it is hard securing a job for someone who dropped out of school. Musili spoke at Mivukoni Primary School in his Kyuso ward during a prize giving day. The top candidate in the 2017 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examination and top subject teachers were awarded. Musili promised to pay secondary school first term fees for the top candidate next year.
