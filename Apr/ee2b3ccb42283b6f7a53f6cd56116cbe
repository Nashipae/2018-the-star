Tuskys Supermarket employees have threated to go on strike in two weeks time over unfair labour practices meted on them by their employer. They have issued a strike notice through the Kenya Union of Commercial Food and Allied Workers. In the notice, seen by the Star, the employees are complaining about massive transfer of shop stewards and refusal by their employer to recognise them as workers representative. Also among their complains, is “ outright defiance of a court judgment” by Tuskys supermarket in respect to outsourced labour and disciplinary action against shop stewards perceived to be leading the union membership recruitment of outsourced workers. Thirdly, the employers have raised concerns on ongoing threats, and disciplinary transfers against out-sourced workers. “Our efforts to have these grievances resolved through dialogue have not been successful while at the same time, the employer continues with her assault against the union and its members with the intention to interfere with workers fundamental rights of freedom of association,” the unions secretary general Boniface Kavuvi said. He added that upon expiry of the notice, workers will down their tools without further consultation of the employer unless action is taken to stop the unlawful actions. Speaking to the Star on Phone, Tuskys Human Resource manager Joshua Wambua declined to have received the notice nor having any knowledge of the planned strike. In 2013 December, Tuskys employees through KUCFAW had downed their tools alleging that the management had failed to honour a Collective Bargaining Agreement signed in March of the same year. The strike saw 17 staff of the retailer suspended.
