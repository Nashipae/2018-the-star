The hearing of a case appealed by six Nyeri county residents against a court ruling that upheld Jubilee Party MCAs’ nomination will continue on May 11. Chief magistrate Wendy Kagendo had upheld the nominations of 12 out of the 13 Nyeri MCAs. Led by Margaret Nyathogora and Lucy Wanyitu, the residents yesterday faulted the decision. They said the nominations should be declared null and void for violating the Constitution. The residents through lawyer Samuel Ndung’u want Nyeri High Court Judge Jairus Ngaah to set aside the magistrate’s judgment. “The magistrate failed to make specific declarations and orders with respect to the non-inclusion of people living with disabilities in the Nyeri county assembly, despite finding the same to be a valid issue of concern,” Ndung’u said.
