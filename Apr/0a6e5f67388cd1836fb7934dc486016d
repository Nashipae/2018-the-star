A chopper carrying Lugari MP Ayub Savula and three others made an emergency landing inside Soysambu conservancy in Nakuru on Sunday evening. The chopper which was headed to Nairobi from Kakamega was forced to make an emergency landing due to unfavourable weather conditions. "When we arrived in Nakuru few minutes to 5 o'clock it was cloudy and we couldn't move further. The pilot tried to use a different direction but we could not move for more than 10 min but it was not possible. That's why the pilot was forced to make an emergency landing." Savula told the Star. He added: "We tried to call the security chiefs from Western to link us with the Nakuru officers. The officers managed to find us after three and a half hours." The MP was travelling with his body guard and West Kabras MCALazarus Anaswa. "We thank the security officers, we thank God for ensuring we are safe," Savula said. They will spend the night at Lake Nakuru Lodge and will continue with their journey to Nairobi on Monday.
