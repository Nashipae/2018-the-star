As the rains continue to pour heavily in most parts of the country, Weiwei farmers in Pokot have predicted a bumper harvest this season. Rainfall has started earlier than usual. Members of the Weiwei Farmersâ€™ Association, which falls under the irrigation scheme, have planted early and partnered with Kenya Seed Company Ltd to obtain seeds and fertiliser in advance. Payment is made after harvest and sale of produce. Association chairman Mark Meut yesterday said the scheme has helped farmers fight hunger and improve their standards of living. One thousand farmers have enrolled for the Sh3 million partnership with Kenya Seed Company. Meut said farmers will get 100 per cent yield. Drought has hurt output in previous years. Meut said farmers plan to diversify from maize seed production to ensure food security. He called for joint efforts to deal with the armyworm menace. Although the rains have brought good tidings, Meut said flooding has made farmers incur losses. He urged residents to plant trees and build dykes on the upper parts of River Weiwei which sometimes bursts its banks. Farmers Stephen Tingoria and Susan Lokomoiywo said they are optimistic of a bumper harvest because they planted in good time and used certified seeds. They said they are happy with the management of the scheme. Maize for seed production fetches Sh60 per kg. This translates to between Sh70 and Sh100 million expected this year as the farms produce thousands of sacks.
