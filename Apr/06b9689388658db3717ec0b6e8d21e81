Suspected bandits killed a Tugen herder and stole 50 cows from Ngaratuko, Baringo North sub-county, on Saturday night. Victim Reuben Rutto and other residents had been helping National Police Reservists to repulse six bandits who attacked the village at around 7pm. "There was a fierce exchange of fire before he was shot in the head," Loruk assistant chief Samuel Kamuren said. Rutto died while being rushed to Baringo County Referral Hospital in Kabarnet. Kamuren said the stolen animals belonged to herder Laban Sumukwo and that they were driven towards Kading-ding in Tiaty sub-county. The incident took place amid the circumcision of more than 2,000 Pokot girls, aged between nine and 14, in Tiaty. Tugen elder Joshua Katya said: "We suspect Pokot bandits are carrying out raids to pay the expensive dowry charged for the girls once they graduate from initiation." Katya asked the government to fast-track the deployment of more NPRs. Three weeks ago, bandits attacked Kashiela in Baringo South and stole 100 cows from three Tugen herders. Last week, Baringo County Commissioner Henry Wafula said they will soon recruit and deploy NPRs to curb the cattle rustling menace.
