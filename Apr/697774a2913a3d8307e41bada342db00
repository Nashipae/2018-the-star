The government has identified 2,000 acres of land in three counties in the North Rift region for resettlement of families to be displaced by the construction of the Sh63 billion Arror Multi-Purpose Dam in Elgeyo Marakwet. Kerio Valley Development Authority CEO David Kimosop yesterday said more than Sh80 billion will be used to compensate land to the 800 families that will be affected. The residents will be resettled in Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo Marakwet and Trans Nzoia. KVDA, last month involved NLC to help in the land acquisition process. “The process is going in well and we took the families for a tour of the farms to see for themselves the property and they have given us the go ahead to prepare the sale agreement and other logistics a head of their resettlement,” Kimosop said. The families will be settled in phases to ensure transparency and fairness in order to avoid acrimony and suspicion in the process. “None of the families who will give up the land will be left out and we have taken extra care and working under the law to ensure everything is done smoothly in the purchase of the land then resettlement of the families”, Kimosop said. NLC Chairman Muhammed Swazuri says they will now move the area to start the process of acquisition for the land.
