    A man who killed his girlfriend after a quarrel over a firearm has been remanded for a week awaiting to face murder charges. Patrick Nyagilo failed to take plea because he was not represented by a lawyer. He was to be charged with killing Elizabeth Kalekye on January 31 at Utawala in Embakasi. “We cannot have the accused person to plead to the charges because he is not represented by a lawyer since the charge is serious," the prosecution said. Justice Jessie Lessit granted the prosecution’s application and allowed police to detain the accused for seven days as he gets a lawyer. Police said Kalekye was Nyagilo's girlfriend. The two committed crimes in Embakasi. Police said the deceased borrowed gun from Nyagilo to go and use for some work but delayed to return it. It is alleged that this made Nyagilo very furious as he had other missions to do using the same gun. On the fateful day, the suspected is alleged to have lured Kalekye to Utawala area where he was in company of another man. A disagreement ensued after the meeting over the gun as she failed to give Nyagilo a reasonable explanation why he had faulted to return it. Nyagilo then pulled a gun from his waist and shot the deceased in the chest several times and immediately fled away leaving Kalekye lying in a pool of blood. Members of the public out of curiosity, rushed at the scene and found the deceased in a pool of blood. They rushed her to the nearest hospital where she was pronounced dead on arrival. The matter was reported to Kayole police station and police recovered two spent cartridges of 9mm and one misfired cartridge of 9mm. The case will be mentioned on April 9 when the accused will plead to the charges.
