NGO Plan International has partnered with the civil registry to distribute 1,500 birth certificates to pupils in Homa Bay. Regional manager Raphael Aoko said the majority of schoolgoing children are from poor families and cannot afford to pay for the document. “We’re helping the children access the documents so they pursue their education without a problem,” he said. Aoko spoke yesterday at Ngengu Primary School in Rangwe constituency. Plan International will also help pupils from Ndhiwa, Suba North and South subcounties get their birth certificates. “The organisation has come in to save parents from unscrupulous middlemen who swindle them of a lot of money in pursuit of the documents,” Aoko said. He expressed concern over the rise in dropouts because of poverty and teen pregnancy. “We’re appealing to education stakeholders to develop and implement policies that will ensure the rights of the juvenile are protected,” Aoko said. Parents of special needs children were urged to enrol them in school. “Don’t deny any child their right to education because they are disabled,” Aoko said. Registrar Henocks Kola urged parents to register for birth certificates.
