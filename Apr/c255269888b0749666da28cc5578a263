University student leaders in Eldoret have accused Education CS Amina Mohamed of failing to quickly end the lecturers’ strike so they can resume learning. Led by Moi University students’ union secretary Moses Tisa,the students said they had missed many lessons while parents who paid fees have incurred heavy losses. “We urge the CS to help end the strike by negotiating with the unions to agree on the delayed CBA agreement,” Tisa said. The student leaders said frequent strikes degrade education. On Tuesday, more than 1,200 staff at Moi University vowed to remain on strike and escalate the boycott that is now in the second month. They demand the government present a counter-offer and implement the delayed 2017-21 CBA. Kenya Universities Staff Union top officials urged Amina to initiate fresh dialogue.
