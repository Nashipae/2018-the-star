A new malaria vaccine to be introduced in Kenya will reduce the number of deaths in children by 30 per cent. The vaccine, known as RTSS, will be introduced on a pilot basis by the Health ministry and WHO later this year. The pilot will also cover Malawi and Ghana. The vaccine will be initiated in four doses - the first will be given at six months, while the last will be given at two years. RTSS will target children between five months and six years. A syringe vaccine will be initiated in parts of Western with a high malaria prevalence rate. According to WHO, 75 per cent of Kenya’s population is at risk of contracting malaria. Pregnant women and children below the age of five are the most vulnerable. During the Kenya Pediatric Association Annual Scientific Conference in Mombasa on Thursday, Kemri researcher Sam Aketch said the vaccine will prevent 40 per cent of new infections and 60 per cent of anaemia cases in children.  TARGETS “This new tool will add to the existing tools we are using and has potential to prevent several infections. The vaccine has been shown from studies to prevent up to 40 per cent of infections,” Aketch said. If the initial phase meets targeted results for prevention of the disease, it will be recommended by WHO and the government and more will be bought. Unicef official Peter Okoth urged caregivers to make sure they take their children for all scheduled immunisations. He said the number of children being vaccinated has drastically reduced, making them vulnerable to diseases such as measles and polio. “Ninety per cent of children used to be vaccinated and this has reduced. If the children are not vaccinated, they will be vulnerable,” Okoth said. Reports show 500,000 children have not been completing their immunisation schedule, especially for measles and polio.
