The move to ban the trade has drawn mixed reactions from residents and local leaders. Many support the directive. A local leader Samuel Kiratu welcomed the decision, terming it timely. He said it would help save the environment that has been degraded. Reidnets said they were alarmed by the manner in which sand harvesting was being carried out in the area.
