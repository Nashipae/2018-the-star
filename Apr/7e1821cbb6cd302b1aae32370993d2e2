Agriculture recorded a drop in economic growth from 5.1 per cent to 1.6 percent, the latest Economic survey data shows. There was an overall decline in production due to drought, the fall army worm and diseases. But despite the reduced production of major crops during the period under review, all the produce sold locally and internationally realized better prices. The report stated that the value of marketed production increased by 8.2 percent from Sh413.2 billion in 2016 to Sh446.9 billion in 2017. This is the lowest growth performance the sector has recorded since 2013 which was at 5.6 percent, then declined to 4.5 percent in 2014. In 2015, it increased to six percent. In 2016, the sector recorded a 5.1 percent growth which has now dropped to 1.6 per cent. National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich acknowledged that the sector posted mixed performance leading to slowed growth of 1.6 percent. “The government has identified three broad areas in 2018 that will ensure the country achieves food security and improve nutrition. Enhancing of large scale production, boosting small holder productivity and reducing the cost of food have been identified as the measures that will scale up the agriculture value chain,” he said while launching the 2018 economic survey report. Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) director general, Zachary Mwangi noted that maize production declined from 37.8 million bags in 2016 to 35.4 million bags in 2017.

Wheat production declined by 23.1 percent from 214,700 metric tonnes in 2016 to 165,200 metric tonnes in 2017,” Mwangi said. Tea production reduced by seven percent to 439,800 mt in 2017, while exported coffee dropped by 15.1 percent to 33,700 mt.
