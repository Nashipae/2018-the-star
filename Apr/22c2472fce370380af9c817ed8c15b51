The Kitui county government is mulling private criminal prosecution against crew members of two lorries impounded with charcoal, who were released by the court Maurice Kimuli, the county government lawyer, has written to Kitui principal magistrate Johnson Munguti who gave the orders to release the lorries. He sought  leave to conduct private prosecution. He said there was unwillingness to prosecute the crew members who violated a ban on charcoal burning and trade in the county. The crew members the county government wants prosecuted privately are Stephen Thairu, John Njenga and Josesph Mwangi, according to Kimuli’s letter dated April 12. The letter was  written a day after Munguti ordered  the release of the lorries and crew members who had  been arrested. He said there was no basis to continue holding them. Kimuli said as the  people’s representative, the county government was aggrieved by  the by the ruling  and  would  seek orders to challenge it in a higher court.
