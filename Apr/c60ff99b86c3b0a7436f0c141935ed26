Chandarana Supermarkets is the most loyal retailer and will be easily recommended to a friend, a customer service survey has found out. The supermarket is among the oldest retailers, having started in 1964 as a grocery shop. The survey by Net Promoter Score (NPS) industry benchmark for the first quarter 2018 rates the supermarket as one that customers would recommend to family and friends. NPS is a customer loyalty metric, and is based on a question that respondents answer rating it on a scale of zero to 10. According to the survey, customers would recommend Co-operative Bank as their lender of choice, while for energy service providers, customers feel that Total Fuel Services is loyal to their needs. Telkom Kenya fared well as the phone service provider of choice when it comes to taking care of their customer needs. According to the global mobile-first consumer experience and feedback platform leveraging text messages and mobile messaging to simplify access to credible, on-demand information from Africa and other emerging regions, retailer and television cable service provider DSTV emerged tops in taking care of their clientsâ€™ needs. Customers chose UAP Old Mutual as insurer who is most loyal, and Aga Khan Hospital their loyal health facility. According to the mSurvey, businesses are adopting the use of benchmarking surveys to know the industry standards that they are measured against, and to compare their performance with industry competition.
