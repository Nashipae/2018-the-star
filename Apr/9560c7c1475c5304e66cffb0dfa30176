Education CS Amina Mohamed on Friday asked for help from the UK government to implement the new curriculum. Amina, who is on a visit to London, held talks with Director of Assessment Research and Development at Cambridge Assessment Tim Oates. She said Kenya can obtain invaluable insights on curriculum review and development from the UK, which has experience on competency and knowledge-based curriculum frameworks. Education players in Kenya say the implementation has been slow due to poor training and lack of materials. Amina said the government will conduct an assessment on the implementation in August. The International Bureau of Education recommends that curricula be reviewed every five years.
