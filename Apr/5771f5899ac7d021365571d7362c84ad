â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹Let me also cry. I have lost count of the number of prominent personalities
that I heard this week paying glowing tribute to Kenneth Matiba. It was curious
how some contorted their faces to convey their deep sense of loss or grief at the
departed superman, yet they had the wherewithal to lift him from the pain he
endured. Such effort, genuine or contrived, got me thinking how absurdly we
feign love and passion for people who matter, or about whom we know little — for the sake of political correctness. Even respect for your enemy is a great honour and
Matiba truly deserved to be celebrated by both those who loved and killed him
alike. Yet as we applaud the valiant struggles of the one who bore
the brunt of the struggle for the freedom we enjoy, we are not shy to desecrate
the tombs of democracy and caress today's tyranny. Yes, Matiba today was
Miguna of yesteryear. But for those who wondered in the past week what all the fuss was
about, Matiba was a mentor and icon in the true sense of the word, to many. He was a missionary who stuck to his faith with rare
consistency. Moi had to order his detention, together with that of Charles Rubia, days
before the Saba Saba rally in 1990, at which he was to unveil the first party
and launch the crusade for multipartyism. That was the turning point. In
detention, he would suffer a stroke that impaired his abilities and although he
survived, he never recovered fully. I can say without batting an eyelid that he
is the one who broke the back of Kanu and Moi's dictatorship. The country owes
him. But my generation owes him more. Everyone has a small beginning in life and for me, it was at
Matiba's feet that I began my career as a journalist. I had just crawled out of
journalism school, armed with a degree and hungry for a job like everyone else.
But I was particularly furious with the oppression that surrounded us. I found ventilation
at The People weekly newspaper, which was just beginning. It would later become
the nursery for some of the most prolific writers defined by the passion they
shared of poking holes in tyranny. It was early 1992 and the People was in its fourth week of
publication. I sauntered into the blue-and-white offices of Kalamka Ltd at
Westview in Westlands. In the same compound as the block housing the Nairobi
booking office of the Alliance Hotels was a small four-room bungalow that
became the war room of one of the most ferocious journalism machines. After a small
conversation, Virginia the receptionist led me to a yawning living room where a
bespectacled fellow with a wry smile welcomed me to a seat. "You are
Makali?" he posed, suppressing a chuckle. Kamau Ngotho, it
turned out, had been reading some of the letters to the editor and opinions I
had been writing to the Kenya Times while in college. We broke into stories and
light banter at the end of which I ended up joining The People as the fourth
member of a tiny editorial team comprising features writer Kiruri Kamau, chief
sub Peter Kiongo and John Kamau. I would subsequently meet an elderly serial smoker respected
like the commander-in-chief of this operation — George Mbugguss, the consulting
editor — who was serving his retirement here. He had risen from a little-educated
cub reporter to Editor-in-Chief of the Daily Nation. He took a quizzical look
at me and concluded I was fit for purpose. Well, let me just say that we went to
work and made every Friday memorable for newspaper readers in Nairobi with exclusive
investigative stories. Yes, we would be trailed and threatened every day by
security intelligence; newspapers would be impounded or bought off the
streets by Special Branch; we would be sued. But we kept going and every week
the People would hit the streets unapologetically with offending headlines
about government malfeasance. We joined the special league of the combative pro-democracy alternative media — Gitobu Imanyara's Nairobi Law Monthly, Njehu
Gatabaki of Finance, Blamwel Njururi's Kenya Confidential, Pius Nyamora's Society
and later Tony Gachoka’s The Post. They gave birth to Kenya's democracy. For reasons of space, I will not delve into finer details
here, but we could not have accomplished all that we did without the patronage
and unflinching defiance of Matiba and his family — steely, jolly, warm and
convivial, even under state terror. The newspaper business was steered by Ivy,
reserved and disciplined compared to Susan, her elder sister and bubbly
socialite who sang with Susan Kibukosya in a girl band. Rarely, would you bump
into first-born Raymond who spent time at the Coast managing the family's
flagship Alliance Hotels with Julie. Each of the children had taken a special
attribute from their dad but it was the tranquil spirit of the mother, Edith,
that was the glue holding the family together. After a while Kalamka Ltd gave way to Independent Media
Services as publishers of The People. Advertisers would be intimidated into
withdrawing advertisement but that did not deter the paper from its motto —
'Fair, Frank and Fearless'. Although he owned the paper, never once did Matiba
call to order or instruct us what to report or not print. We were a bunch of
self-propelled missionaries committed to justice, democracy and human rights.
Sometimes we even defied him. And When I, then a 26-year old firebrand, was
hauled to jail with my editor Bedan Mbugua, we knew we going against Matiba’s
will. But he, too, knew we were forced on that road by a greater good. The path
he had paved along with other gallant predecessors, including some who became
our advocates — John Khaminwa, Gitobu Imanyara and  among others. But Matiba was not the kind to betray or abandon a cause. You
held the ace. As I sat in the cell at the High Court basement waiting to begin
my prison term at Kamiti, Edith Matiba came down with lawyer Khaminwa and
Imanyara armed with a cheque for Sh300,000. She implored me accept to pay the
fine and apologise to the court for contempt. And for the second time, I
respectfully declined. To apologise to that system was the ultimate surrender to
injustice and betrayal of our cause. After serving 30 days
of my three months' sentence at Kamiti and Manyani prisons, Bedan and I were back in court
for review. Justice RSC Omollo took one hateful look at us and pointedly
stated, "You have the key to unlock the gates of prison." There was
no choice. Within minutes, we were hauled into the Black Maria destined for Manyani Maximum Security Prison. From isolation Cell No 8 and comrade Bedan two cells apart
in No 10, we knew anything could happen. And a lot did before end of our terms. It is here that the
political detainees Raila, Matiba, Imanyara, the late George Anyona, and others framed
as dangerous by the state, had been confined. On the way out to the quarry every
morning to crush ballast, I would occasionally stop by and peep into a special
cell that was covered all over with wire mesh. It was the notorious cell in
which Matiba had suffered a stroke before being taken back to Nairobi and
airlifted to London for treatment. Life. Although he is gone, I will always remember Matiba for giving
our generation the chance to live our dreams and for standing up when it
counted most. Where others would cower and groan under the feet of the mighty,
he stood resolute like a pillar. And on his back others rose. Together with
lawyer Pheroze Nowrojee and Imanyara — whose
Nairobi Law Monthly provided the bridge to the world — I will always treasure
his mentorship. The flame of freedom that you lit will forever burn.  Long live.
