The ruling in a case in which Neno
Evangelism Ministries pastor James
Ng’ang’a is accused of causing
death by dangerous driving was
yesterday postponed for the sixth
time. The court was expected to decide
whether Ng’ang’a, his co-accused
Simon Kuria - who presented him-
self as the driver of a Range Rover
that was involved in a crash - Kenya
Police Airwing inspector Chris-
topher Nzioka and officer Patrick
Baya had a case to answer. Ng’ang’a is accused of causing
death by dangerous driving, failing
to report that he can been involved
in a fatal crash and giving false in-
formation. He was allegedly driv-
ing Range Rover Sport KCD060Q
carelessly and collided head-on
with a Nissan March KBZ 709W
at Manguo area in Limuru, caus-
ing the death Mercy Njeri on July
26, 2015. Ng’ang’a has denied the
charges. APPEAL Njeri’s family were told the case
had been postponed when a court
clerk advised them to come back
on May 4. The clerk said magistrate
Godfrey Oduor was transferred to Martin Mbugua with prosecutor Cathrine Mwaniki at Limuru law courts yesterday /GEORGE MUGO Nakuru early last year and will be
back in Limuru on May 4 to deliver
the decision. Oduor was promoted
from senior principal magistrate to
chief magistate. Kuria and Nzioka
are accused of giving false informa-
tion while Baya, who was the Tigo-
ni police station base commander,
denied the charge of neglecting his
duties. Njeri’s family is now appealling
to Chief Justice David Maraga to
intervene. Njeri’s widower Martin
Mbugua said the magistrate and the accused have never appeared in
the court for any hearing. “We are wasting a lot of time. We
are not sure if the case will proceed
on the date they issued today,” he
said. “We are surprised the last time
we saw the trial magistrate and
accused persons was in July last
year.” Mbugua said state counsel Cath-
rine Mwaniki from Office of the
DPP was present, only to find the
case had been postponed.
