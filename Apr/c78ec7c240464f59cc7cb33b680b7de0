Garissa residents living along the now swollen River Tana and flood prone areas have been advised to move to safer grounds. Area county commissioner Joshua Chepchieng’ told the press in his office on Friday that the water levels at river Tana has risen from the normal 4.0 meters to 4.9 meters posing a great danger to residents near the river. Chepchieng said the most affected area include Mansabubu in Fafi Sub-County, Gurufa in Lagdera Sub-County, parts of Balambala and Dadaab sub-counties. The county commissioner said that roads to Bura, Masalani, Balambala, Modogashe are impassable and getting relief food to these areas is ‘almost impossible’. “We have just come out of a severe drought situation to a very wet one. We have received above normal rains. Last night it rained for over 10 hours continuously. We are foreseeing flooding along the river Tana,” he said. The Kenya Red Cross, as well as Sub-county administrator and chiefs are on the ground assessing and monitoring the situation with a view of providing assistance to those in need. Chepchieng said the county steering group which he chairs instructed key ministries of health, water, public works, livestock and agriculture to scale up their activities in readiness for floods. The meteorological department said the rains will continue until early may. Kenya Red county coordinator Tusmo Ogle said toilets in many Bullas (villages) in the outskirts of Garissa town caved in last night following the heavy down pour. “We fear for possible outbreak of cholera and other water borne diseases. We have sent out teams to access the damages and requirements for the affected families in Gurufa, Bura and other flooded areas in Dadaab sub-county,” she said.
