Online shopping platform, Orion Online Mall has opened to tackle delays as it promises Nairobi consumers fresh foodstuff at the click of a button. The shop will work with Vendura Groceries, Orion Brice Technologies for printing and branding, BaldevMarkel Logistics for logistics and courier services GoldenScape Architectures, and Tree Africa Nurseries for tree planting and harvesting. Founder Peter Wangai said Kenyans will be access products from 10 companies who are already selling on the platform. “One of the greatest challenges in online shopping is costly delivery and delayed delivery. We will reduce delivery charges and ensure immediate delivery unlike others that take from 24 hours to seven days,” Wangai said. The shopping experience will include tracking goods from store to consumer. The subsidiary of GoldenScape Group with Sh25 million is registering traffic of 100 to 500 people daily. “The company is partnering with China investors to manufacture Orion branded items such as phones, shoes,” Wangai said. Online shopping in Kenya has grown exponentially due to adoption of technology and changing shopping habits.
