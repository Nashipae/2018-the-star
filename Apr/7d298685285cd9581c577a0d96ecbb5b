The last group of farmers whose land was acquired for construction of the Sh20 billion Thiba Dam in Kirinyaga county will be paid by August, the government has said. The government has set aside Sh400 million to compensate the farmers. Irrigation PS Fred Sigor said the dam will hold 15 million cubic metres of water, which will help alleviate the shortage in the largest rice-growing irrigation scheme. He spoke on Monday during a tour of Mwea irrigation scheme. Sigor said the total compensation payout is Sh5.2 billion and the majority of farmers have been compensated. Sigor said the county’s economy will greatly improve when the dam is complete. “This project is one of the key projects aimed at ensuring food security in the country and that is why the government wants the construction completed on time,” he said. Double production The contractor is on site and Sigor said structures are being put in place before construction starts. He urged leaders and residents to support the project. “We are currently producing 80,000 tonnes of pure Pishori rice from Mwea irrigation scheme and we hope to double it and at the same time increase the acreage from 16,000 to 24,000 acres when the dam is completed,” Sigor said. Kenya faces an annual rice deficit of 400,000 tonnes of the national consumption requirements, which is estimated ato be 540,000 tonnes. Ensuring self-sufficiency in the production of maize, rice and potatoes is among the top agenda in achieving food security under the Jubilee government’s Big Four Plan.
