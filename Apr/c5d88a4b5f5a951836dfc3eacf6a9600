Complex procurement procedures and graft are the greatest setbacks to universal healthcare, a medical expert has said. Prof Khama Rogo, a global health specialist, yesterday called for a solution to complex procurement procedures that hurt service delivery. “Procurement of human resources, health equipment and pharmaceuticals should be efficient for a successful universal healthcare coverage in this continent,” he said in his keynote address during the universal healthcare conference in Wote, Makueni. Rogo urged health departments to ensure proper maintenance of purchased equipment. Poor maintenance leads to loss of funds that can be channelled the health sector, he said. Planning and Devolution PS Julius Muia told the county governments to partner with the Health ministry, development agencies and local universities to come up with sustainable universal healthcare systems. “You need to find out innovative financing, management and maintenance frameworks that can help us. Universal healthcare is quite expensive but a basic requirement for our people,” he said. Kenya has achieved 56 per cent of Vision 2030’s health projects against 53 per cent for all sectors, Muia said. Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana said the universal healthcare programme started by the county three years ago can be a building block of the scheme driven by President Uhuru Kenyatta for the country. The programme covers about 72,000 households. He said it is costly and uses 30 per cent of the cash allocated to the county. Kibwana called for alternative ways of funding to make such programmes sustainable. Residents enroled in the programme enjoy free healthcare services in all county health facilities.
