A National Assembly committee has said police officers living conditions across Kenya are poor, many of them share houses. The Parliamentary Security and Administration Committee chairman Paul Koinange on Saturday said police officers lack privacy. He was speaking at Tigoni police station in when he toured Limuru and Kabete police stations and camps. He said the committee would work with the Interior ministry and the office of Inspector General of police Joseph Boinnet to increase police houses and offices.
