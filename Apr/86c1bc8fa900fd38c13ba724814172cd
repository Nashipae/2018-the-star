Garissa Governor Ali Korane wants the UN refugee agency to find alternative sources of energy — not wood and charcoal — for 230,000 refugees at the Dadaab camps. Speaking on Monday in Balambala subcounty, the governor said refugees have left a trail of destruction that will take decades to repair. The countrywide moratorium on logging, imposed on February 26, is ignored by refugees, though residents have demanded compliance. UNHCR said on Tuesday it is providing energy-saving stoves and gas and will work with other organisations to fix the 30-year-old problem. Korane said the UN should stop issuing licenses for cutting trees for fuel wood and charcoal burning. “We have accommodated them as brothers and sisters but that does not mean we allow them to deny us our environment,” Korane said. “It’s high time we explore alternative means of energy that do not directly affect our already fragile environment,” he added. The governor plans to attend a UN conference in Geneva this year to argue that UNHCR must be compelled to come up with alternative sources of energy. “UNHCR must take responsibility for massive environmental destruction in Dadaab. They must come up with long- and short-term plans to restore the environment,” he said. Early this year the host community held demonstrations in Dadaab town, blaming UNHCR for desertification that has undermined their own sources of livelihood. “The land can’t support regrowth of pasture because the ground is bare and all fertile topsoil washed away by flash floods and wind erosion,” pastoralist Abdullahi said. He said some pastoralists are destitute and many animals have died for lack pasture and water during the drought.
