Construction of James Gichuru Road has been paralysed for four days as employees of a Chinese contractor boycott work, demanding better pay. The road is being expanded into six lanes on each side for Sh16.3 billion — running up to Rironi area along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. The workers began their strike on Tuesday. They say they are paid Sh40 per hour and work from 8am to 6pm. From this, they pay the NHIF, the NSSF and PAYE. “The money we receive after all deductions is very little. There are those who work until 12pm from 8am. Some of us have families and we live in rented houses,” one worker said. China Wu Yi says it treats and pays the employees well in compliance with the labour laws. An officer who sought anonymity blamed the protests on incitement by trade unionists. On Wednesday, police tear-gassed more than 100 workers. The workers demanded to speak with World Bank officials who had visited the site. “The company doesn’t want the donor to know what we go through,” one protester said. They went on strike on Tuesday, when they were informed the donor was in the country to inspect the projects they fund. The workers say they earn low salaries and their earlier efforts to seek pay hike were unsuccessful. The workers also demand enough protective gears for their safety. Before the protests, Sigona MCA Naphtali Munyaka and Kiambu county labour officer Joel Ong’weno sought to intervene and spoke to officials of the company. “We agreed they [workers] select 10 people and we accompany them to their [China Wu Yi] offices in Kikuyu for talks” Munyaka said. The 10 selected and they went to their offices, police dispersed them, prompting those who remained at the site to protest. The protesters blocked the road leading a traffic jam. Riot police were called in and they cleared the highway.
