Kenya Lionesses have set their sights on winning the Africa Cup Sevens next month in Botswana next month.
Speaking yesterday on arrival from Gold Coast, following the conclusion of the Commonwealth Games head coach Kevin Wambua expressed satisfaction with the team's performances and said winning  the Africa Cup is now a possibility.
“We played two events, the World Sevens qualifiers and the Commonwealth Games, and the girls played their hearts out in both. We have a great momentum heading to the African event,” said Wambua.
The tournament in Gaberone will feature holders South Africa, hosts Botswana, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal, Madagascar and Mauritius.
The Lionesses beat the Africa's top ranked team, South Africa, twice edging them 24-12 at the World Series Sevens qualifiers in Hong Kong and 19-10 at the Commonwealth Games and Wambua said they have nothing to be afraid of playing the South Africans next month. "I told everyone its only a matter of time before we beat them and we got them twice. Now we want to go and win thew Africa sevens trophy,” noted Wambua
The Lionesses finished sixth at the Commonwealth Games. They lost 45-0 to eventual gold medallists New Zealand in the opener and 24-12 to Olympic bronze medallists Canada to be relegated to the classification matches, where they beat Wales 14-12 and lost 40-5 to Fiji in the fifth-place playoff.
Wambua said they had learnt lessons from the Club Games which will be vital going forward. "We have a good crop of players and there are certain areas of improvement we need to work on but I am confident that, in the next one or two years, we will be able to qualify for the Wold Series and be a strong medal contender come the next Commonwealth Games.
