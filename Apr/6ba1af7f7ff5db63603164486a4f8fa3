The number of trainees enrolled in teacher training institutions rose by 1.9 per cent in 2017, a report by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics has revealed. The general enrollment stood at 42,131 from 41,707. Those admitted for first year also rose to 10,746 in 2017 from 10,434 the previous year. This comes against a backdrop of claims of a decline of enrollment. According to the Ministry of Education, the enrollment drop in the colleges has declined in the last two years due to poor performance in national examinations and fewer application made to the institutions compared to the slots available. However, the Economic Survey 2018 released yesterday disputed the claims, citing a slight increase.
