Safaricom has announced the partnering of M-Pesa with PayPal which will enable Kenyan customers seamlessly to transfer money between PayPal and Safaricom’s M-Pesa mobile wallets. The move will open global market places to Kenyan entrepreneurs and businesses, effectively allowing M-Pesa’s 22.7 million subscribers to transact online, on mobile, in an app, or in person with PayPal’s 227 million users [Quartz Africa] The new service comes just months after Safaricom launched its own e-commerce platform Masoko. Kenya has experienced an e-commerce boom, buoyed in part by ubiquitous mobile penetration that currently stands at over 90%, increased smartphone use, and a mobile-first strategy that allows customers to pay for goods and services online through mobile money services like M-Pesa.
