Lawmaker David Pkosing has asked JKIA management and Transport CS James Macharia to suspend implementation of new parking rates at the airport. The Pokot South MP is the chairman of the Committee on Roads, Transport and Public Works in the National Assembly. Pkosing said on Wednesday that public participation did not take place before the setting of the rates which have sparked public outrage. He said his committee will investigate the matter to establish how JKIA arrived at the figures which he described as too expensive. "I have seen reports of the rates in the media. They should be suspended until all stakeholders are involved," he said. On Tuesday, the Kenya Airports Authority announced it had increased parking fees within Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Those picking and dropping travellers at the airport are to pay Sh100 to stay at the airport for 20 minutes, Sh250 for between 20 and 40 minutes, Sh350 for 40 minutes to an hour. Those staying an hour or two will be required to pay Sh500. Parking will cost Sh100 within 30 minutes, Sh150 for between 30 minutes and an hour and Sh200 for between one hour and two hours. Those wishing to park for more than 24 hours will pay Sh1,000. Owners of vehicles that are clamped will pay Sh1,000. The move is aimed at checking idleness.
