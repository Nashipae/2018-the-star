Confusion reigned in the Embu county assembly on Friday after a court reinstated a deputy speaker who had been impeached, then the order was quashed a day later. Besieged deputy speaker Steve Munene was impeached on April 11 after MCAs accused him of arrogance. He was replaced with Paul Muchangi. But a court reinstated him, pending conclusion of a case he filed. The case was scheduled for May 24. On Friday, Munene, accompanied by his lawyer, headed to speaker Josiah Thiriku’s office to serve him with the order. The speaker was out of office and the door could not be immediately opened. Smarting with impatience, Munene decided to serve the speaker’s secretary with the order. He used his phone to film everything that took place as evidence. Munene then served the order on deputy county assembly clerk Roselyne Miano. Clerk Jim Kauma was not in her office. Munene proceeded to his office but found it locked. Fuming with anger, he removed the plate with Muchangi’s name and forced serjeant-at-arms Silas Mwaniki to open the door or have it broken. Mwaniki obliged. Munene stayed in the office for a short while then left. Later, Muchangi arrived only to find the plate with his name removed, the office locked and keys missing. Muchangi also sought a court order that set aside the one issued to Munene and set another hearing for May 24. He served the clerk with the fresh order and occupied the deputy speaker’s office.
