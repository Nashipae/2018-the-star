Last year, Eunice Njeri made headlines after she walked out of her marriage to gospel rapper Izzo. This came as a shock, considering they had just been married for two months. Taking to social media, she explained how tough it is to start over, urging her fans to lay their burdens down and trust God to do his work. "The hardest thing about starting over is actually starting over... there is a reason why the sun goes down and comes back up the next day. It is a sure sign of a new beginning. Praise God for those who stay to see you through...Praise God for those who leave,they were not meant to be there for this next season in your life....lay all your burdens down,give up all you have for what God has. Let people talk it simply means you are very important... #seeYouAtTheTop."
