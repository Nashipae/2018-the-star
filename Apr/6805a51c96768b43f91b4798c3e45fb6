The newly appointed Director of Public Prosecutions and Attorney General yesterday formally took over their respective offices from their predecessors. Both Noordin Haji and Justice Paul Kihara boast of extensive experience in their various specialties; one an adroit detective, the other a tenured judge and practitioner of the law. They have both been taken through rigorous interviews and found worthty to hold their offices. But like their equally worthy predecessors, they will find that it is not about qualifications but one’s mettle. The two offices are central to the rule of law and therefore the target of the most intense intrigues and manipulation. They require nerves of steel, literally, and higher commitment to prevail. The AG must ensure that government’s actions comply with the Constitution and established laws. The DPP should uphold the rule of law though prosecution of offenders without fear or favour. DPP Haji inherits an office writ with a litany of complaints about lack of even-handedness and a dearth of prosecutions. In a country defined by high levels of corruption and impunity, there is little to celebrate from the tenure of his predecessor. Haji should hold court with Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti and Archbishop Eliud Wabukala of the Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission to turn a new page on the war against hongo. To Justice Kihara: the state must submit to the law.
