Erastus Muriuki of Jubilee Party on Wednesday won the Ruguru MCA seat. Ruguru ward is in Mathira constituency, Nyeri county.
Muriuki beat his rival Ndegwa Macharia of Maendeleo Chap Chap in the by-election after garnering 4,270 against Ndegwa’s 3,946. The by-election followed the death of former MCA Peter Weru in December last year. Weru collapsed while speaking to residents at his Ruguru ward during Jamhuri Day celebrations. He died at the Outspan Hospital in Nyeri.
Muriuki was announced winner by returning officer John Kahura after tallying of votes from all 26 polling stations was received. The ward has 14,041 registered voters, but only 8,216 cast ballots.
Immediately he was announced winner, Muriuki assured residents he will serve them with dedication. He spoke at Kabiru-ini Secondary School. “I want to ensure  that Ruguru will never be the same again. All I can do is serve you with the fear of God so that at the end of my service, you will say I did well,” Muriuki said.
He invited his competitor to work with him in delivering services to Ruguru residents. Muriuki said the ward has stayed without an MCA for five months and many projects have stalled. He also urged his competitor to accept the outcome so they can move on together. “I want to promise him and his supporters that I will not only serve the people who have voted for me, but all the people of Ruguru, including those who did not vote for me,” Muriuki said.
