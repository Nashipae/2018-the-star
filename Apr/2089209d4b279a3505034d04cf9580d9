Conflict is feared between IDPs who fl ed terror attacks and Lamu landowners who say their property is being grabbed. More than 1,000 IDPs are still at the Katsaka Kairu camp in Witu division, despite orders by the national government for them go return home six months ago. The IDPs, mostly from Nyongoro and Maleli areas, have refused to budge and stayed put in the camps. Some have grabbed land where they have camped and even built permanent residences without landowners’ permission. The is has angered property owners who want IDPs forcefully evicted. The grabbed land includes 60 acres set aside in 1993 for a market centre in Katsaka Kairu. “They have been asked to leave but months down the line, they are still here. The biggest problem is that they are now grabbing lands that don’t belong to them. Our concern is that the situation could escalate into violence,” area chief Charo Karisa said. IDPs have accused the government of cruelty for wanting them to return to ‘death traps’ without any funds to help them start over. The IDPs said they don’t believe the government’s word that security has been restored and they will be safe back home. IDP Ruth Saanyu said they deserve a send off package to enable them start life again. “They can’t just tell us it’s safe and we should go back, yet we can’t feel the truth in what they’re saying. The situation is still not right for us to go back,” she said. Saanyu said IDPs demand to be compensated for time wasted and their resources lost back home. “Many of us had crops eaten by wild animals. Our homes have been robbed clean. If they don’t settled us, we will settle ourselves,” she said. Linda Boni operation director Joseph Kanyiri said IDPs will not be compensated. He blamed politicians for inciting them to demand compensation before they return. Kanyiri said their continued stay in the camps makes them easy targets for al Shabaab terrorists.
