The Senate Public Accounts Committee will not support the bill to create the Ward Development Fund. Committee chairman Moses Kajwang’ said the Constitution requires public resources to be devolved to the grassroots. He said the village council is the simplest unit of the devolved functions and establishing a kitty for MCAs is unnecessary. Kajwang’ on Friday urged his colleagues at the Senate to focus on strengthening county assemblies to enable the MCAs to conduct their primary oversight role efficiently. “Senators should look into ways through which development can reach people at the grassroots,” he said.

They should not be involved in the execution of development projects, he added. The chairman said the establishment of the ward fund would interfere with MCAs’ roles. “We should help the reps understand their roles. MCAs should find ways through which the County Integrated Development Plans are implemented,” he said. Kajwang’ was with Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o, who urged counties to create village councils and use them as a basis for planning. They addressed Rusinga residents after attending a funeral on Mfangano Island in Suba North constituency. Kajwang’ urged his colleagues at the Senate to oppose the 2018 County Ward Development Equalisation Bill spearheaded by Murang’a Senator Irungu Kangata. He wants the Treasury and the Controller of Budget to allocate Sh21.8 billion for ward development. Click here for the latest political news
