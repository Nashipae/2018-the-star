Former IEBC CEO James Oswago has faulted Ezra Chiloba for paying Sh250 million for the supply of additional electronic voter identification devices used in the 2013 general election. Oswago told the National Assembly Public Accounts Committee that the commission unanimously agreed to procure 4,000 kits in addition to the 30,000 Face Company had been contracted for. He said the company delivered 34,600 kits instead of the agreed 34,000. "I declined to pay after receiving the invoice because we had not ordered for additional 4,600 kits," he said on Thursday. "This was not paid under my tenure. Chiloba joined the commission and within three months, he had paid. "If I paid for the 4,600 additional kits, I would be in Kamiti prison. To date, there is no formal contract between the IEBC and the company for the delivery of those 4,600 additional kits." Chiloba is the current IEBC Chief Executive Officer who was sent on a three-month compulsory by Chairman Wafula Chebukati for investigations into "major procurement issues". The manner in which Chiloba was sent away was one of the reasons cited by three commissioners who resigned earlier today. Vice Chair Consolata Nkatha and commissioners Paul Kurgat and Margaret Mwachanya cited bad leadership by the Chairman as their main reason. Their moved have deepened the crisis at the electoral agency.
