The 2022 election is still far and politicians must stop the “madness of early campaigns” and get down to work for the common good, Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has told the DP’s allies. Rift Valley has been turned into a battlefield — DP William Ruto and Gideon’s associates outdoing each other. “Political campaigns and elections ended in October last year. It is time the elected leaders work to change the lives of the people,” Gideon said on Saturday during Tiaty MP William Kamket’s homecoming party. He was elected on the Kanu ticket. Ten Jubilee leaders, led by Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, attended the event. They urged Moi to consider dropping his presidential bid to support Ruto. But Gideon warned his opponents the battle is ahead. He accused the Jubilee leaders of using foul language against other leaders to gain political mileage. Like Ruto, Kanu chairman Gideon is from the Kalenjin community. The DP seems to have released his campaign crew to do his bidding. “I was not happy about the way the leaders used abusive language against visitors who attended this function,” Gideon said. Murkomen said, “As the people and leaders of Rift Valley, we should unite and speak with one voice to ensure Ruto is elected President.” He told Gideon Kalenjins and other communities supported his father, former President Daniel Moi, and it is time for other Kenyans to get the chance to lead.
