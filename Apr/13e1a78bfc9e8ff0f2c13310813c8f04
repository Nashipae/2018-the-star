Former IEBC chiefs Issack Hassan and James Oswago will face the Public Accounts Committee on Monday to answer queries on 2014/15 finances. MPs led by Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja) want answers on wasteful expenditure following reports by Auditor General EDward Ouko. Hassan, Oswago and others will be grilled in Room 9. The electoral commission was put on the spot for illegally varying contract content to three times the quoted amount, leading to loss of millions of taxpayers’ money. Ouko said the IEBC inflated the tender for the procurement of the Biometric Voter Registration system, vendor support and maintenance services over and above the amount quoted by the winning firm. In his 2015-16 audit report, Ouko said the agency illegally altered and varied the contract amount from Sh31.7 million quoted by the same vendor in 2012 to an inflated price of Sh93.3 million per year. The committee, which was mandated to negotiate terms of reference, engaged the vendor and recommended award of the contract at Sh157.2 million. However, the contract was cancelled due to lack of funds and the need by the commission to revise the scope of service, said the auditor. According to the report, the contract was suspiciously reintroduced before the tender committee on October 7, 2015, under a separate tender number and speedily approved six days later.

Among the issues Chiloba was tasked with explaining was how 30 law firms were paid Sh328.3 million without lawful contracts. The Auditor General has also put the IEBC on the spot for paying Sh17.8 million to five law firms that were single-sourced and curiously not pre-qualified.
