A former DC charged with defrauding a widow of land valued at Sh954 million has confessed that his wife and house help were allocated three plots in the disputed property. Benjamin Rotich further told a court in Nairobi that he was personally involved in the disputed allocation by virtue of being the DC and chairman of Moiben land control board. The 477 acres of land in question is in Uasin Gishu county and belongs to Anne Kimetei. Rotich is charged alongside former Kenya Pipeline Company MD Ezekiel Komen, lands officials Tom Chepkwesi and Erick Tarus, and businessman Benjamin Kuto. He said his wife Magdelene Rotich and house girl, only identified as Selina, were allocated three plots each measuring five acres. “My wife was allocated the plots after paying the required amounts of money,” Rotich said when he was cross-examined at the Milimani law court. He said the joint owners of the plot, being Kimetei and Bahadhurali Nurani, did not apply for consent for the subdivision, which is the subject of the case. “Nyongio did not attend the land board meeting where the subdivision was approved,” Rotich said. State counsel Solomon Naulikha asked Rotich to clarify the minutes of the meeting leading to the alleged illegal sub-division. The court heard that Chepkwesi was the registrar in charge of Eldoret land registry when the property was fraudulently acquired. In the case, the prosecution claims 72 titles were issued to Eric Tarus, Benjamin Kuto, and Ezekiel Komen to transfer ownership of the land known as Sergoit River Farm, a private property. Rotich is said to have unlawfully chaired Moiben land control board which authorised the illegal subdivision and transfer of land No. L.R 9723. The hearing continues on May 18.
