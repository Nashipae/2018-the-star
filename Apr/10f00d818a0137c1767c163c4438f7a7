Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has stepped in to end the wrangles pitting Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu and Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi. The two leaders have not being at loggerheads with the latest being Mulyungi's accusation that Ngilu visits his constituency without notifying him. Kalonzo at the weekend called upon the leaders to respect each other saying their row is painting a bad picture of 'his home county'. He asked Mulyungi to reach a truce with Governor Ngilu and a local traditional singer commonly known as Musyoka Maiyu. "I am calling upon Mwingi Wiper chairman Jones Nzomo to make sure Mulyungi and Musyoka have a cup of tea together." "You know where we came from and I cannot allow the fights to continue. Musyoka, you should stop attacking leaders with your songs," he said. Kalonzo lamented that if the three continue with their rows, they will end up weakening the Wiper party yet the same should grow stronger ahead of 2022. "Even former Kitui senator David Musila left Wiper and joined Jubilee but I can never disrespect or even abuse him since we know the far we have come." He called upon leaders from the greater Ukambani region to embrace peace and reach out to one another in counsel and advice. The musician had accused Mulyungi of threatening him on grounds he defaming him (the MP) in a song. Musyoka and Mulyungi left the meeting they had already exchanged handshakes sending signal that they could resolve their differences. Click here for the latest political news
