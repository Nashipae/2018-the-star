The pre-trial conference for appeals filed against five Nyanza governors and eight MPs will begin today. Most losers appealed High Court decisions that upheld most election results. In Homa Bay, Governor Cyprian Awiti appealed the nullification of his election. In Kisumu, former Governor Jack Ranguma appealed the decision to uphold Governor Anyang Nyong’o’s election. Justice David Majanja dismissed the petition, saying Ranguma failed to prove his case against Nyong'o. In Migori, petitioner appealed the dismissal of hi case. Ayacko, who ran as an independent candidate against Governor Okoth Obado, says there was bribery of voters, multiple voting, non-identification of voters and misuse of public resources. In Nyamira, Walter Nyambati appealed Justice James Makau's decision to dismissed his petition against Governor John Nyagarama. Nyambati said the judge overlooked many illegalities committed during the elections. Kisii Governor James Ongwae also faces an appeal by Joel Makori and Francis Omao against a decision that upheld his victory. Other leaders facing petition appeals are Ugenya MP Chris Karan, whose election was nullified. Karan’s win had been challenged by former MP David Ochieng’.
