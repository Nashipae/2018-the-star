The national government has been faulted for failing to include the Big Four agenda in the revenue plans between the national and county governments. They are food security, affordable housing, universal healthcare and manufacturing, identified by President Uhuru Kenyatta as areas of foccuss in his second and last term. Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya yesterday said the sectors are rooted in the counties, yet it is still unclear how they will be funded and implemented. Realigning development programmes with the four pillars will be a problem if the sources of revenue and the budget is not outlined. Oparanya said the government should have allocated a special fund in the division of revenue signed by Uhuru on Tuesday if the agenda is to be realised. “As things stand now, it remains unclear how the national government will tackle housing, health and agriculture in counties,” he said. Further, Oparanya asked the national government to devolve library services and water to enable counties perform their roles effectively. Counties will receive Sh372.7 billion in the 2018-19 budget. The allocation is an increase of Sh33.3 billion from what the governors received the previous year. However, Oparanya said the increase in revenues to county governments has not adequately addressed the salary increase awarded to workers, including nurses and doctors. “In my county, I need more than Sh200 million to pay salaries. The extra funds will be cleared in the expenses which were negotiated and agreed by the national government,” he said. He also raised concern about the the delayed disbursement of funds that have affected county operations. In the past five years counties have gobbled up one trillion shillings from the Treasury.
