Many parents in Northeastern are struggling to get birth certificates needed to register pupils in the National Education Information System. That’s a requirement to enter school. Haki na Sheria representative Bare Kerrow yesterday said many pupils are yet to apply for the certificate and it takes time to process them. He said there are few service providers in Northeastern. A birth certificate is required for pupils’ data to be captured in the National Education Information System. Kerrow said Garissa is the worst affected because Dadaab, Balambala, Fafi and Lagdera subcounties do not offer services and depend on the main offices in the town. The government on Tuesday indefinitely extended the deadline for parents to register on Nemis. It had been March 31. About three million learners had not been registered into the Education Ministry’s digital platform by the deadline on Saturday last week. Hundreds of parents to line up at civil registry offices in Northeastern and there are claims of bribery among officials who are taking advantage of the huge demand to extort parents.  ALLOCATING TEXTBOOKS Two weeks ago, Garissa Township MP and National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale criticised registration clerks. This followed complaints that only those who give bribes are issued birth certificates. Registration on Nemis has been going on since January 24 with its initial deadline extended to March 31. Pupils are to be allocated unique PINs which will be used to track their progress and enable the ministry distribute textbooks, funds and deploy teachers.
