Kenya needs 600,000 of new jobs each year until 2030, a report has found. The report by Overseas Development Institute released in April showed that 17.5 million new jobs need to be created each year world wide until 2030. This is to provide opportunities for young people entering the labour market, the report noted. According to the report, Kenya created 400,000 additional jobs each year between 2003–2016. It noted that 2,000 jobs are needed on a daily basis. In a TIFA report done in February, massive unemployment, corruption and poverty remained the top three concerns for Kenyan youths. The report noted that 16 per cent are worried about the lack of jobs, 15 per cent about graft and 12 per cent about poverty. Only 10 per cent are concerned about pollution and eight per cent about terrorism.

Unemployment pushing Kenyan youths to the edge The ODI report noted that commonwealth countries need to create 50,000 jobs every day to provide work for the growing number of young people entering labour markets. This is 50 per cent more than the 12 million new jobs Commonwealth countries created on average each year between 2003 and 2016. Head of the group Dirk Willem te Velde said the research demonstrates the urgent need to promote trade and investment to create more quality jobs. "As more people enter the workforce, Commonwealth countries need to redouble their efforts to make sure levels of employment do not drop," he said. By studying population data for each country, researchers found that India needs to create the most jobs (7.4 million), followed by Nigeria (2.3m), Pakistan (1.8m) and Bangladesh (1.m). In Sub Saharan Africa, 9 million additional jobs are created each year between 2003–2016, 12.9m of new jobs needed each year until 2030 while 35, 000 are needed on a daily basis. The report noted that Uganda needed the same number of jobs as Kenya as Tanzania had 400,000 additional jobs created each year between 2003–2016, 800,000 new jobs needed each year until 2030 while 2,000 jobs are needed on a daily basis. Dubbed "Opportunities for Commonwealth development: Creating jobs, sharing prosperity and increasing resilience" The report outlined how trade in goods within the Commonwealth currently supports an estimated 32.5 million jobs in member states. The ODI and the UK All-Party Parliamentary Group on Trade Out of Poverty have previously highlighted five priority areas for promoting trade within the Commonwealth. They include; reducing the costs and risks of trade and investment, boosting service trade through regulatory co-operation, making trade more inclusive for women and young people. Others are; Addressing the special needs of small and vulnerable states and strengthening partnerships through government, business, diaspora and civil society Maximiliano Mendez-Parra, a Senior Research Fellow at ODI, said: ‘To increase the number of jobs at such a rate would require a significant step-up in investment and fostering trade compared to what we have seen in recent years. How it was carried out The report used data from The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division by calculating for each country how many people will enter the working age population over the period 2015-2030. Dividing this total number by 15 years allowed us to calculate the total number of additional people entering the working age population each year. We then assumed two-thirds of the working age population participate in the labour force (which is appropriate for the average but varies markedly by country) and calculated the total number of people entering the labour force.
