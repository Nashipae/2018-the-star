Nairobi residents have been asked to submit their land documents to speed up processing of title deeds. Lands executive Charles Kerich on Thursday said documentation and preparation of leases is expected to end next month. About 50,000 residents will be issued with title deeds next month. “This project is very important because it will enable owners to use their documents as collateral for loans,” Kerich said. On Wednesday, Kerich led a team of lawyers commissioned to speed up the processing of title deeds in Dandora. He said residents were not submitting their documents as required. The county has established five collection centres in Kayole, Mathare North, Dandora, Umoja and Kariobangi to mobilise residents.
