Prone to frequent strikes by academic and non-teaching staff, Kenyan universities have become haunted institutions of late. The lecturers' strike has entered the seventh week with no end in sight. The stalemate between the Universitiesâ€™ Academic Staff Union and Inter-Public Universities Council Consultative Forum is symptomatic of the mistrust of the state due to its perpetual flouting of binding agreements. As we have said before, the biggest casualty is the innocent student whose life and career plans are jolted. It has become such a risk that universities may need to indemnify students again. These disruptions are a cruel blow to the public university system, now declining in global rankings. A university's reputation is built upon instruction and the certainty of academic programmes. It is a wonder international students would enrol in universities whose academic calendar is as fickle as the weather. The dishonesty, betrayal and sheer insensitivity characterising the CBAs between staff and government are the stuff of academic study. It begs moot questions: What's he point of keeping universities open when no learning goes on? Are students being used as pawns in the labour dispute?
