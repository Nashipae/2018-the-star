A multi-agency security team dismantled an al Shabaab camp at Ijara, Garissa county after a raid on Wednesday. They recovered two loaded pistol magazines, combat knives, assorted medicines and syringes, a hand held radio, and tarpaulin among other items. The raid came after a tip off from members of the public who approached the security agents. Residents of Boni and the surrounding areas have increased their support for the troops operating in the area. Officers also recovered drugs at the camp after confessions from returnees that al Shabaab militants are extremely abusing drugs and alcohol.  /COURTESY The returnees said the militants also sexually abuse women from the neighbouring communities. In September 2017, KDF troops seized ponographic DVDs, alcohol and drugs after raiding an al Shabaab camp inside Boni forest. Later in the year, packets of condoms were washed off from Jilib - an Shabaab stronghold, after flash floods had hit Somalia. After the raid, Sheikh Noor Farah from Ijara said: "It is either we cooperate with the police or allow al Shabaab to turn our town into a sex and drug den." He said the community has resolved to smoke out the militants from the area.  /COURTESY Last month, reports emerged of how the militants in Somalia are extorting huge sums from starving communities. The militants are also forcibly recruiting hundreds of children as soldiers and suicide bombers. This comes as the terror group endures financial pressures, a decrease in numbers and an apparent crisis of morale. Intelligence documents, transcripts of interrogations from recent defectors, and interviews conducted on returnees by security agents confirm the situation.
