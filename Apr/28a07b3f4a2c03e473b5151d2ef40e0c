Kenya’s Hanifa Said finished second from bottom in the women’s triathlon yesterday here in Gold Coast. The Kenyan struggled throughout the race, posting 14.28 minutes in 750m swim, 36.15 minutes in the 20km bike and 23:04 in 5km run for a total of 1 hour 15.18 minutes. She finished 23rd out of 24 and was 18:28 minutes behind the gold winner, Flora Duffy of Bermuda, who clocked 9:10 minutes in swim, 29:37minutes in bike and 16:56 in run for a total of 56:50 minutes. England’s Jessica Learmouth won silver in 57:33 minutes (9:04, 29:40, and 17:40) while Canada’s Joanna Brown completed the podium in 57:38 (9:48, 30:12, 66:31). Hanifa was the sole Kenya representative in the event after colleague Mohammed Said Suleiman made an early on Wednesday after incurring a finger injury. Hanifa was making her second appearance having featured at the 2014 Games in Glasgow, Scotland but her bid to improve on performance went up in smoke. The UK-schooled Hanifa also placed seventh in Maputo. Kenya this time fielded two athletes unlike in Glasgow, where they had four. South Africa’s Henri Schoeman (52:31) won gold in the men’s competition with Australia’s Jacob Birtwhistle (52:38) taking silver and Scotland’s Marc Austin (52:44) the bronze. Schoeman, bronze medallist at the 2016 Rio Olympics, said: "It was a tough race, the swim was rough. My legs were exhausted at the start (of the run) but I gave it a surge and kept up the momentum, I just had to stay cool and save energy. I just kept thinking ‘don’t give up, anything can happen’ (and) that last 50 metres felt amazing." Click here for the latest political news
