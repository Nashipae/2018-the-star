The murder trial of confessed serial killer Philip Onyancha will start afresh after eight years. Justice James Wakiaga yesterday declared a mistrial, saying the prosecution had charged Onyancha under the wrong section of law. Onyancha shocked the country when he claimed to have been inducted into a blood-sucking cult that led him to kill 18 people, mostly women. His trial officially began in 2014 after a four-year delay, but yesterday Wakiaga said “proper procedure had not been followed”. Onyancha pleaded insanity and a number of medical tests proved his claim. As such he ought to have been tried under Section 162 of the criminal procedure code instead of Section 166. The prosecution tried him under Section 166 and asked the court to find Onyancha guilty of murder, but insane. “It is therefore my conclusion that there was a miscarriage of justice and I hereby declare it a nullity,” Wakiaga said. He directed the file be taken before the head of the Criminal Division, Justice Jessie Lesiit, for a fresh hearing. Senior assistant deputy public prosecutor Moses Omirera had urged the court to order that Onyancha be jailed at the “pleasure of the President”. Omirera argued that Onyancha is still a dangerous person but needs help. In a a videotaped confession, Onyancha narrated how he lured unsuspecting women, and raped and killed them. He picked most of the women in bars between 2006 and 2010.
