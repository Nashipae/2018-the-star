The Marakwet Development Association yesterday denied reports 1,000 people including 50 athletes face eviction after their plots were resold. This comes after residents, including the father to Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos, on Sunday accused the association of wrongly selling their land to other buyers. This has caused disputes and tenants say they are at risk of eviction. However, MDA say it only issued 980 title deeds to members who bought part of the 700-acre Kiplombe farm in Eldoret seventeen years ago. The land is valued at Sh50 billion. Association chairman Major (Rtd) John Kipchumba said only 30 title deeds were yet to be issued but the processing was almost complete. The final meeting will be on June 2. “Our members are very happy after we issued them with titles and only six people who have complained over plots yet they do not purchase documents,” Kipchumba said. He said the protesting residents, among them 2010 New Delhi Commonwealth Champion John Kelai, don’t own the land on the farm as they bought it from fraudsters. “Some of those complaining just want to throw dirt at me because they are envious of the good work I have done with my team,”he said. Tolgos’ father Elias Kimuron, says half the acre hebought has already been sold without his knowledge. Kelai’s wife Susan said they are facing eviction after they refused to accept the small portion of land they were being given, as opposed to the entire acre they had bought. MDA said complainants should visit their Eldoret office, saying that they will stick to records.
