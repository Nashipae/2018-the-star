Thika Queens left back Wincate Kaari will be available for selection this afternoon when the national women’s team Harambee Starlets take on Uganda in the first leg of the African Women Cup of Nations (AWCON) qualifier at the Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos. Kaari, who picked a knee injury during a friendly match against Zambia away a week ago and has been training alone, trained with the rest of the team on Monday and yesterday. Speedy Spedag forward Esse Akida, who failed to make it to the Zambian friendly squad due to an ankle injury, faces late fitness test. Coach David Ouma acknowledged they will miss the services of Mary Kinuthia, who excused herself from the team due for personal reasons. Ouma said: “We will miss the services of Kinuthia, who have been a paramount figure in the national team in previous assignments. However, we have Phoebe Owiti, Pauline Musungu and promising Cynthia Shilwatso, who are equally up to the task to fill.” He added: “This is a qualifier and it comes with different demands and therefore we will give everything we have to ensure we record positive results at home to make it easier for us in the return leg on Sunday.” In 2016, Ouma guided the national team to their maiden appearance in Cameroon where the team failed to go past group stage.
