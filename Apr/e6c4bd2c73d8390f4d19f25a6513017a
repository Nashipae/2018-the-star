It states that the AG representation in the matter deprives the PSC of the benefit of independent legal advice.In an affidavit filed by lawyer Suyianka Lempaa, he says the PSC has been sued in its capacity as an independent constitutional commission for failing to uphold its constitutional, statutory and administrative responsibilities.In March, the lobby sued to challenge the President’s nominees to the JSC, saying the process was not transparent. The case will be mentioned on Friday before Justice Mwita. Read: Court suspends Uhuru's JSC nominations  Click here for the latest political news
