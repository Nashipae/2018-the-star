Two children are
feared dead after a rescue boat they were using to cross River Tana capsized on Friday. The two, aged one and 10 years, were among five people rescued after floodwaters marooned Idsowe village in Garsen, Tana River county. County Red Cross coordinator Gerald Bombe said they have launched a search mission for the missing children. Bombe said the children, before they were rescued, had spent a night on the roof of their house after floods
ravaged their home in Galili. "It is during the
rescue mission when water currents overpowered the engine boat, and over turned
it," he said. Bombe said the team at
first managed to rescue two of the five to safety as the three others disappeared
in the flooding waters. The third girl was reportedly found holding a tree by a team of Kenya Red Cross divers
who were dispatched to search for them in the crocodile-infested
river. "The third child was
found after hours of search which went late in the night. She was unconscious and
was held by some weak reeds of trees in the river." Bombe said they were forced to call off the search mission for the two other children, who are members of the same family at midnight. Reports indicate that
a local politician hired the boat to help rescue the families who had been
marooned by floods in Galili area. Currently, some
families are still stranded after their homes were surrounded by the flood
waters. On Saturday, another
team of Kenya Red Cross divers was dispatched to search for the two missing
children.  The current flood situation
is as a result of overflows from KenGen's Seven Forks dams. Also read: State assures flood victims of food, medicine rations Related: Three killed in Murang'a landslide after heavy rains Click here for the latest political news
