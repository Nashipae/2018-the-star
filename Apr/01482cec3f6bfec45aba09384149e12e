The task force on the state of forestry in the country submitted its report to Deputy President William Ruto yesterday. Ruto, who is also the chairman of the Cabinet subcommittee on Forest Restoration, and Environment CS Keriako Tobiko are expected to study the report and its recommendations before initiating remedial action. The task force was to determine the extent of illegal logging, destruction, degradation and encroachment on public and community forests, water towers and other catchment areas; and review the procedures, qualification and conditions for licensing of saw millers to determine their adequacy, fairness and appropriateness. By all accounts, Kenya is at great risk of environmental disaster and the report goes to confirm the obvious. Deforestation and other unsustainable land use can ruin a country’s future as we have seen with unpredictable weather patterns and other consequences of the destruction of crucial water towers. Now that the stark reality has been laid bare before us, it is incumbent upon the government and its agencies to implement the recommendations with alacrity. This is a race against time. Yet, history has shown that with every crisis and wasteful inquiry, little is achieved. Government shelves are bursting with reports set up at great public expense to solve crises. But their recommendations were ignored or implemented partially for political expediency. We hope this shall not be the fate of the forest report.
