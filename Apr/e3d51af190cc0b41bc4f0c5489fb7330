The Association of Lamu Fishermen wants the county and national governments to establish a rapid disaster response unit to tackle sea accidents. Yesterday, it criticised the Lamu county government for not having measures to deal with marine accidents and disasters. Spokesperson Musa Faraj said in Lamu town that travellers and fishermen die because there is no clear disaster response plan. Numerous promises by the county to establish a response unit have not been honoured, he said. Faraj said the unit would enable timely responses and save lives. They say the unit should have divers to patrol the Indian Ocean. “Marine disasters would be reduced significantly,” Faraj said. Fisherman Hamisi Abdalla said they struggle on their own to survive during accidents and his fellows have died. “I’ve had several accidents. There was no one to help. I’ve survived by God’s grace. I’m not sure I’ll be lucky forever. Sometimes your boat capsizes with everything and all you can do is swim to the shores,” he said. “It’s a nightmare, but we can’t stop the trade because it’s our livelihood. All we want is assurance of safety.”
