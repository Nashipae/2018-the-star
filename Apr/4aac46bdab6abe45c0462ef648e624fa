Kenya Prisons middle blocker Rodgers Kipkirui is optimistic the team will shake of Tuesday’s defeat Ahly Ghazi and record a win against hosts Aviation in the battle for seventh place as the Africa Club Championships comes to an end today in Cairo, Egypt. Prisons fell to the Libyan side 3-0 (25-17, 25-21, 25-22), a result that means than will finish a place or two lower than last season’s sixth. Kipkirui, the reigning Kenya Volleyball Federation best blocker, regretted the loss against the North Africans but said they will have to recover and give their all to beat their hosts. “It is painful that we lost that match. We still have a chance to perform well and finish in a respectable position. It is not going to be easy but we will be going all out for a win,” said Kipkirui. Team captain and experienced international, Ibrahim Odour said: “The volleyball fraternity back at home have been supportive of the two teams-General Service Unit and Prisons. The two teams have done their best and they both still have one match each and we are hoping for the best.” National champions GSU have a date with Ahly B of Libya in the position five and six decider. GSU on Tuesday defied all odds to see of hosts Aviation 3-1 ( 21-25, 25-18, 25-16 and 25-19) in the classification matches. Cornelius Kiplagat, who has been instrumental for the paramilitary side performance at the annual event praised his fellow players for the good show and remains optimistic that they will get better going forward. Meanwhile, it will be an all-Egyptian final affair when champions Al Ahly take on El Giesh while Smouha battle Swehly of Libya for the bronze medal.
