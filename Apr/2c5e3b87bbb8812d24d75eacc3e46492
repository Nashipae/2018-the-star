Some 1500
small scale tea farmers have
received over Sh100 million from Sot Tea Growers Sacco after three years in the cold. The Sacco
leadership announced the payout following the release of
a Sh300 million bailout by the national government. Speaking
during a thanksgiving ceremony at the Sacco offices at Silibwet in Bomet,
CEO Geoffrey Sang said the bailout had enabled them pay salary arrears
for their 100 staff who had gone months without pay. The Sacco has also cleared a bank loan that threw them into eight years of crisis. The petrol
station owned by the Sacco had also resumed operations and is expected to post good results. Joseph
Mabwai, the Society’s chairman on his part announced that leadership wrangles
that had dogged the Sacco has been resolved and court cases withdrawn. “The
leadership rows have been resolved and we are now focused on rebuilding the
Sacco and returning it to profit making venture for the benefit of our members,”
said Mabwai. Members are expected to receive dividends
for their shares at the end of the year.
