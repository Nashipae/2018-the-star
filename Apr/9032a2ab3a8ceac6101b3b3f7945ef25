The government is pushing a law change to allow the National Youth Service to engage in commercial activities weeks after venturing into the transport sector. The proposal contained in the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, 2018 if passed will transform the NYS from its current non-profit making entity to an agency that can engage in business activities in any sector of the economy. The amendments coming weeks after NYS deployed buses to ply city roads is viewed as a step to cushion the initiative from potential legal challenges.

The service wants to increase the vehicles to 50. The Treasury is also at an advanced stage of buying an additional 100 commuter buses to ply city routes. The buses currently operate on the Kibera, Githurai, Mwiki, Mukuru kwa Njenga, Dandora, Kariobangi and Kawangware routes. Matatu Owners Association chairman Simon Kimutai yesterday opposed the attempt to allow NYS to engage in business and accused the government of being unfair to the public transport industry despite being major taxpayers. “This is the time they are introducing a Bill to allow them do business. That means they have been engaging as an illegality?” he said. Click here for the latest political news
