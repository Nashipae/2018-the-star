The Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani technical committee says the Coast economic bloc is far from dead, as critics claim. Chairman William Kingi said a paper on agriculture, livestock, fisheries and health is complete.The Mombasa deputy governor said the aim is to eliminate hunger and disease and cushion the region against drought. Professionals and the secretariat started developing the document after signing a Sh18 million deal with the Food and Agriculture Organization. The deal was signed at the Technical University of Mombasa on May 16, 2017. Signatories were JPK chairman and Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya, Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, former Tana River Governor Hussein Dado, former Lamu Governor Issa Timamy, former Taita Taveta Governor John Mruttu and Kilifi’s Amason Kingi signed the deal. The FAO-funded project will support food and nutrition security for Coast counties. JKP has been working with Coast-based universities, including TUM, Pwani and Taita Taveta, as well as scholars to improve livelihoods by promoting tourism, agriculture and establishing a regional economic bloc. FAO will mobilise and facilitate 18 professionals from TUM and the JKP secretariat and two technical lead consultants. They will formulate the Jumuiya 2030 Sector Plan: Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries and the Blue Economy. They will also develop  a JKP gender-sensitive food and nutrition security strategy for 2017-2030. There are reports JKP is dysfunctional owing to political differences. The first governors from the Coast were all opposition-friendly. They were able to push the economic bloc plans when it was conceived in 2015. But Mvurya shifted to Jubilee, making meetings difficult. Lands Chief Administrative Secretary Gideon Mung’aro opposes the bloc as a ‘money-minting body’. “JKP is unsurvivable,” the former Kilifi North MP has said. Former Kaloleni MP Gunga Mwinga told the Star JKP is dead because of vested interests.
