Supplies to Masalani in ijara subcounty have been cut off following heavy rains that have impaired roads in and out of ijara. Roads between Garissa -Masalani and Masalani -Hulugho have been affected. Essential supplies like fuel,vegetables and food supplies from Mombasa, Garissa and Hola have stopped due to heavy down pour in the sub county and the flooding of River Tana . Supplies of fuel from the three petrol station of Heller, Masalani and Ijara filling stations in Masalani town have reduced tremendously. Fuel operators say they don't know how they will get supplies from Mombasa as roads between Gamba in Tana delta and Kotile had been washed away. The proprietor of Ijara filling station Ali Abdi said he only has fuel for the next two weeks noting that his supplies from Mombasa would not be available as scheduled. Ali said the alternative route between Garsen and Boji area has also been cut off as the river burst its banks flooding the 15km road near Masalani bridge which connects Hola to Masalani. Other petrol stations like Heller, manager managed by Mohamed Yarrow, also have fuel which can only last for two weeks. The supply of vegetables has also been affected as lorries supplying vegetables from Thika cannot go past Bura. This has led to come of the perishable goods rotting on the way. A kilo of potatoes that used to go for Sh40 now goes for Sh160 in Masalani town. Bus operators of DEK express and KILAS express have since suspended their operations as they wait for the rain to subside. The residents have appealed the government to repair the roads when the rain subside.
