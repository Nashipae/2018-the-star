Ali Kiba was the talk of town for the better part of last week thanks to his lavish wedding, where no expense was spared. The musician’s wagon is now hitched to Amina Khalef’s, for life. The Seduce Me star must be a very down-to-earth person because his mother-in-law Asma Said Abeid revealed she did not know Ali Kiba was the huge music personality we all know him as. A Tanzanian media outlet disclosed that all Khalef’s mother knew was her daughter was getting married to a Tanzanian lad, but she had no clue it was Ali Kiba. During the wedding, Abeid told Azam TV reporter, “I thank God the wedding is a success, we are happy. All this is God’s plans, not any human’s because what God plans no one can scatter.”
