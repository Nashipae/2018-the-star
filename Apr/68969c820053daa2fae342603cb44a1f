An MP has written to National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi seeking to block the vetting of Judicial Service Commission nominee Justice Mohamed Warsame. Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma, in a letter dated April 9, says it will be unconstitutional if the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee proceeds with Warsame’s vetting. “The delivery of the name of the judge to Parliament by the Executive and the attempt by Parliament to proceed with this unconstitutional process is putting the competence of MPs who are lawyers to question,” he says.

In a letter to National Assembly clerk Michael Sialai, Chief Registrar of the Judiciary Anne Amadi said the push by MPs to vet Warsame is neither provided for in the Constitution nor the Judicial Service Act 2011. “The JSC further takes the view that the proposed approval by the National Assembly as a commissioner of the JSC is unlawful, unconstitutional, a violation of the express provisions of Section 15 ( 2 ) of the Judicial Service Act 2011 and undermines the independence of the Judiciary,” she said. Members of the public had until March 28 to submit their views on Warsame’s suitability to serve in the JSC. On Monday, National Assembly Majority Whip Benjamin Washiali said the committee will proceed with the vetting. He said the MPs are doing their work as the people’s representatives “Vetting must go on with or without the ruling. The JSC members must be vetted since they are not chosen through an election,” the Mumias East MP said. Read:JSC opposes MPs vetting of Justice Mohamed Warsame Click here for the latest political news
