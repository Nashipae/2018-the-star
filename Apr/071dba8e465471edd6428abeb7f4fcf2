A case in which a businessman is charged with obtaining Sh48.4 million using Transport PS Paul Maringa’s forged documents has been put off until May 7. Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi adjourned the case after Walter Owiso alias Dr Odongo skipped the hearing. Owiso is accused of obtaining the money from a private company. Owino was charged alongside two businessmen David Ambuku alias Peter Bwonya Okwaru and Paul Owiti alias Miller Nyami. The two were in court yesterday. The three also face a charge of forging tender documents for the supply of oil from Angling Tail Lines. They used forged documents containing signatures of Maringa and his maritime counterpart Nancy Karigithu.
