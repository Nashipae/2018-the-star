A woman jumped off a motorcyle and died on Thursday after losing Sh7,000 to gambling. Susan Auma, 29, jumped off the motorcyle as her husband rode it. Witnesses said he forced her on to it so they could go home to discuss the issue. The incident took place at Obuya market in Kotienoresi village of Rangwe constituency, Homa Bay. "Auma had refused to board, fearing she would be beaten after losing the money," one said. Area chief Kennedy Akoko said the woman left home for the market on Wednesday afternoon but did not return after losing the amount. Akoko said the husband launched a search and found her at the market, arguing with gambling machine owners. The man told the business people that he gave his wife the money for shopping but that she took more from their stash. â€œThe woman was found near a gambling machine," Akoko said. She jumped off the motorcycle and died due to head injuries before they got home." Homa Bay County Police Commander Marius Tum said Auma fell head first. "The area is rocky," he said, and urged residents to find amicable ways of solving their problems. The body was taken to Homa Bay Referral Hospital mortuary. Click here for the latest political news
