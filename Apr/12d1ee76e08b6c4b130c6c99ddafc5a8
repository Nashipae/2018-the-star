Kajiado Governor Joseph Ole Lenku on Tuesday said a recent trend in global warming has occasioned a decrease in rainfall and an onset of drought that has affected pastoralism. While opening the Fifth Edition of the Kenya Pastoralists Week in Kajiado, Ole Lenku reiterated his government has made positive steps to mitigate the adverse effects of drought and famine. He said Kajiado will be on the forefront as the model county for drawing from best practices on effective pastoralism methods. The governor admitted land has become a scarce resource whereas the limited space available is strained due to an increase in population and commercialization of land. “It is only through embracing modern forms of farming that we can effectively combat poverty and change our livelihoods”, he said. Former Senate Speaker Ekwe Ethuro, who was also at the function, said devolution has made the lives of the citizens much easier as they are able to access efficient government services in their localities. “The time has come, under the devolution program for us to deliver proximate services to the people, and the time is now,” he said. Also present was Garissa governor, Ali Korane who lauded the progress brought about by devolution and the inroads made by the county governments to empower pastoralist communities in making decisions concerning their livelihoods. “We cannot complain of being marginalized anymore, the county governments have made our lives bearable,” Korane said. The Kenya Pastoralist Week brings together pastoralists from across the country to discuss among other issues, pastoral practices, livelihood and legislation governing animal trade and movement. This year’s theme focuses on; ‘Supporting Climate Smart Pastoralism in Kenya’ through approaches geared towards transforming and reorienting pastoralism development under new realities of climate change.
