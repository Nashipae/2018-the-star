News that more than three million bags of Ugandan maize have found their way into the country in the last two months is depressing indeed (Page 33). It flies in the face of government incentives to Kenyan farmers to grow the staple food. Whereas there is no law barring any trader from importing and selling maize in the country, it beggars reason why imports from a neighbouring country should be cheaper than locally produced corn. It is inimical to the government’s stated long-term aim of food sufficiency and job creation. Government must seal the loopholes that profiteers are exploiting to sell imported maize to the National Cereals and Produce Board, which stocks the national strategic reserve. The glut of maize has seen the prices plummet from Sh3,200 per bag to Sh2,000 after the NCPB purchase quota has been depleted. Now farmers, desperate to recoup their costs, or pressed to meet their needs, are at the mercy of traders who will stock up and offload to the market later. Fact is, maize and its by-products will remain the staple food of many Kenyans for a long time. The choice is simple: either the state introduces stern measures that will make it worthwhile for anyone to engage in its production to avoid ending up as a maize-deficit country; or we become dependent on imports, as we have with pretty many things. That’s not how a nation grows.
