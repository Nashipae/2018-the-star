Shujaa utility player Frank Wanyama is in danger of missing out on the season-ending London and Paris series and the Rugby World Cup after he was suspended by his club, Harlequins. Wanyama was suspended alongside teammate Alex Olaba, as they are being investigated by the authorities for alleged rape. The World Rugby rules stipulate that if a player is suspended by the club with whom he has a contract, then he is ineligible to feature for the national team. Wanyama was slowly coming back to the Sevens fold after sitting examinations recently and played at the Victoria Sevens last month in Zimbabwe where he played a crucial role as Kenya won the tournament beating Zimbabwe 10-5 in the final. Olaba has played for the Kenya under 20 team and was in action during the Tatu City series matches against Hong Kong. The duo recorded statements with the police at Kilimani Police Station last week and had their blood samples taken for DNA testing and later released on Sh50,000 police cash bail each and ordered to surrender their passports. Speaking yesterday, Harlequins chairman, Mike Lucas, said the club was following due process adding that they have zero tolerance to sexual harassment. “We have opted to have he players suspended until the case is finalised,” noted Lucas. Elsewhere, the Women’s Africa Cup Sevens will be held in Gaberone, Botswana on May 26 and 27. Champions South Africa, Kenya, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal, Madagascar, Mauritius and hosts Botswana are expected to participate in the tournament. Kenya are hoping to win the tournament after losing 17-12 to South Africa in a tense final in Tunisia last September.
