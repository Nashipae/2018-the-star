County governments will receive increased allocation of national revenue in the coming financial year; this after President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday signed into law the Division of Revenue Bill for 2018/2019 The revenue to be shared based on the established formula for equity is Sh314 billion, up from Sh302 billion this year, while the conditional and additional grants — money meant for specific work per county — has increased from Sh24 billion to Sh58.7 billion Considering that nationally raised sharable revenue for financial year 2018/19 is projected at Sh1.7 trillion, counties will be receiving at least 17 per cent of the amount. The law requires that financing follows functions and in any case at least 15 per cent of the national revenue be allocated to County governments every year While signing the bill into law, President Uhuru Kenyatta said that the Constitution provides for the vertical (equitable) sharing of revenue raised nationally between the two levels of government. He added that Article 202 of the Constitution also provides for additional allocations to the county governments from the national government’s share of revenue. "I have signed into law - The Equitable Division of Revenue Bill for 2018/2019 financial year. This will ensure there is equitable division of revenue raised nationally between the National and County governments,’’ Uhuru tweeted Even so, the amount to be disbursed into counties will be lower than what Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) proposed. CRA had recommended Sh337.2 billion. The Kimani Ichung’wa sponsored bill was drafted to reflect the emphasis by the Treasury that there has been an imbalance in the way revenue was shared between the two levels of government. The Bill was presented to the President for signing by National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi. Also present were Attorney General Paul Kihara Kariuki, Solicitor General Kennedy Ogeto and Assistant to the National Assembly Clerk, James Njoroge Mwangi.
