Raila Odinga's advisor Salim Lone has defended the Opposition leader's harsh criticism of Interior CS Fred Matiang'i. He said the ODM boss rebuked Matiang'i as his [Raila] patience was eroded by "acts of lawlessness" exhibited in the removal of NRMKe General Miguna Miguna from JKIA. Miguna was detained at the airport for days after arriving in the country on March 26. The self-declared general was not allowed entry for lacking a Kenyan passport. "His patience eroded, Raila's authoritative statement today put Matiangi in his place," Lone said in a tweet on Thursday. "The CS and others were determined to show that the Raila-Uhuru pact will in no way impact Jubilee's lawless ways. Lets see how this plays out now." On Wednesday, Raila rebuked Matiang'i for going against the spirit and purpose of his unity agreement with President Uhuru Kenyatta. The Nasa principal condemned the minister for "highly irresponsible and reckless statements" against the Judiciary. He said the Interior Cabinet Secretary's behaviour exhibited impunity.
