A Busia cleric has urged leaders to unite to fast-track the development of the county in the next five years. Hope of God Gospel Mission Bishop Samuel Welimo on Monday said the elections are over and it’s time for leaders to fulfil their campaign promises. He condemned Saturday’s arrest of Budalang’i MP Raphael Wanjala in Kisumu after a chase. This followed violence on Friday when his supporters allegedly attacked Foreign Affairs Chief Administrative Secretary Ababu Namwamba, the former Budalang’i MP.  The two men, long-time rivals, nearly came to blows. Wanjala accused Ababu of interfering in his projects. Welimo said if the attacks persist they can escalate and taint the image of Busia leaders. He urged the two to bury their differences and unite, lest they forget development.
