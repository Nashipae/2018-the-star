National chairman John Mbadi yesterday said ODM will not relent on implementing electoral laws requiring political parties to nominate candidates on merit. Mbadi said he is sensitizing party members on how its leadership intends to duly comply with the electoral regulations prior to the next general polls. A law passed by the National Assembly will require certain minimum academic qualification for one to hold a political office ahead of 2022. “We are strictly going to adhere to the requirements on the academic credentials so that we don’t end up encountering unnecessary challenges after nominations,” Mbadi said. He was speaking on Ramogi FM during the morning talk show where he responded to accusations leveled against him over his remarks made in Ndhiwa on the qualification of MCAs who were nominated by the party in 2017 elections. He clarified saying the directive was not inclined to particular nominated women MCAs in Nyanza region but it cuts across the country where the party has support.
