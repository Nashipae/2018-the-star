The Senate leadership yesterday promised it will continue discharging its duty of protecting devolution and prolonged disbandment calls will not intimidate it. Speaker Kenneth Lusaka said the Senate has played a significant role in ensuring counties are well funded. He said the Senate has worked hard to synchronise its role with that of the county assemblies. “It is reckless and in bad faith to dispute the role of the Senate. The misguided calls for its disbandment are ill-informed, impute bad faith and attempts to distract the Senate from performing its role," Lusaka said. MPs demanded the scrapping of the Senate during a meeting in Mombasa last month. “We will not be intimidated by threats. Let Kenyans be secure in the knowledge that we shall always work for their best interests,” Lusaka said. He added that the Senate has guided counties in resolving problems, as well as overseeing the sharing and allocation of funds. “As a Senate, we want to assure you we will endeavour to effectively discharge our mandate in a manner devoid of acrimony or witch-hunting,” the Speaker said.
