A section of church leaders now want to be included in the dialogue committee named by President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga. Evangelical Association of Kenya (EAK) bishops said majority of Kenyans have trust in the church hence the push for their inclusion to ensure national reconciliation and healing. EAK chairman Bishop Mark Kariuki, during a press conference in Nairobi on Monday, lauded the truce between Uhuru and Raila, terming the move an act of statesmanship. "We want the church to be included. We have congregations at the grassroots," Kariuki said further calling for the inclusion of members of the civil society. "We are cognisant of the fact that religious groups are not only the conscience of society but are one of the most trusted by Kenyans," Peter Njao, EAK Nairobi county chairman, said. The bishops have also invited Kenyans to a national prayer day on Saba Saba (July 7) to 'thank God for seeing Kenya through the elections and preserving our nation.' EAK welcomed President Uhuru Kenyatta's stand on the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender community during an interview with CNN in London. Uhuru told CNN during the Commonwealth heads of government meeting that the issue of homosexuality is not important in Kenya. Kariuki also demanded that the Comprehensive Sex Education in schools be scrapped. He claimed it is in these classes that the issue of homosexuality, drug and alcohol abuse is being introduced to learners. "We are asking those involved in the funding of the homosexuality agenda to stop forthwith as it is against the Constitution," Kariuki said. Kenya does not allow marriage between couples of the same sex. Click here for the latest political news
