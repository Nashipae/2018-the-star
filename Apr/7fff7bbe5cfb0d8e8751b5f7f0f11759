A kamukunji called to iron out differences between some MCAs in Kisumu and the speaker has instead culminated in the suspension of three MCAs. Speaker Onyango Oloo on Tuesday suspended Joachim Oketch (Kondele), Jacktone Ogendo (Nyalenda A) and Seth Olale (Nyalenda B), citing gross misconduct. “The honourable members’ behaviours totally contravene the standing orders of this assembly. I therefore suspend them accordingly,” he said. Oketch and Ogendo will miss 21 sittings each, while Olale will be out for 14 sittings, suspensions Oloo said were handed depending on the extent of their misconduct. Oloo said the three violated standing orders and the Powers and Privileges Act during a speaker’s kamukunji on Monday. He said the three persistently misbehaved and refused to apologise. NO MACE OR SUMMONS Oketch criticised the speaker’s decision, terming it illegal. He told the Star a member cannot be suspended for stating his mind and standing his ground in a kamukunji. “The mace, which is a symbol of authority, was not on the floor to warrant such actions,” he said. Oketch said they have not been summoned by the Powers and Privileges Committee, which is mandated to handle such matters, and so considered the move unconstitutional and out of order. He said he will disregard the orders and go to the assembly as usual. Last month, Oketch and Ogendo were ejected from the assembly following the speaker’s directive after they disagreed over the new list of house committees’ composition, which was tabled in the assembly. Oloo ruled the members were out of order as they continued protesting. He later exercised his powers, ordering the sergeant-at-arms to throw the two MCAs out of the assembly chambers for being disorderly, as the session remained temporarily halted.
