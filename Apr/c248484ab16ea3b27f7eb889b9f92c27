It states that the AG representation in the matter deprives the PSC of the benefit of independent legal advice.In an affidavit filed by lawyer Suyianka Lempaa, he says the PSC has been sued in its capacity as an independent constitutional commission for failing to uphold its constitutional, statutory and administrative responsibilities.The case will be heard on May 11.
