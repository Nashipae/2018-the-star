At least 100 doctors from 20 health facilities in Nakuru have threatened to go on strike in 12 days if the county does not resolve their problems. In an April 20 notice copied to the Nakuru Health Services chief officer, KMPDU officials cited under-staffing, delayed promotions and pending NHIF contributions as some of the reasons they will go on strike. South Rift Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists Union secretary Davji Bhimji on Sunday said doctors in 20 health facilities will walk off the job if the county government fails to recognise and address their demands. He spoke at Nakuru Level 5 Hospital.
