Health workers have found live polioviruses in sewage samples in Eastleigh in Nairobi. No one has fallen sick with polio in Kenya since 2013 when 14 cases came from Somalia. Kenya formerly used a live but weakened virus for immunisation. It has now switched to an inactivated vaccine that contains a dead virus. These samples probably resulted from the old vaccine. There is a very small risk that this sewage contamination could result in an actual polio infection. Nevertheless, we should not take chances. The Health ministry is now organising a mass vaccination campaign between May 5 and 9 for Nairobi to be followed by other high-risk counties. Every parent should cooperate fully with this campaign. Polio can cause paralysis that leads to muscles withering away and children being permanently disabled. In some cases paralytic polio kills. Donâ€™t take chances. If you or your children have not been immunised, you should organise your vaccination after May 5. And if you have been vaccinated, you should ask your doctor whether you should get a booster dose.
