Governors have vowed not to be pay counties pending bills until they are authenticated. The counties owe suppliers and contractors Sh99 billion as of December last year according to the National Audit Offi ce. The time given for the counties to conduct an audit to establish genuine creditors to be paid ends this month. The timeline was issued by the Intergovernmental Economic Council (IBEC). Council of Governors deputy chairperson Anne Waiguru yesterday said counties will not be pushed to pay fictitious invoices. “Most of those bills were incurred by previous administrations in many counties. We are still carrying out the audits,” Waiguru said. She spoke on the sidelines of the Devolution Conference that ended in Kakamega yesterday. Waiguru said counties will prioritise bills that have been authorised by the Auditor General Edward Ouko. “We’ll ensure we pay them before the end of this financial year,” Waiguru said. The Kirinyaga governor said most counties are yet to complete the audits because most invoices do not have supporting documents. “It becomes very diffi cult to establish the authenticity of an invoice without the documents. You can’t tell whether it is payable or not,” Waiguru said. Deputy President William Ruto, who chairs the IBEC, yesterday asked the counties to complete the audits in two weeks. The counties are also expected to identify and validate all their assets. Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia said it was unfortunate that some pending bills were not authentic. He supported the auditing of the invoices, saying some were ghost claims.
