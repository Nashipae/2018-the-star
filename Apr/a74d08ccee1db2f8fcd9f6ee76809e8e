Squatters in Junda ward will pay Sh48,000 for title deeds for land they occupy if plans by Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo are successful. Mbogo delivered a valuation report that was withheld at the Lands ministry for more than two years because of nonpayment of a Sh1.7 million fee. The report valued the 11 plots, measuring about 400 acres, at Sh1.2 billion. There are about 25,000 squatters in Junda. On Monday, Mbogo said Deputy President William Ruto helped secure the release of the report, having waived the fees. “This shows the DP is ready to help Kisauni residents,” Mbogo said. He added that he will work with Ruto to solve Kisauni people’s problems, key among them the squatter nightmare. Mbogo said the tycoons had overpriced the lands, while the squatters undervalued it.
