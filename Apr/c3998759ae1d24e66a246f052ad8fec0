City Hall has acquired a flush machine to be used to clear blocked drainage systems. Speaking during the launch of the machine on Tuesday, Transport and Infrastructure Cabinet Secretary James Macharia said the unblocking drainage was part of programmes funded by the World Ban under the Nairobi Metropolitan Service Improvement project. "The whole project will cost Sh500 million. Nairobi is allocated 75 per cent because it is the capital city," Macharia said. In a bid to improve the drainage systems within the Nairobi, County Government in partnership with National Government have launched Kenya’s first flusher unit machine which will be used to clear blocked drainage systems. Speaking on Tuesday during the launch of the machine at Sunken Park, Cabinet Secretary for Transport James Macharia said the unblocking of drainages is part of the projects funded by World Bank under the Nairobi Metropolitan Services Improvement Project ( Namsip). “ The whole project costs around Sh 500 million and Nairobi alone is allocated 75 per cent of the total amount because it is the capital city,” said Macharia. The Nairobi Metropolitan Services Improvement Project which is funded by World bank was started in December 2012, is expected to be completed by end of May 2019. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko said the machines will work faster as no manual labour will be required. “The flusher machine will help clear the blocked drainage as the country is still expecting heavy rains.,” said Sonko. The CBD has been prone to water floods during heavy rains because the drainage systems have been blocked as a result of waste products being dumped in them. Speaking to the Star Nairobi County public works director Eng. Frederick Karanja said the equipment, Kenya's first flush machine, will remove all wastes from the drainage. Another of the Sh25 million machine is expected in the country in the next three weeks.
