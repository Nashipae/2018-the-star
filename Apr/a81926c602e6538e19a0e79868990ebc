will back Morocco's bid to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup,Football
Kenya Federation president Nick Mwendwa has announced. He
assured a delegation from the Royal Moroccan Football Association who
had presented the bid book to him at the Federation headquarters at
the Goal project in Kasarani."Morocco have shown they are ready
to welcome the football world for the Fifa World Cup in 2026.As FKF
we are going to support their bid as their project is for all
Africans."Mwendwa asserted. Former
Nigerian international Daniel Amokachi who is among a hosts of
continental superstars backing the Moroccan bid said time is right
for the showpiece to be hosted on the African shores particularly
after the success of the 2010 showpiece in South Africa. "It
will be an honour for the whole continent when Morocco gets the
opportunity to host the World cup. Not only are they ready in terms
of facilities like stadia and hotels but have the history of leaving
a mark in the tournament" said Amokachi. Russia
will host the next tournament in June while Qatar will take charge of
the 2022 tourney.With South American nations Argentina and Uruguay
eyeing the centenary finals in 2030,Morocco are odds on favorites to
earn the rights to the 2026 finals. Should
the North African nation succeed it will be the second the that the
biggest football extravaganza is being hosted on the continent. South
Africa hosted Africa's first ever World cup in 2010.
