The Mwingi business community has urged Machakos Governor Charity Ngilu to visit. They promised Ngilu will not be heckled again. Ngilu’s visit on April 5 was cut short after youths disrupted her meeting at Musila Garden. Ngilu was to launch boda boda training, but had to cancel the plan and go back with the goods she had brought. She said she would return at an unspecified date. The business community, led by Muinde Mutukaa and Mwingi Central MCA Mary Kanini said Ngilu, said some residents are out to derail development using chaos. They said politics should not be mixed with development. The group said Ngilu should not have been mistreated. They warned politicians ‘hired’ to heckle leaders they will one day face the same fate. “There is no way you can pay less than 100 youths to come and disturb more than 11,000 residents of Mwingi. You cannot be our obstacle to development. Ngilu is the top-most leader of the county and she is not supposed to beg for permission from anybody to visit any area in the county. Come back we are eagerly waiting for you,” Kanini said. Joseph Kongo,the chairman of Mwingi business community, urged residents to work together to better Mwingi Central. "If we push the governor away, it is to our own disadvantage. Let’s cooperate and work together because she has an interest in developing this town,” he said.
