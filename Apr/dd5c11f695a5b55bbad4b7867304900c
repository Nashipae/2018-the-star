The government has set aside Sh350 million for the construction of a modern courts facility at the Kajiado county headquarters. Justice Aggrey Muchelule said the Resident Magistrates and High Courts will handle the rampant land disputes in the county. Muchelule said they will be established in line with a promise the Judicial Service Commission made in 2015. “This is our way of assisting the
people of Kajiado to access justice since the county is vast. People in
the furthest places of this county also require justice,” he noted on Monday after meeting JSC officials who were on a courtesy call at the county offices. Deputy Governor Martin Moshisho lauded the JSC for efforts to solve old cases. Moshisho admitted that Kajiado has many emotive land disputes. “The establishment of modern courts will ensure every citizen in the county accesses justice in a more efficient manner,” he said. The DG asked the commission to educate people on court processes so they are more
responsive to matters to do with the justice system and conflict resolution. In the past five years, the JSC's reform activities in the county have seen it set up courts in Ngong and Loitokitok towns. Click here for the latest political news
