The Kenya National Highway Authority has closed the Garissa-Bura highway following extensive damage on road sections. This comes barely four days after a woman died while trying to cross a flooded section of the road near Bilbil. Addressing the press on Saturday during an inspection tour, Kenha maintenance director Njuguna Katitu said the road will remain closed until the rains subside. “We warn the public against trying to walk across the floodwater. It is dangerous,” Katitu said. Those heading to Bura from Garissa will use the Nairobi-Mombasa route. Similarly those coming from Bura will use the Hola-Malindi-Mombasa route. Kenha will repair the major road that links Northeastern and the Coast. Among the hard hit are miraa traders who could not get their produce to Bura and Hola. Resident Tawane Mohamed from Madogo has relatives in Bilbil. He said several villages in Chewelle ward have been marooned and need to be rescued. “We are asking for a helicopter to airlift those who are trapped. We cannot be talking of repairing the road when homes and villages have been swept away,” he said. Miraa trader Abdikadir Jama said they are counting losses and the government should repair and open the road as soon as possible.
