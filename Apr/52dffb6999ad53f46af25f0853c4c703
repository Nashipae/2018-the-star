More than 5,000 pupils have abandoned education in Kerio Valley due to banditry. Elgeyo Marakwet Woman Representative Jane Chebaibai on Monday said although calm has returned, banditry has undermined education of both girls and boys. Conflicts in the region which revolve around cattle theft, sharing of pasture and water have forced hundreds of the learners to keep away from school. “We have so many of our girls who dropped out of schools and got married off while the boys took up arms to defend their communities,” she said. Chebaibai asked the county and national governments to set up a special fund for the education of the vulnerable learners. “With the return of peace we will have to invest more in resources to promote education in the region and reverse the negative impact of banditry on our communities,” she said.
