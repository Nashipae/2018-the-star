Kibos Sugar and Allied Industries Ltd has spent Sh400 million to maintain the Miwani–Mamboleo road in Kisumu. The road, which is an artery to Kibos, Chemelil Sugar Company, Muhoroni Sugar Company and Miwani Sugar Company, has now become impassable, forcing many motorists to use the Kericho- Awasi-Ahero-Kisumu road. There are claims the government allocated Sh10 billion for the construction of the road under the annuity programme. KSAIL Corporate Affairs manager Joyce Opondo (pictured) yesterday asked the national government to construct the road and open upthe drainage.
