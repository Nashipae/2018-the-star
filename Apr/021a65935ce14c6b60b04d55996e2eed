The massive transfer of school heads in the second term is ill-advised, Busia woman MP Florence Mutua has said. Primary and secondary schools open this week amid a row over transfer of headteachers. The Teachers Service Commission insists it only wants to promote effective learning through proper management. Its delocalisation policy is also meant to enhance national cohesion. But Mutua says the move will slow down learning and hurt performance. “We are opposed to the idea of transferring school heads from this area,” she said. Mutua faulted the TSC for sidelining leaders when making decisions on school management. She said the delocalisation policy should have been deliberated upon by all players before it was implemented. Many Busia school heads who were transferred were running programmes that had improved education standards, Mutua noted. “I know of teachers who have been moved to far-flung areas, despite having launched good programmes. One had started a programme that kept girls in school and we know this will soon be affected,” the legislator said. She plans to mobilise “like-minded MPs” to come up with a clear transfer strategy that will ensure the teachers’ employer does not act arbitrarily. Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers supported Mutua’s concern. Executive secretary Moffats Okisai said the TSC erred by redeploying teachers to other regions “without involving all stakeholders”.
