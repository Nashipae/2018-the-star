New and improved house and hardship allowances for teachers are yet to be implemented, despite the signing of the 2013-17 CBA in 2016. Some 312,000 teachers were expected to receive the house allowance following a negotiated deal with employer Teacher Service Commission. Those in areas mapped as hardship areas were to get hardship allowances. Some 10,000 teachers are yet to receive the improved package. In Uthiru, which is next to Nairobi, teachers are paid house allowance similar to those in rural areas, despite the schools being within the town. Speaking to the Star, Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers acting secretary general Moses Nturima said the TSC is still using old boundaries to award house allowances, a scheme described as unfair. “Some of our members are yet to earn the right allowances. The boundaries being used are old and are yet to be updated, despite the review. The TSC should refresh the list as schools reopen for the second term,” Nturima said. Similar concerns were raised by Kisumu West Knut branch executive secretary Edward Olando. He cited MM Shah Primary and Arya Primary in Kisumu. “The two are located a few metres apart yet those at MM Shah get enhanced house allowances, while their counterparts at Arya do not,” he said. Under the new policy, teachers were to earn the improved house allowances according to their workstations. The P1 teachers in Nairobi were to pocket Sh6,750 per month. Their counterparts in Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru, Nyeri, Eldoret, Thika, Kisii, Malindi and Kitale were set to earn Sh4,500 per month.
