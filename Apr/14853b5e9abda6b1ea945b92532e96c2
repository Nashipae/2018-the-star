Some Migori politicians have called for unity between Governor Okoth Obado and his rival in the last election former Cabinet minister Ochillo Ayacko. During a fund drive at Owich SDA church in Uriri constituency hosted by area MP Mark Nyamita, the leaders were urged to work together at county level in the same spirit as President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. Campaigns in Migori were marred by violence, intimidation and Ayacko filed a petition which is still ongoing in the Court of Appeal. Five MPs who supported Ayacko in the last election were at the function and called for peace and support for Obado. They were Paul Abuor (Rongo MP), Peter Masara (Suna West MP), Walter Owino (Awendo MP), Pamela Odhiambo (Woman representative).
