Former councillors have petitioned the Nyeri county assembly and the executive requesting for a budgetary allocation to pay them retirement benefits and pension. In a petition seen by the Star, the former civic leaders are requesting to be paid an ex-gratia one-off retirement benefit of between Sh1.5 million and Sh2 million. They also want the families of their former colleagues who died be considered, saying most councilors live in poverty. “That councillors be paid a Sh20,000 to Sh30,000 per month after service similar to the principle applied to MP and the President. Many public officers are paid pension after retirement,” they said. The councillors served in municipalities, town and local counties since Independence. The leaders, through their umbrella body the National Association of Former Councillors, said during their time of service, they were paid peanuts. They later became eligible for some allowances, which were subjected to taxation. “Upon leaving service involuntarily by reason of expiry of elective term, we received absolutely no retirement benefits or a monthly pension despite having served the public with dedication,” they say. They term the move discriminatory as all other public officers receive retirement money and pension. The ex-civic leaders say they do not see the reason why the state should not pay them pension or retirement benefits. The leaders sent a delegation to the governor to present the petition. Governor Mutahi Kahiga said they discussed various other issues. “We engaged on various issues where we can engage in partnerships with an aim to serve our society better. This is in light of their experience in matters administration,” he said.
