Hawa Ali epitomises the physical and mental agony of expectant mothers in Mandera. She has had four stillbirths, despite visiting the Khalalio dispensary and being attended to by traditional birth attendants. Many women in this region lose their children without knowing what or where the problem was. When Hawa got pregnant for the seventh time, she went to Mandera County Hospital and admitted to the modern maternity wing. She was diagnosed with severe anaemia and loss of loss of blood due to oozing. Unlike Hawa, many expectant mothers in her region shun health facilities. However, Hawa succeeded in breaking the traumatising cycle of pregnancy and still birth. She gave birth to a healthy child at the specialised maternity wing upgraded to death with high-risk pregnancies like hers. Mandera once had the world’s highest maternal mortality rate. IN 2008 WHO said it was 3,795 per 100,000 live births. The target is 147. But that has declined to 588 deaths per 100,000 live births in five years. Speaking to the Star on telephone, UNFPA country representative Siddharth Chatterjee, was emphatic that this should not be happening in the age of improved technology. Most women are used to TBAs. But they are unable to diagnose and treat conditions that may endanger the life of a woman and deal with complications during delivery. Since 2013the county has trained over 100 nurses and employed over 800 health workers. “We have localised health workers to the tune of 93 percent,” Mandera Governor Ali Roba said.
