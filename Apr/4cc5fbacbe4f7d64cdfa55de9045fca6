Mourners yesterday eulogised Kenneth Matiba as a man gave his life for Kenyans to enjoy multiparty democracy. "Matiba was a father who used his resources to change this country and improve individual lives. I am very sure that no one here can do that,” President Uhuru Kenyatta said. The family described him as a leader, a role model and father. “He was always at home to be with us, to bring us gifts, ensure we have a comfortable home and acquire the best education,” daughter Susan Matiba said. Susan is Matiba's first born child. Her siblings are Raymond, Ivy, Julie and Gitau. Matiba's grandchildren also attended his funeral service at the All Saints Cathedral in Nairobi. “It has been a long and busy ten days since he died. The time has come to rest with angels. You are a true hero and role model,” Susan said. “Dad will pass love and the gift of being fearless to our future generations.” Uhuru and Deputy William Ruto lead Kenyans during the service that was also attended by NASA co-principals Kalonzo Musyoka and Musalia Mudavadi. Former business associates, those mentored by Matiba and senior government officials also attended. “He lost the battle but won the war. We now have multiparty democracy because of Matiba and his courage,” said friend Joe Gilbert. The church, a three halls and four tents were set up for the church services to accommodate the large crowds’ eagers to be part of his send off.
