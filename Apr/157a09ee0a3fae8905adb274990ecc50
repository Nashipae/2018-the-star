Former national coach Benjamin Musa has decried the poor standards of boxing in the East Africa region and Africa as a whole and predicted doom if the situation doesn’t change. Musa said gone are the days when the region used to be a force to reckon with in the discipline. He said there is a major gap especially in Kenya in as far as boxing is concerned and that the country will soon grind to halt if urgent measures are not put in place. Musa also lamented that there are no longer youth structures hence they are forced to rely on fairly old crop of boxers. “Rising kids are no longer inspired to take up boxing because there is little to celebrate. You can imagine the generation that sprung up after the late Robert Wangila won gold in 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea,” he quipped. “The country has forgotten about feeder programs that used to supply the national team.” Musa, who is currently coaching the Tanzanian national team, said schools used to be active in supplying boxers but the current education system has worsened matters. “Pupils no longer have time to discover themselves in various fields and it is all about books. During our time, we used to proceed for sports at 4pm, immediately after classes, and that is why we had a lot of talent,” he added. He said the current crop of over age boxers will last a little longer because they no longer have options. “Young players are not coming through and we are forced to rely on the older generation,” he noted. “We have to revive the social halls in the estates and encourage youngsters to take up boxing.” He said teams like Posta, Kenya Airways, Breweries among other clubs no longer exist hence the current problems, adding that Boxing Association of Kenya leadership has also performed below par as the standards continue to plummet.
