The DPP Noordin Haji on Friday recommended charges against two rugby players accused of raping a lady in early February at an apartment in Kilimani, Nairobi. This followed the handing of an investigative report by detectives who took up the case after the lady made the allegations against suspects on social media. The lady revealed the alleged ordeal on her Instagram page and named Frank Wanyama, a Harlequins Rugby Club player, and one of his colleagues as the perpetrators. Detectives noted in their report that the players admitted having sex with the complainant but that it was consensual. They accused the lady of trying to extort them. The DPP's office took up the matter on April 2 soon after it was brought to his attention by social media users.
