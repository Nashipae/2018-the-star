The Employment and Labour Relations Court yesterday extended orders restraining Kenya Reinsurance Corporation Ltd from appointing another person to replace sacked managing director Jadiah Mwarania. Mwarania, who is seeking Sh82 million compensation, claims he was unlawfully sacked on March 18 this year and wants the court to declared the termination unlawful. He says his services were terminated without being heard and his rights were violated. He wants to be reinstated. The parties appeared before Justice Byram Ongwaya. The court heard the respondents intend to file their submissions in 14 days. Through lawyer Chacha Odera, Kenya Re said they require 14 days to file the response. But lawyer Judith Guserwa, for Mwarania, said he has filed all the documents and he would like the matter determined before the corporation holds an AGM on June 16. She said they obtained orders staying the appointment, advertisement or recruitment of another managing director. In the application filed on March 13, Mwarania said he has served at the corporation for close to 28 years. Kenya Re filed a replying affidavit disputing Mwaraniaâ€™s allegations, saying the termination was lawful. The case will be heard on May 17.
