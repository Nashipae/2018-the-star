Changara Dispensary in Teso North subcounty has been ranked the most improved in delivering maternal, newborn and healthcare services. The performance assessment report was released on Friday by the Health department, in partnership with Save the Children. The two came together to streamline MNH services in Level 2, 3 and 4 hospitals. The assessment aimed to gauge the readiness of hospitals to provide basic MNH services. Thirty seven hospitals were analysed in Teso North, Teso South, Nambale and Samia. Areas scrutinised included human resource, quality of services, annual work plan, MNH service charter and medicine availability. Others were readiness to offer maternity services, availability and correct use of equipment and maternal and prenatal mortality audits. The study revealed only Alupe and Kocholia subcounty conducts Rhesus factor tests. Less than half of the facilities have a well displayed service charter with the required information. No health facility in Teso South had an MNH service charter. Nambale Subcounty Hospital scored the highest, while Teso South scored the least in readness to offer maternity services. Maternal and prenatal mortality audits indicated seven out of the 27 health facilities conduct monthly reviews. Majority of the hospitals do not have active Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance Response committees. Alupe and Namboboto Mission health centre and Nangina Dispensary are among the best performing.
