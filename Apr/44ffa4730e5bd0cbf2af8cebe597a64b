Diamond Platnumz's brother Romy Jones has apologised to his wife after cheating on her with artiste Baraka the Price's girlfriend, Najma. Baraka exposed Romy's affair with his bae on social media after finding his salacious text messages on her phone.Â In an angry rant Baraka called Romy a "shenzi type" and a "wack pimp". In another post, Baraka posted a video clip of Romy Jones saying he loves his wife, and branded him "chicken head" for his hypocrisy. Seems like Romy Jones has realised his mistake. He posted: "Nakupenda sana mke wangu. Naomba unisamehe kwa lolote lililojitokeza na kukufanya ukose amani na furaha moyoni kwani furaha yako ni furaha yangu pia!!! Sisi ni binadam na hatujakamilika!!!! Nakupenda na nitazidi kukupenda daima. You are my love, my bestfriend, my happiness, my everything. Mungu tulindie ndoa yetu inshaallah."
