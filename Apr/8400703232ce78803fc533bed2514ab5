Two rugby players will be arraigned in court this morning to answer to charges of gang-raping a musician in Kilimani early this year. The woman is pregnant If convicted, the two Kenya Harlequin FC players will face at least 15 years in prison and, depending on the circumstances, they could face life imprisonment. Frank Wanyama and his unidentified colleague were arrested on Friday after the DPP Noordin Haji approved the charges. The rugby players had previously admitted having sex with the woman in an apartment but said it was consensual. In February, the musician on social media accused Wanyama and his colleague of drugging and luring her into his house where they repeatedly raped her. She claimed that the two raped her on February 10, on her birthday. In her police statement, the musician said she tried to confront Wanyama with the allegations but he dismissed her telling her to look for a lawyer in case she decides to go public. Wanyama accused her of attempting to extort him.
