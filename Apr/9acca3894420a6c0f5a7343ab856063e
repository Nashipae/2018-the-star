IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati has said he is not aware of any resignations by some of his commissioners. Chebukati said he only learned in media reports that Vice chairperson Consolata Nkatha and commissioners Paul Kurgat and Margaret Mwachanya had given up their positions. "I am yet to receive formal communication on this matter. The commission will give a comprehensive statement at an appropriate time," Chebukati said in a statement on Monday. Section 7A of the IEBC Act, however, states that any commissioner who wishes to resign must write to the President, not the Chairman. The three announced their resignations in the morning saying Chebukati has failed to give proper leadership. "With the deteriorating mistrust at the commission we feel that our position as commissioners is no longer tenable and we regret to tender our resignations with immediate effect," they said in a joint statement read by Mwachanya. After the resignations, the President gazettes a notice of vacancies at the commission within seven days. Part 3 of the law says that whenever such vacancies occur - by death, removal under section 251 or resignation by notice to the President - the recruitment of new members starts immediately after the President's notice. The commission was reduced to six after Roselyn Akombe fled the country and announced her resignation from New York just before the October 26 repeat presidential election.
