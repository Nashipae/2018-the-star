The first Sh2.5 billion phase of oil and gas drilling in Lamu’s Pate Island has started. Work on the fi rst well, Pate 2, commenced on Friday. It is being undertaken by the Zarara Oil and Gas Limited, a subsidiary of Midway Resources International. The drilling is on blocks L4 and L13 located near the Sh2.5 trillion Lamu Port South Sudan Ethiopia Transport (Lapsset) project. Initially, drilling was scheduled for June 2017 but it was delayed due to technical and financial issues. On Friday, Zarara Oil and Gas country manager Peter Nduru said the company had contracted Drilling Spares & Services, a Kenyan company. “The company is to drill and run 20-inch casings for both Pate 2 and Pate 3 wells up to 300 metres. We had to mobilise the drill from Nairobi because we trust in its previous record,” Nduru said. Preparations for drilling were completed in December. Drilling on each well is expected to reach a depth of 4.5 kilometres. The drilling comes 48 years since Shell-BP drilled Pate-1 well for natural gas.
