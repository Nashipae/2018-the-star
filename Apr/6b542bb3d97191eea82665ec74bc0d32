President Uhuru Kenyatta is to deliver his final State of the Nation address on Wednesday, and expectations are running high. This will be a major, perhaps momentous exposition on Kenya’s future. It comes almost two suspense-filled months after the handshake and cooperation deal on March 9 between the President and Opposition leader Raila Odinga. This cooled political temperatures, promised to heal divisions and, according to all the hype, ushered in a new era of hope. No more platitudes and promises.Kenyans want to know exactly what’s in that deal in detail. The President should seize the goodwill and walk the talk in implementing bipartisan pledges for a better Kenya. He must mercilessly crack the whip on corrupt public officials. Lazy, non-performing Cabinet Secretaries, CASs and PSs must go. No exceptions. The President should implement his Big Four agenda fairly in all 47 counties, not in a preferred few. Constitution Article 123 says the President must lead the nation in realising unity, sharing and devolution of power, rule of law, democracy and public participation. All eyes are on Uhuru.
