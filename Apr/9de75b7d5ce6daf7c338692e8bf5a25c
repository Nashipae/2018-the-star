The man accused of defrauding MPs and the public using Murang’a Woman Representative Sabina Chege’s name will spend seven more days in custody as his pre-bail report is not ready. City court chief magistrate Roseline Oganyo ordered Benson Masubo, alias Waziri Chacha, to remain in custody until the probation officers report about his residence is provided in court on April 25. She granted the prosecution’s application after the probation officer told the court the report on Chacha was not ready. Oganyo said she was referred to handle the matter on April 12, but she has been held up with other matters and only met the accused on Wednesday.  “The report has been sent to our office in Kehancha where Chacha resides and an inquiry report will be conducted next Monday,” she said.
