MPs last week resolved to exclude Justice Mohammed Warsame from the list of appointees to the Judicial Service Commission. They were angry at the Judiciary’s refusal to subject one of its nominees to their authority. They also defied the court’s injunction against vetting Warsame and purported to do so in ‘absentia’. Judge Warsame was elected to serve a second term by his colleagues of the Court of Appeal in exercise of their mandate under Article 171(1c) of the Constitution, which stipulates that the Commission shall include “one Court of Appeal judge elected by the judges of the Court of Appeal”. Nowhere does the Constitution state that the Court’s nominee shall be subjected to further vetting by Parliament. Indeed, the Constitution expressly confers such mandate on MPs with regard to only the public’s representatives — “one woman and one man to represent the public, not being lawyers, appointed by the President with the approval of the National Assembly”. The threat to change the law to bring the Judiciary to heel is an absurd and overzealous attempt by Parliament to usurp power. It is a bid to circumscribe the Court’s discretion on whom to deploy as its representative at the JSC. It is hypocritical for MPs to imagine they can vet every member because, after all, will they also vet the CJ, who is chairman? This propensity by crucial institutions to misinterpret the law for political expediency must be called out.
