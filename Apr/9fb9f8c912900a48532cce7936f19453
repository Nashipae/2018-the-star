Can Olympic and world 3,000m steeplechase champion Conseslus Kipruto complement Wycliffe Kinayamal’s effort with a second gold medal in Gold Coast today? This is the million-dollar question Kenyans are waiting an answer to as the Games enter the penultimate stage. “I will not speak for others but I can confidently tell you that I will deliver. Commonwealth Games means a lot to me, considering I already have the world and Olympic Games titles,” he said. Kipruto said he is here on a history-making mission and he believes nothing will stop him. He teams up with Amos Kirui and Abraham Kibiwott, who are equally oozing with confidence. Kirui and Kibiwott said all they need is for Kipruto to show them the way. “He is our leader and once he puts us on the right track, we promise Kenyans that we will not disappoint,” he added. Olympic silver medalist and Club Games defending champion Julius Yego starts his title defence today as the javelin programme gets underway at 11am. Yego starts favourite considering he tops the field with his personal best of 92m and a season best of 77.82m. He, however, faces stiff challenge from India’s Viper Kasha, who has already covered 80.04m this season. Australian Hamish Peacock, who will be enjoying home support, is also a contender with a PB of 84.39 and a season’s best of 83.87 metres. Similar threat will come from South Africa’s Phil-mar Janse Van Rensburg, who has a PB of 80.49 and this year’s best of 79.91m. New Zealand’s Ben Langton Bureel has also been at his best this year, posting a season’s best and PB of 82.44m. Meanwhile, another lethal Kenyan pair of world 1,500m champion Elijah Manang’oi and silver medallist Timothy Cheruiyot begin their campaign with the first round today. Together with Kumari Taki, the three are expected to go through the first round unscathed with the final scheduled for tomorrow.
