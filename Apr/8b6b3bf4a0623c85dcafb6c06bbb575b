The government plans to standardize electricity rates for lower consumers in the next two months by pumping in Sh50 billion, Energy CS Charles Keter has said. Responding to concerns that electricity costs had made business expensive, Keter said they was working "on an elaborate plan to lower the cost of power". “We want to come up with flat rates for consumers of between 0.50 units and 51-1,000 units in our new tariffs regime to be launched in the next few days,” he told delegates at Kakamega High School. According to Keter, the government is targeting to connect at least 70 per cent of the country’s homestead to electricity . The CS told the devolution conference in Kakamega that the final phase of connecting homes in off grid areas had delayed because contractors were experiencing financial challenges. He dismissed the notion among consumers that Kenya Power was responsible for high electricity charges, saying the cost is determined by generation. "Kenya Power is just an off-taker between the consumer and the generator," he noted. He denied claims by counties that the national government was favouring some areas in the electricity supply plan. Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia had, during the plenary discussion, accused the government of lacking fairness. “We want the national government to be equitable,” Kimemia said. He said the new tariffs regime will be necessitated by the need to by the government to do away with other unnecessary charges imposed on power. “The government will do away with Water Resource Management Authorities levies,” said Keter who noted that the state will bear the Warma costs.
