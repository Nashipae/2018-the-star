The West Pokot government has distributed free maize seeds to 135,000 farmers. Agriculture executive Geoffrey Lipale on Monday said this is 90 per cent of the county’s farming population. The county came up with the food security programme to fight perennial hunger, which has impoverished residents and forced them to rely on food aid. The county is targetting every vulnerable person who owns land to capitalise on the ongoing long rains. For the past two months it has been ploughing land for farmers at a subsidised fee to fast-track the process, which will cost millions of shillings. “We want to empower residents to learn how to produce their own food since we have fertile land,” he said. Governor John Lonyangapuo said the county, whose people depend on livestock, has large swathes of fertile land that is capable of producing enough food to feed residents. The two spoke at Kapenguria where they flagged off consignments of free maize seeds.  MIXED FARMING Lonyangapuo said the county receives enough rainfall, which is underutilised, and a favourable climate for producing food crops. He said they want to change residents mindset from keeping livestock to mixed farming. “During droughts we are worst hit by the effects since we only depend on animals, which have no pasture to feed on, [hence no means to] sustain our families,” Lonyangapuo said. Lonyangapuo and Lipale were accompanied by local chiefs. They said they have linked up with the national government to identify landowners who lack the means to plant food crops.
