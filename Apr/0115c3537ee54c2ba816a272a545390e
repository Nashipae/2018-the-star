Nyamira is among counties with poor revenue collection due to lack of legislation. The Commission for Revenue Allocation on Tuesday said the county is one of the 14 yet to automate revenue collection systems. Speaking in Nyamira, CRA commissioner Irene Koech said it was possible the county was losing millions  because it has no efficient collection system. “We have determined that Nyamira revenue collection is much behind  expectation. We have come to put in place measures for an efficient revenue collection system,” Koech said. Koech raised doubts on the capability of those in charge of revenue collection in the county. “There is need to relook at those in charge of revenue collection so that we improve the system,” the commissioner said. CRA head of ICT Joseph Kuria said the county’s revenue collection had declined since 2015. The county collected Sh94 million in 2013 and made an increase of Sh10 million the following year. In 2015, county revenue collection hit Sh106 million. “The collection dropped to Sh93 million in 2016 which raises questions. We must establish what caused the drop in 2016 and 2017,” Kuria said. Governor John Nyagarama defended his officers, but admitted there was a problem in the revenue collection department. ”There is a big mess in the revenue collection department. We’ll do everything possible to have legislation in place to guide the county,” Nyagarama said. “We need to improve our revenue collection if we have to grow and develop the county in line with the vision we have.”
