Anglican archbishop Jackson Sapit has added his voice to the debate on polygamy saying it is not biblical. During the launch of the Bungoma Cathedral on Tuesday, Sapit criticised those supporting the practice, saying it will only break marriages . “The Bible says one man shall marry one wife and the debate on whether polygamy should be allowed should not even exist among Christian faithful in the first place,” he said. Sapit reacted to remarks by Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni Muchomba who last week said rich men should marry many wives. She said polygamy would solve the problem of alcoholism and street families, adding that bringing up children in the absence of their fathers was the major cause. Muchomba said it was hypocritical to keep quiet on the matter. The sentiments elicited many reactions across Kenya. Sapit said marriage is the cornerstone of a family and should only involve two consenting adults. He said polygamy solves nothing. Sapit condemned homosexuality, saying Christians should not engage in the practice because it is ungodly. preach peace “As a church, we only encourage sex among people of the opposite sex, after all, the purpose of marriage is procreation,” he said. Sapit called on the church to be on the forefront in spreading peace. This comes weeks after the mystery handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM’s Raila Odinga. “As the Anglican church, having understood that the country was polarised before and after the last polls, we have embarked on peacebuilding countrywide as a way to support the reconciliation gesture by the two leaders,” Sapit said. He said communities that were divided because of politics should reconcile. food shortage “With politics behind us, we call upon every community to go back to their farms so that we don’t face food shortages like in the past,” Sapit said. He said many Kenyans had on many occasions politicked at the expense of farming, putting the country at risk of food shortage.
