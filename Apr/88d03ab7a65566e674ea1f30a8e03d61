Christine Ongare finally gave boxers something to celebrate after punching her way into the medal bracket in the women’s 51kg category at Oxenford Studio here in Gold Coast. Ongare was unstoppable as she knocked down Sri Lanka’s Dulani Jayasinghe in the second round of the a one-sided affair. Ongare led throughout the first half as she subjected her opponent to heavy body blows. The second round was even more painful for the Sri Lankan as Ongare set on her with upper cuts and more fierce punches, forcing the referee to stop contest. Ongare said she is happy to have crossed the first hurdle and placed herself in the medal bracket. “It was going to be shameful as the boxing fraternity to return home empty handed. I want to push this further so that the gold can shine on us all,” she noted . She said she is not going to be complacent after entering the medal bracket as she still has work to do. “I want to win gold, that’s my target. I am determined to go all the way and make my country proud. The Sports Cabinet Secretary, Rashid Echesa, has also talked to me and I even feel more encouraged and energized,” she added. She said boxing is a mind game and she seemed to have an edge over her opponent. “I noticed that she has some weaknesses, which I capitalised on to send her packing,” she said, adding that despite losing in the other bouts, she received a lot of support from her colleagues. “They were very supportive and I want to dedicate this feat to all of them,” she added. She takes on Carly McNaul of Northern Ireland, who eliminated Oyisat Oriyomi of Nigeria. Coach Patrick Maina said he will study the footage of Ongare’s opponent and plan ahead of tomorrow’s bout. “She fought according to the rules and I am happy she crossed the hurdle,” he observed. He said Ongare is a candidate for the final but warned her not to be complacent. “Her feat is inspiring and we can now walk with confidence,” he added.
