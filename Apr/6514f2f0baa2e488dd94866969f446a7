Police in Eldama-Ravine, Baringo county, are investigating three prison lorries that were seized transporting timber on Tuesday. Area police boss Agnes Kamau said the 21 tonnes of timber were allegedly destined for the prisons industry in Ruiru, Nairobi. She said the lorries were loaded in the Metipsoo Forest, a few kilometres from Ravine town. “I received a message from the KFS at 5pm alerting me of the incident. We found the individuals did not have a transportation permit,” Kamau said. She said, however, nobody was arrested, although the “drivers are just around and will soon be called to come and record statements”. The lorries are being held at the police station. On February 24, a 90-day logging moratorium was imposed.
