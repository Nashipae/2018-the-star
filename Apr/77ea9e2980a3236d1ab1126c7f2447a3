Embakasi East MP Babu Owino has appealed against the March 2 nullification of his election victory. He wants the Court of Appeal to set aside the ruling on scrutiny and recount ordered by Justice Joseph Sergon on February 12. Babu says the petition filed by his opponent Francis Mureithi should be dismissed. He says Sergon ignored the legal standard for evaluating evidence in election petitions. Instead, Babu says the judge ascribed excessive weight to irrelevant and weak evidence to make a wrong decision. He said the judge made a mistake in concluding the results of the election were not verifiable on the basis of a sample of administrative errors in only two out of 208 polling stations.
