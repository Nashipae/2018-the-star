Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa has asked Kenyans to exercise patience as the country pushes for more titles at the ongoing Commonwealth Games here in Gold Coast. The CS said having been a boxer himself, he knows too well that it is never over until it is over. “We have just covered a quarter of the events here and we still have a chance to deliver more medals,” he said. Besides, he said the team here is a relatively young one and are generally looking into the future. The CS was speaking to the media after addressing the Kenyan delegation at the Athletes Village. “ We are looking beyond this event and we hope to use the lessons we have learnt here at the 2020 Olympic Games,” he added. He said the average age of the athletes in Gold Coast is 22 years and winning any medal or reaching the final is encouraging. The CS said he will spearhead the review of the games and forge the way forward with the focus mainly on the 2020 Olympic Games. He said the Kenyan athletes will soon start seeing the results of the recently signed partnership between Kenya and Cuba. “I have used the first three months trying to understand the sports fraternity and I intend to engage gear two soon,” he added. He said he has been assured by the athletes that all is well and the tide will change starting today. He called on all sports federation to partner with the Government and Nock as they seek to take sports to the next level. “For us to empower the youth, we must ensure they are well remunerated. As the sports CS, I will make sure that this is done." Click here for the latest political news
