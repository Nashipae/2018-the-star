Nairobi is the biggest beneficiary of Sh314 billion shareable revenue allocated to the counties for the 2018-2019 financial year. The county will receive the lions share of the cash, after it received an allocation of Sh15.7 billion. The amount is an increase of Sh300 million from the previous financial year, according to the County Allocation of Revenue Bill 2018 tabled in Senate yesterday. Kilifi received the second highest allocation of Sh10.8 billion. That means Governor Amason Kingi’s administration will receive an increase of Sh900,000 from its allocation in the previous year. Other counties with highest allocations include Turkana (Sh10.7 billion), Kakamega (Sh10.3 billion), Nakuru (Sh9.4 billion), Kiambu (Sh9.3 billion), Bungoma (Sh8.9 billion), Kitui (Sh8.7 billion), Wajir (Sh8.4 billion) and Machakos (Sh8.3 billion).

The Sh314 billion is an increase from Sh302 billion allocated to the counties in the 2017-2018 financial year. The counties will receive  Sh58.7 billion as conditional grants. The total allocation is equivalent to 39.8 per cent of recent audited revenues approved by National Assembly, Mahamud said. “Out of the total conditional allocations from the revenue raised nationally, Sh16.1 billion will be transferred to the county governments and will be included in the budgets of county governments to be approved by the respective county assemblies,” Mohamud said.
