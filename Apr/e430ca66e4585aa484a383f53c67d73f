A human rights group has called for the transfer of police bosses in Ukunda, Likoni and Amu in Kwale, Mombasa and Lamu counties respectively, saying they have failed to end killings. Haki Africa boss Hussein Khalid said crime is out of control in Ukunda, Bongwe and Diani in Kwale, Bamburi, Likoni and Nyali in Mombasa and Amu in Lamu. Notorious gangs terrorise residents. “We want the IG Joseph Boinnet to immediately transfer the bosses in police stations in those areas. They have failed to reign in crime,” Khalid told the Star on phone yesterday. The lobby group said Likoni has been turned into a crime zone where gangs operate at will. On Tuesday evening, two politicians in Ukunda were gunned down by unknown assailants. The attackers accosted the victims and sprayed them with bullets. The duo, a former Ukunda MCA aspirant, Kombo Gude alias Kombo Chui and his ally Nassib Diti, were killed in as they returned home. Msambweni police boss Joseph Chebusit allayed fears the attackers were al Shabaab returnees. “It is too early to say that. Let us not speculate. Investigations will give definitive answers when all is complete,” Chebusit told reporters. Khalid said the killings have caused panic among residents. “We are calling on the police to act swiftly and an end the spate of killings. Kenyans have a right to security,” Khalid added in a statement.
