Kwale Woman Representative Zulekha Juma has written to Speaker Justin Muturi on amendments to the NHIF Act. Zulekha is seeking the introduction of a mandatory requirement for all public officers to be entitled to payment of benefits for medical expenses only at public hospitals. She has requested the National Assembly Speaker to assist in the preparation of the necessary legislative proposal. "With the dwindling health services in the country, it is hoped that the amendment will not only ensure public hospitals get added funding to be better staffed and equipped, but also ensure constant oversight of service delivery by leaders across the country in this crucial sector," she notes in the proposal. The Act says benefits paid out of the fund include a daily allowance in respect of medical treatment and a hospital's recommendations. It states that no benefits will be paid except in respect of treatment received by a contributor, his wife or husband, a child or any other named person. The benefits paid will not, in any case, exceed expenses incurred by the contributor, it also states. It also notes that contributors will not be entitled to benefits unless they produce cards showing contributions have been made. The Act further indicates that no benefit shall be paid in respect of any expenses incurred by a contributor before the start of contributions. In 2015, Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali asked Parliament to amend the NHIF Act to protect Kenyans from exploitation. Washiali said the outpatient cover had resulted in endless complaints by the public.
