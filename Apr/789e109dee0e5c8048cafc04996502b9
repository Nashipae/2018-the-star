The Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industries wants the East African Community to harmonise taxes to boost cross-border trade. Busia county vice chairperson Fred Papa yesterday said the Kenyan business community in the border town of Malaba is disadvantaged because of the low taxes imposed on goods on the Ugandan side. He said many Kenyans prefer to shop in the neighbouring country because its goods are cheaper. “Trade on the Kenyan side is declining. We’re seeing our people lose jobs. Our people also want to grow economically,” Papa said, urging the government to intervene.
