Leaders turned cheeky at the devolution conference on Wednesday, in an apparent reference to a video of Kirinyaga Deputy Governor Peter Ndambiri. Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said he had declared a 24-hour economy and that reports indicated this was working. "You know very well that yesterday I declared a 24-hour economy. And what you hear is that it is working," he said. Devolution Minister Eugene Wamalwa said: “Indeed it is working and [Kirinyaga] Governor [Anne] Waiguru can attest to it.” They spoke before Opposition leader Raila Odinga took the state to deliver his keynote address. Raila also lightened the mood at the conference when he said most of the guests seemed tired from working at night without lights. "Some of you seem to be tired because Oparanya said this is a 24-hour economy...," he said to laughter. "The Governor told me that although it's a 24-hour economy, some decided to save electricity bills by working at night without lights." In his response, the DG termed the video concocted and edited. "I wish to state clearly and categorically that this so-called video has not emanated from my end, neither have I invited anyone for a date." He went on to say: "I can only describe it as panic action from some faceless, politically unworthy opponents who are using my name to advance their diabolical games." Ndambiri asked the public to "treat the video full of lies and malice with the contempt it deserves." Police termed the video strange and said they were investigating. Reports indicate the ordeal may have been part of a set-up. Read: Police probing video clip on Kirinyaga Deputy Governor Click here for the latest political news
