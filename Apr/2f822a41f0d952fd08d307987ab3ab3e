Two top Makueni security officers on Wednesday failed to appear before the assembly’s ad hoc committee formed to look in to rising crime in Wote town. County commissioner Maalim Mohammed and police commander Kalimbo Mwandoe were to face the committee at 2pm. But chairman Douglas Mbilu (speaker) told the MCAs that the two had indicated they would not show up. Mohammed told him on the phone that though he was not in the office, he would not have appeared before the committee anyway. He was unhappy with the MCAs for putting his office on the spot over the matter. “They have indicated that they took offence, particularly the county commissioner, [who said] his office had been published in a newspaper...[that they had been] invited by the committee, which in my view is absolutely misguided,” he said during a sitting in the speaker’s boardroom. NO OFFICIAL SUMMONSES Mohammed told the Star the committee does not have the authority to summon him, especially through a newspaper notice. He said the summon was made in bad faith. But Mbilu said the committee was guided by the Constitution, which provides that public business shall be conducted in the open. The exception is where the chairperson finds that there are issues that cannot be discussed in public, he said. Mbilu said they formally invited the two senior security officers and did not summon them through a newspaper. “For one to purport that he cannot come to the committee because he was not formally invited and that the assembly committee was the one to go to his office is a misplaced thought of the old constitution and lack of social responsibility,” he said. He said the team will proceed to look in to the crime problem and file a report. The committee was formed following a petition by Wote town residents after numerous theft and burglary cases.
