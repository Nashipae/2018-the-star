Swaziland’s King Mswati's eighth wife has committed suicide following drug overdose. Senteni Masango was found dead in the early hours of Friday morning, news outleto in the South African country reported. According to Mpumalanga news, the late queen's funeral will be held at Ludzidzini Royal Kraal on Saturday, April 7. She will be laid to rest on Sunday in line with the Royal Swazi rites. Her death comes barely a week after the burial of her sister Nombuso Masango. The king’s wife is said to have taken an overdose of about 40 amytriptyline capsules.

She was described as a high school drop-out. Click here for the latest political news
