More than 600 pregnant women and 1,500 children under five have crossed into Kenya seeking refuge after Ethiopia declared a six-month nationwide state of emergency last month. The displaced are living in three makeshift camps in Moyale. They include Sololo camp with a population of 4,757, Somare camp at 4,910 and Cifa/Butiye camp holding 890 people. A report from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies indicates a risk of disease outbreak in the camps due to congestion as well as poor water and sanitation. Essential drugs are in short supply, especially for under-fives. Four cases of diarrhoea and five cases of tuberculosis have already been reported.“The most critical needs and gaps in the ongoing response are WASH, Health, Shelter and Protection. Poor sanitation and hygiene due to insufficient latrines and lack of solid waste management are risk factors for disease outbreak with the ongoing rains. Close monitoring and isolation is needed to prevent a worsening of situation,” the report says. The report also says the displaced population have gathered in tents which can hardly accommodate them with minimal separation by gender and age, hence, no privacy. Registration at the camps is still ongoing. So far, there are 615 pregnant women, 940 lactating mothers, 723 under- 5 males,  753 under-5 females, 50 living with disabilities, 125 unaccompanied children, 71 elderly males and 105 elderly females. Another 1,200 people are expected to join the camps from Olla Waqo Dogo, Telle Dambi, Guchi, Argane, Madho, Chana Mudha and Mor Mora, Mudiambo, Tatesa, Chamuk, Tille Madho and Qetal. More displaced persons are also expected through border villages of Gada Korma, Bori, Kukub, Mado Adhi, Wayegodha and Uran. Access to health facilities has been constrained due to insecurity and inadequate number of health service.
