A chief in Chure location, Imenti South constituency on Saturday committed suicide in unclear circumstances. Residents found the body of the deceased, Geoffrey Mwiti dangling from an avocado tree behind his house at 6am. A resident, Koome Gichuru said the deceased was more than a chief to them. "Whenever criminal was brought in his office, he counselled them and made them understand their mistakes. Sometimes he forgave them, when they promised to change." Gichuru said. South Imenti deputy county commissioner Mugo Gichiri told the Star that investigations have been launched. "There are claims that he was trying to borrow a soft loan of Sh50,000 from friends. However, we can't conclude this made him take his own life." Gichiri said. "It is also not clear whether he hanged himself or something else happened to him." Gichiri said a postmortem will be done to establish the exact cause of death. He eulogised him as a wonderful officer adding that his death was a big loss to them.
