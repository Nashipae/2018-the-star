A 48-year-old man in Lari on Monday reported his mother, 87, to the area chief demanding to know where she got him from. Peter Karanja asked his mother Damaris Wanjiru at Kinale chief’s office if she was his mother. He told chief Jeremiah Thuku he is hated by everybody in the family and his inheritance is in jeopardy. “I want this woman to tell you where I came from. I’m not certain she is my mother. She doesn’t treat me like a son,” Karanja said. Wanjiru, who was accompanied by women of her age, said Karanja was born at AIC Kijabe Mission Hospital on April 17, 1970, at 8pm. He is the eighth of her 12 children. She named her son Kinoro, a name that was meant to bring blessings to him, but her late husband David Mbugua changed it to Karanja. “I went through painful labour when I was giving birth to Karanja. Little did I know he will deny me,” a tearful Wanjiru said. But Karanja said he visited the hospital and the child who Wanjiru says she gave birth to was not documented. The chief and Wanjiru requested Karanja to go back to the hospital and ask for the notification records and look out for a child named Kinoro. Wanjiru and her other children said they don’t hate him. The siblings said in their fathers will, Karanja was entitled to a share of his land.
