Some 2,000 ECDE teachers in Bungoma county will finally be paid after months of a tussle with the county government. Governor Wycliffe Wangamati's administration last September stopped their salaries, saying they were not budgeted for by his predecessor's government. Wangamati has now agreed to pay them the salary arrears by end of April. Speaking at Kimilili Boys High School on Tuesday evening, he said he has saved Sh400 million, which will be paid to the teachers. Wangamati spoke at the farewell of party of outgoing principal Patrick Wandili. â€œWe [will] ensure that learning in our ECDE facilities run smoothly," he said.
