There are fears of a disease outbreak in Meru town, and it’s suburbs. Residents complain about lack of water in taps for one week, despite heavy rains and flooding. Those who spoke to the Star said there is a likelihood of emergence of waterborne disease. Mary Gaichu, a resident of Gitimbine in Meru town, Imenti North, said sanitation and drainage areas are damaged. “We are forced to drink contaminated water directly from Kathita River that can easily cause diarrhoea, cholera, typhoid or dysentery,” she said. Meru Water and Sewerage Services GM Robert Miruri yesterday said they have plans to construct a more significant storage facility system. “Workers will remove silt, mud, and blocks interfering with the flow of water into the pipes,” he said.
