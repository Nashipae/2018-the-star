Police in Bungoma have launched a manhunt for a househelp who is suspected to have killed an eight-month-old baby on Friday. The suspect from Kakamega town killed baby Becky Aliva while her mother, Cynthia Aliva, was at work. Aliva said she had lived with the forty-one-year-old domestic worker for two and a half months. She got the maid through a friend. The mum told journalists on Sunday at her home, she left her baby under the woman’s care and went to work. Aliva said when she went home for lunch, she found the baby fine. “When I returned home in the evening, I found the maid and her belongings missing. My baby was unresponsive in the bedroom. She was wrapped in a blanket,” Aliva said. She screamed, alerting neighbours. The baby was rushed to hospital on a motorbike. Doctors confirmed she was dead. Weeping, Aliva said she does not understand why the suspect killed her only child. “She looked harmless. We have never quarrelled. I paid her salary. She was diligent in her work,” she said. Bungoma South OCPD David Kirui said police are following leads. A post-mortem report has revealed the baby died of choking. Bungoma South DCIO Bernard Chepkwony yesterday told journalists the post-mortem was done on Saturday. Specimens were taken to the Government Chemist to check for poisoning, he said. A family friend, William Isigi, claimed the maid knows something about the death and should be arrested.
