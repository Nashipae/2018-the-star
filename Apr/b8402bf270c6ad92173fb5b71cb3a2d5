Murang’a prison had its first open day in five years as it seeks to end stigma against inmates. Officer in charge Bison Madegwa said prisons are meant to rehabilitate prisoners and the society should receive prisoners once they leave and start their lives afresh. He said the prison plans to hold two open days annually to prepare relatives to accept former inmates back into their homes after they are released. “The only hiccup is that these events are not funded and we rely on sponsors,” Madegwa said. He said the events help families bond with prisoners which makes reintegration easier. Madegwa said former convicts who receive a hostile reception from their family more often than not end up becoming jailbirds. “We have noted that some prisoners deliberately commit crimes so they can return to prison because of poor relations with their families,” he said. This, Madegwa said, has led to congestion of the prison which holds 761 inmates, yet its capacity is 300. Open days also provide a platform for prisoners to showcase the skills they developed while doing time. Hostility from family members pushes some former convicts to set aside the skills they learnt and revert to crime. “Their problems are aggravated by lack of employment as many people are unable to trust them enough to employ them due to their criminal record,” Madegwa said. He said former convicts should be given capital to start their own businesses. Madegwa trains prisoners in tailoring, electricals installation, carpentry, masonry, mechanics and agriculture.
