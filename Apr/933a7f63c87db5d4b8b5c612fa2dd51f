The Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) Network has called on the national government to settle dues owed to about 100,000 of its members countrywide who were not captured in the January settlement exercise. The national secretary of the Network, Raphael Eyanai said the government has to fully honour an agreement that was sealed in 2015 which stipulated that each member was to be paid Sh200, 000 as compensation. "The government made a partial payment of Sh 50, 000 to some 83, 891 members while the rest are yet to be captured. We have a membership of more than 181, 000 who also include forest evictees,”Eyanai spoke in Kitale on saturday. He spoke after an election that saw members of the Network elect new county officials where Mark Adir was elected as county coordinator, Lucy Onsesre as Treasurer and Jane Minayo as the woman representative. Members of the network who are yet to be compensated by the government said they have been suffering with their families since falling prey to evictions from their former homesteads. "It has not been easy since some of us are unable to provide education for our children who engage in child labour just to fend for themselves,” said Christopher an IDP from Saboti.
