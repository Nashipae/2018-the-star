Lawyer Miguna Miguna left Dubai for Toronto on Air Canada flight AC 057 that departed April 1, 2018, minutes to midnight. Reports have emerged that he boarded the plane while under the escort of UAE police. The self-declared NRM Kenya general was heard expressing his intention to sue Emirates Airlines for taking him back to Dubai against his will. Miguna Miguna has, out of his own voalition and with the assistance of the Canadian Consulate in UAE, travelled to and arrived in Toronto, Canada. He will undergo toxicology tests and treatment for the chemicals used to sedate and poison him. He will return thereafter. Miguna was forced into a Dubai-bound plane by Kenyan authorities on March 28 after he was denied entry into the country. A court had ordered that he be facilitated to acquire a passport so as to attend hearings.
