Activist Okiya Omtatah yesterday moved to court challenging the single sourcing and direct procurement of private service providers on e-Citizen platform, saying it was arbitrarily done. Omtatah also wants money raised through the platform and how it is utilised made public. He has sued National Treasury CS Henry Rotich and Attorney General Paul Kariuki in the petition filed at the Milimani Law Courts. Omtatah says the administrative fee of Sh50 per transaction on the platform is unjustified, exorbitant and exploitative. He says the charges are unreasonable and unlawful. "The petitioner posits the transaction fee is way above the market rate for such services and was set without any benefit of a market survey to ascertain the average market price as required by law," Omtatah said. There are seven digital payment options on e-Citizen including M-Pesa, Airtel Money, Visa Card, Eazzypay, E-Agent, KCB Cash, Equity Cash and MasterCard. Omtatah said all were single sourced and directly procured in contemptuous contravention of both the Constitution and the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act.
