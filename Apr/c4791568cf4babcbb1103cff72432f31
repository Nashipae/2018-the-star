The Insurance Regulatory Authority has said its powers to appoint receiver managers to run unstable underwriters is in line with the Constitutionâ€™s provision for protection of consumers. The authority has asked the High Court to dismiss a petition in which the Law Society of Kenya sought to strip IRA of the powers. LSK has accused IRA of abusing the power because none of the underwriters placed under statutory management since 2005 have been revived. IRA says the underwriter faced unique challenges. The firms placed under receivership are United Insurance (2005), Standard Assurance (2009), Blueshield Insurance (2011) and Concord Insurance (2013).
