A parliamentary committee is pushing to change the formula on equal sharing of CDF money between constituencies. National Assembly Special Funds Committee is chaired by Kathuri Murungi. Yesterday, he said it is unfair for the multimillion-shilling kitty to be shared equally among the 290 constituencies. Murungi said population should be considered. The committee wants the law passed in 2016 for equal sharing of CDF money changed to cure the imbalance between marginalised constituencies and the more developed. Murungi is the Imenti South MP. He raised the issue during the committee’s meeting with National Government Constituency Development Fund board acting CEO Yusuf Mbuno at Parliament Buildings. Mbuno was with two NGCDF board officials when they appeared before the committee. They shared information on constituencies accounts as audited by Auditor General Edward Ouko for 2013-14 and 2015-16. The new CDF law limits money from the kitty to only support national government programmes in constituencies such schools, bursaries and security-related projects like police posts. “The kitty targets security and education. However, you find a constituency with a small population of people sharing equal funds with a constituency having a high population like mine which has about 300,000. It becomes very difficult to even build one classroom,” Murungi said. The previous law which favoured poor constituencies provided that the budget ceiling for each constituency was to be three-quarters of the amount specified in law divided equally among all constituencies.
