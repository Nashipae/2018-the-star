The Ministry of Health has moved to stop a strike by 5,000 clinical officers in public hospitals. The clinicians on Wednesday issued a 28-day strike notice to the government for allegedly messing up the process of negotiating their CBA. Yesterday, Health Secretary Sicily Kariuki invited officials of the Kenya Union of Clinical Officers to listen to their grievances. Kuco secretary general George Gibore confirmed the officials were meeting the CS at Afya House in Nairobi yesterday. “We received the invitation this week for the meeting with the CS, we do not know who else was invited,” he told the Star. The workers are demanding a collective bargaining agreement with the government, after their union was registered last year. Gibore accused the government of using delaying tactics to frustrate negotiations. He said the government negotiations team has often fallen short of quorum, forcing the adjournment of sittings. The secretary general said the union submitted its draft proposal in October last year for negotiation, as agreed, but the ministry and the Council of Governors have never made a counter offer. The formula set February 28 as the deadline for the negotiations. Read:Clinical officers issue 28-day strike notice over pending CBA Click here for the latest political news
