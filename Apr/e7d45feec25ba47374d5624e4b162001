Two Luhya MPs have distanced themselves from the community’s unity being spearheaded by ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula. George Aladwa (Makadara) and Godfrey Osotsi (nominated MP) yesterday said the two leaders are only politicking. They warned Musalia and Wetang’ula against taking the community for a ride in their new quest, which the two say will fail.

Neither Musalia nor Wetang’ula is fit to spearhead it, Osotsi said. He questioned how the two leaders had the combined numerical advantage in the NASA coordinating committee to pick the presidential candidate. They failed to propel a Luhya to become the flag bearer. The 12-member team comprised James Orengo (Siaya Senator, ODM), Johnston Muthama (former Machakos Senator, Wiper), Eseli Simiyu (Tongaren, Ford Kenya) and Sakwa Bunyasi (Nambale, ANC). It had representation from ODM, Wiper, ANC and Ford Kenya. “NASA has four principals, where two are Luhyas. The committtee to select who to be the presidential candidate had 12 members and each principal had three members each. ANC and Ford Kenya had six,” Osotsi said. Aladwa said the two leaders are cowards who were afraid of attending NASA leader Raila Odinga swearing in as the People’s President on January 30. “Some are now saying they want to be President and during the swearing-in they went into hiding,” he said. Last month, Mudavadi and Wetang’ula said they are working on plans to unite the community to field one presidential candidate in 2022. Click here for the latest political news
