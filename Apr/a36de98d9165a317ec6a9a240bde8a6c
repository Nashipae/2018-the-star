Former Lamu Governor Issa Timamy has appealed to the national government to lift the ban on logging because it was killing the county’s economy. Speaking yesterday on Ndau Island, he criticised the state for “targeting sectors that were crucial to Lamu’s economy”. Many residents depend on mangrove business for a living, he said. Timamy said the logging ban was impoverishing people. He said Lamu’s economy was battered because insecurity caused by persistent al Shabaab raids. He said Lamu depended on fishing and tourism, which have slumped owing to insecurity. Dhow makers have been rendered jobless due to logging ban. Traditional dhows are made of mangrove wood.
