Siaya fishermen yesterday accused police of extortion. They said patrol police seek cash on the pretext of using it to maintain security in the lake. Beach management chairman Leonard Okoro said they are forced to pay Sh1,300 daily but still lose their engines to thieves and harassed by Ugandan offi cers. He said the police a do not care about their plight. He said they have more than 100 boats and each boats gives the cash. In a month, the police get almost Sh4 million, Okoro said.
