The national government will meet with governors from the counties affected by the fall armyworm this week, Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri said on Saturday. Kiunjuri and MPs from the National Assembly Committee on Agriculture said they need at least Sh1 billion to control the pest, which is capable of destroying 50 per cent of this year’s crop production. Kenya’s annual crop production stands at six million tonnes of food, 4.2 million tonnes of horticultural crops and 500,000 tonnes of industrial crops, according to Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization . The government said some 10 counties have already been affected by the fall armyworm. Kiunjuri says it is a real threat that must be fought with thoroughness. Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu, Bungoma and Nandi counties are among those affected. Last year, some 40 counties were infested by the pest.
