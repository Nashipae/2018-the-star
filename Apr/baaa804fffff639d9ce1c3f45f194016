Wanuri Kahiu has termed 'unfortunate' the ban of her film Rafiki, which is the first Kenyan film to be screened at Cannes Film Festival. "It was a good thing to have this film because it recognises the long-time handiwork of us Kenyans, but it is unfortunate that it was banned. It is basically from a short story book called Jambula Tree, which in 2007 became a prize winner and it was not banned," Wanuri told Kiss FM breakfast presenter Adelle Onyango in a phone interview. The film director would not appear for the breakfast show physically for fear of getting arrested. During the phone interview, Wanuri added, "What the ban means is that there is no single adult in Kenya who will be able to watch it. What we intended to communicate about is a reflection of society, some of whose lifestyles you may not agree with, some of whose beliefs you may not agree with. However, we have the right of constitution to redefine ourselves we also have the right of constitution to express the freedom of speech. "We feel that the Kenya Film Classification Board violates our right of expression and this means that they will intimidate other filmmakers who might want to talk about different issues from coming up. We submitted our work earlier to them and there was no point where we broke the law. We feel disappointed because by doing this, they are denying the adults the opportunity to decide whether they will or they will not watch it," she said, adding that the film will be shown around the world but not in Kenya. So far, the film has gained a lot of international support, with Grammy winner Janelle Monae throwing her full support behind the movie, saying, "Let's celebrate this film, y'all. Let,s do screenings all over the world #Rafiki."
