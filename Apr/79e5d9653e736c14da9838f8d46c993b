Chinese doctors successfully removed a 3.28ft long phone cable from a pensioner using laser technology in northeast China. The man, said to be in his 60s, thought of inserting a cable to stop itchiness in the urethra that caused by prostatitis, an inflammation of the prostate. However, the cable tied a knot in the bladder and caused bleeding when the man tried to pull it out himself. According to Kankan News, the unnamed pensioner inserted a one-metre-long (3.28ft) phone charging cable into his penis to relieve the itchiness caused by the inflammation. He rushed to Dalian Hospital on March 30 and sought for medical help. Dr Gao Zhanfeng, a urologist at the hospital noticed the cable, measured five millimetres (0.2inches) wide, had tied a knot inside the man's bladder under a scan. 'The knot gets tighter when the patient tried to pull it out. This causes bleeding in the bladder,' said Dr Gao.
