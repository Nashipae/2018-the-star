The Kenya Dairy Board is pushing for new legislation to help control milk hawking. KDB director Margaret Kibogy on Friday said more than 70 per cent of 5.3 billion litres of milk produced in the country annually is hawked without processing. She said hawking risks consumers’ lives and must be stopped. The board is working the government to come up with a proposed law to be tabled in Parliament. “With more than three billion litres hawked, many consumers are exposed to risks. We are working to have laws to help us regulate hawking,” Kibogy said in Soy constituency. She said the government and the counties have made major strides in providing cooling plants and farmers have no reason to hawk their milk. Some farmers have defended hawking as the  only way to get quick cash. “Dairy firms take time to pay us, but through hawking we have money by the end of the day. But it’s fine if there will be laws to regulate the same,” farmer James Bett said. Two years ago, the Uasin Gishu assembly endorsed a motion by Ngenyilel MCA David Sing’oei to legalise milk hawking. Farmers in Nandi and Trans Nzoia have also demanded similar legislation, arguing they are being frustrated by processors. Charles Mose, an official from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, backed the call by the KDB. “The county governments should help farmers put up cooling plants and join cooperatives so they can engage in value addition and earn more,” he said in Eldoret town. Meanwhile, Rift Valley farmers have demanded that they own the New KCC dairy firm. They say this will allow them to fix the problems in the sector. There had been plans to privatise the Sh8 billion company. Farmers want President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto to ensure it is handed back to them. Kenya National Farmers’ Union chairman Musa Barno said they have presented their demands to the Parliamentary Agriculture Committee.
