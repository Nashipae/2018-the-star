The EACC will involve the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions when probing graft to effectively gather evidence that can secure convictions. Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission chairman Eliud Wabukala and DPP Noordin Haji said yesterday detectives will work jointly with prosecutors to gather watertight evidence against corruption suspects. They spoke at EACC offices where they discussed the cooperation.

We have discussed several areas to enhance the fight against the vice, including involvement of the ODPP in investigations,” Haji said. Wabukala said, “We also want to have a seamless process between the two institutions. The fight against corruption is not only a responsibility of EACC or the ODPP, it involves all of us.” He went on, “We shall create mechanisms so at the very early stages of investigations, these two bodies will collaborate and will reduce time and help strengthen evidence for the courts to adjudicate. “It was one of the things we discussed to see how we can reduce [investigations] time and at the same time concretise the evidence.” Wabukala said the commission will focus on graft prevention, as opposed to pursuing perpetrators after a crime has been committed. The EACC and the ODPP have been blamed for rampant corruption with only a few convictions secured against architects of mega corruption deals. Last weekend, Haji met the ODPP advisory board and also convened a meeting with departmental and called for professionalism.
