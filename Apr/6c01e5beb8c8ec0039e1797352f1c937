A woman who couldn’t afford Sh200 to be carried across the flooded Garissa-Bura highway tried to cross by herself. She stumbled and was washed away by the powerful current on Wednesday evening. Others paid sturdy young men Sh200 to carry them safely across. Her identity was not disclosed as her next of kin had not been informed. The body was recovered this morning, raising the death toll to three in the area. Two children died in Bura when they downed as they attempted to cross a flooded area. Addressing the press at Bilbil, assistant chief Abdi Aden said the woman’s personal documents including her ID card were found on the body. “We suspect the woman was traveling from Garissa to either Bura or Hola for business,” he said. Aden said business in the area had hurt as no vehicle could cross the badly damaged road that serves towns between Mombasa, Garissa, Wajir and Mandera. “Traders are counting loses running into millions of shillings. All goods and services along the major highway remain suspended,” he said. Resident Abdi Madhobi urged the national government to get qualified road contractors to fix the road once and for all. “This is not the first time this section of the road has been swept away. This is because cowboy contractors are out to rip huge profits” he said. Tana River county roads CEC Eng. Stephen Wachira urged travelers and other users not to cross the damaged section of the road. He said the county administration is working closely with KEnHA to make sure the road is opened as soon as possible.
