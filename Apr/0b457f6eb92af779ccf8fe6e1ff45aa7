City Hall is yet to restock its hospitals with medicine and other supplies, more than a month after it said it would buy the commodities from private distributors. This followed a decision by the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority – the main supplier for public facilities – to stop the supply over a Sh285 million debt. The 78 county-owned health facilities ran out of medicine and other essential medical supplies more than a year ago and patients, mostly slum dwellers, have continued to suffer. Last month, Health executive Hitan Majevda said the county had opted to buy the medicine from vendors after Governor Mike Sonko ordered the county Treasury to halt payments to Kemsa until the ongoing audit of all the county government’s pending bills is concluded. But yesterday, Majevda said they are yet to restock the facilities. “No other procurement has been made, save for emergency medicine purchased directly by the facilities,” he said.  APPROVAL “The procurement process is ongoing [but] it was disrupted by the changes in the procurement department.” On April 19, at least 30 officers in the procurement department were sent on compulsory leave for inflating and issuing local purchase and service orders without the governor’s approval.  EXPENSIVE Majevda said about three million people, mostly slum dwellers, seek medical attention in public health facilities in the city. But the county-owned facilities have been grappling with poor management, shortage of staff and dilapidated structures. The hospitals often transfer patients to private clinics and chemists, but many residents complain services are expensive. Majevda sought to downplay the gravity of the problem, saying the hospitals have been buying emergency drugs from vendors using money generated locally.
