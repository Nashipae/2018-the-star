Police in Awendo subcounty are investigating a girl’s killing by her brother during a quarrel over a disco dance. Kombo South chief Beatrice Auma said the two quarrelled on Saturday at 9pm when the girl, 15, and a standard eight pupil wanted to sneak out for an Easter disco dance. “Her brother, who is in class five, tried to prevent her from going and during the quarrel, he picked a blunt object and hit his sister,” Auma said. The girl was taken to Rapcom Hospital in Migori town but was pronounced dead on arrival. Police have launched investigations. The children’s mother countered the quarrel story and said her daughter died during an epilepsy attack. “She said her daughter died from an epileptic seizure probably to help her son, but the school’s head teacher refuted the claims,” Auma said. She said prior investigations showed the girl died after being attacked using the blunt object. No arrests have been made as police wait for statements from family members and do an autopsy.
