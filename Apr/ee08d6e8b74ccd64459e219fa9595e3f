Residents of Suna Road estate on Ngong Road have urged the county government to intervene after floodwaters and sewage flowed into their homes. The homes have been flooded since last Thursday and the residents’ attempts to seek help from Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company have been futile. “NCWSC was unable to unblock the drainage line yesterday and disappeared without offering a solution,” resident Moses Khaemba said yesterday. The area was flooded following a heavy downpour in the capital. The situation has been aggravated by the burst sewer lines. “Area MCA and MP have not been responding to our pleas ,” Khaemba said. The residents now fear an outbreak of diseases. NCWSC acting managing director Nahashon Muguna did not respond to the Star’s phone calls. Last week, Kariobangi South and Pioneer estates were submerged following heavy rains. Roads were cut off. The county government has been on the receiving end of complaints for its failure to clear blocked drainages despite early warnings by the weatherman.
