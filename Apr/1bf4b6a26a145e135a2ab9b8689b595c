The Nandi government has declared four wards disaster zones after at least 2,000 residents were displaced by landslides caused by heavy downpours. The wards are Kapchorua, Koyo-Ndurio, Songhor and Soba. Governor Stephen Sang said on Saturday the declaration would enable his administration to set aside more resources to support the victims. There has been extensive damage to public and private property. Services have been disrupted. Many residents were injured by rocks that fell on their homes. Data collected by the county and Kenya Red CrossSociety shows 112 households in Uson, Uswet, Kolongei and Kapkanin villages were worst-hit. Others were Sirwa and Tereno Sile. In Kapchanga, 130 homes were swept away.
