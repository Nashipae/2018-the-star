Kenya’s medal prospect Winnie Chebet fell by the wayside as Beatrice Chepkoech and Mary Wangari sailed to the women’s 1,500m final. Beatrice Chepkoech won her heat in 4:08.29 ahead of Winnie Nanyondo who placed second in 4:08.49. Chebet fell down before struggling back to her feet but it was too little, too late as she placed ninth in the heat. Efforts by the Team Kenya Chef De Mission Barnaba Korir to appeal flopped as the cameras portrayed her to be on the wrong after stepping on Australian runner, Linden Hall, before spilling to the ground. Hall ended up third in 4:08.64 “I have checked the replays and actually it was just a normal accident. I feel sorry for her,” said Korir. The other heart saw Mary Wangari (4:06.58) sail through alongside winner Caster Semenya (4:05.86) and Georgia Griffith (4:06.41). Elsewhere, all the three Kenyans sailed to the second round of the 400m race after impressive show in the preliminary round. Maximila Imali won Round 1 Heat 3 in 51.74 seconds ahead of Jamaican Tovea Jenkins, who timed at 52.58. Gladys Musyoki qualified in Heat 2 as the fastest loser after placing sixth in 53.41. Jamaica’s Stephanie McPherson won the heat in 50.80 with Scottish Zoey Clark second in 52.07. Veronica mutua also sailed through with a time of 52.70 in Heat 3 won by Nigeria’s Yinka Ajayi, who timed at 51.71seconds. In the field events, Africa champion Mathew Sawe faded to seventh place to bow out of the high jump competition after posting 2.15m. England’s Chris Baker (2.21m), Canada’s Django Lovett (2.21) and Allan Smith of England sealed top-three spots. After four events (100m, long jump, shot put and 400m) in the men’s decathlon, Gilbert Koech was position 10 with 3677 points.
