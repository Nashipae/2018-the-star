Limuru police on Tuesday repulsed youths from looting Sh1 million milk from a truck involved in an accident on the Nairobi-Naivasha highway. A lorry carrying milk overturned and landed into a ditch in Manguo area. Police faced resistance from youths who surrounded the lorry and tried to loot the Kinangop Life dairy product. They had been encouraged to loot by those first on the scene. Twenty cartons were stolen before police arrived. “Were it not for the police, all the milk would have been looted. The manner in which the youths surrounded the lorry told it all,” witness Samuel Njore said. The accident happened as the driver of the lorry swerved to avoid a head-on collision with an overlapping tanker. The lorry was transporting the milk from Naivasha to Nairobi. “The lorry hooted for a long time before landing in the ditch,” Njore said. Tigoni police boss Ronald Asava swiftly arrived. He ordered the youths to stop looting the cargo. Limuru OCPD Eunice Githure congratulated police for their “super response”. “We protect people and their property. We’re happy to have saved the dairy from losses,” she said. The milk was later removed from the lorry and loaded onto another for transportation to Nairobi. The wreckage was towed to Tigoni police station.
