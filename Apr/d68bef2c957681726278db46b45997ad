Kenyans living below international poverty line dropped by eight per cent in past decade to 2015/16 but the country may not realize its 2030 goals on poverty eradication. According to the latest edition of the Kenya Economic Update by World Bank released yesterday, the proportion of Kenyans living on less than the international poverty line of $1.90 (Sh190 ) declined from 43.6 per cent in 2005 to 35.6 per cent in 2015. The report shows that agricultural sector was a key driver of poverty reduction in the past decade. However, this also implies progress in poverty reduction remains vulnerable to agro-climatic shocks such as droughts that can force households back into poverty. Increased consumption among the poorest of the poor reduced during the period under review, but progress among the population living between the US$ 1.90 and US$ 3.20 (Sh320 ) poverty lines was considerably low. Although poverty incidence in Kenya is below Sub Saharan average of 45 per cent and among the lowest in East Africa, it is trailing Uganda which is at 34.6 per cent and three times below that of Ghana at 13.6 per cent. FAR FETCHED GOALS Even so, Kenya is not likely to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal on poverty eradication initiative by 2030 if the current trend is anything to go by. In order to achieve a poverty rate below three per cent by 2030, the poverty rate must decrease by 32.6 per cent. However, Kenya’s annualized poverty reduction rate was 1.8 per cent between 2005 and 2015. According to World Bank, Kenya’s annualized poverty reduction rate was 1.8 per cent between 2005 and 2015. Assuming this rate is maintained for the next 15 years, the poverty rate will remain above 25 per cent in 2030 “At the current pace of poverty reduction, about one percentage point per year, Kenya cannot eradicate poverty by 2030,” says Utz Pape, World Bank poverty economist and lead author of the update’s special section on poverty. To realize this dream without any redistribution, real household consumption would need to increase on average by 11.4 per cent per year from 2015 to 2030 and inequality would need to be reduced by 2.9 per cent annually if poverty eradication is to be achieved without growth in household consumption. The report found that although Kenya has had stable GDP for the past decade, it does not reflect in poverty reduction. Despite recording growth domestic product (GDP) growth rates above 5 per cent for most of the past decade, the transmission of that growth into increased consumption at household level remains low, or GDP growth would have translated into even higher poverty reduction. The study marries another one dubbed ‘Reasonable Goals for Reducing Poverty in Africa - Targets For Post 2015 MDGs And Agenda 2063’ which revealed that although Kenya and other Sub-Saharan countries like Cameroon, Egypt, Ghana, Mali, Mauritania and Senegal have experienced exponential economic growth, they have failed to translate this growth into poverty reduction. The country however has recorded an overall improvement in provision of basic social amenities like education and health. Kenya’s literacy rate is amongst the highest in SSA, and it has increased further by 11 per cent since 2005. At least 84 per cent of Kenyans aged above 14 years can read and write compared to 73 per cent a decade ago. Around 72 per cent of Kenyan households have access to improved water sources—above the 68 per cent average in the SSA.
