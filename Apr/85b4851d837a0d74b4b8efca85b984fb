The court yesterday dismissed an appeal challenging the decision by the High Court that struck out an election petition against Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko.Justices Roselyn Nambuye, Gatembu Kairu and Kathurima M’Inoti ruled that High Court judge Msagha Mbogholi was right to strike out the election petition. The appeal filed by Japheth Muroko and Zachaeus Okoth argued that the decision to strike out their petition challenging Sonko’s victory was made in violation of the law. They said the judge should have allowed them to withdraw to give room for another person to take up the matter.

But in the ruling, the appellate judges said Mbogholi acted within his discretion by striking out the petition. The court also noted the two petitioners acted in bad faith by adjourning the matter several times when the judge had stated he would not entertain any adjournments. The petition at the High Court had 47 witnesses and when the petition was struck out in January, none of the witnesses had testified.  Click here for the latest political news
