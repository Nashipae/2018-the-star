Encroachment on wetlands returned to haunt residents of Westlands after floods cut off roads and disrupted movement. A spot check by the Star on Friday showed people constructed houses too close to the waterways, while some buildings literally stand on top of the streams. Mwanzi, Lower Kabete, Peponi Roads and Brooskside Drive were completely cut off by the raging waters caused by the heavy downpour in the capital. The area near Westgate Mall looked like a small lake. Commuters, who had woken up early to go to work were stranded. Some sought the services of a handcart to cross over. “Something needs to be done, because every time it rains this place floods,” stranded commuter Jane Wangari said. But this was not the first the place was flooded. Last month, the situation was the same, if not worse. Residents say the areas is prone to flooding whenever it rains and blamed private developers for constructing houses on riparian reserves.
