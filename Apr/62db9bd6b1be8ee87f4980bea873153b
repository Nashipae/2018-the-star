The appeal filed by Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter against the High Court’s decision to nullify his election will be heard in Eldoret on May 18. Keter filed the appeal in Kisumu but Justice Erastus Githinji directed that the matter will be heard in Eldoret. The Jubilee MP is challenging the March 1 decision by Justice Kanyi Kimondo to nullify his win. Bernard Kibor vied for the seat against Keter and lost. He filed the successful petition at the High Court. But Kibor has filed papers urging the Court of Appeal to dismiss the case. “There are issues we feel the High Court did not tackle, yet they would have to strengthen our case. That is why we have filed the cross appeal,” he said. At the High Court, Kibor accused the IEBC of colluding with Keter to rig him out.
