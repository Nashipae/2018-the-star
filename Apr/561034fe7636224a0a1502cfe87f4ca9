Meru county’s poor performance in last year’s KCSE exam is embarrassing and unforgivable, Governor Kiraitu Murungi has said. Murungi wants legislators to help transform secondary schools into centres of excellence to ensure stellar performance. He said on Friday a report by the Teachers’ Service Commission on the rating of the KCSE exam was “shocking and alarming”. A giant county like Meru, which has celebrated national schools, should not be defeated by other Eastern counties — that must stop, Murungi said. “I feel so embarrassed leading a county which is backward in education,” he said at Njogune Primary School during a prize-giving ceremony. “When I went through the 2017 performance report, I realised we were defeated by Tharaka Nithi, Isiolo, Kitui, Embu and Garissa counties, among others.” Meru county was “number two from behind”, Murungi said. The county chief said he will uplift education standards so the county can rank high in future examinations. He will involve MPs, religious leaders, parents and education officers to ensure a turnaround “even though the sector is not fully devolved”. Meru should be in the top position, Murungi said, adding that the county has done well in the KCPE exam because there are well-established centres of excellence. “I urge every MP to make one secondary school in his or her constituency a centre of excellence. Pamper it with infrastructure and the required items and you will see change.” Murungi said the good work in primary schools must be replicated at the secondary level. He urged alumni to help build their old schools to improve education. “Meru will be number one. The fruits, impact and products will be realised and felt,” he said.
