Kenya Medical Training College has defended the transfer of Nyeri principal Zipporah Njeru to Kuria saying it was based on her star performance. Njeru has been moved to Kuria, a decision that sparked protests among students on Tuesday. The students said they suspect malice in the changes which came barely a year after the principal's appointment. KMTC CEO Michael Kiptoo said the transfer was "executed under normal circumstances", and does not just affect the Nyeri campus.

"We want her to do better elsewhere...she has no issues with the transfer," he said. Prof Kiptoo said no student will be victimised for opposing the changes. The Nyeri KMTC students held demonstrations on Wednesday to protest Njeru's transfer. The learners blamed the immediate former principal for instigating the changes, claims that the CEO denied. The former principal was demoted and replaced with Njeru after nine years at the helm. Student leaders at the college said the principal has been good to the learners and is development-oriented, unlike her predecessor.  Click here for the latest political news
