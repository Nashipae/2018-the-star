Families of four people believed to have drowned while crossing River Enziu in Nuu, Mwingi East subcounty have pleaded for help to trace the bodies. The four - a driver and three commuters - were travelling overnight from Nairobi to attend a burial in Nuu the following day, but they went missing. When they reached River Enziu, the driver sent a text message to his family members saying their Probox got stuck in flooding River Enziu and he was in danger. The four have not been seen for two weeks. The driver’s father - David Matambo - said he believes the bodies are in the river. “The divers who have been rescuing people in this river told us they have identified something they believe to be a vehicle inside this river,” he said.
