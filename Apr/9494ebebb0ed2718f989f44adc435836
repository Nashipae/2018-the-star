Six former National Bank of Kenya managers have been fined millions of shillings by the Capital Markets Authority for abetting fraud. Led by then managing director Munir Sheikh, the chiefs are accused of cooking the bankâ€™s books in 2015 to indicate profits when at least Sh1 billion had been siphoned. The misrepresentation of financial statements was occasioned by premature recognition of sale of assets amounting to Sh800 million and underprovisioning of a loan amount. It also involved the wrongful recognition of interest income leading to the overstatement of profit. Based on whistle-blower information, the CMA conducted an inquiry into the affairs of the bank leading to enforcement proceedings against the then NBK board members and its senior managers. The six include Sheikh, who has been disqualified from holding a board position in a public issuer of securities or working for a licensed person for three years. He was also fined Sh5 million for his role in the ineffective management of the bank. Chief credit officer George Jaba, chief finance officer Chris Kisire, acting finance officer Wycliffe Kivunira have also been penalised. Former finance officers Solomon Alubala and Chris Kisire have been suspended for 10 years and three years, respectively, in line with evidence of their active involvement in the embezzlement scheme. Prosecution has been recommended. Alubala has been fined Sh104.8 million, being two times the amounts so far traced to him from the embezzled funds. Kisire was handed a Sh1 million fine.
