Flood waters wreaked havoc in Suswa area, Narok county, with the busy Narok-Mai Mahiu highway being blocked for the better part of Saturday evening. The deluge blocked the road near the standard gauge railway construction site for hours as the rains continued to pound the area. The floods also swept away six vehicles from the road to the culvert. Six people who were in the cars were rescued by the public. Passengers travelling between Western Kenya and Nairobi and plying the busy roads were stranded near Suswa trading centre about 50km from Narok town. Tourists visiting the world-famous Maasai Mara Game Reserve were also stranded as the region was a no-go zone. There was a traffic snarl up as vehicles from Nairobi stretched as far as Satellite area, while those from Western Kenya reached as far as Suswa trading centre. Following the incident, motorists were forced to use the Nakuruâ€“Kericho route instead of Narok-Mai Mahiu road which is shorter. "We feared that we might be swept away and we had to move to safe ground until the waters subside. The rains made a mess," motorist Wesley Koech said. Koech said he and others rescued victims. Alfred Oduor, who was stranded, said the heavy rains caused floods started at 2pm and made the road impassable. "I think these are the worst rains I have experienced in my life. The flood waters swept away boulders and sand deposits were washed in the middle of the road," he said. Oduor urged road users to be careful while using the area which is prone to flooding.
