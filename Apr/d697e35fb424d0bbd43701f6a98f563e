Two bodies were yesterday morning found dumped in a thicket at Chepsangor in Nandi Hills. Police chief Patrick Macharia said his officers are investigating. The bodies were of men aged 20 and 25. They were dumped in separate areas; a thicket and in a cane farm on the Nandi Hills-Kisumu Road. “They might have been strangled using most likely a wire or a sisal twine,” Macharia said. Residents of Chepsangor barricaded the Eldoret-Chemelil Road, demanding action from the police. A week ago, another body was found in a thicket.
