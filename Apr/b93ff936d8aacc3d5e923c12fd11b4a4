Traders in two markets in Migori county have refused to pay taxes to the county government over poor service delivery. On Tuesday traders at the Wath Ong’er market in Nyatike sub-county, the main livestock market came to a standstill as tax collectors were chased away. Traders said they would not pay any amount to the county government until a modern toilet is built, a devolution campaign pledge by Governor Okoth Obado in 2013. Angry traders turned away county officials on Tuesday, a market day, lamenting that nothing had been done at the market except the erection of a barbed wire fence. “We are tired after several meetings from start of devolution. We were promised a modern market, which we have never seen. We settled on a toilet, which is also just a promise,” a trader identified as Min Anyango said. Traders said they are forced to use bushes and the nearby River Kuja together with their customers to relief themselves. “We are done with pledges and several meetings," Peter Kainda, chairman of traders’ association, said. "As long as Wath Ong’er doesn’t have a toilet the county will never receive any taxes from us.” Macalder-Kanyarwanda ward administrator Simon Obondo said the county had plans to upgrade the market and build a toilet “but we don’t have funds and traders need to be patient.” At Rongo Bus Park, the county government through Central Kamagambo ward administrator Seth Odoyo was forced to move with speed to clean up the area after similar threats. On April 19, operations at Migori county offices came to a standstill as a contractor who has been building toilets started a one-man protest demanding his dues. Armed with twigs and his tender documents, Maricus Okinyi Okech of Dida Construction invaded the offices in Migori town shouting that he should be paid his dues which have been delayed for over two years. He is demanding Sh8 million after building ten toilets in several markets.
