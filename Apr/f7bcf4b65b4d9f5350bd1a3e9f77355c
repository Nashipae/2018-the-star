Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa has backed the decision to slash counties cash by Sh18 billion, saying the government is in a financial fix. Treasury CS Henry Rotich petitioned MPs to cut county allocations in the next financial year, adding that the government cannot raise enough revenue. The government proposed an amendment to the Division of Revenue Act to reduce money meant for the counties. Rotich said the decision was informed by the protracted general election, which slowed down economic activities. The move has elicited a tag of war between the Treasury and governors, who accuse the government of planning to stiffle counties operations and activities. But Eugene yesterday defended the cut, saying the government is broke and governors should understand the situation. “Kenya is in a tight place financially,” the CS said. The devolved units were allocated Sh302 billion in 2017-18. In the next financial year, the amount will be slashed to between Sh287 billion and Sh284 billion. Eugene said the government is committed to devolution.
