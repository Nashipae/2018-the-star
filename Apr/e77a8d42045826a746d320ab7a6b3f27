The Ministry of Lands on Wednesday suffered a major blow after the high court barred them from digitizing title deeds and other documents at their registry. Justice Winfrida Okwany temporarily restrained the Ministry from implementing or mandating the electronic filing of conveyancing documents as per their notice dated April 4 published in the Sunday Newspapers on April 8 pending the hearing and determination of a case filed by LSK challenging the decision. In her ruling, Okwany certified the matter as urgent and further ordered that pending the hearing of the case, status quo in respect of manual conveyancing system should remain.

In the case, the legal body has challenged the decision by the Ministry to digitize their records arguing that the move was made without consultation with all the stakeholders. They wanted the court to order CS Farida Karoney to establish a task force comprising of all stakeholders affected by the electronic registration and conveyancing system, who shall be mandated to come up with the guidelines for the implementation of the electronic registration within two months. LSK says it is concerned the digitisation notice issued by the ministry has discontinued manual transactions at both the Nairobi and Central registries. The legal body further says there are pending cases before the courts touching on the validity of leases, titles and consents and it is unjust to have these documents validated through online processing without regard to the affected persons or the outcomes of the cases pending. It further says the process was carried out without being subjected to public participation as required by law and without the benefit of the input of Parliament.
