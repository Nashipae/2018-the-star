An inter-agency team carrying out the crackdown on illicit brew and unlicensed alcohol sellers are accusing some senior police officers of interfering with their work. On Saturday, a team composed of officials from National Authority for the Campaign Against Drug Abuse, Kenya Revenue Authority, Kenya Bureau of Standards, Nairobi County government, Public health and National Police service were ambushed by officers from Hardy Police Station. The officers claimed that they were not informed of the crackdown in a move that amounted to "invasion of their territory." "We are not aware of the crackdown and if anything, this is our territory,"Chelagat, an officer from Hardy Police station said at Beacons Inn. Efforts by the inter-agency team to convince them fell on deaf ears. "We ought to have known in advance that you are coming here,"Chelagat who was accompanied by Hardy OCS said.
