Fourteen landlords of Nakumatt Holdings limited are no longer interested in working with the retailer as a tenant. They are from Galleria, Nyali, Likoni, Karen Crossroads, Nakuru, Eldoret Household, Cinemax, Nanyuki, Highridge, City Hall, Diani, Malindi, Meru and Highport (Warehouses). In a press statement , the landlords stated that they do not do not support the proposals for recovery advanced by Nakumatt administrator Peter Kahi. Early this year, the High court allowed Nakumatt to appoint Kahi in a bid to strategise the way forward on coming out of debt owed to the landlords and suppliers. The administrator was expected to meet all Nakumatt creditors in 60 days of his appointment, and address all their concerns. The meeting held last month by the creditors flopped following questions over validity of the retailer’s Sh35.8 billion debt. While at that, Tuskys supermarket, which had proposed a deal to help Nakumatt back on its feet, backed out on Thursday last week. Tuskys grew cold feet because of some aspects of the revival proposal presented by Kahi. "As a result, we are instructed to advise you that Tusker Mattresses Limited is re-considering its proposed investment in Nakumatt Holdings Limited," a letter by Tuskys to the Competition Authority said. The 14 landlords also attributed their decision to the decision of Tuskys pulling out of the proposed deal saying there is no viable alternative offered. "We note that the Nakumatt/Tusky’s deal has fallen through with no viable alternative offered, leaving us with no other conclusion than that Nakumatt has no hope for recovery."
