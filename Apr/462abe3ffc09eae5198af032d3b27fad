For the second day running, Conseslus Kipruto put a smile once again on the faces of Kenyans as he masterminded a rare 1-2-3 sweep in the 3,000m steeplechase at Carrara Stadium yesterday. Kipruto, the world and Olympic 3,000m steeplechase champion, led training-mate Abraham Kibiwott and Amos Kirui to the tape as Kenyans ran away with all the medals in the presence Sports Cabinet Secretary, Rashid Echesa, here in Gold Coast. Conseslus won the race in a games’ record of 8:10.08 despite running a more relaxed race. Compatriot and neighbour Kibiwott posted a season’s best of 8:10.62 while Amos Kirui closed the podium in 8:12.24. The three had little competition apart from Canadian Mathew Hughes who was beaten to fourth place at the line in 8:12.33 and Uganda’s Albert Chemutai, who finished fifth in 8:19.89 after dropping off the pace with two laps to go. The Kenyans ran a tactical race with Kipruto taking the lead barely two laps into the race and led for three laps. He then commanded his troops to step forward as he controlled the pace. “My interest was not just to win gold but to ensure a Kenyan sweep. I would have taken off and won my race with a faster time but I chose to take care of my boys,” he noted. Kipruto — who now hold all the important titles including world, Olympic and Commonwealth Games — said it was in his interest that the country sweeps the board. “For me it was all about my country and I wanted us to win in style. Of course I knew I would win the gold medal but this was not just about me but the team,” he said. He explained that he opted to run with the boys because he knew he could handle the pressure plus the boys would lose if he left them on their own. “I am the senior most here and I wanted to guide them to the end. However, one thing I was sure of is that we were not going to lose gold,” he added. Kipruto said he will be attempting the 3,000m steeplechase record but he is yet to decide the date and venue. A jovial Kipruto revealed that said the Kenyan camp at the Athletes’ Village was in panic until Thursday when Wycliffe Kinyamal won a surprise first gold in the men’s 800m. “I told them not to panic about steeplechase because I knew I would take care of that. I am happy everything went as per the plan,” he said. Kirui was full of praise for Kipruto, saying that the Olympic champion had not only hatched the plan but also executed it. He said the Commonwealth medal means a lot for him and he is inspired to go even bigger things. Kibiwott was equally excited. “I train with Conseslus and I must say he made this happen.” Meanwhile, Margaret Nyairera settled for silver in the women’s 800m, behind Caster Semenya of South Africa, who ran a games record of 1:56.68. Nyairera timed 1:58.07 as Jamaican Natoya Goule took bronze in 1:58.82. The 10,00m race saw Kenya’s Rodger Kwemoi settle for bronze in 27:28.66, behind winner Uganda’s Joshua Cheptigei (27:19.62) and Canadian Mohammed Ahmed (27:20.56). This was the second gold for Cheptegei, having won the 5,000m title while Mohammed took his second silver to add to the 5,000m honours. Kenya’s Jonathan Ndiku faded to eighth in 27:56.24 while Josphat Bett was a poor 11th in 28:56.94.Ndiku was until yesterday the 3,000m steeplechase champion.
