A Sh250 million irrigation project in Murang’a will harvest rain and flood water from rivers. It will be set up by American NGO Kids Can Do and is expected to benefit 100,000 farmers. “Despite having fertile soils for agriculture, Murang’a continues to suffer from food insecurity due to lack of irrigation water. This project has the potential to turn the county into a food basket,” the firm’s coordinator Karanja Mburu said. He said talks are being held with the national and county governments to set up the project in the areas that suffer most flooding. The project will be done in phases and is expected to solve the flooding problem during long rains. Mburu said the project would use gravity to harvest flood water, channel it into a dam and distribute it to farms. Providing irrigation water will reduce unemployment as many youths will venture in small scale commercial farming, he added. Mburu a commissioned a 300,000-litre water tank at Gaitheri Primary School on Monday. It was built by the NGO. He said Kenyans should find ways of harvesting rain water for use during droughts. The organisation has already constructed 20 tanks in primary schools to harvest rain. It plans to build 100 tanks. Most areas that suffer mosrt from drought are also those that suffer from flooding, Mburu said, yet nothing is done to collect runoff water.
