Nasa leader Raila Odinga intervened on Monday to solve wrangles within the Luo Council of Elders. The council has been facing leadership disputes on who should be at the helm. Mzee Willis Otondi was named Chairman after a six-hour closed-door meeting chaired by Raila at his Opoda home in Bondo, Siaya county. Adera Osawa, who was the Secretary General of a parallel council headed by Nyandiko Og’adi, took the same position.

Addressing the press after the meeting, Raila said the meeting was called to end constant wranglingamong the elders. The Nasa leader, who is also the council's patron, said the elders will also embark on a peace tour, during which they will meet elders from other communities, to promote national unity. “I cannot allow any form of wrangling at my doorstep yet I have resolved to unite the county from the bondage of political and ethnic division,” Raila said. He embarked on a mission to unite the country on March 9, when he agreed to work with President Uhuru Kenyatta after the fierce political battle between the two in the 2017 presidential elections.
