There was drama at Bukhungu Stadium on Sunday after Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala showed up with a rope and presented it as a gift to retiring Maseno North ACK Diocese Bishop Simon Oketch. The event was a thanksgiving ceremony for Oketch. He will retire on June 30 after a 25-year service as the Maseno North Diocese head. Malala arrived at the function late after introduction and speeches and took a seat at the VIP tent. After the service, leaders were allowed to present their gifts to the bishop. Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya was the first and he presented a fridge. Vihiga Governor Wilbur Otichilo presented an envelope. The contents were never made public. Busia Senator Amos Wako had left earlier and it was Malala’s turn to present his gift. He emerged from the crowd holding a sisal rope and walked to the dais to hand it over to the Oketch. “And where is the cow?” asked the bishop, causing a prolonged laughter. Malala said he would deliver the animal later. Lugari MP Ayub Savula followed and handed over a dairy cow. Yesterday Malala told the Star the rope indicates he will give the cleric a cow. “I was not aware it would be a gift session and when I arrived and learnt of it, I consulted with the family and they said they preferred a dairy cow,”  he said. The event was graced by ACK Archbishop Jackson Sapit. Three Canons – Charles Asilutwa, Jacob Mbunjiro and Peter Adolwa – have been shortlisted for interviews as Oketch’s successor.
