More than 2,500 families displaced by floods in Tana River yesterday received food from the Garissa county and Bura CDF kitty. The donations valued at more than Sh15 million were given to families from Bakuyu, Ziwani, Madogo, Malkamanza and Mororo. Tana North subcounty administrator Mohamed Gure said the county has also acquired portable toilets for the temporary makeshift camps. Gure was speaking when he launched the food distribution at Bakuyu and Ziwani. He also said more mosquito nets for expectant mothers, children and the elderly will be part of the relief aid in temporary camps across the sub-county “We have acquired portable toilets and assorted drugs to prevent possible outbreaks of malaria, cholera and other waterborne diseases. The toilets, mosquito nets and assorted drugs will arrive in three days,” Gure said. Victim Kolombo Tutata urged other donors to extend their donations to flood victims in other camps adding that their biggest challenge was accessing safe and clean drinking water. The food donations to the more than 1,100 victims in Bakuyu, Ziwani and Malkamansa included 650 bags ( 50kg) of rice, 190 jerycans ( 10L)  of cooking oil and 150 bags ( 90kg) of beans. Bura CDF donated 100 bags ( 50kg) of rice, 10 bags ( 90kg) of beans and 20 cartons of cooking oil to more than 800 displaced families in Mororo. The Kenya Red Cross estimates more than  15,000 families could be affected if the current rains, which have claimed four lives, continue into early May.
