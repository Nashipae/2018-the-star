Kenyans have until Friday to give their views on the introduction of genetically modified cotton. This is after Nema issued a gazette notice to the public last month to submit comments on an environmental impact assessment for the proposed national performance field trials on Bt cotton at nine sites in eight counties. The fields trials will be carried out in Mwea, Katumani, Kampi ya mawe, Bura, Perkerra, Kibos, Alupe, Barwessa and Matuga in Kirinyaga, Machakos, Makueini, Tana River, Kisumu, Busia, Baringo and Kwale counties. Margaret Njuki, the chief compliance officer at Nema said genetically modified food is a sensitive subject and there is need to carry out an EIA before introducing the crop to the environment, which has been done and the applicants have now applied for a go-ahead. She spoke during a youth biotechnology sensitisation working in Thika by the Open Forum for Agricultural Biotechnology. “I urge young people to give their comments on the issue as they are important decision makers in the country and should take part in public participation to help influence the right decision,” Njuki said. She assured Kenyans every comment will be considered.
