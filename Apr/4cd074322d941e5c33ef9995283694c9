Three people were stranded for several hours in a truck cabin at Kainuk bridge in Turkana after their vehicle was swept away by floodwaters. The lorry driver had attempted to cross the swollen River Turkwel which burst its banks after heavy rains on Saturday night. The occupants were rescued after they managed to get out of the vehicle and sounded an alarm. Luckily for them, the vehicle was held by a concrete beam which prevented it from being washed downstream. Transport through the bridge, which links Kenya to South Sudan, has been paralysed owing to the installation's structural weakness. Following the 4am accident, Patrick Lokaapa, a resident of Kainuk, said: "Drivers are not following the advisory issued by KeNHA." "They cant cross the flooded river but they ignore warnings over the same. Action should be taken to teach them a lesson." Lokaapa said drivers of most of the affected vehicles went against a directive by the roads authority which banned the bridge's use at night. It is not the first time motorists are facing trouble crossing the bridge, the most recent one being last year when it had to be repaired.

He spoke at the Turkana tourism and cultural festival held at Lodwar last week. "The Kainuk bridge that links Kenya to South Sudan, Ethiopia and Uganda will be fixed soon. We already have a contractor." The heavy downpour in Turkana and its environs has displaced over 10,000 people and destroyed properties worth millions. Click here for the latest politicla news
