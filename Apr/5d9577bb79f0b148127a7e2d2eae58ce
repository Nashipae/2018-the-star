Kenya Red Cross Society officials in Tana River have intensified the search for two children, who went missing after their boat capsized in the crocodile infested River Tana on Friday. The two girls, aged one and 10, were with five other passengers when their boat capsized as they were being rescued at Idsowe village three days ago. Two people were rescued immediately, while the third was found stuck in reeds along the flooded river late at night on the same day. Tana River County Red Cross coordinator Gerald Bombe said the missing girls are yet to be rescued. Both had spent a night on roof tops after floods buffeted their home in Galili.
