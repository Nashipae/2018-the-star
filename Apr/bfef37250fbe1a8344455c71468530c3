Tigania residents on Saturday held protests over delays in works on a road launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto last year. The lot blocked the Meru-Mikinduri road until 3pm saying the delayed works have rendered the St Ann-Kagaene-Kibuline-Kaboto road impassable. This is among the hundreds of kilometres of roads commissioned by the President and the DP ahead of the general election. Nkomo, Kagaene and Mbeu residents want the contractor to hand over the project "to a more competent one". They argued that not a single kilometre of the route has been tarmacked adding that the ongoing heavy rains have worsened the situation. Kiriinya Mwenda further said the contract be cancelled as the current contractor has denied youths from the area employment as demanded by the law. "We want the incompetent contractor to hand over the tender project to a more serious bidder. Whoever wins, must consider employing area youths and not foreigners." "We have those who can operate excavators, Caterpillars, compactors among other construction machines," Mwenda said. He added: "We were not late during the voting day and so, developments delayed is development denied." Lydia Muriuki said the roads' condition has hampered medical emergencies. "We request the President to follow up to ensure the work is done. We want a tarmac road, nothing less. Let the contract go." Earlier this month, Tigania West MP John Mutunga put the contractor on notice saying the project cannot wait any longer. "When residents are about to demonstrate, the contractor is seen on the road with his machines after which he immediately leaves," Mutunga said. "Let him take his belongings and go to perform his magic somewhere else, not in Tigania. We donâ€™t want him at that site." Click here for the latest political news
