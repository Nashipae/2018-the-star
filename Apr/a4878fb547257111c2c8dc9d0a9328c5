Where does the line cross between psychosis and being a run-of-the-mill staunch fan? Well, meet Naphas Masia. He is a diehard Betty Kyallo fan, but the KTN News anchor has blocked him on her social media platforms for expressing waaaay too much love. Defending himself, Naphas said, "She blocked me on social media because of some issues. You do know that Betty is no longer pals with Susan Kaittany? Well, I was pals with both of them, and when she found out that I had gone to meet Susan, she got angry and blocked me." Is he a stalker? "Apana, mimi si stalker," Naphas said. "Betty and I talk. I meet her at various events. We do know each other. We talk all the time. I even have her number. We chat all the time on WhatsApp. I just want you to tell her I love her." The Kenyatta University law student claims he has a special message for Betty, which he sent to the office WhatsApp phone and insisted that we forward to Betty. It reads: "Dear Betty Kyallo, I will always be there for you, fight for you and try to make sure you smile. You know that I love you with all my heart, I want to keep you and never let you go. My love for you is like corruption in Kenya, it will never end." At the time of going to press, Betty Kyallo could not comprehensively respond but promised to comment at a later time. So keep it here for her response.
