Kiambu residents will access water under one centralised water and sewarage company. This is meant to provide clean and affordable water and end exploitation by cartels. Governor Ferdinand Waititu yesterday said unscrupulous individuals had invaded the water sector and controlled it for their selfish gain. Only a small fraction of residents got water and many could not afford exorbitant charges. The county boss spoke during the launch of the Kiambu Water and Sewarage Company. The county seeks to streamline the sector to ensure order for the benefit of all residents. “There was no political goodwill in the water and sewarage companies. The new firm will go a long way in making sure residents get services from one central point,” Waititu said. He said his administration will not sit back and watch residents suffer as a few people exploit county resources. “Some people have started politicking that the merger of the firms did not follow due process. I want to assure residents that we followed the Constitution and our main agenda is to bring water into the homesteads,” Waititu said.
