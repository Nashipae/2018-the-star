Polygamy is not the answer to alcoholism and the problem of fatherless children, psychologist Gladys Chania said yesterday. "What we need is not to advocate what can open a can of worms. We need to empower single mothers; empower and mentor our young men to get married and be responsible," she said. "Holistically we need to economically empower our youth and society. If an addict marries five wives, what will he do with them?" Chania was responding to Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni Wamuchomba's call to the county's men to marry more wives. Wamuchomba polygamous marriages will increase the county's population, and reduce cases of infidelity and of children born out of wedlock. She said it is regrettable that more women are yearning to get married but most men are heavily dependent on illicit brews. But Chania said politicians are in a position to change Kenyans' economic and social fortunes. "Let them not hide behind populist rhetorical stereotypes of getting our families more psychological and social torture," she said. "Let them do what they can with the kitties the government has put under their control without turning other people's [problems] to oral sarakasi [drama] every other day." Chania said psychologically it is better to handle one demon than two. An addict or a recovering one has little tolerance for emotional stress triggers; so we cannot rehabilitate them then push them to marriage to have children, it is a journey and a process, she said.
