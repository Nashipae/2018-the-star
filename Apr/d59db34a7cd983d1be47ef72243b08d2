ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna has said the party can never be compared to Jubilee. They have different interests, he said. Sifuna said President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga handshake does not mean the two merged. “We are different parties with different manifestos. We advocate for the end of injustice, but our colleagues seem to be contributing to residents suffering,” he said. Sifuna spoke on Wednesday during campaigns for the Kinondo Ward by-election slated for April 18. He clarified that Raila has been given a government job. “Raila is at home. He has not been given any office as claimed. Do not be lied to that we are one. Vote for an ODM candidate for change,” Sifuna said. ODM will field Hamisi Pweza, who successfully filed a case against Jubilee’s Juma Maone. ODM camped at Biga grounds while Jubilee camped at Rainbow grounds.
