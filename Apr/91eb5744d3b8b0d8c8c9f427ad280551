NASA senators appear to have lost steam for their retreat to address inhouse matters including the Minority leader’s seat after Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula announced he was no longer interested in the position. Wetangula ,the Ford Kenya party leader, on Sunday last week declared he will not take back the position which was dramatically snatched from him on March 20. Addressing the media in his county, he hit out at Raila Odinga’s ODM party telling it to “keep the position” “I will not, even if offered by Raila Odinga and his ODM Party, take up the seat of minority leader. That is not what I bargained for, our people in Vihiga, Trans Nzoia, Bungoma, Kakamega and Busia unconditionally supported Raila and gave him an overwhelming vote. Now we have seen their vote of thanks,” Wetang’ula said.  NOT IMPORTANT He added, “Let Raila and ODM keep their seat of minority and let the games begin.” Wetang’ula’s was replaced by Siaya Senator James Orengo. On Friday, Kakamega Senator Cleopha Malala said there was no need for the retreat as Wetang’ula has already stated his position. “From the current developments,I do not think it is important to have that retreat. The retreat will not have any meaning,” he said.
