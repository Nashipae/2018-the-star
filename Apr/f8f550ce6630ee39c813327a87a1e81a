The Luo are tired of playing second fiddle while others reap from government, hence the unity deal between President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga, an MP has said Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma said the community has been at the forefront of opposing tyrannical governments in the quest for democracy, while others enjoyed massive development. He was speaking on Radio Ramogi on Wednesday. Kaluma said Raila changed tack after his co-principals betrayed the cause and failed to turn up for his January 31 swearing-in as the People's President in Uhuru Park, Nairobi. “Our son had to re-strategise on realising that we were being betrayed while other community members enjoy benefits from Jubilee government,” he said. Raila's NASA co-principals are Kalonzo Musyoka of Wiper, Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula of Ford Kenya and Musalia Mudavadi of ANC. Kaluma said senior government officials from the community are being unfairly hounded out of office and being replaced by members from other communities, hence Raila's change of tack. He said the unity deal will profit the community as well as Kenya's economy. NASA, however, has not joined Jubilee Party, Kaluma added. “You can bear me witness that following the duo's handshake, the economy improved and the shilling rose in value against the US dollar,” he said. The MP said the journey to Canaan is still on. He said NASA wants a structured dialogue in which issues that were an impediment to proper electoral reforms and democratic space are ironed out. Kaluma urged ODM supporters to be patient with Raila and Uhuru, as the benefits of the unity deal will trickle down to the region.
