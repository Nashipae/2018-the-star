The Supreme Court has certified as urgent a case in which Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi is challenging nullification of his election. Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu directed Abdi to file his written submission within three days and serve the respondents with the application and submissions to the case. The case will be mentioned on May 3 before the deputy registrar for further directions. Abdi moved to the court on Friday last week, moments after the Court of Appeal upheld the decision by the High Court to nullify his victory in the August 8 election. The governor said he was aggrieved with the entire verdict of the court of appeal. Appellate Judges Philip Waki, Milton Makhandia and Patrick Kiage agreed High Court colleague Alfred Mabeya that Abdi lacked the academic qualifications to run for the seat. The judges dismissed Abdi's appeal saying that the governor did not have a degree from Kampala University as he had claimed. They also said Abdi did not have a master’s degree in diplomacy as he claims. The Jubilee Party governor failed to prove that he obtained the said degrees, the judges said. They agreed with Mabeya's finding that the governor was not legally cleared to run for office. The bench said Abdi wasted the opportunity to rebut the allegations made against him when he declined to appear before the High Court for cross-examination. The governors opted to file an affidavit. Appellate judges also rejected Abdi’s argument that Mabeya had no jurisdiction to inquire into his degree certificate. The governor said Mabeya's action amounted to investigating fraud and forgery against him. The court ruled that Mabeya had powers to determine the issues that were before him. "Only the governor could have explained, under oath, the critical details relating to his academic qualifications. He chose not to," the judges said.
