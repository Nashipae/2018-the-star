Kisii Governor James Ongwae has appealed to the US government to help in soapstone value addition on soapstone to shield miners from exploitation by middlemen. â€œMiddlemen exploit miners by cheaply buying their soapstone before ferrying it elsewhere for value addition. We want that value addition done here for the miners to benefit," Ongwae said on Monday. He spoke in his office where he received outgoing US Ambassador to Kenya Robert Godec. Godec had paid the governor a courtesy call. Soapstone mining is the main economic activity of residents of South Mugirango. Ongwae said residents have remained poor despite the availability of the precious mineral. Godec said the US government was keen on supporting governance structures to enhance growth.
