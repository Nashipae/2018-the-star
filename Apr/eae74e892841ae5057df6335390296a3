Mbeere North MP Muriuki Njagagua has threatened to petition Parliament to force the government to share equally the Sh1.2 miraa grant if Embu farmers are not included in a committee to dish out the money. Farmers from Embu last week protested their exclusion from the 11-member committee and called for the appointment of their representative. The committee was formed to oversee the implementation of recommendations by a task force that looked into the problems farmers face. The team will oversee the distribution of Sh1.2 billion. The money is a government grant to miraa farmers. The farmers said they were not represented in the task force that came up with the recommendations to be implemented by the committee. Njagagua said it was unfair for the government to exclude Embu from the two teams. He wants Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri to review the list. “If that does not happen, then I will petition Parliament to ensure the Sh1.2 billion is equally shared by all miraa growing zones,” Njagagua said. He was speaking in his constituency on Sunday. The MP said farmers must be represented in the committee because they have the best understanding of their problems. Embu, especially Mbeere region, ought to have been included in the committee because it grows a special type of miraa, muguka. ”Mbeere must have a share of the Sh1.2 billion grant. Our farmers must also be represented in the implementation and stakeholders committee,” Njagagua said. He spoke barely three days after Mbeere and Embu Miraa Farmers Union and Mbeere Muguka Sacco threatened to move to court to block the committee from implementing the recommendations.
