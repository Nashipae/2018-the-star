Jubilee MPs from Western have dismissed Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula and his ANC counterpart Musalia Mudavadi's new push for Luhya unity. The MPs said the push, which followed after their fall out with ODM leader Raila Odinga in NASA, is out of the leaders' frustrations and for selfish political gain. The MPs John Waluke (Sirisia), Fred Kapondi (Mt Elgon) and Janet Nangabo (Trans Nzoia woman representative) warned that the bid will divide the community. "Jubilee is the government we fought for and we can't jump into something we don't know. This ANC-Ford Kenya merger is going to divide the communities," Waluke said. The legislators said Wetang'ula and Mudavadi should be the last persons to talk about Luhya unity. "They failed to unite the community while holding powerful ministerial positions in the previous governments. What are they going to do now?" Waluke asked. He took a swipe at Wetang'ula saying he cannot manage the millions of Luhyas in Western. "Wetang'ula failed to manage 28 NASA senators while serving a Senate Minority leader," Waluke said. The legislators have asked the two NASA leaders, who teamed with Raila ahead of the 2017 poll, to join the Jubilee government. Raila has since joined hands with President Uhuru Kenyatta in a pact which was sealed through the now famed handshake on March 9.

"When Mudavadi and Wetang'ula were in NASA as principals, they never represented Luhya interests. But now out of frustrations, they have gone back to tribal cocoon which should be condemned," Kapondi said. Nangabo said the two leaders should desist from politics and partner with the government for western residents to benefit from development. Click here for the latest political news
