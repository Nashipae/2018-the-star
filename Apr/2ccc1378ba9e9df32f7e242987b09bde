Walls of four Lunguma Primary School classrooms collapsed in heavy rain on Tuesday. Head teacher Mwachama Omar yesterday appealed for a Sh2.5 million donation to rebuild two classrooms. The other two will be rebuilt with the Matuga CDF cash, he said. MP Kassim Tandaza said he will fund two classrooms using the cash that was allocated for desks. More than 70 pupils will have to learn under trees if they get no help. The pupils head for the April holiday and will resume learning barely four weeks later. Omar called for urgent help so learning is not disrupted. “We have yet to come up with an alternative,” he said. “The procedure used by CDF committee is long. I fear we may resume next term before construction starts.” Omar said maintenance fees from government cannot meet the construction cost. Each child gets a maximum of Sh50 per term for building maintenance. The school has 270 pupils. “If we fail to get help by next month, we’ll have to call parents and plan for a temporary shelter,” he said.
