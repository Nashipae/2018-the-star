Martha Karua's evidence in her elections case is not supported by affidavits, a Kerugoya court heard on Tuesday. Senior Counsel Paul Nyamondi said this while making submissions on behalf of Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru, who defeated the Narc Kenya leader in the August 8, 2017 race. Karua is representing herself in the case and is being assisted by a new lawyer as Gitobu Imanyara failed to appear in court. She was forced to cut short her submissions after the respondent's lawyers demanded that she abide by rules of proceedings. Nyamondi noted that evidence not supported by affidavits is deemed null and void. He added: "It was out of order for Karua to refer to witness reports before an application she made earlier on the same reports is fully heard and determine." Justice Lucy Gitari adjourned the session to allow the petitioner to file an application on read-only access to IEBC data. The hearing will resume on April 17. Karua says the election was not free and fair, and that ballot boxes were tampered with and papers forged on a large scale The Supreme Court declined to stop Kthe Narc Kenya leader's petition in March. Waiguru had asked the court to stop the Kirinyaga High Court from proceeding with the hearing to allow her to appear, but her application was rejected. Waiguru approached the Supreme Court after the Court of Appeal set aside a decision dismissing Karuaâ€™s petition. The judges also quashed an earlier decision directing Karua to pay Waiguru and the electoral commission Sh10 million.
