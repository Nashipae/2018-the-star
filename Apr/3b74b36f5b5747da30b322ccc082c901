The conservation icon who cared for orphan elephants, Dr Dame Daphne Sheldrick, is dead. Sheldrick, 84, passed away on Thursday after a long battle with breast cancer. She impacted many lives after founding The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, and the orphan elephants she raised, now living in the wild. The trust said in a statement “it is deeply saddened by her death”. Her daughter and DSWT chief executive Daphne Angela Sheldrick said, “Daphne’s legacy is immeasurable and her passing will reverberate far and wide, because the difference she has made for conservation in Kenya is unparalleled. She will be sorely missed, but never forgotten and this is what Daphne drew the most comfort from in her final weeks.” She said Sheldrick’s memory and work will continue with the tiny steps of baby elephants for generations to come, and that the work she pioneered has achieved so much for wildlife and wild places throughout Kenya. Sheldrick dedicated more than 60 years of her life to the protection of Africa’s wildlife and some of the world’s most iconic and threatened animals. She was born in Kenya in 1934. Sheldrick spent close to 30 years working alongside her husband David, the founder warden of Kenya’s largest National Park, Tsavo East. They turned the wild land into a protected space for Kenya’s largest elephant population and other wild species. Her husband died in 1977. Sheldrick then founded The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. For close to 40 years, she helped shape the world’s understanding of elephants and rhinos. Sheldrick also played a pivotal role in the protection of these species. She was the first person to successfully hand-raise a milk dependent newborn elephant and rhino, knowledge that has seen more than 230 orphaned elephants saved in Kenya, and countless other infant elephants in countries across Africa and into India.
