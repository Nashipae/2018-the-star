Nyando MP Jared Okello wants the government to expedite issuance of land title deeds to his constituents. He asked the National Land Commission chaired by Mohammed Swazuri to swiftly process the title deeds to residents. Okello pointed out that no resident in all the five wards in Nyando sub county has ever owned title deed. “Majority of my constituents have never seen how a title deed looks like apart from me and other few individuals in the constituency,” he said. The legislator called on Swazuri to speed up the process of ensuring that citizens are issued with land title deeds. Noting the importance of title deed, Okello said the document is crucial and must be issued to every Kenyan who owns land in the country. He pointed out that locals are unable to access loans from financial institutions as they lack the document to use as collateral. Okello urged the commission to visit Nyando constituency on a fact-finding mission in efforts to speedily process the title deeds to residents. “I am looking forward to organise a public awareness rally on the issue of land title deed. We will invite the Swazuri-led team to help tackle land issues,” he added.
