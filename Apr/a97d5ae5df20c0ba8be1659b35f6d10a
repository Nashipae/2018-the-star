MCAs are once again on the Auditor General’s radar for blowing millions of shillings on travels, some of which never happened. In his 2015-16 report, Edward Ouko flagged assemblies he said couldn’t document cash advanced for local and foreign travel. MCAs surpassed travel ceilings or exhausted allocations without documentations. They include West Pokot, Homa Bay, Busia, Bomet and Kisumu. Read : Counties splashed Sh514m on travels in three months In West Pokot, MCAs spent Sh62,990,641 for domestic travel, against an approved budget of Sh40,910,881 for 2015-2016. In Homa Bay, the last assembly could not account for Sh12,168,800 to attend liaison meetings in Kisumu and Nairobi. Ouko queried how Busia MCAs used Sh4,108,067 paid to the last assembly and the Global Centre for Capacity Development in the form of foreign travel and consultancy. Kisumu assembly could not support the Sh2,743,026 used for domestic and foreign travel. In Bomet county, the authorities could not furnish Ouko with justification for a ‘suspect’ two-day trip to Dubai on December 14 to 16 in 2015. Since the advent of devolution in 2013, MCAs have been accused of burning millions of taxpayers money in non-essential trips. Most destinations were Dubai, Zanzibar, Rwanda and Israel, where the legislators crafted huge budgets in the name of learning best practices not readily available in Kenya.
