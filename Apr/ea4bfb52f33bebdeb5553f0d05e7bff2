More than 32 households in Shompole were on Thursday submerged after River Pakase bursts its banks in Kajiado county. The incident happened when most people were out in the fields either grazing their livestock or away in the local market. Former MCA Peter Pariken said several goats and chicken were swept away. “People have now started arriving in their homes and are yet to count losses. We thank God this happened during the day because it could have been disastrous if it found people asleep at night,” Pariken said on the phone. Kajiado West deputy county commissioner William Kakimoni confirmed the same and said the area is unreachable on road. “I have appealed to the people to move to higher grounds just in case more floods occur,” Kakimoni said.
