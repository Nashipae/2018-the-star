A woman from Riandu, Mbeere North subcounty, Embu, is seeking help to get a lung transplant after she developed a disorder that is scarring her lungs. Peris Igoki, 43, was diagnosed with interstitial lung disease four years ago. She moves around with an oxygen cylinder as the disease has damaged her lungs. Interstitial lung disease is a group of diseases that causes progressive lung scarring, affecting one’s ability to breathe and get enough oxygen into the bloodstream. Her husband Edward Njiru and brother-in-law Harison Mwaniki yesterday told the press that the mother of two started experiencing health complications in 2010. Doctors treated her for TB. Igoki is a housewife and Njiru a small-scale farmer who quit his job in Nairobi to take care of her. Family members have been raising funds to support the two and their children. The family imported an oxygen concentrator for Sh250,000, but it was unreliable. It’s battery is recharged every 30 minutes. They were advised to buy an oxygen cylinder, which they refill every four days for Sh3,500. The drugs she uses cost Sh60,000 a year
