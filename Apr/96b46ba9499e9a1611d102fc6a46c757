Scores were yesterday arrested and detained at the Mwingi police station following chaotic demonstrations in the town. Police had to fire teargas to disperse protesters after two groups clashed. Supporters of Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu clashed with those of Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi. On Saturday, the MP warned the governor against setting foot in his constituency, remarks that have angered Ngiluâ€™s supporters. Earlier, Ngilu had been forced to postpone her meeting in Mwingi after it was interrupted by youths believed to be supporters of Mulyungi.
