Ugandan artiste Ykee Benda is in Kenya for a media tour. Ykee has been in the industry for two and a half years now and is doing great with music. He told Word Is he is more of an urban artiste. The artiste is known for his song Farmer, which was his breakthrough song in the music industry. "The struggle is real when it comes to music, but I believe in shining. I walk with God and I try to be decent, which is why I am top of the game in a short while," Ykee said. "My biggest inspiration to music was the late Mowzey Radio, who started his music in 2007, when I was in school then, working hard to be an engineer. I looked up to his music and said to myself, I want to sound like Radio. I started training with his music." So, how did Ykee receive the sad news about the passing on of his hero? "It was sad to me. It was that one morning that you feel like you have lost your own brother. I met Mowzey twice not because I could not meet him more times, but I avoided meeting him. "From what people used to say about him, he was very tricky and short-tempered, and therefore, I chose not to frequently meet him, because I did not want to experience his bad side. I wanted him to remain special to me and he is still so special to me." Ykee feels there is so much talent in East Africa that is yet to be identified. He urged artistes to come together and work towards lifting each other, saying he is looking forward to working with Kenyan artistes. Ykee is also going to feature in the World Cup song that will be launched soon with, Diamond, Jason Derulo, among other big artistes.
