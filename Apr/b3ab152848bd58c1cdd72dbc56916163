At least five families spent Friday night at Kamandura underpass along the Nairobi Nakuru highway in Limuru after their vehicles got stuck in flooded waters. The families have all been rescued but their vehicles were destroyed. “We started feeling as if our vehicle was being pulled. I tried to apply brakes, but it was still moving, it was at this time the engine went off,” explains Godfrey Muchiri, a motorist. Muchiri said he had two female passengers and children.

The women started screaming, but it was late at night,” he added. “Since the windows of my vehicles couldn’t be lowered, I broke the driver’s window glass and we went out. The other vehicles occupants escaped through windows too,” he said. Johnson Ocholla said they waded in the waters until they rescued everybody. Residents attributed the floods to the uncompleted upgrading of the James Gichuru road up to Kamandura by the China Wu Yi contractor. In Limuru town, floods also closed Kabuku road at the Kenya Railways bridge, forcing motorists to use alternative routes.
