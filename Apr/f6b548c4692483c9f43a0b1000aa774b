A former Embu Coffee Society secretary has been accused of misappropriating Sh27 million. Alvin Gitonga denied the claims, calling them malicious and a form of witch-hunt. Government auditors revealed Embu North’s Central Ngandori Coffee Cooperative Society’s Sh30,738,890 was misappropriated, with Gitonga being blamed for the loss of Sh27 million out of the said amount. The rest was embezzled by seven former management committee members. The audit report scrutinised the society’s accounts between 2014 and last year. It was presented to the farmers last week. The losses were occassioned by exaggerated repairs and maintenance costs and fictitious payment of tax to the Kenya Revenue Authority. Other means through which the money was siphoned off included alleged survey expenses, unaccounted for cash withdrawal from the society’s bank accounts, alleged purchase of goods and irregular allowance payments. The audit was commissioned by President Uhuru Kenyatta during his campaigns for re-election last year. The farmers called for his intervention following delayed payments. Gitonga said those blaming him are not genuine. “Who is supposed to run the society? Is it the staff or the management? It’s wrong to blame procurement issues on me. That is not how things are done,” he said. The farmers called for Uhuru’s intervention after sacking officials in a special meeting. They confronted the President when he visited the area, demanding he saves them from the management committee members. The President instructed that an audit of the society’s account be carried out immediately and the culprits be dealt with accordingly. Society chairman Patrick Njagi urged farmers to be patient and give the new management committee time to work and stop further loss and theft. Embu county cooperative commissioner David Muriuki promised to push for the investigation of the management committee members who embezzled the money and make them pay it back.
