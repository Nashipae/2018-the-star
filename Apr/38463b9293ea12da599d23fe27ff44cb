Chinese firm Avic International has said construction of a five star hotel next to Villa Rosa Kempinski along Chiromo Road is lawful.The firm, in a letter to the Star on Friday, said the stop order issued by the National Environment Tribunal expired in December 2015. Kempinski in 2015 moved to the tribunal to challenge approvals granted by Nema to Avic.Once an appeal has been filed before the NET against a development, construction must stop.The NET in December 2015 dismissed Kempinski’s appeal for being filed outside the 30-day window after approval. Read: Villa Rosa in intense war with upcoming hotel in its vicinity Kempinski then moved to the High Court, which ordered the NET to hear and determine the appeal.But Avic now says NET’s orders expired in 2015 and the law does not provide for instances when a dismissed matter is referred back to the tribunal. “Although the Environment Management and Co-ordination Act contemplated that the filing of an appeal at the tribunal would have the automatic effect of stopping the development activity complained of, such a position is not provided for after the conclusion of an appeal at the Environment and Land Court and referral back to the Tribunal (as is the case),” Avic says in the letter.Avic says it has abandoned its planned challenge of the High Court’s decision in favour of negotiating an amicable settlement.
