Tigania West MP John Mutunga has put on notice a no-show contractor hired to tarmac a road a year ago. He said not a single kilometre of the Kagaene-Kibuline-Kaboto road has been tarmacked, despite President Uhuru Kenyatta commissioning it one year ago. “When residents are about to demonstrate, he is seen on the road with his machines then immediately leaves,” Mutunga said. “Let him take his belongings and go to perform his magic somewhere else not in Tigania. We don’t want him on the road. I will not condone reverse work.” He spoke at Kaboto and Kibuline, when he unveiled 44 sub-location development committees on Monday. Residents have complained the road is filled with potholes and gets muddy when it rains.
