A woman is nursing burn injuries at Limuru Nursing Home after she fought with her husband over Sh50 paraffin on Wednesday night. Ann Wangui, 25, says she was overpowered by her 31-year-old husband when she tried to run away. “When I decided to run away, I took our parrafin lamp, teased him with it and quickly opened the door, but before I rushed outside, he pulled me back inside and banged me against the wall. The lamp exploded,” Wangui, who is from Thigio in Limuru constitu-ency, said. The mother of one sustained burns on her chest, neck, face and hands. But the doctors said she was out of danger. Sauti ya Wanaume na Watoto chairman James Njenga condemned the violence, saying Wangui’s husband should be arrested. But Wangui said she does not want to file a case against her husband. “God will deal with him. I only want my daughter, clothes, one sheep and one hen. They are mine. I want to go to back my parents home to start a new life once I am discharged,” she said.
