Drainage challenges in Nairobi may soon be a thing of the past after the government and Nairobi county acquired a flusher machine for unclogging drainage systems. This came amid concerns of flooding within the Central Business District during heavy rains. Transport CS James Macharia and Nairobi governor Mike Sonko un the machine on Tuesday at Sunken Park.

"The whole project costs around Sh500 million and Nairobi alone is allocated 75 per cent of the total amount," Macharia said. The project started in December 2012 and is expected to be completed by end of May 2019. Sonko said the machines will work faster as no manual labour will be required. "The flusher machine will help clear the clogged drainage as the country is still experiencing heavy rains," Sonko said. Nairobi county public works director Frederick Karanja said the machine will clear the drainage system to allow the free flow of water. A flusher machine costs an approximate Sh25 million.
