A wild animal believed to be a stray hyena killed 17 goats on Satuday in Kyandoo village in Kamuwongo location, Kyuso subcounty. Other goats were wounded during the night attack. Resident Julius Kitheka lost three goats. He urged the government to capture the animal and compensate the affected farmers. Subchief Richard Muthengi said the incident was reported at his office. Seven goats were recovered from the bush. Ten others are missing. “I’m urging residents to be patient since the Kenya Wildlife Service is working to catch the animal. Compensation will be carried out following the laid down procedure,” Muthengi said.
