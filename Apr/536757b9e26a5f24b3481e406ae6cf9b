Residents of Longonot in Naivasha were left in shock after a man committed suicide by jumping into a drum full of water on Monday. The man in his mid 40s took is life after the Children's department ordered him to pay Sh1,500 every month to his estranged wife for child upkeep. The man, only identified as Chege, had part ways with his second wife two years ago following unending domestic rows. Chief Stephen Njuguna the man had complained of being stressed following the second wife's demands. "The directive by children department irked him further. He decided to take his life by jumping head-first into a drum which was full of water." Jackson Waimeri, a neighbour, said the man asked his sons to fill the drum with water before he closed the door and killed himself. "It seems he had planned for this all along. He has left behind a very young family that relied on his support," he said. Meanwhile, the traffic police officer who was hit and killed by a speeding motorist along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway has been identified as Constable Joseph Kwemoi. Police launched a manhunt for the driver of the vehicle that knocked the officer at Karai, Naivasha. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said the officer's body has since been transferred to his rural home in Kitale for burial. "We are still in shock over the incident but we are sure that we shall catch up with the missing driver who hit and killed the traffic officer Kwemoi."
