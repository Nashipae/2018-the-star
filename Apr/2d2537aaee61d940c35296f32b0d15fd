Graves at Ndunyu Njeru cemetery in Nyandarua county have started sinking as heavy rains continue to wreak havoc across the country. The situation has raised fears among locals as the water overflowing from the cemetery find their way to Kinja river - a source of the region's water supplies. Thousands of people from Ndunyu Njeru,
Ndinda, and Turasha rely on water from the river for both their livestock and for domestic use. The residents now want the county government of Nyandarua to
act with speed to avert looming humanitarian crisis. "We fear for our health because the water from these graves
is flowing to the river where we fetch water for use," Jane Wambui, a resident, said. "We were born and brought
up here and we have nowhere else to go. The county government should relocate
this cemetery for us to live in peace." Wambui said locals at times find crosses,
washed away from the graves, at the river. "This means that even some remains
of the dead would find their way into the river." John Muigai said they can't rule out the possibility that people using Kinja's waters are consuming fluids and other substances from
the graves. Click here for the latest political news
