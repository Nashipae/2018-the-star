Nakuru MCAs want Governor Lee Kinyanjui to remove Finance and Economic Planning executive Joseph Kiuna for what they termed sabotaging development. Fifty-five ward reps have signed to impeach him. The county assembly has 78 members. A notice of motion was brought on the floor of the House on Tuesday for debate on impeachment. The furious MCAs said they they are finding it difficult to travel to their wards because they have not done any development projects for the eight months they have been in office. They accused Kiuna of violating the Public Finance Management Act, 2012. Ward Reps said he did not submit key budget policy documents in time including the County Fiscal Strategy Paper that was to be ready by February 28. He hasn't also submitted budget estimates and the county development paper. Ol Karia ward MCA Peter Palang'a said Kiuna failed to implement a resolution by the assembly last week to stop penalties on traders for one month until the Finance Bill, 2018, is passed. Chairman of the Budget and Appropriations Committee Moses Ndung’u said the panel is has continually been frustrated by delays by Kiuna to hand in budget documents. The assembly has not received the County Integrated Development Plan, which should have been ready by  September last year. The annual development plan has also not been given to the assembly. Ndung’u said the documents are essential as they guide the budget making process. There is confusion and uncertainty with the April 30 deadline approaching fast. The delays are hindering the assembly from effectively carrying out its mandate, he said. He said the Finance Bill delayed and was submitted after the expiry of 90 days after the passing of the Appropriation Bill. The MCAs claimed the executive was hampering house business by not providing crucial information through departments. Governor was on an official tour to Singapore.
