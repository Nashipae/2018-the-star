More than 500 traders in an open-air market in Marigat, Baringo South subcounty, have threatened to stop paying county due to poor sanitation. The traders say they sell their goods on dirty and wet ground and lack sheds to shelter from the rain and sun. “Poor sanitation may pose health risks to us and our clients. We are urging the county government to intervene and if not, we are going to stop paying fees,” trader Eunice Jepkogei said. Jepkosgei says she sells onions and cabbages and pays the county Sh20 every Monday and Thursday. “It is quite impossible being forced to pay taxes while we continue making losses,” she said yesterday. The traders risk being moved as the county is building a tarmac road across Marigat town. Traders selling farm produce on the Loruk-Marigat-Nakuru road say stray goats have become a menace.
