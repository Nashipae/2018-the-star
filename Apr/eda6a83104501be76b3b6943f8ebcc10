Anti-GMOs activists have opposed use of genetically modified maize, saying it is not the solution to the current armyworm crisis. Led by Anne Maina, the national coordinator for Kenya Biodiversity Coalition, the activists said armyworm is does not spare GMO crops. “It is not correct to say that GMOs are the answer to the current challenges posed by the armyworm. GMOs are not necessary in Kenya, whether as a contribution to sustainable food security or for trade,” Maina said.

The activists claimed the introduction of armyworm in Kenya and other parts of Africa was a strategy to put pressure on governments to accept genetically modified foods. Murenga Mwimali, the team leader at Water Efficient Maize for Africa, said research has shown less damage on GM maize compared to conventional ones.The stem borer research was conducted in Kiboko and Kitale. “Though the research was not on the armyworm, we noticed there was less damage on the GM maize unlike the conventional maize which had extreme damage on the leaf and stalk,” Murenga said. Maina dismissed the research, saying there was a misconception that GMOs will lead to less fertilisers and pesticides.
