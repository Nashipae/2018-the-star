NASA co-principal Musalia Mudavadi has been told to reach out to Deputy President William Ruto for a political alliance ahead of 2022. National Assembly Majority whip Ben Washiali said other NASA co-principals were reaching out to new friends and that it was time Mudavadi did the same. He asked Mudavadi to reach out to Ruto, saying they will strike a deal because they are neighbours. Washiali said Mudavadi must look for support outside the Luhya community for a realistic chance of becoming President. “Mudavadi’s friends are shaking hands with other leaders. Hand- shakes have become the news these days. Mudavadi should also shake hands,” Washiali said. He was referring to the March 9 handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga. Raila has also met with former presidents Mwai Kibaki and Daniel Moi. Washiali asked Raila to allow the Luhyas to unite behind Mudavadi and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula. The two leaders are leading fresh efforts to unite the community behind one political party. "The only respect Raila can give Luhyas for supporting him three times is by allowing them to unite,”the Mumias East MP said. Meanwhile, Lugari MP Ayub Savula said Raila and Mudavadi were ready to work together despite disagreements in NASA. “I met Raila last week and he sent me to Mudavadi with a message that he still respects and trust Mudavadi,” Savula said. Savula said he relayed the message. Raila and Mudavadi shared a platform on Saturday during the burial of Shinyalu MP Justus Kizito’s mother, Regina Mmbaya.
