Online taxi drivers in Mombasa have completely switched
off their apps in a protest expected to
continue for one week. The over 500 drivers are demanding an increase in base
fare to Sh300 from Sh100-Sh200. Rates differs depending on the applications with Uber
charging Sh200 base fare. The drivers also want charges per kilometer increased from Sh25 to Sh50. The drivers also want the waiting time charged at Sh5 and not Sh3 per minute. According to Coast Digital Association, a union that
brings together the operators, the decision to switch off and issue ultimatums
is informed for rise in fuel prices and low incomes. Shellie Githinji, the secretary of the group, said despite
inflation, all the firms maintained their rates, just as cub owners whose
commission have been Sh2,000. "We are making a lot of trips but all the money is going towards fuel expenses. We started this business when the prices were Sh95 per litre, today it
is Sh104." The firms take between 15-25 per cent of money generated
by drivers. Taxify is the lowest while Uber is the most expensive. Githinji said they want the percentage reduced to a 10
per cent flat rate. Uber has called for meeting with their members of May 16. CDA member Kevi Odhiambo said Uber has blocked about 80 Mombasa
accounts for cancelling trips. Odhiambo said the security situation, in some instances, dictate whether they will pick a customer or not. "I cannot go and pick a passenger from an area prone to violence
and attacks," he said. Omondi Onyango, a driver, asked the government to regulate
the firms saying they are exploiting Kenyans. Read: Online taxi drivers in Mombasa down tools in protest over poor pay Click here for the latest political news
