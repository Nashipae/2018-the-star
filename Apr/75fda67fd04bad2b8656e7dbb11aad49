Government’s expenditure on education is projected to rise by Sh99.7 billion this financial year, a report has revealed. The 2018 Kenya National Bureau of Statistics economic survey indicates that the 2017/2018 budget for the sector will rise by 31.6 per cent to Sh415.3 billion from Sh315.6 billion in the previous financial year. Recurrent expenditure, which includes teachers’ and lecturers’ salaries, will increase by 30.7 per cent to Sh385.2 billion. This is seemingly an indication that a pay rise for lecturers and teachers could be in the offing by the end of the year. According to the report, Teachers Service Commission will take the biggest share of Sh202 billion. The latest supplementary budget shows that the commission has been allocated Sh16 billion to hire more teachers’ and award pay increases. This will likely help reduce the 155,605 teacher deficit being experienced in the country. TSC CEO Nancy Macharia told the education committee on education on April 10 that the commission needs to hire 68,000 intern teachers at a cost of Sh16 billion, and will need more funds to hire 12,696 trained teachers.

Plight of varsity students as lecturers' strike bites She said TSC is overwhelmed because it has only 312,060 teachers and the Sh5 billion governments allocate each year is not enough to hire 291,635 trained teachers. She said the commission needs to hire 20,000 teachers each year to close the existing deficit in four years' time. The Kenya National Union of Teachers claimed that teacher shortage has led to a teacher-student ratio that is as high as 1:50. Expenditure on university education is expected to rise to Sh96 billion followed by basic education which will get Sh85 billion. The supplementary budget indicates that Sh5.7 billion has been set aside for universities. This could potentially end the strike which is now in its 58th day. Currently, lecturers are on strike demanding a pay hike, car loans, mortgages and medical insurance to be factored into a four-year Sh38 billion collective bargaining agreement. Some Sh30 billion of the total expenditure will go towards infrastructure development in schools. A huge chunk of the development funds will likely be spent on building new classes in secondary schools to deal with a student influx arising from the roll out of free day secondary education. Vocational and Technical Training education has been allocated Sh2.5 billion. The Sh30 billion allocated for development expenditure has also been allocated across all the education sectors. Vocational and Technical Training education has been given the highest chunk of Sh16.5 billion while Basic Education has been given Sh8 billion. University Education has been allocated Sh5.4 billion while TSC has been allocated Sh118 million.
