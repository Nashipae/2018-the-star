The government will revive collapsed industries to create employment opportunities, Industrialisation CS Adan Mohamed has said. Speaking in Kisumu on Monday, Mohamed said the government was keen on supporting private investors for the realisation of the Big Four agenda. President Uhuru Kenyatta has outlined food security, affordable housing, universal healthcare and manufacturing as his Big Four agenda for his final term. Mohamed said the government will revive the textile industry which has factories in many western counties. The CS spoke during a tour of the construction of Sh15 billion Kenya Breweries Limited plant. Mohamed said private public partnership was key in the attainment of government flagship projects. The KBL plant, set to be launched later this year, is expected to create about 100,000 jobs once it starts operation. Mohamed said he was impressed with the progress of the plant which was commissioned by Uhuru in June last year. The firm will initially produce senator keg, to be made from locally sourced sorghum before its starts the production of other KBL brands. The plant has a capacity to produce 100 million litres of senator keg. “The plant is part of the government's Big Four objectives in the manufacturing sector," Mohamed said. He said residents will get first priority in the available job opportunities. “I'm aware that approximately 85 per cent of the workers here are locals," The CS said.
