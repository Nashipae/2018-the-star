Activist Okiya Omtatah has hit out at Interior CS Fred Matiang'i over his attacks on the judiciary. Omtatah said the CS seemed to be "high on drugs" when he appeared in parliament to explain Miguna Miguna's deportation. “There is a certain clique of judicial officers have gotten into ‘unholy relationship’ with a clique of Opposition activists to derail the government,” Mating'i told the Committee on National Security on Tuesday.

"He is totally unhinged to be making such reckless statements before such an important forum as though he was high on drugs or something because he didn't look normal to me. His utterances were basically insults," he said. He said Matiang'i statements were reckless and he will file a case seeking to declare the CS unfit to hold public office. "Matiang'i thinks he is a small god. He trivialized serious issues on the rule of law," Omtatah said. He further said he will write to the clerk of National Assembly Clerk seeking to cross-examine Matiangi on his allegations that he is part of a cartel of activists working with the judiciary to undermine the government through court orders. While appearing before the committee Matiang’i justified the move to “remove” Miguna saying he was not deported but removed because he did not have a passport. He accused Judiciary of issuing irrelevant orders and full of ‘click of criminals’ and judges who collude with activists to embarrass the government.
