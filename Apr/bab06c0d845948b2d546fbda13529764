The government should compensate and make community health volunteers health workers. Amref Health Africa global CEO Githinji Gitahi yesterday said volunteers make an important contribution to the community. They visit households, link people to formal health systems and make referrals, he said. “This country has multiple levels of healthcare and the last level, which is level one, is the community health workers,” Githinji, who is also the co-chairperson for Universal Health Care 2030 globally, said. He said volunteers should be appreciated. “They are the ones who know mothers who need antenatal care. They are the ones who know children who have not been immunised and they refer them to the health facilities,” Gitahi said.
