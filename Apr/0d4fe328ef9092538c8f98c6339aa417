The construction of a state-of-art eye hospital in Thika town is in the works. The Jain Youth League - a group that holds the Free Shah Eye Clinic every April in Thika town - revealed plans to put up the facility are underway. Group chairman Dr Jinesh Shah said despite holding free clinics for 39 years, eye, ear, nose and throat maladies are still on the rise. He said the hospital will bring services closer to Kenyans. He spoke on Wednesday at Chania Girls High School in Thika where the group has been holding a free clinics for two weeks. Shah said the planned facility will offer services at a subsidised cost. “We’ve decided to construct the hospital to end the suffering of many Kenyans with eye or ENT problems. We only appeal to the national and county governments to assist us with a five-acre piece of land anywhere in Thika so we can start putting up the facility,” Shah said. He said the group will hold free clinics - which will include dental services - regularly even after construction of the hospital. Shah said the group has brought in doctors from India and the UK, including six eye surgeons and six ENT surgeons. “We’ve also given out reading glasses to patients every time we hold the free exercise,” he said. Dr SK Savla - a consulting eye surgeon - said the main problem exhibited by patients is cataracts, which are a major cause of blindness. He said close to 6,000 patients who attend the clinics suffer from cataracts. “We usually perform surgeries,” Savla said.
