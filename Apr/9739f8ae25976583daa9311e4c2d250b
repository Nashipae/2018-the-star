Widepsread misuse of treated mosquito nets has slowed the fight against malaria in Migori county. Despite free distribution of 677,872 insecticide-treated nets in the past year, many nets are used for fishing nets, for drying fish and for protecting kitchen gardens from poultry and inspects. “The fight of ending deadly malaria has been undermined by carelessness and ignorance of the population on how to prevent the disease,” Rongo assistant county commissioner Pamela Odhiambo said on Wednesday. She and others were speaking in Rongo town during observations on the World Malaria day. Odhiambo said nets distributed by the government and donors have been used for fishing and fencing off kitchen gardens. “We sadly have cases where villagers use distributed treated nets as fences in kitchen garden to keep poultry from eating vegetables,” she said. She said fishermen have been using free nets, sewing them together and uses them as fishing and drying nets for sardines commonly known as omena and other small fish. Director of malaria control Florence Ongele said the county reached a target of 98 per cent coverage after 691,950 nets were issued by the national government and development partners. She said in the last population census, 1.3 million people in Migori had nets and the figure has risen to 1.4 million after distribution of nets every three years. “The high coverage is because we targeted boarding institutions like schools, where principals committed to complete cover,” Ongele said. The director said it was disheartening that some married couples keep mosquito nets only for themselves, leaving their children without protection. “Some families just keep nets for visitors,” she said.
