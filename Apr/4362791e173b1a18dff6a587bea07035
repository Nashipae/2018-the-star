Lamu is witnessing an upsurge in divorce cases because of increased secret marriages conducted by carefree and unauthorised religious leaders. The Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya, Lamu chairman Abubalar Shekuwe, warned couples who get married through such leaders. Speaking in Lamu on Tuesday, Shekuwe said a new trend makes couples defy religious directives and secretly get married without involving witnesses as required by law and the Quran. Shekuwe said secret marriages are the cause of frequent conflicts in families and high divorce cases. He said it is wrong for one to be married by a cleric who has not been ordained for that duty. "Most of those marrying secretly have wives and children, a situation that always results in ugly conflicts when either side finds out," Shekuwe said.
