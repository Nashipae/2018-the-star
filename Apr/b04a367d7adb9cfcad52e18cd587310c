Paul Lonyangata of Kenya will be looking to retain his title at the Paris Marathon tomorrow. The Kenyan could become the first man to win back-to-back titles since Steve Brace of Great Britain in 1989 and 1990. Last year, he improved his personal best to 2:06:10. In addition to this win, the 25 year-old also succeeded in Lisboa in 2013 and Shanghai in 2015. Lonyangata is familiar with Paris roads as he finished runner-up over the half marathon in a best of 1:00:40, also last year. Although he will wear bib no. 1, Lonyangata, whose last outing was a fifth place showing at the Sao Paulo 15km in December, doesn’t seem to be the main favourite on paper in this year’s edition, as he holds the fifth fastest time of the field. Ethiopian Yemane Adhane is the only athlete to arrive with a sub-2:05 lifetime best, having prevailed in Amsterdam in 2012 in 2:04:48. Since then, he took silver at the 2015 IAAF World Championships and won in Fukuoka two years ago clocking 2:08:48. Although he is the fastest man of the field, Adhane, who will turn 33 on Sunday, hasn’t shown good form since that success in Fukuoka. Some of Lonyangata’s compatriots will also be in contention for the victory. First among them is Eliud Kiptanui, who has a 2:05:21 PB set in Berlin in 2015 when he finished runner-up. He then won in Ottawa in 2017 in 2:10:14 before finishing fifth in Valencia in 2:07:25 in November. Mark Kiptoo has also shined over the distance when he succeeded in Frankfurt four years ago in 2:06:49. He bettered that mark by 49 seconds the next year clocking 2:06:00. Last year however he finished 10th in Paris in a more modest time of 2:10:45. Kiptoo’s half marathon 1:01:04 success two weeks ago in Azkoitia highlighted his current shape. Erik Ndiema reached the podium in Paris in 2013 when he finished third with 2:06:34, 24 seconds outside his PB set in 2011. His last race was a sixth place in Toronto in 2:15:31 last October. Limenih Getachew of Ethiopia, second in Paris in a best of 2:06:49 in 2014, could also figure in the battle for the victory. Not to be discounted are Ethiopia’s Yitayal Atnafu and Kenya’s Micah Kogo.
