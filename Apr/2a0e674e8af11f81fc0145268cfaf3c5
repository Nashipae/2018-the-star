Popular Kikuyu Secular artist Joseph Kamaru is alive contrary to death reports. News on his alleged death flooded social media on Friday. But the Benga artist said he was alive and was being discharged from a hospital. He is expected to attend a musicians' meeting at Homeland. The 79-year-old is a local music legend whose debut in music was received in a unique fashion. When Kamaru released his "Darling ya mwarimu " in 1966, Knut called a nationwide teachers' strike and parliament debated the controversial song. It took the intervention of President Kenyatta to cool down tempers. The song was a reflection of affairs between wayward teachers and pupils. Many of his songs were political, either praising or criticising the government. Initially, he had a good relationship with President Kenyatta, but after writing a song condemning the murder of Josiah Mwangi Kariuki in 1975 Kamaru fell out with him. After Kenyatta's death, the next president Daniel arap Moi was close to the artist. In 1980 Kamaru toured Japan as a part of President Moi's entourage. After the visit, he composed Safari ya Japan praising the president. But Moi was not pleased with Kamaru's support for multiparty democracy in the late 1980s.  Click here for the latest political news
