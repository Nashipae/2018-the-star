A man accused of murdering the Kitale Gold Club Chairman was taken to court on Friday but did not plead to the charges. The prosecution
asked the court for more time for investigations into the murder of Moses Yator, who had been chairman for three years. Magistrate
Paul Biwot ordered the suspect to appear in court on Tuesday for plea-taking. Yator,
64, was gunned down on the night of March 3, a few metres from his home
near Kitale prison. He and his wife Esther Nandutu had been returning home from the
club when three assailants accosted them and shot him. The killers stopped the
couple at gunpoint and ordered Yator out of the vehicle. They shot
him in the chest. A close relative said Yator
tried to negotiate with the killers who stole his phone and a wallet containing Sh25,000. They warned his wife that they
would kill her if she tried to raise the alarm and then escaped on a motorcycle with Yator's car keys. Nandutu
said the gang dragged her husband's body in front of the vehicle's and ordered her to lie on it. Read: Kitale golf club chairman Moses Yator shot dead County Commander Samson ole Kine said they were close to finding the motive for the killing. “Detectives are working
