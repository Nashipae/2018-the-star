Cuba has now released 100 specialised medical doctors to travel to Kenya. Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki signed the agreement and contracts in Havana yesterday. The first to arrive could be 10 public health experts expected in July to help Kenya, like Cuba, to eliminate malaria. “Fifty Kenyan doctors will also travel to Cuba to receive specialised training, which will be mostly be on family medicine,” Kariuki said. President Uhuru Kenyatta sanctioned the bilateral agreement allowing Cuban doctors to work in Kenya during a recent visit to Cuba. Kariuki said the Cubans will be deployed to rural areas to help improve access to specialist medical services and reduce the dependence on the few congested referral hospitals. “The deployment of the Cuban doctors will also enable knowledge transfer to doctors in rural areas. Kenyan specialists should consider offering their services in the counties level rather than concentrating in the big cities,” she said. Early this week, chief of staff and head of the Presidential Delivery Unit Nzioka Waita said under the partnership with the Cuban, Kenya will bring in specialists in key areas of medicine, including kidney and skin care.
