Estellah Nyamuta’s massive hit, Tindi Pipo, is taking the music arena by storm.  “The song reminds the Kisii community to retain and uphold its culture. It insists that people should uphold their moral values,” she said. The artiste is a third year PR and communication student at Moi University’s Nairobi campus. She has promised her next single will have a blend of Kisii and Kiswahili tunes. “Artistes should also pursue an education, not music alone, so they grow and put more sense into their music as they entertain their fans.” Nyamuta has another single titled Nitarejea, produced by Grandpa Records, and three other hip-hop and ragga songs produced while she was in high school.
