Farmers in Elgeyo Marakwet are counting losses after marauding animals killed at least 60 sheep in two weeks. The animals that resemble dogs have killed sheep in Kapteren, Cheberen, Kapkoi, Kaptarakwa, Chebiemit and Kapyego areas. Elgeyo Marakwet KWS warden John Ngalia identified the beast as a wild dog and said the service is laying traps in the affected areas. He said the marauding dogs are killing sheep at night in areas adjacent to forests saying that they don't move in groups making it difficult to trap them. “Areas adjacent to Kessup forest is worst it. We are urging farmers to construct stronger animal sheds to protect their livestock,” Ngalia said. The warden said KWS officers have launched hunt for the wild dogs in swampy areas in local forests where the beasts live in. “Livestock officers will do an assessment before the affected farmers are compensated,” Ngalia said. At least 200 sheep were allegedly killed by the marauding wild animals in the areas in June last year.
