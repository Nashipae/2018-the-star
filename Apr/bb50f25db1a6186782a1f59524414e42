Motorists have been assured the Mai Mahiu-Narok road is safe. Mining PS John Omenge said the yawning cracks on the stretch were caused by floods, and that there was no scientific explanation for tectonic movements. The road was stable and the affected sections were caused by sand washed down hill from Suswa Hills. “This is normal in floods prone areas. We can’t say we move this road because of the cracks since after the rains, everything will be back to normal,” he said. Omenge blamed environmental degradation as the cause of gaping crevice. Human activity had contributed to the under-washing of sand leading to the fissures.
