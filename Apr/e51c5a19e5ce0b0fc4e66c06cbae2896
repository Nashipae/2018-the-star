Transport along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway was temporarily paralysed after a speeding motorist hit and killed a traffic police officer in Naivasha. The Canter driver who killed the officer near Karati trading centre escaped while undergoing treatment at Naivasha Subcounty Hospital. Police are hunting for him. A solemn mood engulfed the busy police station as colleagues tried to come to terms with the death. Witness Adam Muchiri said the officer had flagged down the Canter that was heading to Naivasha from Nairobi. The driver who was speeding hit the officer who was standing by the roadside, seriously injuring him. “The driver of the Canter lost control of the vehicle and landed in a ditch. The officer was rushed to hospital,” he said. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said they have the details of the driver, they are looking for him. He said the driver slipped out in the confusion at the hospital, but is optimistic he would be caught. “We have lost a dedicated officer because of negligence of a driver. He can run but cannot hide. We will find him wherever he is,” he said. Meanwhile, tension in high in the clash-torn Kosovo in Naivasha after two communities clashed over farming in the government-owned ADC land. Scores of peasant farmers were injured - two seriously - before police moved in to contain the situation. The incident came two weeks after a man was shot with a poisoned arrow and died hours later. The OCPD however downplayed the incident saying normalcy had resumed.
