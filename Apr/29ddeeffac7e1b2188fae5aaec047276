Politician Sangok Teeka has given Governor Joseph Lenku one week to rescind the sand harvesting ban or face his wrath. Teeka, who did not specify what he intends to do, said the ban was “ill-informed” and in “bad taste”. “While the people of Kajiado believe in new policies to guide mining in the region, there is need to consult the people before taking such disastrous actions. He is being heartless to the plight of thousands of people depending on sand trade,” he said. Teeka made the remarks yesterday during a press conference in Kitengela. He said, “The sand business can still move on as the county formulates its rules, laws and regulations. This is a natural resource.”
