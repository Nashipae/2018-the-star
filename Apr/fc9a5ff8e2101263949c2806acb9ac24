City Hall plans to build multistorey car parks to ease traffic congestion in the CBD. The building will increase parking slots. The 2018-19 fiscal strategy paper says the county will carry out reform to achieve an efficient traffic management system. It says the rapid increase in the number of private cars, lack of an efficient rapid transit system and indisciplined motorists and boda bodas are to blame for the deteriorating traffic conditions. Last month, Zimmerman MCA Pius Mbono introduced a motion proposing all open spaces within the CBD be turned into parking areas. The parking place adjacent to the Supreme Court is one of those earmarked for permanent multistorey car parks. It is currently used by the assembly members. This would also help generate revenue. The county assembly called for public-private partnerships to support the investment. MCAs directed the Transport and Planning committees to come up with a plan to fast-truck construction. Majority Whip Chege Mwaura supported the motion. MCAs also want new buildings in the CBD to provide parking spaces for their tenants. The 6.5 million population of the city and suburbs is projected to hit 10 million by 2030.
