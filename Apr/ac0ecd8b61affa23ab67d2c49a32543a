A faction of the Luo Council of Elders wants the Willis Otondi-led group to stop engaging politicians from the community. The elders say they recognise Nyandiko Ongadi as chairman. They said Otondi is seeking support from politicians after most elders rejected him. Otondi was recentlyend orsed by ODM leader Raila Odinga. Led by Ongadi’s vice chairman Thomas Achiando, Homa Bay branch chairman Opiyo Achieng’ and member Simba Amadi, the elders accuse Otondi of instigating wrangles by working with politicians. “He [Otondi] wants favour from this community through popular politicians after failing to get attention from most elders. But we are telling him that he will not succeed through that route,” Achiando said. Speaking to journalists when they met Ongadi at his home in Kendu Bay, Karachuonyo constituency, the elders said they do not recognise Otondi’s endorsement as chairman by Raila. “It is the politicians who should seek advice from elders, not the reverse . The meeting went against our customary laws,” Achiando said. Homa Bay branch chairman Achieng’ accused Otondi and his group of causing division among the elders. On Monday, the Otondi faction met Raila at his home in Bondo constituency. It was later reported that the elders had agreed to throw their weight behind Otondi’s leadership. Ongadi accused Otondi of working with political leaders to derail the council
