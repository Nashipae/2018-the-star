Charcoal dealers in Narok town want the government to fund alternative businesses following the ban. The group of 100 traders - the majority women - said they have been unable to pay school fees. They met at the assistant county commissioner’s office in Narok town yesterday. Trader Grace Partoip from Olopito said she uses stock from the bush in her farm to make charcoal and has never used timber from forests. “I don’t know my next move after the ban on charcoal burning,” she said. Ann Sankok from Olpopong urged the government to help the group start alternative businesses.
