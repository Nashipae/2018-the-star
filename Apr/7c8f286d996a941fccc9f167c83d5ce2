A video of Diamond Platinumz and his baby mama, Hamisa Mobeto, in bed has gone viral. The Bongo star looks visibly inebriated in the video. He mocks Hamisa, saying she took him to court for child support, yet she is in bed with him. In the video, Hamisa tries her best to not be part of the selfie video and she is seen struggling to avoid the camera. “Leave me alone, Nasibu. I'm still mad at you!" Hamisa shot back, hiding behind a pillow. The background to the videos was a new release by Diamond and Harmonize titled Kwangwaru. Now, we don't know if all this was for the purpose of promoting the new song or he was just too drunk that he wasn't aware of what he was doing. Diamond also captioned one of the videos, "She said she wants child support nikamwambia naenda RC." In another video, Diamond is seen getting hot and heavy with a mystery woman. In the series of videos, the Tanzanian singer throws pot shots at his ex, Zari Hassan, with whom he has two children, Tiffah and Nillan. He acknowledges that Zari did indeed dump him in the video, as he flaunts his mystery bae. He captions the video, "Ukiachwa achika". In yet another video, he says his new bae has softer, silkier and real hair, not like that of his ex, Zari, which is a wig.
