Three Rift Valley MPs have vowed not to support the proposal by NASA leader Raila Odinga to amend the Constitution and create a PM post. They say the proposal is ill timed and aimed at undercutting DP William Ruto’s presidential ambition for 2022. Soy MP Caleb Kostany, his Ainabkoi counterpart William Chepkut and Nandi Senator Stephen Cherargei say the new post would be costly to the taxpayer. Kostany on Saturday said the current clamour to amend the Constitution is being driven by selfish politicians. Chepkut said, “We cannot subject the county to such amendments to satisfy individuals. We will use all means possible to reject it.”
