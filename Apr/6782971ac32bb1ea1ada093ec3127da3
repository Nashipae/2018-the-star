Kisumu Speaker Onyango Oloo has suspended three MCAs over gross misconduct. The MCAs are Joachim Oketch (Kondele), Jacktone Ogendo (Nyalenda A), and Seth Olale (Nyalenda B). Following their suspension, Oketch and Ogendo will miss 21 sittings each while Olale will be out for 14 sittings. Oloo said on Tuesday that the three acted in violation of the assembly Standing Orders and Powers and Privileges Act. He said the three persistently misbehaved during a Speaker's Kamukunji (informal meeting) on Monday and refused to apologise. The speaker said the suspension was given to each of the MCAs depending on the degree of their misconduct. "The member's behaviours totally contravene the Standing Orders of this assembly." A source told the Star that the Kamukunji was called to bring a truce and make the assembly operate smoothly. This followed differences pitting some of the MCAs against the speaker. Oketch expressed his displeasure with the speaker’s decision, terming it an illegal move. He told the Star that a member cannot be suspended for stating their mind and standing their grounds in an informal meeting. "The mace, which is a symbol of authority, was not on the floor to warrant such actions," he said. Oketch added that they have not been summoned by the Powers and Privileges Committee which is mandated to handle such matters. "I consider the decision as unconstitutional and out of order. I will disregard the orders and go to the assembly as usual." Last month, Oketch and Ogendo were ejected from the assembly following after they disagreed on the list of members of House Committees. Oloo ruled that the members were out of order even as they continued hulling sentiments expressing their dissatisfaction with the committees' composition.
