The police officer who beat and stepped on the neck of a civilian in a viral video has been positively identified. Inspector General Joseph Boinnet said via twitter that the officer is being processedÂ for disciplinary action. "We are calling upon the individual assaulted to present himself to the Nairobi Area Police Commander for statement recording to facilitate the officer's trial in a court of law," he said. The officer was caught on camera stepping on the neck and head of a civilian. In the 97-seconds video, the attacker is seen apprehending a civilian, and forcing him to lie down on the ground. The officer then steps on the neck of the man as he struggles on the ground for rescue, an indication that he was suffocating. After the man turned to lie on his belly, the officer is seen climbing on top of him while stepping on his head. The helpless man surrenders completely. "Chini! Chini! Chini! (Down! Down! Down!)," the policeman is heard shouting even as he keeps on mistreating the man. See: Video of cop brutalising civilian during arrest sparks outrage Click here for the latest political news
