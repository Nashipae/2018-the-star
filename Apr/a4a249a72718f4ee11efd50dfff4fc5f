Visa has announced it will be opening up the first Visa Everywhere Initiative for Sub Saharan Africa to young developers during the Nairobi Tech Week. Developers who win the Visa-led hakathon during the tech week scheduled for April 19-21 will gain entry to the Visa Everywhere Initiative, granting them an opportunity to compete for a chance to win up to $50,000 at the regional level. “Introducing the Visa Everywhere Initiative at Nairobi Tech Week will go a long way in enabling the country’s developers merge their creative ideas with their technical skills to build something capable of solving potential challenges,” Visa general manager for East Africa Sunny Walia said. Visa will take part in panel discussions focused on three key areas; Fintech, Cyber Security and Tech in industries. Additionally, the hackathon competition will be based around three topics. Each of the topical challenges are structured to leverage on Visa Developer APIs and are geared towards solving payments and commerce challenges of tomorrow. According to Visa, payments systems need to grow as fast as the growing needs of e-commerce businesses, in order to achieve the required output. “As the region’s domestic merchants rapidly expand their digital commerce proposition, payment gateways must also evolve at breakneck speed to offer their customers a hassle-free shopping experience,” Walia said. Nairobi Tech Week, in its third edition, is Kenya’s largest tech event for product makers aimed at bringing various actors and influencers of the tech ecosystem to one space to showcase premier developments in innovation and technology. This year’s agenda includes three days of workshops, panels and hackathons. Day one will focus on hands-on workshops for developers and designers, to sharpen their skills, while day two and three, will primarily be for the Hackathon.
