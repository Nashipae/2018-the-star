The Sh20 million ultra sound machine which was stolen from Kapenguria county hospital in West Pokot has been recovered. The machine, which was stolen onÂ  March 7, 2018, was returned by a resident of Lityei village on Wednesday. The person who surrendered the equipment is in custody and is assisting police with the investigations into the theft. John Mureithi said he was given the machine by an unidentified person to look for a potential buyer. He said he decided to return the ultra sound machine after realising it was the one stolen from the hospital. Kapenguria Hospital medical superintendent Jotham Mukhola said he was happy that the machine was recovered. Health chief officer Abraham Longolomoi said it was unfortunate that such an expensive equipment disappeared from the hospital. He noted that the ultra sound machine was shipped in at the hospital by doctors who were coming to support the project dubbed "Saving Mothers". "It is a mobile machine almost the size of a laptop. It is a powerful machine which can help a gynaecologist diagnose the interior parts of a women womb." Saving Mothers donated the equipment to the facility owing to the long distances women in the region cover to get pre-natal care. Click here for the latest political news
