Lamu’s Health department has distanced itself from claims that neglect resulted in the death of a 20-year-old snake bite victim. Phillip Murithi died after he was bitten by a puff udder. His family says he was neglected and wants the county to compensate them. Nyingi was bitten and rushed to Mpeketoni Subcounty Hospital and thereafter to King Fahad Hospital in Lamu, where he died. But Lamu county director of health David Mulewa said their investigations showed the medics were not to blame for the death.
