Counties have defend themselves against claims of imposing development projects on their people. Responding to questions by delegates at the Fifth Devolution Conference in Kakamega, Deputy Governors forum chairperson Joash Maangi said counties rely on development proposals from their people. He said no county comes up with a projected that is not contained in the County Integrated Development Plan. “At the counties, development projects originate from the people themselves, when we do the CIDP [County Integrated Development Plan],” the Kisii Deputy Governor said. On the establishment of the Sh5 billion sugar factory at a controversial forest in Nyangweta, Kisii county, Maangi said the people of South Mugirango prioritized the project in their development proposals. “What the county is doing is to obey the wishes of the people. We are not breaking any law,” he told delegates during plenary discussions. Asked why the county was deforesting the area to pave way for the Indian investor to put up the factory, he said the county government had plans to compensate for the lost forest cover. “This is a man made forest, we are taking 120 acres but we are donating 150 acres to the Kenya Forestry Service to plant trees to recover the cover,” he said when challenged on what the county will do once the factory is built. He said a feasibility study was done which established that the project was doable and profitable.
