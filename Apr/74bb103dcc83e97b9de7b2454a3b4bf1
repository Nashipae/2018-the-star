Petra Bockle appeared on the music scene with King Kaka's street anthem "Ligi Soo" remix - at least that's how we remember it. Well, credit goes to King Kaka's effort for having an all female cast feature on the second half of the hit. It actually offered all the female emcees featured, including Femi One and Wangechi, a significant upturn in the industry.  In the pantheon of our female rap greats, Petra now occupies a noteworthy position when ranked against her rivals. Her early releases like "Mkali Wao" didn't do her much justice. However, for the last two years, her presence has been felt to a slight extent as she's featured on collaborative efforts with top names such as Bobby Mapesa, Calvo Mistari and Band Beca.  Of late, she's been jamming to Khaligraph Jones's vibe appearing on "The Khali Cartel" and "Rider," rapping with fire and force. Well, both artistes come out as replicas of something we've heard before, and maybe deserve to release music together. But what's even more enthralling about Petra is that she got Victoria Kimani to do the hook on "I Got That".  Solely, she doesn't seem to be as strong as when she's involved in collaborative efforts. We are yet to witness a proper solo release from Petra who's, for a better part of her career, preferred to thrive in the delight of her predecessors and those who've already made a mark.  Since she stormed the music industry, the young star has rarely been the topic of discussions either by critics or enthusiasts. Over the years she's been busy finding the perfect moment to state her claim on the throne. She been shadowed by top artists who've outdone her severally, but now she's turning into a fighter matching up against the top names.  Her music has grown and she's making daring attempts at being recognized and respected as a rapper. We can simply assume that her journey has just started and it's all up to her to up her ante.
