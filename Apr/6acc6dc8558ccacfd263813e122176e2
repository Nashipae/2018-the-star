Murang’a MCAs and a few residents will visit Tanzania to study waste management. The date has yet to be set. Under the Nairobi Metropolitan Services Improvement Project (Namsip), the county will have a landfill in Mitubiri. Namsip assistant senior director Peter Bundi yesterday said MPs will also visit South Africa on the same mission. Tanzania has three landfills in Arusha, Dodoma and Mbeya. South Africa has advanced systems. Four county officials had been taken to Scotland for training. They will be tasked with managing the landfill. Bundi made the announcement after the MCAs demanded that they too have a benchmarking tour. MCAs said they need to understand how a landfill is managed so they can explain to residents. Namsip will manage the landfill for one year before handing it over to the county. The visits are in line with CS James Macharia’s (Transport, Infrastructure) directive two weeks ago when he suspended the project, Bundi said. Macharia issued the order after residents and politicians complained Namsip had imposed the project on them without proper public participation. They expressed fears the project could pollute groundwater and contaminate their boreholes. Some said Namsip should have chosen a site less suitable for farming. They want a clear plan on how toxic waste will be sorted and disposed of to avert disasters.
