The Meru assembly has passed a motion compelling the county to unclog drainage and repair roads ruined by storms and heavy rains. The motion tabled by deputy speaker Elias Murega passed unopposed on Tuesday. It requires the Roads and Energy departments to come up with urgent measures to manage drainage in urban centres. Murega, also the Municipality MCA, said the executive must act swiftly to avert disease outbreaks. “We have witnessed flooding, especially in Gitimbine where property was destroyed and lives put at risk,” he said.
