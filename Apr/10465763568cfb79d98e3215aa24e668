Makueni MP Daniel Maanzo has demanded that the national and county governments release money for the repair of roads damaged by floods. Maanzo said this in a phone interview with the Star on Saturday, after a bridge at Matiliku on Emali-Wote road was swept by floodwaters. Following the incident on Friday night, police issued a warning and asked motorists to use alternative routes. In a notice posted on its Twitter account, the National Police Service asked Makueni residents to use Makueni-Masimba road to Emali via Makindu. “The [bridge has been damaged and the road rendered] impassable." the notice stated. Maanzo asked for emergency funds but dismissed the warning as an exaggeration. “I know the place. It is near Governor Kivutha Kibwana's residence. It cannot be that bad considering the way it is structured. I am sure it's only a small section," he said. The MP said he had asked the national government for money from the emergency kitty to tarmac the rough road. He asked the county for help saying national officials were taking long. Regarding financial allocations for road works, Maanzo raised questions about processes. He said that in the last financial year, the government assigned Sh3 billion to the 42 km road but that it was diverted to the construction of Sultan Hamud-Kasikeu road. “The President [Uhuru Kenyatta] was in Matiliku during the campaigns seasons. He promised to tarmac the road but it seems people in high offices despise us Kambas," he said. The legislator pledged to raise the matter in Parliament.
