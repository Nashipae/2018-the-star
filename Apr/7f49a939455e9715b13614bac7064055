Posta Rangers have flattered to deceive for much of the season and they will hope yesterdays 2-1 win over Kenyan Premier League leaders Mathare United at Camp Toyoyo, Jericho is not another false dawn. A pair of headers from in form Kennedy Otieno and Joakins Atudo saw the mailmen race into a two goal lead and with their defensive record there seemed to be no way back for Mathare. A rare lapse in their box allowed Clifford Alwanga to steal in and nod Mathare back into the tie as they went into the break having halved the deficit. If Mathare expected an end to end encounter in the second half it was not forthcoming as Rangers closed shop and took all the three points that left Mathare just one point above champions Gor Mahia who were not in action this weekend but will be mightily pleased by the results. Ulinzi Stars yet again dropped points at home as they were held to a goalless draw by lowly Thika United. The same result was replicated in Ruaraka where 10-time champions Tusker shared the spoils with fast improving new boys Vihiga United. Nzoia Sugar rise up to the league table continued as Victor Omondi’s first half strike helped them to a 1-0 win over Bandari. The early kick off match went in favor of host Chemelil Sugar who thrashed Wazito 3-1. Meanwhile, Western Stima’s journey back to the top flight remained on course as they came from behind to edge out 10-man KCB 2-1 to retain their place at the summit of the National Super League table. After 12 games, Stima have amassed 27 points four more than KCB, who have played a game less.
