Governor Kiraitu Murungi yesterday urged the Meru business community to employ their own security guards to prevent theft. He said it is impossible for police officers to guard every home and business in towns and trading centres from burglaries. “From Monday, we embarked on a clean-up exercise because Meru cannot grow when businesspeople are operating on muddy areas. We’ll instal not less than 10 floodlights surrounding this market to enable them to sell their goods 24 hours,” Murungi said in Gakoromone, Meru town. “But on security, I ask people to have their own means of securing their businesses.” The county plans to pave link roads in the town. Meantime, they have used 100 lorries of sand to make them passable. On Wednesday, traders and residents of Kwathambi estate requested the county and national governments to build proper drainage. On Monday, firefighters rescued traders and residents after a downpour. Some business premises were submerged in rainwater. “We have a plan for dust-free towns. We’ll incorporate the businessmen in their towns to ensure there is no dust or mud. It is shameful that people buy potatoes, cabbages and other items displayed on mud,” Murungi said.
