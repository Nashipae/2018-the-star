Sometimes there are times when I slow down to look for the really small things. After driving very slowly, eventually my reward came in the form of some funnel web spiders in the Langata forest. It is very interesting to see the detail in the funnel shape of the web and then spend some time, waiting and watching how incredibly fast they are when prey like insects get caught in the web. It must be noted that spiders are NOT insects. The order Araneae (spiders) is the largest order within Arachnida, and spiders are found in every part of the world, except the Antarctica. Although many people think of spiders as being insects or “bugs”, they are, in fact, different in many ways from insects. For example, spiders have only two body parts (cephalothorax & abdomen), while insects have three body parts (head, thorax and abdomen). They have four pairs of legs, while insects have three pairs of legs. They do not have wings, and they have two to eight simple eyes, while insects have compound eyes. As spiders are carnivorous themselves, they are also important biological controllers of their prey species, keeping insect numbers in check. If every spider on the continent were to suddenly disappear, we would virtually drown in a sea of insects! Spiders are fascinating to observe and study. Behavioural differences and colour variations are as numerous as the species themselves. So how about slowing down and observing the smaller creations like spiders, that all have a purpose as God made them? Remember this: “When we look for the smallest, we also see the largest”, from spiders to giraffes, and so on. Bring your family and have great fun exploring the wonders of the Nairobi National Park.  The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00. For more information, visit www.kws.org or www.nairobigreenline.org
