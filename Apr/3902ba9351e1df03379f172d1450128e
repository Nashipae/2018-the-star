Moreover, capitalization grew 48.7 per cent during the quarter under review from Sh1.89 trillion in the corresponding quarter last year to Sh2.8 trillion Speaking while presenting the sixth edition of the Capital Markets Soundness Report (CMSR), CMA director of regulatory policy and strategy Luke Ombara said that 2018 look promising as market turbulence ebbs away "Globally, capital markets registered strong performance in the early part of Q1/2018. As the quarter progressed however, global markets tightened and became more volatile as the destabilizing potential of US inflationary pressure increased. Domestically, the market stabilized as it sought to shake off the “wait and see” sentiments from a prolonged electioneering period,’’ said Ombara The equity turnover grew to Sh61.15 billion during the quarter under review from Sh36.02 billion, with investors in Total, Unga Group, Equity Bank and Barclays Bank Kenya growing their money by over 30 per cent Recently, Total Kenya announced that it will take up 25 per cent of Turkana oilfields, and also committed to the construction of the Lokichar - Lamu crude oil pipeline. Equity Bank’s share on the other hand grew on the back of aggressive campaign of its online money transfer platform; Equitel that saw transaction volumes grow by 11 per cent Even so, shareholders in Uchumi, Kenya Airways and ARM cement went home in tears during the quarter as their money dropped by over 36 per cent. Uchumi share traded at Sh2.45 in the first quarter of the year down from Sh4.60 in Q4/2017 representing 46.7 per cent drop. The listed retailer did not declare dividends after it declared pretax loss of Sh895 million in 2017, compared to Sh547 million in the previous financial year Investors in Kenya Airways suffered a blow after the share dropped from a high of Sh17.15 in the previous quarter to Sh10.85.
