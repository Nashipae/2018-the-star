Tenants of the 100-unit Khadija Estate in Mombasa yesterday protested against Governor Hassan Joho’s administration accusing it of forcibly trying to evict them. At least five tenants of the Estate, which has been earmarked for demolition to pave way for the construction of Sh200 billion high-rise housing project, had their belongings thrown out of the houses. The tenants accused Joho of scheming to have all the houses allocated to close allies and individuals who work at the county government, including a personal assistant, bodyguards and inspectorate officers. They said they are not against Joho’s Sh200 billion housing project, which is facing opposition in court, but they want a proper legal structured agreement and assurance before they vacate the houses. “They had promised to give us Sh500,000 as house rent for the two years the project will be ongoing if we agree to move out, but we asked for a proper legal structured agreement and they refused to heed to our request. They want things done without any legal binding,” Jane Wanjiku, the chairperson of the estate, said. She said in 2016, High Court judge PJ Otieno ruled in favour of Joho saying the tenants be evicted and the project proceed as planned. However, they moved to the Court of Appeal seeking to overturn the High Court ruling. The Appeal court restrained the county from evicting the residents pending determination of the case. Wanjiku said the county government evicts without notice tenants who default on rent payment for a month. A resident who referred to himself as Mr Obunga said there are tenants on standby once others are evicted.
