Naivasha residents are up in arms following a garbage pileup that has left the lake side town sinking in filth. There are fears of a disease outbreak amid reports about 50 county employees responsible for garbage collection have been laid off. Matters have been made worse after it emerged garbage collection vehicles have either broken down or have not been fuelled. Residents have urged the county government to address the problem promptly. Lake View MCA Karanja Mburu yesterday said it was shocking to see garbage pile up all over the town, including the CBD and “no one seems to care”. He said Naivasha leads in revenue collection in Nakuru county yet residents gett poor services.  OPERATIONS GROUNDED “We have just had a cholera epidemic and just when we thought the county has rectified its mistakes, garbage has piled up and left this place stinking,” Mburu said. Naivasha Professionals Association CEO Abslomon Mukhusi said the town had lost its former glory. He said the rains have worsened the situation with part of the garbage containing toxic chemicals being washed into Lake Naivasha. “We are destroying the lake’s ecosystem yet we depend on it entirely for survival. The concerned parties should rectify the mess,” Mukhusi said. A senior county official who sought anonymity for fear of reprisal said operations have been grounded and workers cannot collect garbage.
