Education CS Amina Mohamed has said the government is working to harmonise lecturers’ salaries. She spoke at Mary Hill Girls High School in Thika town yesterday during the school’s Speech and Prize Giving Day. Amina said learners go to universities knowing they will complete the course in four years. “It is unfortunate that they end up taking six years because of the unending strike, which is not their fault,” the CS said. Amina reiterated the need to know how many lecturers are there in each university to hold discussions with unions to agree on a lasting pay formula. The government wants to ensure students start working as soon as they complete their university education, which should take the expected four years.
