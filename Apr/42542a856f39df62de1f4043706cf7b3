Politician Ambundo Libby has penned a touching message to DNA and his family after the rapper DNA, born Dennis Kaggia, lost his son, Jamal Waweru, last week. The nine-year-old boy, who was a class three pupil at the Kitengelea International school, drowned in the institution's swimming pool. "Bwana DNA be strong, buddy. Am still in shock. I know how it feels to lose people so close to us. Only God knows why, so let us trust his timings, his events and his instincts. We are in this together. Condolences to you and your family," Libby wrote. The family is yet to announce the funeral plans. From Word Is, we pray for peace and comfort for the family in these trying times.
