The Law Society of Kenya has endorsed the Lands ministry digitisation programme, PS Nicholas Muraguri has claimed. He said this followed their consultative meeting with the lawyers, who were initially opposed to the plan, on Friday. LSK had threatened to take the Lands ministry to court if online processing of land transactions is not stopped by April 9. In a letter to the Lands CS Farida Karoney, the lawyers asked the ministry to immediately stop online transfer of land calling it illegal.

"The new online system is only administrative with a view to expedite the processing of transactions of documents," Muraguri said in a statement on Saturday. Following the meeting, LSK said they are keen to ensure that the process is done in a consultative manner. "Execution and attestation of such instruments will
similarly continue to be done in accordance with the law," Muraguri said. In September 2017, the lands ministry said transfer of land leases, charges and subdivisions will be transacted online. This was after Lands ministry signed an MoU with the Government Digital Payments (eCitizen payments portal) towards setting up the system. The system went live on September 25 last year at the Nairobi registry. According to the ministry, the move is a major step towards digitisation of document processes in its registries. In June, the ministry introduced controlled access to sensitive offices at Ardhi House in an attempt to cut off cartels.
