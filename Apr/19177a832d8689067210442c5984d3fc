Construction of 11 footbridges is underway along the newly upgraded Outer Ring Road in Eastlands. Kura chief corporate communication officer John Cheboi yesterday said tthe authority has been researching the best sites. The Chinese firm Sinohydro Tianjin Engineering Limited will instal the 11 footbridges at a cost of Sh880 million. “We have started putting up the footbridge at Baba Ndogo area. The process will continue until all are finished,” he said. “We will also consider where the number of people crossing is highest and the strategic points to build foundations,” Cheboi said. Kura urged pedestrians to be patient and let the authority complete work. Residents had earlier protested the lack of footbridges that posed a risk to their lives as they used the busy raod. The 11 footbridges will be built all along the road from Taj Mall on North Airport Road to GSU headquarters in Ruaraka. Last week, Embakasi West MP George Theuri requested the National Assembly’s Transport and Public Works committee to set aside a budget for 10 footbridges and six underpasses. He cited Umoja’s Mutindwa area, Donholm and Taj Mall where vehicles have struck an killed several pedestrians. Plans to commission the 13 kilometer Outer Ring Road is  still set on July 14.  Construction began in January 2015.
