Shujaa will renew rivalry with USA, England and France in Pool ‘C’ of the London Sevens slated for June 2-3 at a sold out Twickenham Stadium. This is a repeat of the just concluded Singapore Sevens with all the teams having clashed over the weekend. Innocent Simiyu’s charges finished second in pool play in the City State with a 34-0 demolition of France and an impressive 33-14 over USA to qualify for the Main Cup quarterfinals. Kenya had earlier lost 28-19 to England in the opener. Shujaa went on to lose 24-10 to South Africa in the Main Cup quarterfinals to drop to the fifth place playoff, where they lost 17-7 to New Zealand. Series leaders and winners of four tournaments, Fiji headline Pool ‘A’ where they face New Zealand, Scotland and Argentina. Australia meet Spain Wales and yet to be identified team in Pool ‘B’ while South Africa, Samoa, Canada and Russia lock horns in Pool ‘D’. Shujaa beat England 12-0 en-route to the Vancouver Sevens final in March to record their first win in seven years over the former colonial master. Kenya’s record against the France is, however, balanced. Apart from 34-0 demolition of France over the weekend, the Les Tricolores have been a bogey team this season. The two sides have clashed four times this season. France winning 21-14 in Cape Town with Kenya winning in Sydney 17-14 the French edged Innocent Simiyu’s charges 19-14 in Las Vegas with Kenya winning 12-7 in Vancouver. The USA and Kenya have clashed three times this season, drawing 19-19 in Hamilton and 24-19 win in Vancouver coupled with the 33-14 victory in Singapore. Kenya have moved up to sixth on 93 points same as USA and they are on course to break the 100 point mark with the two tournaments remaining. Skipper Oscar Ayodi and Dennis Ombachi are expected to be back for the final two legs as they step up their recovery from injuries. Their fitness levels in the final two legs will determine their chances of making the squad to the Rugby World Cup Sevens in San Francisco, USA in July. The team arrives today and will embark on 10-day rest period before resuming training.
