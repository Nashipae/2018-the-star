Farmers who planted maize in February through irrigation are staring at losses following an invasion by the Fall armyworm. The worms have invaded Nyeri, Kirinyaga, Embu and Meru. “We have tried several pesticides but none is working,” Embu farmer Edward Murimi said. Recently planted maize has not been affected yet. Farmers are banking on the long rains expected to increase this month to counter the invasion. Meteorological department director Peter Ambenje told the Star the worm hides when it rains. “Any time it rains, the fall armyworm hides and reemerges after it stops,” he said. The rain, however, does no kill the worm. The worm population grows rapidly as one female lays 1,500 to 2,000 eggs in her lifetime, usually in batches of 200 eggs on a single plant.  DON'T USE SYNTHETICS Other counties that were affected last season include Baringo, Bungoma, Busia, Kakamega, Kericho, Nakuru, Nandi, Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu and parts of Kwale. Researchers have discouraged farmers from using synthetic pesticides to control the armyworm this season. The Food and Agriculture Organisation said many of the pesticides used last year are harmful to the environment and are more expensive as compared to safer alternatives. “Older pesticide molecules banned in industrialised countries are often still readily available and widely used in African countries. These products put farmers’ health and their environment at risk,” FAO said in an advisory. The rush for the synthetic pesticides was fuelled by panic and not based on a careful analysis of the costs and benefits. “The good news is bio-pesticides, including those based on bacteria, virus, and fungus, have been already tested, developed and used successfully in the Americas,” the advisory said.
