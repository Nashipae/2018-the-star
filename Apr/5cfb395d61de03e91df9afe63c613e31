Senate Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen yesterday hit out at governors for crippling the oversight of county assemblies. The Elgeyo Marakwet senator electrified ward representatives attending the Fifth Annual Devolution Conference in Kakamega. He backed the strengthening of their oversight role in counties to ensure prudent use of public resources. “After the 2013 election, we started off with conflict and confrontation instead of consultation and collaboration. This conference should open a new chapter for the national government, counties and other actors to work together,” he said. Murkomen regretted that devolution has been hampered by elements who think the system is about governors alone. Devolution is bigger than governors, MCAs and the national government, he said. He accused governors of creating a new generation of marginalised people by frustrating oversight and clinging to the budget-making process. “There are no checks and balances in counties. Let governors let go the powers to allocate resources. Let county assemblies perform that function,” he told the delegates amid loud cheers from MCAs. The senator said while the conference is about auditing the performance of counties, it should also be an opportunity for evaluations to establish how the national government has disbursed resources and if they have been used the money for the intended purposes.
