Safaricom's Director of Consumer Business Sylvia Mulinge has been appointed the head of Tanzania's Vodacom. Bob Collymore, the company's Chief Executive Officer, made the announcement on Monday. "Mulinge has been appointed Managing Director effective June 1, 2018. She will be taking over from Ian Ferrao," Collymore said. "Throughout her 17-year career, she has built a reputation as one of Kenya’s outstanding business leaders. She will leave behind a very strong team." Mulinge has more than 10 years' experience in marketing, half of it being in the telecoms industry. She is keen on consumer marketing and brand activation. Mulinge joined Safaricom in February 2006 from Unilever and rose from the role of Prepay Product Manager to Head of Retail. She is a first class honours graduate in Food Science and Technology from the University of Nairobi. The director was recently voted one of the top 40 under 40 most influential women in Kenya by Business Daily. Collymore also announced that Charles Wanjohi will act as the Interim Director of the Consumer Business Unit and report directly to him. Wanjohi, who has joined Safaricom's executive committee, has over 15 years' experience in the telecommunications industry. He joined Safaricom in June 2015 as Head of Consumer Segments Marketing and was responsible for insights that led to the creation of propositions such as Stori Ibambe, Tunukiwa, Safaricom Platinum and BLAZE. Prior to joining Safaricom, he worked at Eastman Kodak, Celtel Kenya, Zain and Airtel Group. Click here for the latest political news
