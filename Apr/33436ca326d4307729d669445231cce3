Former Mathere MP Stephen Kariuki’s property is set to be auctioned after he failed to pay Sh533,598 to Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company following a road accident. Gladsom Auctioneers went to Kariuki’s - Bishop Margaret Wanjiru’s son - home on the Kugeria Estate in Kiambu  last Tuesday, but were unable to access it. Kariuki allegedly ran into a vehicle belonging to Nairobi Water  on February 16, 2014. A letter seen by the Star showed Prudent Loss Assessors investigated the matter and found the car Kariuki was driving - registration number KAT 019Z - caused an accident. Referred to invesco In a civil case at Milimani commercial courts in 2016, Nairobi Water sued Zirock Holdings Limited and Stephen Kariuki and the court ordered the amount owed be paid. Gladsom Auctioneers were told to recover the amount if payment was not made. Wanjiru, however, intervened and asked the auctioneers - who were to break into Kariuki’s compound - to meet her at her Jesus is Alive Ministries offices in Nairobi and get a  cheque. Wanjiru referred the auctioneers to Invesco Insurance company with whom her son had insured his vehicle, but the insurer refused to pay saying Wanjiru’s son breach his insurance policy by failing to pay excess on the vehicle. An excess is the first amount payable by the insured in the event of a loss. It is the uninsured portion of loss, so when the insured submits a claim, he or she has to pay an excess. Four vehicles to be auctioned The goods to be auctioned included four vehicles worth Sh2 million, pool tables and chairs, sofas, TVs, carpets and fridges. Wanjiru is a former assistant minister for Housing. She unsuccessfully sought the Jubilee ticket to run for Nairobi governor.
