Residents of Kilungu ward in Makueni county have criticised area MCA Patrick Mbevi for suing a mentally ill man. Mulei Mwevya, who does menial jobs at Nunguni and Kikoko markets in Kilungu subcounty, was set free by Kilungu law courts on Thursday on grounds he was not fit for trial. According to court records seen by the Star, he is said to have gone to the MCAs office on Friday last week and questioned his commitment to develop the area. A heated exchange ensued and the MCAâ€™s handlers restrained the man and took him to Kilome police station where he was locked up until Monday. He appeared before senior resident magistrate Elizabeth Muiru who ordered police to take the man for a mental checkup at Machakos Level 5 Hospital before his trial. Kilome OCS Charles Njunchu said the suspect was taken to the facility on Wednesday, but there was no suitable doctor who could examine him on that day. On Thursday, the suspect appeared before senor resident magistrate Charles Mayamba who set him free after his parents told the court their son is mentally ill.
