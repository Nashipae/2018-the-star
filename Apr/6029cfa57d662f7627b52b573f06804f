84 per cent of Kenyans are supporting devolution, an IPSOS survey has said. According to the survey released on Friday, Coast counties lead with the highest support at 90 per cent followed by Nyanza with 88 per cent. Eastern and Rift Valley follow with 85 per cent and 83 per cent respectively. Ipsos lead researcher Tom Wolf said in terms of political party affiliations, 86 per cent of NASA supporters were in support of devolution compared to 83 per cent of Jubilee supporters. Wolf said they did not, however, ask why more NASA supporters supported devolution than those of Jubilee supporters. The research was conducted between March 4 and March 12, 2018, with 2,003 respondents being interviewed face to face. The survey had a 95 per cent level of confidence and a margin error of 2.16 percent. "This perhaps explains why 50 per cent of Kenyans have confidence with county governors," Wolf said. The report further indicated that 27 per cent of Kenyans feel county governments should improve more on roads infrastructure with another 21 per cent saying more needs to be done to improve water. 14 per cent want county governments to improve on employment, 9 per cent want education, another 9 per cent health and 6 per cent want Agriculture improved. The report, however, said in terms of health services, 44 per cent of Kenyans want the national government to take full responsibility compared to 36 who want the services be managed by county governments and 18 per cent who feel both levels of government can share the responsibility.
