Ohangla musician Maureen Achieng’, popularly known as Lady Maureen, said the 10 days she spent in Tanzanian cells showed her the true colours of politicians whom she sang songs for during campaigns. None came to her rescue. The traumatised musician was released from a Tanzanian jail on Friday. She was arrested in Mwanza on April 3 for performing in the country without a valid work permit. The musician and 14 band members arrived in the country on March 31 and performed for two days - on April 1 and 2 - before they were arrested at their hotel on April 3. Achieng’ said a Tanzanian promoter called Liz tricked her and her bandmates. She said Liz was to get the permits, but failed to do so.
