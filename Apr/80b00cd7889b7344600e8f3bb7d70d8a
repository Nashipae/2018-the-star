The Senate plans to interrogate Interior CS Fred Matiang'i over the Miguna affair next week. Yet he appeared before the National Assembly Security Committee only a few days ago. Similarly, last month both houses held committee meetings to probe the botched operations at Kenyatta National Hospital. Clearly, such duplicate activities are a waste of time, effort and money (see P10). The Senate is supposed to handle matters that touch on devolved functions and the welfare of counties while the National Assembly handles national (government) issues. However, the Senate seems to be swinging all over in search of relevance or trying to enhance its functions under the new Constitution. The country needs to find ways to make it more useful â€” including assigning it more responsibilities. In the short-term, Senate and National Assembly speakers should coordinate so that respective committees do not duplicate their roles. Where necessary, they should form joint committees to investigate an issue that is both national and local, such as KNH, or hold joint committee sittings. Clear delineation of the roles of the two houses should be a priority of the political and constitutional reforms being mooted.  Quote of the day: "What is a soul?
