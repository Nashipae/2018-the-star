Willy Paul and Harmonize are not on good terms after the Tanzanian seemingly reneged on a contractual agreement with the local gospel star on their song Pili Pili. “We should be
fair," Willy told Word Is. "The way we push our music here, they should also push our music.
We are brothers. I feel like they have to play their part. If we are
brothers, let's be real brothers. Hakuna kitu naeza mwambia. Anajua vile
tulikua tume-agree.” He added: "Kenyan music should be played more. As an artiste, I feel we are not played more in our country. As much as we are played their music, our own music should also be played but in a bigger percentage. I support WCB but I feel they should do the same thing."
