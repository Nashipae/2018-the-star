National Treasury CS Henry Rotich is on Tuesday expected to appear before Parliament over procurement flaws of electronic gadgets by IEBC during the 2013 polls. Rotich will appear before Public Accounts Committee to shed light on queries raised by auditor general for the financial year 2013/2014. The query has elicited mixed revelations from IEBC CEO Ezra Chiloba, former CEO James Oswago and former chair Isaack Hassan. "We have invited the National Treasury CS appearing on Tuesday to give input on this matter," PAC chairman Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja) said. Last month, Chiloba told the committee that Treasury and Auditor had given the commission approval to pay the firm Sh460 million as an additional claim for what they had supplied during the elections. He said internal auditors were commissioned by the Treasury to analyse spending bills. Chiloba said he opted to pay Sh250 million instead of Sh460 million which had been recorded as pending bills. He said the amount was for the supply of 4,600 additional kits, the hand-held devices but were not paid for inÂ 2013.  Click here for the latest political news
