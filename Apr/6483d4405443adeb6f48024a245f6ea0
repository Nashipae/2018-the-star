Some lecturers missed last month’s salary following the ongoing strike. Union leaders, however, said this will not deter dons’ resolve to push for the negotiation of the 2017-21 CBA. The strike enters its 37th day today. University Academic Staff Union secretary general Constantine Wasonga said members are not bothered by the withholding of salaries. “Workers in public universities did not call the strike to be paid March salary. Let them keep it, and by the end of the strike, whether one year or two years from now, you are going to get a boon,” Wasonga said. Last week, Wasonga said some vice chancellors were demanding show cause letters from lecturers for participating in what they described as unprotected strike. Wasonga told lecturers it is their right to strike, adding the union will from next week be represented by professors in law in court.
