Olympian Benson Gicharu feels it is time to lay his hands on a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games. Gicharu’s boxing career went a notch higher in 2010 Commonwealth Games when he scooped silver at flyweight division which was a moment to savour. “I have tasted Commonwealth Games success before and will be hoping to raise the bar higher in Gold Coast to improve my collection of medals,” said Gicharu prior to the teams’ departure. “I already have a Commonwealth silver and bronze medal and it would be prudent for me to try out a gold. I will fight my heart out.” In Delhi 2010, Gicharu defeated Oteng Oteng but lost to local boy Suranjoy Mayengbam in the final. At the 2014 Commonwealth Games, he competed in the bantamweight division, losing to England’s Qais Ashfaq in the semi-final. Born and brought up in Mukuru Kwa Njenga informal settlements, Gicharu has dominated the bantamweight class in the country alongside his Nick Okoth (lightweight) and Elly Ajowi (heavy). Gicharu joined amateur ranks in Mukuru Kwa Njenga so as to hone his skills but later relocated to Qatar through an agent who had secured him employment in the rich Arab state. “I stayed in Qatar for only one year and came back home. I didn’t renew my contract as I found life in the Arab country not so rosy. Foreigners went through a lot of mistreatment and that was not the life I wanted for myself,” he sums up his short stay in the Arab nation. In 2006, a year after finishing high school, Gicharu was recruited in the National Police Service and currently works in the General Service Unit. Click here for the latest political news
