Police have arrested 40 street urchins in connection with an incident where a woman's rape ordeal was videotaped in Nairobi's Kirinyaga Road. Nairobi Central OCPD Robinson Thuku said the woman in question is a drug addict and is known to some of her attackers. "The street urchins identified the man who committed the act. They have informed us that the lady is a drug addict and is known to
them," Thuku said. The police boss said they are looking the woman, said to be frequenting the streets, to record a statement over the incident. He said that the man involved in the incidence may be charged with indecency even if the woman will not press charges. "We
want the lady to resurface and press charges or else we charge the man
with causing public nuisance," Thuku said. "We want her to show up and record a statement on what
really happened." He said that since the county law do not consider roaming a crime, those arrested will be charged with illegal dumping of garbage.

In the two and a half minute video, the woman attempts to resist but the men threaten to kill her. A street boy, identified as ‘Baite', is seen attacking the woman as she screams for help. "Help! I’m being raped," the woman screams. The incident followed in the wake of concerns of an uncontrolled proliferation of street children in Nairobi, a situation that raises crime fears. Nairobi county government's efforts to remove the children from the streets seems to have failed as their numbers have remained high.
