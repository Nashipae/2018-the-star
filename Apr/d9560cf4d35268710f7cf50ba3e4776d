Three people were charged on Tuesday with robbing a Nairobi businessman of property worth more than Sh9.7 million at gunpoint. Catherine Njoki alias Hot, Carlos Sande alias Kalonje and Eliud Mbuthia alias Mbush denied the charge before Milimani Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi. The prosecution said the three attacked Isnina Osman on March 29 at Royal Park estate in Lang'ata, Nairobi. The court heard that the attackers threatened to harm Osman.  They allegedly committed the offence with accomplices who were not in court. Officers from the Langata DCI office arrested Njoki, Sande and Mbuthia on Sunday following a tip-off. The crimes they have been charged with carry the death sentence. The three were each granted Sh1 million bond with the alternative of Sh300,000 cash bail. The case will be heard on May 3. Click here for the latest political news
