Busia is among 13 counties that qualify for funding from the national government, Governor Sospeter Ojaamong said on Saturday. Ojaamong said Busia has the second County Integrated Development Fund 2018-22 in place. It is a statutory requirement that every five years there must be a CIDP developed by counties to guide the development programme of counties. The governor said the county will continue with its development programmes following the swearing in of 10 executives. He spoke at the burial of County Secretary Nicholas Mulaku’s mother, Julia Ong’ango, at Mungatsi in Nambale. Ojaamong said the task of delivering services to county residents now rests on his new team. “I don’t want residents to blame me when the executives fail to deliver. You have the right to protest to their offices and lock them out if you fail to get satisfactory services,” the governor said. Mourners eulogised Ong’ango as an active church member, generous and selfless. Some of the executives present were John Mwami (Education) and Moses Osia (Agriculture).
