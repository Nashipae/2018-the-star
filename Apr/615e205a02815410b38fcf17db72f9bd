Meru Deputy Governor Titus Ntochiu has denied there are wrangles between the executive and ward representatives. “There are no fights. We are open and consult among ourselves. There should be no panic or cause for alarm,” he said at the assembly on Wednesday. This comes days after MCAs passed amendments in the budget’s fiscal strategy paper. Last week on Thursday, ward reps passed major amendments in the county’s Sh10.1 billion budget for 2018-19. They deducted Sh91 million from the office of the governor. MCAs also removed Sh176 million allocated to the Finance department and Sh10 million from the Public Service and the Environment dockets. The reps scrapped a Sh101.4 million tender to Meru Dairy Union. This threw Governor Kiraitu Murungi's flagship free milk programme in doubt. In a letter to speaker Joseph Kaberia dated April 23, after MCAs made the changes, Kiraitu urged them to reconsider their decision on the fiscal strategy paper for 2018-2019. Kaberia, who read the letter to MCAs on Wednesday, said the governor was unhappy with the slashing of some funds including the money given to his office. "The money slashed will affect many functions such as maintenance, travel, advertising and communication. A free milk programme for ECDE learners was introduced to eradicate malnutrition," part of the letter read. However, the MCAs later passed the Fiscal Strategy paper for 2018- 2019 on Wednesday afternoon without the ammendments they had made on Thursday last week. “Budget is critical it is really not an events it is in that process we tried to come up with an agreement and they can admit that we clarified and explained so that we can come up with win win situation, “he said.
