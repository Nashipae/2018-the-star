MP Shah Hospital was unapologetic after slapping a family with a bill of about Sh860,000 for a patient who died 12 hours after admission. This led to public outcry, with activist Boniface Mwangi posting about the issue on his Facebook page on Saturday. Mwangi said patient Matilda Anyango was stabbed by thugs in Kangemi Slums, Nairobi, on the night of April 11. Anyango was taken to the hospital at about 9.30 m and died the following day at 10am. "MP Shah is demanding Sh858,355 from her very poor family. They have refused to release the body for burial," he said. In a statement on Facebook, the hospital explained that: "As with protocol, in which every patient has the right to emergency treatment and due to her critical condition, she underwent emergency surgery by a multi-disciplinary team of surgeons. "The patient was in a critical state and needed life support in our Intensive Care Unit." MP Shah further explained that bills are not dictated by periods of admission but by the extent and complexity of medical procedures. The hospital said it issued the family a breakdown of the bill.
