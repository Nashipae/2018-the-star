The social media has been buzzing with
reports of explosions in the area of the standard gauge railway that is
currently being built through the park. It has been mentioned that loud
explosive bangs, resulting in underground vibrations, have been occurring at
night. Effective from February 23, the SGR
construction team illegally moved into the Nairobi National Park on the Eastern
boundary to start work on the almost 200 concrete tower blocks, which will
eventually span the width of the park. It should be noted that the SGR construction
is also simultaneously ongoing on the Western boundary of the park. The ongoing construction activities are
having a traumatic effect on the wildlife in the park.Â  Many species, including lions, are
territorial by nature. Recent lion activity, including serious fighting
resulting in deaths, suggests that lions that used to dominate the area where
the SGR construction is ongoing have been territorially displaced, with the
consequence of having to fight with other lions as they move into other
territory. Naturally, it is good to see any nation improve and upgrade their
infrastructure, but not when a gazetted national park is chopped in half by a
railway line. The park is internationally renowned as
a unique place where a wide range of wildlife lives in close proximity to the
Nairobi mega city of more than 5 million people. In the year 2046, the 100th
year of the Nairobi National Park, would it be a moment of great celebration,
or merely a sober moment of reflecting on the sad lost past? God has put many wonderful treasures on this earth, and the Nairobi park
is a priceless one that needs to be kept for future generations. We cannot replace what has already been destroyed.
