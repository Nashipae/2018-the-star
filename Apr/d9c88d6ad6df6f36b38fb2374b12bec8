Kenya is likely to benefit from a fund set up by the World Health Organization in case of health-related emergencies. The WHO has raised Sh2.3 billion through donations from more than 11 countries. The fund tackles disease outbreaks and humanitarian health crises — mostly in the developing countries. This year, the WHO has set a target of Sh10 billion, the highest since the fund was established in 2015. Last year, Kenya received Sh30 million to stop a cholera outbreak in 12 counties, including refugee camps. “The outbreaks were a particular cause for concern because of the high population density of the affected areas, their proximity to neighbouring countries, and the fact that the majority of cases occurred among infants and women,” the WHO said. Response to emergencies is usually the responsibility of the Health ministries in the affected countries with the help of international organisations such as the WHO. “By acting decisively and quickly, we can stop disease outbreaks and save thousands of lives for a fraction of the cost of a late response,” WHO’s Dr Peter Salama said.
