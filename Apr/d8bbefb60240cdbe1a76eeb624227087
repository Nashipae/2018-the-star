The Aga Khan Foundation yesterday handed over Sh3.5 million equipment to the Garissa vocational training centre. The equipment — including sewing machines, fabric, electrical and beauty therapy products — were received on behalf of the institution by area deputy Abdi Dagane. Hasma Awadh of the Aga Khan Foundation said the equipment were purchased by funds they received from the EU. She said the three-year project will improve the socio-economic opportunities for youth in Northern Kenya. Dagane said youth enrolment to the centre was still low despite the county’s support. The government set aside more than Sh2 billion for the 47 counties. It will fund student capitation of Sh15,000 each for tuition, training materials, skills completion and co-curricular activities.
