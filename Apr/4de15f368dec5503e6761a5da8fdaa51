The Kenya Forest Service has defended the eviction of the Ogiek community from the Sabor section of Kaptagat Forest. North Rift acting KFS commander David Rono said yesterday the indigenous community was evicted in a humane manner. The KFS is rehabilitating the forest. At least 14 Ogiek houses were destroyed. On Wednesday last week, the service extended evictions from other forests — Elgeyo Marakwet and Embobut, where the Sengwer community lives. Kaptagat is one of the forests declared as water towers by Environment CS Keriako Tobiko. Rono said the communities were notified before the evictions started. Ogiek spokesman Daniel Kimalel said they moved out of their own volition once they got the notice, to avert confrontation with government officials. "We have decided to move to our relatives’ homes. Some of our members were lucky to have secured land outside the forest. We have agreed to rebuild our lives outside the forest,” he said. Some families said, however, that they have nowhere to go. They appealed for help. Rono said they talked with the families on the need to conserve forests and the community agreed to move out. "It was unfortunate some houses were burnt, but we’re happy the families moved out and agreed to partner with us to conserve the forests,” he said. Rono said conservation efforts are ongoing and they will ensure no logging takes place until the moratorium imposed by the government lapses.
