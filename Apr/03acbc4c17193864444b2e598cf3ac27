Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture members touring Uasin Gishu county yesterday got a hostile reception from angry farmers at the National Cereals and Produce Board Eldoret depot. The team was headed by Kwanza MP Ferdinand Wanyonyi. The members had a hard time talking to the farmers who demanded subsidised fertiliser. The farmers also want the more than Sh4 billion payment for maize delivered. The lawmakers had to hold an emergency meeting at the NCPB boardroom in Eldoret town. Those in attendance included NCPB top officials, Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and farmers’ representatives. As soon as Mandago started introducing the members, the farmers started chanting ‘mbolea’ (fertiliser) and ‘pesa’ (money). The farmers representatives said they will not listen to false promises. As soon as they calmed down, Mandago handed over the meeting to Kwanza MP Ferdinand Wanyonyi, who was leading the delegation. “These farmers are frustrated. They want nothing but solutions on the problems bedeviling agriculture. Majority of them, including me, have not yet planted maize due to the acute shortage of subsidised farm input,” the governor said. Mandago said he is concerned that none of the promises Agriculture Cabinet Mwangi Kiunjuri made to the farmers when he toured the region last month has been fulfilled. The team on a two-day tour includes Matungu MP Justus Murunga, his Turbo constituency counterpart Janet Sitienei and Moiben’s Silas Tiren. Addressing the farmers, Wanyonyi said he sympathises with them and that the team will come up with measures to solve their problems. He promised that Parliament will pass lawsto ensure the National Cereals and Produce Board will be allowed to import fertiliser starting next year. Wanyonyi said the members will eradicate cartels that hurt the distribution of subsidised fertiliser to genuine farmers.
