At least 17 people died and 43 were injured yesterday when the bus they were travelling in plunged into Siyapei river on the Narok-Mai Mahiu road. The driver of the 62-seater Daima Connection bus heading to Nairobi from Kendu Bay lost control of the vehicle when trying to avoid a trailer. Narok county commissioner George Natembeya led the rescue efforts accompanied by Red Cross officials. He said among the injured passengers, four are in critical condition. A witness said the worst-affected were passengers seated at the front. Natembeya said the trailer was being used for the SGR project along with lorries. "One of the ladies who was coordinating the lorries so as not to hit oncoming vehicles gave the signal too late," he said. Natembeya said this made the bus driver plunge off the road to avoid hitting the lorry and the woman. NOTORIOUS Residents gathered at the scene and tried to save the trapped passengers. Some watched in shock while others took to their phones to take pictures and videos. A breakdown truck was seen trying to pull the yellow, blue and red bus from the river as some residents screamt. By the time of going to press, the bus was still in the river. The accident took place four kilometres from Narok towards Mai Mahiu, an area notorious for grisly accidents. In January, two brothers died after the motorcycle they were riding in rammed into a trailer on the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road. The teenagers were on their way to Longonot from Mai Mahiu trading centre when the accident occurred. CAVES IN The Mai Mahiu road also recently caved in making motorists fear using it.
