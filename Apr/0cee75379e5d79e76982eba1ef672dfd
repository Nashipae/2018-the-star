Civil society groups yesterday asked opposition leader Raila Odinga to abandon his agreement with President Uhuru Kenyatta because of Jubilee’s violation of human rights. Voicing concern over the deal signed on March 9, the social justice activists warned that such a pact makes no sense if the ruling party continues with its “well-trodden path of dictatorship, disregard of the rule of law and impunity.” Instead, they want Raila to cobble an alliance with civil society as the only viable option of continuing the struggle for reforms. “As such, the Civil Society Refernce Group calls on the former Prime Minister to tread carefully and not to hesitate to abandon the agreement altogether,” said the statement signed by CSRG presiding convener Suba Churchill. He warned they don’t support the Uhuru-Raila deal unless it respects human rights, fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and independence of the Judiciary. “The Civil Society will not support the agreement signed as it cannot lead to greater respect for human rights ... let alone uniting the country,” Churchill said. In a raft of demands to the President and Raila, the civil society groups called for the inclusion of the implementation of the Public Benefit Organisations Act as part of the agenda. For them to rally behind the deal, the groups said the government must commit to create an enabling environment for the sector as it has done for other actors.
