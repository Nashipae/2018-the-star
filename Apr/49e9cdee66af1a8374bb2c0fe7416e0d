Devolution PS Nelson Marwa (pictured)  has said the government has launched a crackdown on cartels in the ministry. Marwa said taxpayers’ money was being stolen by cartels through disaster response programmes. “There is a lot of misapplication of public funds in disaster management by cartels in the ministry which must stop. I don’t work in an environment where cartels are in control,” he said. He said cartels were profiteering from management of disasters such as floods and famine. “We wonder why when there is a disaster and relief food is required, the supplier must be from Nairobi.”  Click here for the latest political news
