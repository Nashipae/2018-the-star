Titus Musila Katitu, the popular Githurai cop accused of murdering a 27-year-old man, was on Thursday jailed for 15 years. Justice James Wakiaga said the former police officer will serve 12 years in custody and three years in probation. He also directed the four years he has been in court be considered. This means Katitu, 45, will serve about eight years since he was taken to court in 2014. The former cop and Githurai residents had pleaded with the judge to hand him a non-custodial sentence.

"The sentence will serve as a stern warning and a deterrence to other police officers for unlawful use of firearm." Katitu of the famous Katitu Boys Band shot Kimani at Githurai bus stage on March 14, 2013. He was taken to court a year later. Justice Wakiaga said that Kimani, much as people alleged he was a notorious robber, did not deserve to die the way he did. "The officer should have protected the suspect by arresting him if it was true that he was a robber," the judge said. The judge said the case raised sensitive issues on the popularity of the former officer, and the public attitude towards criminals. He added that the case had also attracted media attention and had nothing to do with Katitu's popularity. "The trial was not about the popularity of Katitu or whether the person he shot was a well-known robber or whether he killed the victim's brother but about the unlawful use of a firearm." The judge said the policeman should have identified himself and given a clear warning before proceeding with the action he took. Justice Wakiaga said an officer has no right to take the life of a suspect unless under circumstances provided for in the law.
