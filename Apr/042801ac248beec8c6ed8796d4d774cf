More than 300 residents of Syokimau in Athi River yesterday demonstrated against an investor over a land row. They marched to the deputy county commissioner David Juma’s office and demanded that the investor be evicted “from their ancestral land”. Protesters turned rowdy when they spotted a representative of Zum Zum Investment Limited Company Abdul Saleh. The firm is claiming ownership of thedisputed 27 acres. Baying for Saleh’s blood, the protesters tried to forcibly enter into the compound. However, they were repulsed by heavily armed police officers guarding thepremises. Waving placards, they camped at the gate and hurled insults at the investor. The protesters and the investor both claim they have authentic documents for the controversial land. Saleh said Zum Zum legally acquired the piece of land, which residents claim belongs to their ancestors. The people saying they are the legitimate land owners belong to a cartel of grabbers who invade people’s property in Athi River, he said. “These demonstrators have been hired. They don’t own any land. Their spokesman claims he is a human rights activist fighting for the rights,” Saleh said. A shaken Saleh remained at the administration block until the demonstrators left for fear of being attacked. Athi River subcounty security committee chaired by Juma held a closed door meeting with the warring parties for more than six hours. The committee first met the them separately and later had a meeting with both sides. Juma said the committee resolved that each of the groups provides their documents for the contested land. The Director of Criminal Investigations will investigate the authenticity of the land documents and the committee will give its report within two weeks, he said.
