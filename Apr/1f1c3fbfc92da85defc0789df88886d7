More than 8,000 families have been displaced by the current floods in Bura and Galole constituencies, Tana River County as the rains continue to pound several parts of the country. According to County Red Cross coordinator Gerald Bombe, the number of the victims could rise to over 15,000 after the metrological department announced that the current rains may continue into early weeks of May. Bombe said the most affected areas included Boka with 300 families, Asako with 350, Koromanatha villages where houses were swept away. Over 300 families in Mulanjo, Adama and Madogo are affected. Anole A and B recorded 110 families while Mororo recorded the highest number of 2,500 families. The coordinator said already reports were coming from areas such as mnazini in Garsen constituency where farms have been flooded and so far 3 have been reported dead. He said they have rescued at least 38 people using motor boats who were marooned by water in Bura and Nanighi. Due to the state of the roads, Bombe said it is almost impossible to reach to those in the interior parts of the county but Red Cross was working closely with the county government to get a quick solution to the crisis. Area MP Ali Wario who visited the displaced families last evening appealed to the aid agencies to move with speed and assist the affected families with the humanitarian support among them clean, safe drinking water, tents and drugs. Wario said the victims were at risk of contracting waterborne diseases due to poor sanitation in the makeshift camps and called on the public health to provide necessary drugs to avoid loss of lives. He said areas where the temporary camps have been set up is the same place several people were admitted after being diagnosed with cholera.
