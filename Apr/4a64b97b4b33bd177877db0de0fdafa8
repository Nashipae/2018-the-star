Human rights groups have raised alarm over the increasing cases of defilement in Kisumu. Transform Empowerment for Action Initiative and Haki Africa said they had received 1,208 cases of defilement over the last seven months alone. Five disabled children were among the victims. Team leader Maureen Kemunto said gangs terorising residents and police failure to take prompt action have contributed to the rise in defilement cases. "Identification of the culprits, lack of confidentiality in handling cases, loss of files and poor response to distress calls have hindered the fight against the menace," Kemunto said. They called on police to strengthen security. “We have lost many lives and a lot of property due to insecurity. We want relevant authorities to look into the matter," she said. Of the 747 recorded cases of crime, 299 were robberies,
189 burglaries, 98 homicides, 61 assaults and 177 listed under possession of dangerous weapons. HAKI Africa's rapid response officer Francis Auma demanded compensation for those killed and injured by police. At least 37 people were killed between August and November as police and protesters clashed during last year's elections. Auma
said many residents have also fallen victims to corrupt officers who do not care
about the rights of citizens. “We
want action to be taken against such officers. Police bosses should be transferred if possible," Auma said. The groups called on the Parliamentary committee on security to tour the county to ascertain the effects of insecurity.
