The Fall armyworm menace may not end anytime soon, experts warned on Tuesday. This dashed Kenya’s hopes for food and nutrition security, as the pest also attacks other crops. Regina Eddy, Policy and Engagement coordinator, Fall Armyworm Task Force, USAID Bureau of Food Security, said the pest poses a serious threat to food security, income and nutrition. “The eggs and moth of Fall armyworm will be there for the rest of the year. They will go to reproductive cycle, feeding on crops, thereby damaging and lowering the yield,” she said. The worm has a voracious appetite and not only feeds on maize, Kenya’s staple food, but also rice, sorghum and sugarcane, among 80 other types of crop. It also reproduces and spreads fast. Eddy spoke from Washington, DC, during a video press conference in which she fielded question from African journalists. She said it is highly anticipated the pest will continue to spread rapidly as the current conditions allow it to thrive. Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation director general Eliud Kireger said, “We do not see a lot [of them] now but the pests are still there. We have them in Nandi, Bomet and Kitale, among other places.” He said a document on managing armyworms is being developed. “We have identified the chemicals and we are editing the document, which will be ready in a week. It will show how to spray and which chemicals to use,” Kireger said. He said GMO maize has proven to be resistant to the pest, but the government has not lifted the ban. Agriculture experts estimate the pest has caused over $13 billion (Sh1.3 trillion) in crop losses across Africa. It was found in at least 38 countries across sub-Saharan Africa in the past year.
