Chepkube traders in Bungoma have protested their eviction from a road reserve, demanding that they be given an alternative market before they move. The Kenya National Highways Authority on Tuesday directed the traders to vacate the reserves along the Mumias-Bungoma road in 30 days. The agency wants to expand the road. Speaking to reporters yesterday, the traders said they will not leave. They also refused to pay taxes to the county government, saying they will only do so after an alternative site is found. “How can the county government demand levies yet they are not ready to provide an alternative market for us,” the traders chairperson, Benard Makokha said. They will invade adjacent idle land if they are forcefully evicted. The plot belongs to a prominent businessman. They accused Governor Wycliffe Wangamati of fake promises, saying he had not secured an alternative market despite promising to do so. The county advised the traders to relocate to a parcel near Muteremko cattle ring. The traders declined, saying the area is remote. “We won’t get customers there,” Makokha said. Finding an alternative market for Chepkube roadside hawkers has been a political campaigns issue during election.
