People suspected to be hired goons illegally evicted Nakumatt Lifestyle from NSSF's Hazina Trade Centre in Nairobi on Saturday night. The National Social Security Fund says the collapsed supermarkets chain owes it Sh73 million in rent arrears. A crowd arrived at the Nakumatt store in the building at about 11pm, removed all items from the shelves and placed them outside. In December last year, NSSF evicted Nakumatt from the centre over rent arrears for four months. The pensions body shut Nakumatt Lifestyle and clamped the retailer's vehicles after obtaining a court order.

The administration orders are to accelerate and complement recovery efforts and oversee the restocking of key branches in partnership with key suppliers. The ruling by Justice Fred Ochieng's was a big win for Nakumatt Holdings creditors. Ochieng is presiding over a suit filed by 100 creditors seeking to liquidate Nakumatt for failure to pay them over Sh4.5 billion. He will rule on the chain's liquidation or revival. For over 18 months, Nakumatt has faced financial burdens with an amounting debt of over Sh36 billion which has forced it to close tens of its branches in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Its troubles have caused it to be on top of country economic storms, with stories been told by empty shelves, wrangled employees and devastated suppliers across its previous 66 branches.
