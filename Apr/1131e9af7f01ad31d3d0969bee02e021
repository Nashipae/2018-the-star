Two people were killed in Homa Bay after a quarry they were excavating caved in on Friday evening. Tilen Omondi, 17, and Peter Ochieng', 24, died after they were buried in the quarry at Oywer village, Rachuonyo North constituency. They were excavating stones at the time of the accident. Villagers said the soils in the area are loose due to heavy rains. Area assistant chief Israel Amadi said the bodies were removed by residents on Saturday. "Stone mining is the areas' main economic activity," Amadi said adding that one of the victims is a student who was out looking for fees and money for upkeep. "Tilen went to look for money for his upkeep because he is an orphan," he added. Amadi told residents to be cautious and avoid going into quarry pits during rains. "We donâ€™t want to lose more lives unnecessarily," the chief said. Their bodies were taken to the Homa Bay county referral hospital mortuary. Click here for the latest political news
