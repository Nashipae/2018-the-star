City Hall has blamed shortage of staff for the return of hawkers into the city centre. The unruly vendors have flocked back into city streets barely two months after a much-publicised police crackdown. Sources told the Star the county withdrew a Sh6.2 million provision for police vehicle's fuel and officers' meals and allowances making the crackdown unsustainable. "We're having a shortage of staff. That has affected our daily operations," operations chief officer Peter Mbaya said yesterday. Mbaya said the crackdown will continue despite the challenges. Shortage of staff identified as main challenge facing the County Inspectorate Department despite the daily operations within the city. It has been noted that the unruly hawkers and street families have sneaked their way back to the city centre during the week. "We are having shortage of staff which has led to a set back in our daily operations," said Mbaya City-county operations Chief Officer, Peter Mbaya. Mbaya told the Star yesterday , that the officers will continue the operation regardless of the obstacle. The county is set to employ 1,000 askaris following last month's recruitment exercise at Kasarani Stadium. More than 10,000 candidates participated. Mbaya said he will meet Governor Mike Sonko next week to strategise on the hawkers menace.
