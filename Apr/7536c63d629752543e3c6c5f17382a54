The Luo Council of Elders has been faulted for blaming self- styled NRM ‘General’ Miguna Miguna for woes that befell him leading to his deportation. John Bens, the council’s Migori chairman and leader of Migori Young Entrepreneurs criticised council chairman Willis Otondi. He said Otondi’s statement last week lacked wisdom. “What Otondi said about our son Miguna as our chairman, is not binding. It is in bad faith,” Bens said. Miguna is from Kano in Kisumu , his heritage and home can be traced. For the council to make such a statement when he needed it most is unfortunate, Bens said. “As a community, we want our son back in the country,” Bens said in Rongo town. Last week the council criticised Miguna Miguna and blamed him for his woes at the JKIA.
