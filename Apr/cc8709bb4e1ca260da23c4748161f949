Kenya has not encroached on Somalia’s border, Northeastern regional commissioner Mohamud Saleh has said. This follows encroachment claims from Somali quarters. Speaking to the Star on the phone on Saturday, Saleh described the allegations as propaganda, adding Somalis have put up structures on the Kenya side. He was reacting to the government’s move to temporarily halt the construction of a border wall to give room for talks amid rising tension in Mandera town and Bulahawa in Somalia. The dispute led to 64 houses being earmarked for demolition to pave way for the border wall construction. Saleh last week held a meeting with Jubaland state and Kenyan delegations and it was agreed to suspend the exercise for three weeks to allow for negotiations. “In the meantime, the contractor has been asked to stop work,” he said.  PROPAGANDA Residents of the two countries have built permanent structures on no man’s land. Saleh said, “There is a lot of negative propaganda, particularly on the Somalia side with respect to the border security programme, but we are here to confirm all that is false.” He said the Somali side has been made to believe the building of a wall would lead to their eviction and the demolition of their houses. Mandera Governor Ali Roba said consultations have been going on for two-and-a-half years. Construction has been slow since the commencement in 2015. Locals have been involved at every stage. Last week, Roba and his Gedo counterpart Mohamed Mohamed from Somalia toured Mandera and Bulahawa . They said talks will be held.
