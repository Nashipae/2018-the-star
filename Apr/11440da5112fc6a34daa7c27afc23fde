Kenyatta University and Impala Club clash in a mid-week Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) men’s Super League clash as they launch their title campaign at the City Park Stadium. This will be the first match for both teams this season. KU were relegated to Super League this season from the Premier League, where they placed 13th out of 15 teams last season. On the other hand, Impala were elevated to the league after placing third in the National League Pool ‘A’. KU coach Moses Kagochi is cautious going into today’s match. He said Impala are a good team and the fact that they will all be seeking to start the season with a win, should make the match interesting. “We are both from different leagues. However, I have watched Impala play and they are not a pushovers. However, we are keen to convert all our chances and hopefully, we will carry the day,” said Kagochi. “We are fresh from participating in the just concluded Kenya University Sports Association games and although we didn’t go past group stages, we picked vital lessons that will come in handy in tomorrow’s (today) match and the season in general. Our objective is to make it to the Premier League at the end of the season.” Kagochi at the same time regretted the exit of forward Lawrence Makhata who joined United States University International Africa (USIU-A) and midfielder Oliver Chilloti, who is now at Wazalendo but was quick to note that they have able replacements.
