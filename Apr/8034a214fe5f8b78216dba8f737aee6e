The Luhya will still be used and dumped, even if they unite, unless they come up with strategies on how to get allies to back their power agenda, UDP leader Cyrus Jirongo said yesterday. Jirongo said he will restore the community's lost glory soon. “I have taken a sabbatical leave to think over the community leadership and I will be giving the way forward when I return soon,” he told the Star on the phone. Jirongo said the community has numerical strength and is supposed to give Kenya the political way forward, but it has always been misused and ignored. Jirongo ran for President on the August 8 and October 26 polls on the UDP ticket. ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang’ula have hinted at merging their parties in readiness for the 2022 General Election. But Jirongo said merging the parties will not be the solution. “We have been talking about the Luhyas uniting for decades and nothing has happened. We must change our approach and engage friends who can help us gain power,” he said. "If by merging their parties they will unite, I wish them the best. Right now everyone is consolidating their bases."
