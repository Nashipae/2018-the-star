A case in which 25 KRA and KPA employees are accused of colluding with clearing agents to irregularly release containers finally kicked off in Mombasa yesterday. The case, in which KRA claims to have lost Sh106 million in revenue, kicked off after a two-year delay. The suspects face charges of misuse of office and failure to deactivate the password of a former employee. The password is believed to have been used to irregularly clear the 124 containers. KPA officer in charge of electronic data Benjamin Mwawuda told Mombasa senior magistrate Francis Kiambia the containers were cleared using details of Florence Langat who had resigned months earlier. Hearing continues today.
