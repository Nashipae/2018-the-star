Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi has said he will unseat Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu in 2022. He described Ngilu as “a chameleon for associating herself with people who supported Jubilee in the election”.  On Wednesday, Ngilu toured Mwingi Central constituency but was interrupted by angry youths who wanted two Jubilee supporters in the meeting to leave. The youths demanded to know why MP Mulyungi was not invited. “I’m disappointed in Ngilu, because she did not invite me when launching projects in my constituency. She invited my opponents who supported Jubilee,” he said on Saturday.  Click here for the latest political news
