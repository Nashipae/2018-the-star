A virtual reality film shot in Samburu county will be released worldwide in seven languages on April 30. My Africa had a successful run at the prestigious annual Tribeca Film Festival Virtual Arcade on Friday in New York. The film, narrated by actress Lupita Nyong’o, transports viewers to the Reteti Elephant Sanctuary, the first elephant orphanage in Africa owned and operated by the local Samburu community inside the Namunyak Wildlife Conservancy. Conservation International said the film seeks to reignite the traditional bonds that have enabled them to coexist harmoniously with wildlife for long. Directed by four-time Emmy award winner David Allen, the film presents a gripping experience of the community’s delicate and unique work of caring for rescued baby elephants orphaned by poachers, left behind by their herds or injured in accidents such as falling into wells. The animals are released back into the wild as soon as they are able to survive on their own. In the movie, a young Samburu woman called Naltwasha Leripe tells viewers about her people’s daily life, which includes tending livestock and digging wells deep into dry riverbanks. “This film shows a new way, one that unites rather than divides people from wildlife. Today, conservation is not about building fences but rather breaking down barriers, so that local communities benefit when nature thrives,” project executive producer and Conservation International CEO M Sanjayan says.
