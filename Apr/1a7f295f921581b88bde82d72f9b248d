Stigma is a major threat to the management of HIV and Aids, a counsellor has said. Sister Anne Nekoye of the Ruambwa Subcounty Health Centre on Wednesday said the majority of patients do not seek medical attention when ill to avoid undergoing HIV and Aids tests. “The majority suffer in silence instead of visiting voluntary counselling and testing centres,” she said. Nekoye provides trauma, HIV and Aids counselling to patients before and after testing. Nekoye, the chairperson of Vihiga-based CBO Kenyan On Networking Counselling, Training and Advancement - said people with HIV should not lose hope. “I want to encourage people to stop stigmatising and visit VCT centres so they can know their status and be put on antiretroviral drugs should they test positive,” she said.
