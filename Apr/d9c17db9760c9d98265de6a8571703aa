Read; 518 set for interviews after KDF recruitment It turned out KDF was recruiting. Those who turned up are part of the 3,000 staff allegedly forcibly given military training at the NYS College in Gilgil between 1996 and 1997. A serviceman from Lamu said they were trained to use the general-purpose machine gun, grenade launchers and G3 assault rifles. “Here I am with full military training, better trained than most police officers, but with nothing to do because I have been denied a job. If you hear people going to Somalia or taking up jobs with terrorists don’t ask why. Because no one will sleep hungry yet they have skills that can change their situations.” Their discharge certificates indicated they underwent eight months basic paramilitary training and a five months military training comprising of weaponry, parades, range, field craft, jungle tactics, and arms drill at the college. Those sent away included a hopeful from Kiambu county who served with US Marines in Afghanistan and Iraq after leaving NYS in 2000 "We came here for NIS recruitment only to find KDF. If we knew it was KDF we won't have come because we know of corruption in their recruitment. The advert only said the qualification is D-plain in KCSE, national ID and the NYS discharge certificate. But we are checked for teeth and scars," he said. They alleged massive corruption claiming most of those enlisted offered Sh40, 000 bribes.  Click here for the latest political news
