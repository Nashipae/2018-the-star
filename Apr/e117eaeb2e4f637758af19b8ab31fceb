Tigoi Girls hockey team came from a goal down to beat Nyamira 2-1 and book a semi-final date with Keruguya Girls at the ongoing Term One Games at Kangaru High School today. Both teams, who were drawn in Pool ‘B’, had played to a barren draw in the first half, before Nyamira got the lead through Daughty Ranga in the 56th minute but their joy was short-lived as Joan Anjao sounded the boards a minute later to restore parity. Jemimah Kerubo then sealed the win for Tigoi in the dying seconds of the match to award the Western region representatives the crucial win. The other semi-final pits Nyamira against Trans Nzoia, who registered a 1-0 win against Kerugoya courtesy of Mercyline Andala’s 41st minute goal to top Pool ‘A.’ In the boys’ matches, Kisumu Day and Musingu High booked their semi-final slots after playing to a 1-1 draw. Roykin Omondi scored for Kisumu Day barely two minutes into play as hits and misses were the order of the day in the remaining minutes of the first half. On resumption, Musingu equalised through Job Wandero in the 53rd. Hosts Kangaru and Shimo La Tewa played to a barren draw, a fete that saw both teams bundled out of title contention. “The game was tough from the start but I am happy at least we pulled back an equaliser. We do not expect an easy game tomorrow (today). We will give it our best. We intend to start strongly and fight to the last whistle,” said Wandero. In rugby 15s, defending champions Kakamega High maintained their unbeaten run thanks to a 42-0 against Alliance to book a slot in the last four as St. Mary’s Yala defeated Miathene 18-0 to also reach the semis.
