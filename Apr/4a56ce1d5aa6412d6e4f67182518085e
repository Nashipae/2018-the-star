Limuru residents have asked Kiambu county to station firefighters in all trading centres to deal with frequent outbreaks. A fire on Friday destroyed business premises with goods valued at more than Sh2 million burnt. The residents want firefighters to be in every centre for quick response to the emergencies. "It takes a long time for firefighters to respond, leaving residents to suffer heavy losses that can be avoided," George Ndung'u said. The Friday fire destroyed a traders' store and a bar and a hotel in Ngarariga. “The county should conduct a research on the losses caused by fire outbreaks to fully understand what residents feel," Ndung'u said. Trader Onesmus Mukua said he lost equipment and stock valued at Sh900,000 in the fire. He said the fire could have been caused by an electric fault, given that it was preceded by a blackout. “The hotel caught fire when lights resumed. It was about 11pm when we heard people screaming," Mukua said. Area MCA Jacquie Nungari praised residents for braving the night to put out the fire with buckets of water. Firefighters arrived at the scene about an hour later and extinguished the inferno before it could spread further. “The people did their best despite their failure to salvage anything from the hotel and the store," Nungari said. The fire was the second outbreak in less than a month. The other was also caused by a suspected electric fault. “We shall discuss with Kenya Power to know what is happening. Residents now live in fear of blackouts because they precede fire outbreaks. W," Nungari said. Click here for the latest political news
