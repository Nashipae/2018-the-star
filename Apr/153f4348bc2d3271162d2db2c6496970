Budalang’i MP Raphael Wanjala has pleaded with former area MP Ababu Namwamba, now Foreign Affairs Chief Administrative Secretary, to give him space to serve residents.
He said he has no grudge with Namwamba but appealed to be given a conducive environment to serve constituents. Wanjala spoke in Port Victoria town on Monday.
He said he had taken a low profile when Namwamba was MP and gave him time to serve Budalang’i residents. “It is regrettable to note that former MP has declared war on me, instead of working with me for the good of residents. I urge him to let me do my work without interference, now that I’m the one holding the steering wheel,” Wanjala said.
He said the issue of Sigiri Bridge should not be used as a stepping stone to political supremacy, adding that the project will benefit everybody.
“The issue of who spearheaded construction of Sigiri Bridge should not cause rifts between us. At the end of the day, we will need one another,” the legislator said.
Last Friday violence erupted when Wanjala’s supporters allegedly attacked Namwamba. The two men, long-time rivals, nearly came to blows. Wanjala accused Ababu of interfering in his projects.
On Saturday, Wanjala was arrested in Kisumu. He was on Monday released on Sh400,000 cash bail.
