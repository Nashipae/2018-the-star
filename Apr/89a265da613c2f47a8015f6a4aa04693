Lamu Governor Fahim Twaha has sacked two executives in a cabinet reshuffle. Assembly speaker Abdul Kassim on Wednesday said he had received names of Paul Thairu and Anne Gathoni for vetting as the new executives for Agriculture and Health respectively. That means Florence Ndung’u and Raphael Munyua have been fired. Twaha has also sacked John Mburu as the budgeting chief officer and replaced him with Farida Abdullahi. Munyua’s sacking comes in the wake of constant demonstrations by health workers. Nurses accused him of arrogance and making illegitimate transfers. Abubakar Badawy was nominated the chief officer for medical services. Kassim said Twaha submitted the names for vetting on Tuesday.
