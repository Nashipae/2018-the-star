Just months after the bruising election, 2022 politics appear to have kicked off in earnest in Thika town. And it’s not pretty. On Monday, hired goons stormed an event organised by MP Patrick Wainaina, popularly known as Wajungle, at Matathia Primary School in Magogoni, Thika East. Residents said they were probably sent by a known political rival to disrupt the meeting. Armed with clubs, the youth who appeared drunk attacked residents who had come for the launch of a water project rehabilitated by the MP. The goons protested that the water project was not supposed to be commissioned by the MP since it was a devolved function. Residents argued the school borehole project was under the national government and their MP was right to rehabilitate it before handing it over to the Thika Water and Sewerage Company. Police officers led by Thika East boss Ali Mohammed moved in and averted a clash between the two groups, Two men wer arrested. “When will these politicians realise that all we need is development?” Magogoni resident, Mariam Wanjiru asked. “We don’t care who is responsible for which project. Our only concern is progress and they should know politics is over. It is too early to start politicking.” MP Wainaina condemned the attack, saying, “Some politicians are still suffering from electioneering hangover to the extent that they fighting development projects sponsored by perceived rivals.” The MP said Thika East has for a long time suffered from a water shortage. He said these projects will ease the burden on locals. “I am ready and willing to work with all leaders for better services to residents. Come 2022, the people will gauge every leader according to their work,” he said.
