Three people have gone missing after rain floods swept away their houses at Arsin village in Samburu North sub-county on Tuesday. Samburu Kenya Red Cross coordinator Maurice Onyango said they are working with the community to trace the missing people. He said on Wednesday that fifteen other households have also been directly affected by the ongoing floods. "We are doing a detailed assessment that will inform us on the level of effects of the floods at the village and possible response options," he said. He advised residents living in lowland areas to move to higher grounds in order to avoid loss of lives and property. The meteorological department has said that the rains will continue in most parts of the country throughout the week. An unknown number of livestock have also been swept away by the floods. The affected residents asked the county government to seek funding from the national government for construction of dams along River Baragoi. They said the construction of at least two dams will enable them harvest and preserve rain water for domestic use, irrigation, and watering livestock. Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe recently underscored the importance of preserving rain water for future use, especially in regions prone to prolonged dry spell. He said in Samburu that the national government will support the county government in the next financial year to construct water dams to harvest water for use during drought. Floodwaters from the rains experienced since March have left six people dead and property worth millions of shillings destroyed. This comes against the backdrop of concerns that the government, both national and counties, are ill-prepared to tackle the effects of floods.
