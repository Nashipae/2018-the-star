Kwale county commissioner Karuku Ngumo yesterday told Vidziyani residents they will not be evicted from a 42-acre plot. He said there is no court order, only a letter from National Land Commission chairman Muhammad Swazuri. Ngumo said, “Remain calm and maintain peace. Be sure the government will never forsake you.” He will meet leaders in a bid to find a lasting solution. Residents of Vidziyani and Nyumbani Kumi villages in Msambweni subcounty said they will resist eviction attempts by Kwale International Sugar Company, whether there is a court order or not. Some said they would rather die than leave the land.
