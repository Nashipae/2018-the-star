Kenya Simbas international Joshua Chisanga has signed an eight-month contract with Polish side, Orkan Sochaczew, a top flight side in Eastern Europe.
The move rules him out for the remainder of the Enterprise Cup starting with next weekend’s semi-final against holders KCB.
This will be Chisanga’s second professional stint after 18 months stint at Premiership club, Newcastle Falcons between 2016-2017
He had a dream start at the club, scoring two tries off identical catch and drive line outs hence leading Newcastle Falcons ‘A’ to win over Gloucester in Aviva  A-League match—a second tier platform. He is expected to depart the country this week and returns at the end of May, in time for the Kenya Simbas Rugby World Cup qualifiers against Morocco in June. Chisanga is delighted to try his luck in Europe again for the second time. “It will be nice to go back to Europe. I had a good time in England and I can’t wait to see how I progress in Eastern Europe,” he added.
