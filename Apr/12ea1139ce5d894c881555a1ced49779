The transport safety agency director general risks punishment for disobeying an order suspending the proposed curriculum for drivers training. An activist has filed an application at the High Court to have National Transport And Safety Authority’s Francis Meja committed to jail for six months for disregarding the order. Alternatively, Okiya Omtatah wants the court to fine Meja Sh200,000, which he says should be deducted directly from his salary. The proposed new curriculum for drivers’ training and testing was halted on March 28 last year by Justice George Odunga. The judge also suspended a public notice issued by the authority requiring all driving schools and PSV operators to be vetted. Odunga stopped the agency and the Ministry of Transport from disabling the e-Citizen password of driving schools, which Omtatah, in an application filed yesterday, said has been ignored. “Despite being duly served with orders and my subsequent letter of caution on April 12, the respondent has refused to comply,” the activist said. Omtatah said the refusal by the NTSA to obey a court order is in contempt and against administration of justice. “The rule of law stands to suffer irreparable harm and damage unless the application is heard and determined,” the activist said. Suspending the curriculum, Odunga said no prejudice will be suffered if the orders are granted. The new curriculum was scheduled to start in October. Meja said the curriculum was necessitated by the increase in road accidents. More than 80 per cent of road crashes are attributed to human behaviour-related factors. In the proposed curriculum, driving school students are required to undergo between 24-160 hours of training, depending on the vehicle category. The new curriculum requires driving schools to have not less than 1.7 acres, where it must develop facilities and infrastructure of a model highway and a well-equipped ICT teaching aid classroom with computers and projectors.
