If you are all about the female ingenuity, this article is for you. Wangechi is back spitting bars, and we must be stoked about it right now. After a long layoff, supposedly, Wangechi is back and she’s got a new track out, called “Used to it”. More than ever, she is a force of female lyricism, giving yet another chase for the title of best rapper. Some background detail in case you need it: Last year, she dropped a debut EP, “Don’t Consume If Seal Is Broken”. A few months before that happened, in 2016, she scored an endorsement deal with East Africa Breweries. However, nothing much came out of it. All her efforts simply languished and not much was heard of her afterwards. Anyway, with particular focus on her work, it is a spectacular moment for women in rap. She epitomises a proper female rapper standing out in a male-dominated field. Her latest release indicates an artiste who has been hard at work, refining her craft. In 2016, while her rivals Femi and Njeri were busy trading off lyrical banters and tarnishing each other’s names for relevance, Wangechi remained focused on completing her EP. It was a genuinely significant thing to do, considering she had survived an accident where she lost her closest friend. She held a high level and refused to be pitied, providing her fans with an exceptional record. While it historically hasn’t been easy to be a successful woman in hip hop, Wangechi remains defiant. She has never really appeared to be reliant on anyone to be where she is. In fact, she has always brought her own, going toe-to-toe with all rappers, male and female. Her latest release might just be the break she’s been waiting for. She seems to be up to something big.
