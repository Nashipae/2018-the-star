A senior police officer and his brother died on Sunday night after their car was swept more than 300 meters down a fast flowing river in Makueni. The officer was identified as Diplomatic Police Unit Commandant Charles Mwau. Mwau was a senior officer of the rank of Commissioner of Police while his brother worked for private security firm SGA at the Safaricom headquarters. A police report sent to Vigilance House said they were traveling from Sultan Hamud to their home in Kasikeu village when the incident took place at River Kaluku, Mukaa sub-county. Villagers spotted the car that had been submerged after water subsided at about 1pm on Monday and called police. The bodies were retrieved and kept at Kasikeu Primary School until 4 pm when they were picked by a police helicopter and flown to Nairobi. “They underestimated the waters and were swept away as they crossed a drift,” County Commissioner Mohammed Maalim told the Star on phone today. Maalim cautioned residents against crossing rivers after heavy rains. “It is impossible for one to know the strength of moving water in a river, so I advise residents to be careful." Heavy rains pounded the area overnight resulting in floods that over-topped the bridge at Kitumbini.
