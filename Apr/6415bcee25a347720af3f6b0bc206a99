A Nairobi court has
suspended an order requiring Governor Mike Sonko’s government to pay Sh6.2 million to a law firm
that supplied it with printing materials. Chief magistrate Edna Nyaloti on Thursday set aside the orders obtained by Ondabu and Advocates Company after
Sonko told court they were wrongfully obtained. The orders had required
the county’s Cooperative Bank account, City Hall branch, to release the money to
the law firm. But Sonko told court the consent was entered without
the county’s approval. He also accused the law
firm for colluding with Borabu MP Ben Momanyi, the lawyer who was representing
the county in the matter between it and General Suppliers Ltd. General Suppliers Ltd had moved to court
demanding payment from the county, but on Monday, April 16, even before the
matter was resolved, Momanyi entered a consent with the law firm agreeing that
the county would pay Sh6,234,829 The magistrate has directed
parties to appear before her on April 25. Sonko accused the law
