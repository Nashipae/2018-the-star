Garissa county commissioner Joshua Chepchieng has advised residents living along the River Tana and flood prone areas to move to safer grounds. This follows a notification by KenGen yesterday of eminent excessive spillage from Kiambere Dam. According to the energy company, the heavy rains have resulted in a drastic rise of dam levels that has seen Kamburu, Gitaru, Kindaruma and Kiambere dams rise to their spillage levels. "Consequently, spilling of excess water is now taking place and we are kindly requesting that communities living near the banks of Tana River down stream of Kiambere be alarted of the impending increase in the river flow," the statement in part read. Addressing elders at Garissa Ndogo during the launch of the cash money transfer exercise for the elderly, Chepchieng asked the residents to heed to the advice and move to safer grounds. “We want to take this earliest opportunity to tell our people to move to safer grounds. We would not wish to have causalities as a result of this,” he said. The county commissioner said the government has already taken the initiative to have all those living along the river banks moved. Farmers Federation vice chair Dubat Amey however blamed KenGen for failing to warn thousand of farmers downstream saying that the end result was the farmers counting losses. He said KenGen had made it a habit of releasing water without informing them adding that the only lasting solution was by building a canal where the waters will be directed. "Year in year out farmers incur huge loses due to the actions of KenGen. For how long will we continue to suffer? Wlho will come to the rescue of the farmers?” Amey said. He said a multi-sectorial approach by both the county and national governments is required for long time solutions for the farmers.
