The Kirinyaga government has set aside Sh1.5 billion — equivalent to 37.5 per cent of its annual budget — for development, Finance executive Moses Maina has said.
He said the county in its budget has identified several flagship projects to spur development.
The county also has proposed Sh3 million for renovation of the Kerugoya County Referral Hospital to ensure it offers high quality services.
The county will set aside Sh400 million to construct a medical complex in Kerugoya County Hospital to increase bed capacity from 250 to 500. Maina said the proposal will be tabled before the cabinet before it is forwarded to the county assembly.
Farmers will also benefit after the county proposed Sh54 million to buy subsidised fertiliser. A further Sh6 million will be set aside to buy seeds for distribution to farmers.
Maina said the county will acquire fertiliser so farmers can buy at subsidised prices to increase yield and ensure food security.
Maina spoke to residents on Saturday in Baricho town, Ndia constituency, during a public participation meeting.
Youths, he said, will also win big in the budget after the county proposed to set aside Sh30 million to renovate the Kerugoya Moi Stadium to international standard.
Maina said the budget is people-centered and has been welcomed by residents.
