Residents of Kisii estate in Thika West subcounty have criticised a contractor they accuse of poor workmanship. The residents are against the manner in which Mwangaza Primary School-Munyu Road was carpeted. It has developed potholes and cracks in the first week after completion. Contractor Dennix Ltd worked on the 1km road in a month even though the project was scheduled to be completed by July. Locals are demanding an explanation from the Kenya Urban Roads Authority resident engineer who oversaw the road upgrade. They say the contractor swindled the governmentâ€™s millions of shillings for a road that will easily be washed away by heavy rains. They promised to block further construction work until their grievances are addressed.
