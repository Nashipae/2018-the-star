More than 3,000 people have been displaced by floods after River Tana burst its banks. The most affected villages are Chalaluma, Dide Waride, Moa, Nyongoro and Matabore, where homes were either flooded or swept away. Lamu deputy commissioner Louis Rono on Sunday said a joint team from the national government and Red Cross had been dispatched to assess the situation and ascertain the degree of destruction and food aid requirements. A total of 287 families are out in the cold after their homes were swept away in Chalaluma village, while 82 households in Moa village were affected. In Dide Waride, about 30 households were rendered homeless after their houses were submerged and later swept away yesterday. Roads are also impassable. The road from Chalaluma to Moa village is impassable and can only be accessed by boats or helicopter. Relief supplies and other humatarian aid will be distributed starting tomorrow. “The situation is worrying. The national government is making all necessary interventions to help, with the assistance of Red Cross. Supplies will come in on Tuesday,” Rono said. In Matabore, an isolated island between Moa in Lamu and Kipao, over 1,000 head of cattle have been stuck for more than a week in the island. The peasant farmers are worried their livestock might be swept away and have appealed to the Red Cross to rescue the animals.
