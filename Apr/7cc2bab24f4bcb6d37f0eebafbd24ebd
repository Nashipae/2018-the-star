The cereal and produce board has cleared lorries lining up to deliver maize at its Rift Valley depots. The National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) took in about 200 lorries of maize in the last two weeks. Hundreds of farmers withdrew their maize from the queues after the government failed to pay them as promised. The government owes farmers more than Sh5 billion for four million bags of maize delivered since December last year. Some of the farmers had signed government commitment forms, indicating that if allowed to deliver maize they will not demand for payment until after three months.
