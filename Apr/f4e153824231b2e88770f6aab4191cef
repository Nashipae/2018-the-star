Four Jamhuri High School students accused of assaulting and injuring their schoolmates were on Monday acquitted by a Nairobi court. This was after the complainants, Sayid Osman and Mohamed Idris, dropped the case against them. Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi ordered the release of Brian Oswago, Clinton Luvayo, David Kyalo, and Moses Otieno. Senior state counsel Solomon Naulikha said the complainants, who were present in court, have forgiven the accused persons. Osman and Idris told they court that they reached the decision in order to proceed with their learning without interference. The accused persons were booked for assaulting their schoolmates on January 23 at the Nairobi City Water offices on Murang’a Road. They denied the charges and were each released on personal bond of Sh20,000 pending the hearing of the case. Andayi had directed the parents to sign a guarantee to ensure the students appear in court for trial. The students had asked for leniency bond, saying they are candidates in form four. About 35 students at the school were injured during protests against alleged discrimination by the school administration.
