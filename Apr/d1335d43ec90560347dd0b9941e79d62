Kenya Power customers will not be able to buy prepaid tokens between 10 pm on Tuesday and 6 am Wednesday. The company says the service will be shut down to enable it to carry out a “minor maintenance exercise”. “To enhance our service delivery, we regularly undertake system maintenance. Following the recent improvements on our prepaid system, we have greatly enhanced the customer experience in purchase and delivery of prepaid tokens,” the firm said in a press statement on Tuesday.

Customers have been experiencing delays in purchasing prepaid tokens since mid April. On April 17, the system collapsed completely forcing the firm to apologize to customers via texts. “We are experiencing delays in prepaid tokens generation. You can buy tokens from our banking halls countrywide. Please bear with us as we resolve the issue,” read part of the text. The service was restored later in the day.
