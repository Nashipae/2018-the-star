Kenyans have only 10 days to give feedback on the impact of interest rate cap in their businesses and day to day life. Central Bank of Kenya announced, on its website, the April 30 deadline for giving comments, should be provided via email. President Uhuru Kenyatta said, on Tuesday during his Chatham House address in London, that there is need to relook at the interest rate cap law. He said that access to credit for small and medium enterprises dried up when the law came to effect. “We have learned our lessons and recognise the limitations of the law. We need to repeal it altogether or modify it to deal with the concerns that have been raised,” the President said. SMEs and individuals who spoke to Star on phone said the period given was too short as many Kenyans do not understand what they are giving feedback about. “I am not aware of the announcement, and this shows there is no goodwill from Central Bank on having the voice of ordinary citizens in this issue. There is need for Civic education on this matter,” Wandi Packaging founder James Ndicu said. He said at least two months should be given to the public to enable participation. Ndicu is a victim of the rate cap law, and believes he was denied credit by banks as they bought time to see if the government will review the cap. Phyna Okure, a fashion designer in the central business district, cried foul on the CBK deadline. She said that unless CBK does not want public participation on the issue then they should advertise appropriately for Kenyans to know how much time they have and how to give their input. Last month, the regulator said they intend to complete outstanding policy reviews not limited to that of interest rate caps by June this year. This means that two months from today the bank is likely to have made a conclusion on whether to abolish or modify the interest rate caps, a move set to see the cost of loans rise.
