Nairobi county Public Service Board has denied bribery claims in the appointment of city inspectorate officials and firefighters. The board has been accused soliciting huge amount of monies to process calling letters for the recruit constables. This followed reports that those interested in the jobs were asked for between Sh150,000 to
Sh200,000. There is also a claim that the jobs have been dished to people who are not residents of Nairobi county. Board chairman Philip Kungu denied the allegations saying the process of calling the officials is yet to begin. Speaking to the Star on Sunday, he defended the board by saying no letters have been issued to the effect of the appointments. "The recruitment process is still ongoing. We are still on the preliminary stages," Kungu said. He said the recruitment follows many processes adding the 10,000 people interviewed at Kasarani was just the fist stage of the job listing. Kungu further challenged those with evidence to take the matter to the police for investigations. "The bribery claims are nothing but mere rumours. We are strictly being guided by the law on the recruitment process." He said the claims are being peddled by malicious people who are
interested in tarnishing the reputation of the county government. Kungu said the recruitment is done in accordance with the County Government Act and Public Service Regulation. "The board is not doing anything outside the law," Kungu said. On March 15, 10,000 candidates were taken through an intensive recruitment exercise at Kasarani Stadium. Only 1,000 people will be hired for the jobs. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko had announced that the county is recruiting 800 constables and 200 firefighters. Click here for the latest political news
