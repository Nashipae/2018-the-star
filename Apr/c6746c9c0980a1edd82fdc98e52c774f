Eleven Kisii MCAs and two of their former colleagues yesterday dismissed Dagoretti North MP Simba Arati’s endorsement as the Kisii community spokesman. They told Arati to focus on serving his Dagoretti North constituents. Led by Kiogoro MCA Samuel Apoko, the politicians told the MP senior leaders such as Senator Sam Ongeri, Governor James Ongwae and his Nyamira counterpart John Nyagarama deserve the position. “Arati should stop taking the community for a ride,” Apoko said in Matunwa village during a funeral ceremony.
