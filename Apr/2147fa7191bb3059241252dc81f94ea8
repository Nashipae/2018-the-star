On Wednesday Raila Odinga called for a three-tier government with national, provincial and county layers. It would return to the Bomas draft which proposed 14 regional governments. But under today’s Constitution, vast power and responsibility have already been devolved down to the counties. Some functions would have to be transferred up again to the provinces. Devolution would be reversed. Kenya is struggling to pay for 47 county governments as well as the cost of national government. How could we afford to pay for 14 more provincial governments with all their governors, ministers and MCAs? All our taxes would be spent running government, instead of investing in development. Regional government would also create a new layer of bureaucracy that would complicate our lives. We should instead be stripping out layers of government from the existing system. For instance, why does the national government need to keep the parallel apparatus of county commissioners and administration? All that could be devolved to the counties with considerable cost savings.  Three-tier government — forget it!  Quote of the day: "We prefer self-government with danger to servitude in tranquility."
