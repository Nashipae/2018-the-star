A Nairobi court yesterday heard how officials at the NYS discovered entries made to the IFMIS system and were approved by former deputy director general Adan Harakhe without his knowledge. Testifying against 26 suspects charged in relation to the Sh791 million loss at the agency, Christopher Keter told the court Harakhe discovered five days later payments of about 800 million had been approved using his password. The discovery was made after Harakhe inquired about the approval of the funds on May 25, 2015. “Harakhe called me to enquire whether I had made any payments of about Sh800 million, I told him I was not aware but I said I will check through my colleagues,” the witness told chief magistrate Francis Andayi. He said he talked to his colleague Jared Nyandimu and they both checked from the system and discovered a request entry had been made on May 20 and approved the same day. “I went back to Harakhe and told him that he is the one who had approved the payment and he did not know about it. He said he was not the one,” the witness said. The computers showed the entry had been made by Regina Nyambura - one of the accused in the case - and approved by Harakhe. Among the suspects include former Devolution PS Peter Mangiti, former NYS director general Nelson Githinji and businessman Ben Gethi and Josephine Kabura.
