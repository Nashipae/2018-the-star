Kiambu police chiefs have been asked to do more to combat increasing crime. Director of the Department of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti yesterday told the officers to wake up. Kinoti, who summoned the DCI commanders for a dress down, expressed anger that some police officers were concealing crimes. Three months ago, criminals raided a farm owned by President Uhuru Kenyatta's uncle and stole goats and cattle. The animals were slaughtered and their mutton and beef taken to the market. The incident was reported at Juja police station. No arrests have been made. The theft is among issues raised by Kinoti during the closed door meeting that lasted five hours. Heads of the Flying Squad and the Special Crime Prevention Unit were in attendance. Sources said Kinoti was irked by revelations that officers were not reporting major crimes to their superiors. "Flying squad officers will be deployed to the area to deal with problems raised by the commanders," a source told the Star. The commanders were instructed to come up with action plans to deal with crime. It was also agreed that officers from the elite units would be deployed to deal with major incidents should the divisional commanders feel so.
