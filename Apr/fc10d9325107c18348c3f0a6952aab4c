Commonwealth Games javelin champion Julius Yego will not have a chance to defend his title after failing to qualify for today’s final. Yego threw 74.55m to exit the event, which he dominated four years ago in Glasgow, Scotland, after placing sixth. Australia’s Hamisch Peacock won the second semi after covering 81.22m While Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem recorded 80.45 to place second. India’s Vipin Kashana ensured he remained in the mix with an impressive 78.88m throw for fifth place. Ironically, Yego’s understudy Alex Torotich sailed through to the final after qualifying as one of the best losers. Toroitich covered 74.88m for sixth place. The Kenyan has a personal best of 78.67 and a season’s best of 75.67. The qualification mark was 78m but they needed four more to fill the top 12 places with Toroitich emerging second among the four best losers. Granada’s Anderson Peters covered 80.44m to win the first semi ahead of India’s Neeraj Chopra ( 80.42m) and Saint Lucia’s Albert Reynolds ( 78.10m), Australia’s Luke Cann ( 77.43m), Trinidad& Tobago’s Shakeil Waithe ( 75.21m) followed in that order. A disappointed said he was going to protest his ouster. “I am disappointed with the officials. I am not happy at all and I have been asked to pick my video and review and that is what I am doing. I was forced to make my third throw when the con was on the runway and yellow card was up and this means minimal chances. You can’t throw when the con is on the runway and yellow card is up,” he said.
