A 20-year-old slaughterhouse worker yesterday walked into a police station and confessed that he had stubbed his colleague to death over a Sh100 debt. Abdi Aden was locked up by police on Tuesday afternoon. Police found the body of Loko Abush, 26, by the road at Soko Ya Mbuzi market in Huruma. Abush suffered a single stab wound to his chest. The two men, police said, fought after Abush refused to hand over the Sh100. Aden had a knife hidden in his jacket, which he unleashed during the fight. Abush was pronounced dead at a clinic in Nairobi where he was rushed. Nairobi DCI chief Ireri Kamwende confirmed the incident. In another incident, five gunmen attacked passengers in a city centre-bound bus and escaped with cash and other valuables. Police said the criminals boarded the bus at Lucky Summer at around 5am yesterday. Moments later, the five suspects who were seated at different positions in the bus drew guns and ordered the passengers to hand over mobile phones and money. They escaped on foot at Allsops area, police said. This is the second incident reported in the city in a month. A gang posing as passengers carjacked a bus and robbed commuters of cash and other valuables before dumping them at Baba Dogo in Nairobi. The City Hoppa bus was headed for Pipeline. On reaching General Motors on Mombasa Road, the gang of five commandeered it towards Enterprise Road and ended up in Baba Dogo. They robbed the passengers who lost more than Sh200,000 in cash and valuables, Nairobi police boss Joseph ole Tito said.
