IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati has defended his decision to send CEO Ezra Chiloba on compulsory leave. In a statement, the poll agency boss said the decision was made by majority of the commissioners. "The commissions' plenary meeting held on April 6 received and discussed an audit report on some procurement matters," he said via twitter. "Subsequently, it was decided through a majority voting to expand audit scope and that the CEO proceeds on compulsory leave for three months." Chebukati said the leave of absence will enable a comprehensive audit of issues that have arisen in the procurement department. "It is important to note that in making the decision to carry out a comprehensive audit, the Commission is performing its oversight role to safeguard public resources," he said. Chebukati has previously raised questions regarding a number of technology-related procurements. According to sources within the commission, the chairman wants a number of issues investigated while Chiloba is away. The effect of the move is to destabilise the commission, which is to conduct vital boundaries delineation with implications for the next election. It makes work difficult or impossible because the CEO by law makes the day-to-day decisions; other commissioners cannot. It creates fear in the commission that others may be targetted. Chebukati and Chiloba have not had a cordial working relationship since the CEO resumed work this year.
