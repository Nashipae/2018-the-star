Property worth millions were destroyed after houses built on a disputed piece of land were demolished on Sunday morning. A bulldozer descended on the 50-acre parcel amid tight security and started demolishing houses following a court order. Squatters settled by the government in 1997 have been battling a court case with Pwani University who claim to have acquired the land. This was after the Kilifi Institute of Agriculture, which owned the land, was converted to a University in 2007. The squatters under the Kisumu Ndogo-Kibaoni extension settlement project lost the case on April last year and appealed. According to their chairman Nelson Chai, they again lost the appeal in December last year. Chai faulted how the eviction was done. "After losing the case for the second time, we knew we would be evicted but they should have given us some time to demolish our houses by ourselves." The chairman said he was called by Kilifi North deputy county commissioner on Friday to his office where he was shown the eviction notice. "I saw the eviction notice on Friday. It is not humanly possible for people to relocate within the short time we learned of the eviction." He said this is since they did not invade the land having been settled here by the government when Francis Baya was the Coast PC. "We were given allotment letters but when Pwani University came, they gave us a vacation notice," he added Chai now wants the government to allocate them an alternative land and compensate them for their houses. A valuation done last year placed the total cost of the houses at Sh80 million. "Let the government resettle us in a plot with a similar acreage and give us money to rebuild our houses," he said.
