Former Governor Isaac Rutto has accused Jubilee leaders in Bomet of reneging on an agreement to reach out to his supporters. Speaking at a church in Sotik on Sunday, he said despite his attempts to support the current administration, he has been provoked and insulted, and had to speak out. Rutto was reacting to accusations by some Jubilee leaders that he is undermining the county leadership. “People should not get scared of my presence in social events within the county. We should instead respect one another and stop politicizing every issue,” he said. “My supporters and CCM leaders have not made any move that shows we are seeking to undermine the current leadership.”
