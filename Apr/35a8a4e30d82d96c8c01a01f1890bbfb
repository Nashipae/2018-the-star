New Moi University VC Isaac Kosgey has said he will reclaim the lost glory of the university through hard work. Staff who make mistakes will be fired. Kosgey met staff at the university on Wednesday for the first time since he took over from acting VC Laban Ayiro. “You must maintain high ethical standards while on duty,” he said when he commissioned the renovated walkway at the main campus near Kesses.
