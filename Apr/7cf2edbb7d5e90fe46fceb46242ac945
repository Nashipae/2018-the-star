Lilian Muli is still going strong, doing her job. She may be in the second trimester of her pregnancy, but she is still working hard. But the nature of her work is such that even one slip-up can unleash a torrent of hate and criticism from viewers on social media. This weekend, the TV anchor interviewed a rape survivor. During a live TV interview on April 7, Irene Karimi, the victim of the rape ordeal, narrated how 10 men broke into her house in Kibera during the night. According to Karimi, the men stole almost everything, beat her up then sexually assaulted her. In her follow-up question, Muli then inquired whether the victim had done something to provoke the attack. “Could you have said something, done something, or were you dressed in a certain way?” A flabbergasted Karimi responded: “When rapists come, it’s not because a woman behaved in a certain way. They do it because that’s who they are. It’s not because who the woman is. I didn’t offend anyone in that community.” Many felt that this follow-up question was insensitive and they made their displeasure felt in the great universe that is social media.
