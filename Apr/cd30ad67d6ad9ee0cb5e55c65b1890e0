Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua says it’s time Deputy President William Ruto and the three disgruntled NASA principals started leading from the front. Wambua said the DP, Wiper’s Kalonzo Musyoka, Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetang’ula and ANC’s Musalia Mudavadi must take over from President Uhuru and Opposition chief Raila Odinga. The Wiper lawmaker said the two are “deep into the twilight of their careers” and are now more interested in their legacies. “Their best days in politics are behind them,” Wambua said on Saturday at Kongowea during the launch of the Nyali NG-CDF bursary fund presided over by MP Mohamed Ali. Ruto and the three NASA principals were left out of the deal in which Uhuru and Raila pledged to work together. Wambua said this is a wake-up call to the leaders that they should start thinking about their own career paths. “These leaders should work together because their best days in politics are ahead of them. When the others [Raila and Uhuru] talk about their legacy, they should talk about taking Kenya forward,” Wambua said. As the President and ODM leader Raila push their agenda of peace and their legacy, the four others should sit together and talk about the future of this nation, Wambua said. He said peace needs other virtues to be sustained. “There can never be peace without justice. And there can never be justice without fairness,” he said. Ali praised the Uhuru-Raila handshake.
