llegal loggers will be watched from the sky after Kenya signed up for new satellite technology to monitor deforestation. A task force appointed by Deputy President William Ruto said some forests exist only on paper but the land itself has been stripped bare by loggers. The government admits that no one know the true size of Kenya’s forest cover, which should be 15 per cent. Common estimates place it at seven percent. The new satellite technology, called the African Regional Data Cube, will process the latest earth observation and satellite data. It will present information in real-time in a simple way to help Kenya, Tanzania, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Ghana monitor their forests and address food security.  CROP DISTRIBUTION, RAINFALL The system launched last week in London was developed by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellite. That is the global body that coordinates civil space observations in partnership with Strathmore University Kenya, Group on Earth Observations and Amazon Web Services. DP Ruto has said the satellite system will help the government protect forests and improve food security by understanding crop distribution and changing seasons. “This technology will help us understand month by month how our land is used so we can target interventions to improve our actions against climate change, help small-holder farmers and secure sustainable food and water,” he said. While satellite data is not new in land management, it has traditionally been difficult to access and use, limiting its usefulness to governments. The system has been successfully demonstrated in Australia, Switzerland and Colombia and is under development or evaluation by more than 30 other countries. It allows analysis-ready satellite data and reduces the burden of data preparation and management.
