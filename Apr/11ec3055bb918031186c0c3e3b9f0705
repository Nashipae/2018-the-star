Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has declared himself the spokesman for Kakamega county, saying he will lead the region in negotiations for the 2022 General Election. Oparanya on Saturday accused former Senator Boni Khalwale of disrupting county unity “by bringing in outsiders” (ANC’s Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetang’ula). He has declared interest in running for President on the ODM ticket in 2022. He was speaking during the burial of senior chief Joseph Makatiani in Ikolomani. Broadcasting and Telecommunications Principal Secretary Sammy Itemere was present. “I want to tell Khalwale that I cannot allow outsiders to speak for us and purport to unite us,” he said. Oparanya, Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa, Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi and Jubilee MPs in Western have opposed the latest attempts to unite the Luhya. He said the move by Mudavadi and Wetang’ula — planning to merge their NASA affiliate parties — was promoting tribalism by pushing for formation of a single party for the community. Mudavadi and Wetang’ula are in the process of collapsing their parties into a single outfit before the 2022 poll. Oparanya said Kakamega county must leverage its numerical strength to demand its rightful political stake in 2022. On Friday, deputy Ford Kenya party leader Khalwale said tremendous progress had been made in the merger process. There would be a political tsunami sweeping away leaders opposed to Luhya unity, he said. Opposition supporters on Wednesday shouted down Oparanya during Opposition leader Raila Odinga’s tour of Kakamega town when he mentioned his bid. However, they cheered Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, who has also declared interest in the top seat. Joho says he fully supports the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila to heal the country. He also backs better working relations between the counties and the national government.
