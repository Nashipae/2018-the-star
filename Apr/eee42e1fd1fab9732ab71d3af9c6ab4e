Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata on Wednesday told the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to arrest and charge individuals involved in corruption in the county. The senator said the commission should walk the talk and arrest individuals embezzling public resources instead of just giving data on the rate of corruption. The EACC has ranked Murang’a the most corrupt county, angering county officials. Speaking at Moi Primary School in Gatanga subcounty during planting, Kang’ata said EACC chairman Eliud Wabukala should name names. He said he should make public the departments and individuals been siphoning public money in Murang’a and take them to court. “We don’t want to just hear that Murang’a is leading in corruption, we want to see people being arrested and taken to court for stomaching public resources,” Kang’ata said. However, Murang’a Woman representative Sabina Chege, the chief guest, reprimanded him for just complaining of graft in the county through media outlets. Chege told Kang’ata to play his oversight role by using the right channels identify and correct where public resources are being misused. “I am telling leaders to stop embarrassing Murang’a county through media exchanges. My good friend- Kang’ata should use the Senate channel to find a solution to graft in the county and tell Murang’a people where and how resources have been misused,” she said. Chege told leaders the law won’t condone anyone found culpable of misappropriating public resources. In a survey conducted before last year’s elections, the EACC ranked Murang’a as the most corrupt county. Governor Mwangi Wairia dismissed the report as a political witch-hunt. The woman representative told the senator and the governor to work together to find a solution. She also urgedthe assembly to acquire the audited report from the EACC and identify the departments that are making the county look bad. “The MCAs should get the report and tell residents where and how much money has been lost,’ she said.
