Education in public universities is on the brink of collapse as lecturers defy pleas to return to class and the government remains aloof. This has caught the attention of foreign education unions. The dons want a counteroffer on the 2017-21 CBA and have pledged to stay on strike until their demands are met. The walkout is in its 56th day. It has surpassed last year’s record when the dons boycotted work for 54 days over similar grievances. Conciliation efforts have collapsed and court processes scuttled. Three foreign unions have urged Education CS Amina Mohamed to end the stalemate. The latest appeal came from the German Education Union president Marlis Tepe on Monday. "The pay structure of academic staff in public universities is characterised by distortions, stagnation and poor career progression plans. The lack of any review of terms and conditions of employment, including basic salaries, pension arrears, allowances and other schemes, is a form of discrimination against university staff in Kenya,” Tepe said. On Thursday last week, Britain’s University and College Union secretary general Sally Hunt made a similar appeal. This came three weeks after Brussels’ Education International general secretary David Edwards made his. The unions urged the government to incorporate best international practices and give a credible counteroffer. Some vice chancellors have been accused of intimidating strikers. University Academic Staff Union secretary general Constantine Wasonga yesterday told the Star such tactics will not work. “Do you think lecturers are a crop of people you can intimidate with threats?” he asked. Wasonga said the conciliation meetings are meaningless in the absence of a counteroffer. “What do we talk about?” he asked.
