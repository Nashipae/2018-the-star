One person has been killed and seven others received medical treatment after a US passenger jet's engine ripped off midair, officials say. Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 made an emergency landing in Philadelphia after a window, wings and fuselage were damaged in the incident, officials say. The flight was en route from New York's La Guardia airport to Dallas, Texas, with 143 passengers and five crew. The Boeing Co 737-700 made a safe landing, said fire officials. The US Federal Aviation Administration has opened an investigation into Tuesday morning's unexplained incident. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said that that they are aware of one fatality in the suspected "engine failure". NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt told reporters the type of engine, a CFM56, is "very widely used in commercial transport". The father of one passenger aboard the plane told NBC Philadelphia that a woman was "partially sucked out" of a window after it was pierced by debris from the engine. She was pulled back inside by other passengers, Todd Bauer added. Philadelphia Fire Commissioner Adam Thiel told a news conference that seven passengers were treated at the scene for minor injuries, but they were not taken to hospital. Timothy Bourman, a pastor from New York City, told The Inquirer and Daily News he had been sitting in the rear of the plane when he heard a loud boom. "All the sudden, it felt like we dropped 100 feet," he said. "We were kind of out of control for a while. It seemed like the pilot was having a hard time controlling the plane. Honestly, I think we just all thought we were going down." When flight attendants told passengers to brace for impact, Bourman said he and his wife worried for the worst. "We're just all really thankful to be alive right now," he said. "Thankful to God, thankful to that pilot."  Click here for the latest political news
