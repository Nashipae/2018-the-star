A mother who set ablaze her ten-year-old son pleaded guilty to charges of assault causing actual bodily harm to her class three son before a Nyanyuki court last Tuesday. Elizabeth Ngina, 32, was set to be sentenced yesterday but Principal Magistrate Waititu Gichimu ordered that a probation report be prepared to guide the court on the matter. Ngina doused her son with kerosene on March 20 at Equator village as she demanded that he produces Sh100 which went missing after the minor had been sent to a nearby shop to buy some goods. “The mother asked the boy to say her last prayers which he did and then doused him with kerosene all over the body before striking a match stick and setting him on fire,” Carol Muriu for the prosecution told the court. Ngina will know her fate on April 10.
