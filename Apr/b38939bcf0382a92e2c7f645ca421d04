The body of a 25-year-old man yesterday morning was found near a thicket in Omiro-Kakelo, Kabondo Kasipul. Residents said Tom Otieno’s body had burn wounds. They said the deceased had been staying in Kisumu but died when he visited home. The body was taken to a mortuary in Oyugis town. “We can’t say what exactly killed him, but his body had some burn wounds, which are likely to have caused his death,” a witness said. They eulogised Otieno as a jovial person. He had been spotted with friends the previous day. Homa Bay police commander Marius Tum said they are investigating and have summoned the friends. He warned residents against abetting crime. “We’ll also interrogate his relatives,” Tum said. “We want people to collaborate and report their grievances to police or any other relevant authority for assistance.”
