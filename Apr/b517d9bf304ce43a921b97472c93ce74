Despite Kakamega Homeboyz beating Bandari 1-0 at Bukhungu Stadium on Saturday, head coach Mike Mururi regrets missing the services of his top scorers Allan Wanga, Lamine Diallo and Ali Ahmed Bhai, who are nursing injuries. Mururi said his options in the attack were limited due to the injuries, forcing him to redeploy midfielders to try and get goals, something which has caused numerous challenges in one of the most competitive leagues ever. He, however praised his players for seeing off hard-fighting Bandari, a team he referred to as one of the most tactical this term. Mururi was under intense pressure from both the fans and the club management heading into the encounter and had the weight of a three-match ultimatum to either deliver or disappear. “Last season we kicked off our campaign strongly to emerge as one of the favorites since had all our players fit unlike this term. However, I am optimistic of fixing up things and start posting good results,” he said. Some of the injured players have just some weeks to return to competitive situations after returning to light training recently and I am hoping their coming back will help us to a strong finish.” Wycliffe Opondo’s strike in the 33rd minute settled the tie in favour of the home team. However, Bandari head coach, Ken Odhiambo, was left fuming at centre referee George Mwai, whom he blamed for making wrong calls against the coastal side.
