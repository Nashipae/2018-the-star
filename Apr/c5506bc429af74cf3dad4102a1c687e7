Some 1500 small scale tea farmers who missed their annual bonus pay since 2015 have received more than Sh100 million from Sot Tea Growers Sacco (Stegro). The Sacco leadership announced on Monday the payout to the farmers following a release of a Sh300 million bailout by the National government following a cash crisis. Speaking during a thanksgiving ceremony at the Sacco offices at Silibwet in Bomet on Monday, CEO Geoffrey Sang said the bailout had also enabled them to pay salary areas for their 100 staff that had gone for months without pay. He said Sacco has also paid a bank debt that threw them into nearly 8 years of crisis. The Petrol station owned by the Sacco which had grounded due to the cash crisis, he noted, had also resumed operations and is expected to post good results. Joseph Mabwai, the Society’s chairman on his part announced that leadership wrangles that had dogged the Sacco has been resolved and court cases withdrawn. “The leadership rows have been resolved and we are now focused on rebuilding the Sacco and returning it to profit making venture for the benefit of our members,” said Mabwai. President Uhuru Kenyatta while in Bomet last year announced a Sh500 million bailout to the Sacco following several appeals by the local leadership led by Governor Joyce Laboso and Bomet Central MP Ronald Tonui. The CEO at the same time announced that for the first time, members will receive dividends for their shares at the end of the year noting they had set aside Sh1 million to be loaned out to members.
