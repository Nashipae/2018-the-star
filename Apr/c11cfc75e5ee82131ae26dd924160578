Most Isiolo residents are not informed about the Lapsset project, a report shows. The report about tension between human rights and development by Haki Jamii says the residents are likjely to oppose the project if they are not informed. It wants the authorities to engage the community through public participation. Haki Jamii executive director Pauline Vata said majority of respondents across said they are not aware of the project. Isiolo is an important part of the Lapsset corridor with an international airport and resort cities to be built in the town. The corridor is the main economic enabler targeting to open up the north to investment and trade. It will also link the region to local and offshore markets in line with aspirations of the economic pillar of Vision 2030. "The most pressing issue is land and compensation. Most of the land is community-owned because residents are pastoralists," Vata said. The lobby group asked the government to explain to residents how compensation will be done. "The county should also make public its position and reveal all relevant information to the public to avoid squabbles," Vata said. The report presented to the county government, the county assembly and civil society organisations. Vata said the three-year research was meant to stir debate and elicit appropriate action by the Lapsset Corridor Development Authority. Most respondents said land tenure remained unresolved. MCAs and youths who attended the forum said the project was being carried out with consultation and public participation.
