The proposed review of the Constitution is not about the 2022 polls, but the well-being of Kenyans, Senator James Orengo has said. He said Deputy President William Ruto, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetang’ula should not oppose the referendum without a persuasive argument. Orengo said it’s important to engage in the debate with everyone as that will align with the aspirations of Kenyans. The Siaya Senator spoke in Gem on Sunday. Orengo said the Constitution is a set of laws that can be subjected to review any time so as to respond to the needs of Kenyans. The referendum debate is about creating political units that make sense, not about creating jobs at the top of the political hierarchy.
