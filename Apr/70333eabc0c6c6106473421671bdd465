Kathiani MP Robert Mbui has criticised Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua for chest-thumping he has billions of shillings to use for his 2022 presidential campaigns. The MP told Mutua he had nothing when he was elected for his first term as the Machakos governor in 2013 on the Wiper ticket. Mbui on Friday accused the governor of using public resources to fund his campaigns at the expense of suffering Machakos residents. “Our roads are in a pathetic state and there is no medicine in hospitals, yet we see him on TV bragging he has billions of shillings to spend in 2022,” the legislator said.
