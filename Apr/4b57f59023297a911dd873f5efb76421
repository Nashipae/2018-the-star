Transport along busy Kasarani-Mwiki Road was disrupted yesterday after matatu operators and business people blocked it to protest the deplorable and ipassable condition of a section. Residents, some who had awakened as early as 5am, were stranded as operators parked their vehicles, put stones in the way and literally sat on the road.They blamed Emishoyi East Africa Ltd, the contractor repairing the 100-metre section, of sloth and incompetence. “We don’t want this cowboy contractor. He has been here for more than a month and the only thing he has done is to place these big stones here,” matatu operator Peter Njunguna said. Residents are forced to walk more than three kilometres or use boda bodas which charge Sh150 to Sh200, up from the  e usual Sh50. Kura communications officer John Cheboi defended the contractor, saying the section had been destroyed by a nearby car wash that had weakened its foundation and thus complete rehabilitation was needed.The contractor had to dig 1.2m deep to remove the cotton soil and fill it with stones. He said by next week residents will see progress.
