Workers at Bata Shoe Company, Limuru, have complained of harassment, poor salaries and lack of job security. They accused managers and expatriates from India and Italy of conspiring with a senior security officers to victimise them. Anyone who speaks out is fired. The workers have urged President Uhuru Kenyatta, Labour CS Ukur Yatani and Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu to rescue them from what they call “neocolonialism”. “Casuals, low level workers and middle level managers are frustrated so we can quit and be replaced with expatriates,” a production worker, who sought for anonymity, said. The workers are not allowed wear the company’s products to prevent theft. But Human Resources manager Peter Giathi said the allegations have never been reported to his office. He said his office will investigate. “In normal circumstances, such serious allegations reach me very fast, but nobody has raised complaints,” he said.
