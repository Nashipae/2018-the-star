Public Service CAS Rachel Shebesh has rejected Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi’s proposal that she becomes Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko’s number two. She said she cannot engage in politics as she is a civil servant and wants to use her current position to transform the country. Sonko’s former Deputy Governor Policarp Igathe resigned in January and the county boss is poised to fill the position. Shebesh said she did not apply for the post as she is not interested. She wished Sonko well in getting a capable deputy. “You have been a very great friend of mine. I’m no longer a politician but a civil servant. I can tell you the transition has been quick because of the direction of President Uhuru Kenyatta, no more politicking,” Shebesh said at St John’s Methodist Church in Kirua, Buuri. Kiraitu had said Nairobi can only be managed by Sonko and Shebesh, who are “well-versed with the politics of the city”. But Shebesh said, “I’m committed to the transformation agenda and writing the legacy of President Uhuru Kenyatta through this ministry. This [CAS] opportunity given to me is a chance in a million to be able to turn my passion into action. There was a time I was a politician.” Read: 'Shebesh, Ongoro top in Sonko's all-woman list of Deputy Governor choices' Click here for the latest political news
