Deaf persons in Naivasha have accused employers, mainly in the flower farms, of overlooking them while hiring staff. The lot said this is despite them meeting the required academic credentials. The deaf persons said some employers do not have confidence in them despite having gone to higher institutions of learning and are experts in different fields. This emerged during a special mass led by the deaf persons at PCEA church in NaivashaÂ  on Sunday. Zachariah Ngechu, addressing the congregation through an interpreter, noted that they are ready for any kind of a job. The chairman of the deaf persons in Naivasha expressed concern over the high number of jobless deaf people in the country. "We are asking employers to give us a chance because like other people we have gone to colleges and we are capable of delivering," he said. Ngechu added that in rare cases, some employers had agreed to give the deaf low cadre jobs yet some of them have Bachelors degrees. "As we mark the rising of our saviour Jesus Christ, we are asking employers to give the deaf a chance to serve them. I can promise that they will not be disappointed." Preacher David Ndiritu encouraged Christians to remain steadfast in their faith and to support the less-privileged members of the society. "Sometimes, we are looked down upon but Christians should be in the forefront in ensuring equity for the psychically challenged," the preacher said. Click here for the latest political news
