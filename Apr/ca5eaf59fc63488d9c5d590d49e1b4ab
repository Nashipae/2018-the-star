Her place in history is cast in stone here in the land of many heroes and victims and among the human race in general," he said.

"As we bury Winnie, it is our hope that her death will resurrect in all African countries the purpose of the struggles that we have waged at different times but often with the same goal of bequeathing freedom, dignity and economic empowerment to our people," he said.
