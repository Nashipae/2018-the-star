Shujaa began the Hong Kong Sevens tournament on a winning note, thrashing Canada 33-10 in the opening match yesterday. The Canadians settled early and dictated the opening exchanges and took the lead when Connor Braid touched down following good work by Nathan Hirayama for an unconverted try and a 5-0 lead. Innocent Simiyu’s charges responded immediately from the kickoff when vice captain, Sammy Oliech, raced 50 metres clear to land for a try at the corner and tie the match at 5-5. Shujaa grew in confidence and piled pressure on the Canadians to score through Andrew Amonde with Oliech converting for a 12-5 lead. The Canadians tried to rally back into the match at the end of the half but the granite Kenyan defence stood firm to shut them out to lead 12-5 at the break. On resumption, the Canadians came out firing on all cylinders and from a quickly taken line-out Pat Lay crossed the whitewash for an unconverted try to narrow Kenya’s lead to 12-10. Collins Injera gave Kenya breathing space with a weaving run to land at the centre with Oliech converting for a 19-10 lead. Shujaa intensified the pressure thereafter and it came as no surprise when Nelson Oyoo combined well with Jeff Oluoch to send Willy Ambaka over for his 100th try on the world sevens series circuit with Oliech adding the extras for a 26-10 lead. Oyoo then completed the rout with a trademark run and burst breaking three tackles to land at the center with Oliech converting tom close out the rout. Kenya face Spain at 8:10am this morning and return to the pitch against Australia at 12:10pm. Elsewhere, Kenya Lionesses lost to South Africa 12-7 in sudden death in the Womens sevens series qualifiers semifinals to miss out on next seasons top tier rugby.
