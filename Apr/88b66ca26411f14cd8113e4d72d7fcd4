Two people were on Friday found dead and their bodies dumped separately in a thicket and a sugarcane farm at Chepsangor, Nandi Hills. The bodies were discovered by members of the public who informed police of the incident. Nandi Hills OCPD Patrick Macharia said they have launched investigations into the incident that has shocked the residents. "We suspect the men, aged between 20-25 years, were strangled with a wire or a sisal twine before being thrown into the bush," Macharia said. Following the discovery of the bodies, angry residents barricaded the busy Eldoret-Chemelil road demanding action from police. A week ago, another body of a male adult, who is yet to be identified, was discovered in a thicket in the same area. Nandi Governor Stephen Sang, who visited the scene, condemned the incident. He asked police in Nandi and Nyando to establish permanent road blocks and ensure all vehicles are inspected. The governor pleaded with the residents to re-open the road and cooperate with the police to identify the vehicle used by the suspected killers. "There is a weakness within the investigation unit of the police because hardly do we hear of breakthroughs in apprehending suspects," Sang said. "We believe these murders are conducted elsewhere and the bodies of victims dumped here as if this is a mortuary." The bodies were taken to Kapsabet county referral mortuary in wait for a postmorterm. Click here for the latest political news
