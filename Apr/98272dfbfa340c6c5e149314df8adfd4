For a third time in six years, Robert Matano will be the coach of 10-time Kenyan champions Tusker after he was unveiled at the clubs Ruaraka base yesterday. Matano, who was out of job after he was released by AFC Leopards last month, has been given the unenviable task of taking the brewers out of the unfamiliar relegation territory they find themselves in. The Kenyan Premier League title winning coach was confident that his experience competing at the top of the league and winning trophies with various clubs will be invaluable as the brewers seek to turn around their fortunes that have dipped since they parted ways with Paul Nkaata, who had just led them to the 2016 league title. “I am very familiar with the high standards of this club and it is disappointing where they find themselves in the league table. Everyone has to take responsibility from now on, and that includes the players, if we are to start winning matches more consistently and rise up the league table,” he said. The self-christened ‘Lion’ has his eyes trained on this afternoons clash with Wazito FC as the brewers seek to usher in a new era after the ill-fated stints of Ugandans George Nsiimbe and Sam Timbe. “We all need to have a common goal and pull in the same direction in spite of the difficulty the club has experienced so far. The season is still young and if we become more consistent, then we will still end the campaign well,” said Matano. The brewers lie 15th with 10 points, just three above the bottom. Other matches set to be played today will see AFC Leopards visit Kariobangi Sharks while Gor Mahia will be away to Chemelil Sugar as Bandari play hosts to Zoo Kericho.
