Residents of Longonot in Naivasha were shocked after a man committed suicide following orders that he pay Sh1,500 per month to his estranged wife for child upkeep. The man, only identified as Chege, died after jumping into a drum full of water. He had been ordered by the children’s department to pay the cash. Area chief Stephen Njuguna said the couple parted ways two years ago following domestic problems. They had one child. The woman was Chege’s second wife. “The directive irked him and he decided to take his life. He jumped into the drum, head first,” Njuguna said. Neighbours said the woman lived in a nearby village. Jackson Waimeri said Chege asked his two sons, from the first wife, to fill the drum before he locked himself in the house and took his life. His wife was away when the tragedy happened. BABY DROWNED “He had contemplated committing suicide. It’s a double loss because he has left behind a young family that depended on his support and guidance,” Waimeri said. In November last year, a form one girl in Kakamega was admitted to hospital after allegedly drowning her baby and taking poison following a disagreement with her boyfriend. Neighbours said the student disagreed with her boyfriend over the upkeep of the child aged 15 months. “She went to see him in a neighbouring village with the child, but came back alone. Upon being questioned, she poisoned herself,” said a witness who did not want to be named. “We found her writhing in pain and rushed her to hospital.” The girl said she threw the child in River Yala. A new bill wants parents to share cost of upkeep on a 50-50 basis.
