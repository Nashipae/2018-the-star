Siblings Nicholas Bett and Aaron Koech failed to live up to expectations as they gambled in the 400m hurdles yesterday at Carrara Stadium. With the lanes favouring the two brothers, Bett ran a very erratic race and finished last in 51.00. The former world 400m hurdles champion, started the race like lightening, momentarily raising the hopes of Kenyans but faded off with 150m to go to the chagrin of the Kenyan fans including the Sports CS Rashid Echesa. Koech, despite occupying the inside lane, was no better and wounded up sixth in 50.02 seconds. Koech is the Africa bronze medallist. The two raced better at the mixed zone, going past the journalists like a flash without uttering a word. However, they were overheard telling the broadcast journalists that they had seen darkness towards the end. “Tuliona giza (We saw darkness),” they said. Meanwhile, All the three Kenyan representatives sailed into today’s final of the women’s 800m final. Margaret Nyairera clocked 2:00.60 to win Heat 2 ahead of Jamaican Natoya Goule (2:00.74) and Shelyana Oskan -Clarke (2:00.81) of England. Emily Cherotich won Heat 3 in a time of 2:00.58 while Uganda’s Winnie Nanyondo was third. Australia’s Georgia Griffith completed the top three places. South Africa’s caster Semenya reigned supreme in the first heat in 1:59.26 to relegate England’s Alexandra Bett (2:00.11) and Kenya’s Eglay Nalianya to second and third places respectively. Kenya’s Elijah Kimitei missed the qualification cut by a whisker after placing sixth in 15.75m. Kimitei was supposed to make it to the top five places to move to the final round. Dominac’s Yordanys Garcia won the heat with 16.75m ahead of Guyana’s Troy Doris, who returned 16.33m. Cameroon’s Marcel Mayack II covered the event in a personal best of 16.32m.
