Hundreds of farmers have withdrawn their maize from queues at the NCPB depots in the North Rift. The government has not released the Sh2.5 billion Deputy President William Ruto had promised would be issued last week. More than 500 lorries queued at the depots, but more than half of them have withdrawn as farmers fear the government may not pay them soon. Some of the farmers had signed government commitment forms showing that if allowed to deliver their maize they will not demand payment until after three months. The government owes the farmers more than Sh5 billion for maize deliveries since December last year. “What is happening has demoralised most farmers. Some have been forced to take their maize back home,” said Kenya Farmers Association director Kipkorir Menjo.
