Several women groups from Kanduyi, Webuye West and Tongaren constituencies in Bungoma have received interlocking block machines from the office of the Woman Representative through Affirmative Action funds. The machines can make up to 40,000 bricks each day. They consume less energy, a shorter time and less water. Woman Representative Catherine Wambilianga addressed the groups at the Bungoma county commissioner’s office on Monday. She issued the machines and urged the women to improve their businesses. Some of the women who received the machines are from Ndalu Catholic Church Women’s Association, Webuye West CBO and Marakaru Women Group. “I assure these women they will have ready market as we liaise with the secondary and primary schools expanding their structures,” Wambilianga said. The women will also partner with the county government in selling the bricks. Wambilianga, a first-time MP, said the machine uses modern technology that is easy to apply.
