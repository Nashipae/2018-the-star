Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya says he will join national politics after his second term ends in 2022. He said on Sunday he had accepted “residents’ pleas” not to retire after serving as governor. Mvurya spoke in two meetings in Kitivo village, Waa Ng’ombeni, and Kirewe village, Kizibe in Mkongani. “I’ve heard your appeal. I’ll go for a national position in Nairobi,” he told his cheering supporters. “I’ll not have attained the retirement age, but the law forbids me from seeking a third term as governor. I’m willing to respect your suggestion that I go for a higher national office.” Mvurya said he will back Deputy President William Ruto for the presidency. “Many vehicles lead to Nairobi, but not all of them reach there. Some branch at Mazeras and others at Voi to go to Taveta. The only vehicle that will take us from Kwale to Nairobi is that led by Ruto. Let’s go in it. I can never mislead my people,” he said. Mvurya urged residents to avoid partisan politics, “as NASA chief Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta have decided to work together for the sake of developing the country”. Mvurya and Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani distributed 60 hybrid he-goats — 30 in each village — to be used to improve local breeds. They urged farmers not to sell the animals. Mvurya urged residents to elect Achani governor in 2022. “I’ve been with Achani in the first and now second term. She knows very well what amounts to leading this county to greater heights. She is the best candidate to lead after me. We should not gamble with this crucial position,” he said. Achani described Mvurya as a focussed, visionary and hard working.
