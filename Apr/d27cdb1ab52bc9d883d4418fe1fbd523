More than 2,000 people in Kisumu county have been displaced by floods after River Nyando bursts its banks. Many roads, including Ahero-Ombeyi, were rendered impassable yesterday. The only available means of transport to rescue them was a tractor. The majority of those affected were moved to schools and churches. Some learning institutions, including Obiayo Primary School, were flooded. Residents called for permanent solutions to the flood problem saying they are tired of being asked to move to higher ground. “The government should invest in building dykes, water pans, and desiltation of rivers to control the floods and even channel the water for irrigation,” flood victim Joyce Adhiambo said. Muhoroni deputy county commissioner Kipkech Lotiatia said by Monday, a total of 403 households in Muhoroni had been affected which translates to approximately 2,015 people being displaced. “We are still experiencing rains and locals in flood-prone areas should move to safer ground,” Lotiatia said. Kisumu director of special programmes Ruth Odinga said, “The county has set up evacuation centres in the affected areas. Most of the rescue centres are already in use alongside medical tents and others are on high alert for activation should the need arise.”
