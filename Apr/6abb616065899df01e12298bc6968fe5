Torrential rains and floods have once again put Nairobi authorities on the spot as residents demand clear-age of blocked drainage systems. Residents want to know what the county government is doing to ease the flooding problem in various estates. Some residents say they haven’t seen any action to clear drains or any effort to create awareness of what to do in emergencies. “Is our government waiting for our houses to be completely filled with water so that they can come help us?” Hellen Awinja asked. Last month City Hall started using a Sh25 million drain flusher machine to clear blocked drainage systems. A check spot by a Star reporter on Tuesday revealed that residents of civil servants’ South C, Kariobangi South and Piooner estate in Buruburu were awakened by water flooding into their homes. Commuters were stranded as many roads were impassable. Speaking to the Star yesterday, National Disaster Management Unit CEO Francis Wanjohi said the latest flooding is not restricted to Nairobi byut is countrywide. “We are working together with the Ministry of the Interior and the county government to address disaster management,” he said. The Disaster Unit was formed last month to help manage emergencies. City Hall set aside Sh194 million to tackle flooding and avert deluge disasters in the future “Stakeholders Red Cross Kenya, Kenya National Police Services and many others are on ground but it’s not being highlighted publicly, Wanjohi said.
