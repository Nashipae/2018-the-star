Most parts of Wajir county will be generally dry this month, with occasional light to moderate rainfall. However, some areas will experience heavy rains. The meteorological department said heavy rainfall is expected in Tarbaj, Khorof Harar, Kotulo and Wajir Bor. According to county director of metereological services Daniel Wanjui, the April forecast is based on changes in sea surface temperatures and reduction of anomalies in temperatures. Wajir is located near a ‘neutral’  Indian Ocean area not favourable to rain. The rainfall will greatly benefit the livestock sector as pastures will improve during the March to May rainfail, the weather report says. Wajir and the rest of the Northeast have been suffering from drought. The rains will help but the drought is expected to continue.
