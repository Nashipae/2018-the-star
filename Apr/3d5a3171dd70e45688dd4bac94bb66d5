As far as early deficiency and diarrheal diseases are concerned, they are causing more deaths in Busia than the national average, which ar 3.3 and 3.9 per cent respectively. The information was made public yesterday by the county director of Public Health Melissa Lutomia during an advocacy meeting for increased allocation of budget to the health department. Governor Sospeter Ojaamong was the chief guest at the meeting. The department expressed concern that if the allocation by the county governmennt reduces as proposed, then funding from donors including the World Bank will go down as well. Director of Medical Services Janerose Ambuchi said it will be difficult to provide adequate health services if the budget is reduced. “We have come together with partners so that we put our heads together. Let us increase the budget, failing which, the whole county will be painted in bad light and more so the common mwananchi will suffer most,” she said. “We are pleading with Your Excellency to increase the budget for health. The average budget for health is coming to Sh2.5 billion for this financial year.” The department was allocated Sh1.8 billion last financial and the sum proposed for this year is Sh1.5 billion. Lutomia said many facilities are yet to be completed.
