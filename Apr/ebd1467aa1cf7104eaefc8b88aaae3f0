The High court has ordered a fresh hearing of the murder case against self-confessed serial killer Philip Onyancha. Justice James Wakiaga said Onyancha's charge and subsequent sentencing was a mistrial. He said the case was conducted under a wrong procedure. The judge directed that the matter be taken before head of criminal division for further directions. Earlier, the judge had found Onyancha with a case to answer after testimonies from 13 witnesses, among them two doctors. Onyancha is charged alongside Tobias Aradi and Douglas Obiero Makori. He had confessed to the police of the alleged killings where he linked his co-accused persons. It
is alleged that the suspect had confessed to killing 19 women and
children around the country and showed their hidden bodies. He has since denied three murder charges preferred against him by the DPP. Onyancha entered a plea in 2014 before Justice Lesley Lessit and denied committing the offences.
