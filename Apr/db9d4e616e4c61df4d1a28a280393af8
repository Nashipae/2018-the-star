Residents of Isebania town, which borders Tanzania in Kuria West subcounty, have called for ease trade following the signing of Continental Free Trade Area agreement. The pact was signed by 44 African heads of state earlier last month in Kigali, Rwanda. Residents say they hope it will enhance trading across the Kenya-Tanzania border. Last Friday MPs Marwa Kitayama and Mathias Robi, from Kuria East and Kuria West constituencies respectively, said residents are harassed by Tanzanian officials. The two spoke at a rally in Isebania. “This border point is our only industry in Kuria as it pushes our economy. We need business to be aboveboard, away from unnecessary corruption,” Kitayama said. what brotherhood? The legislator said with election period now over, the community expects an increase in trade through the border. Robi said Parliament will deal with the issue of harassment and plan a joint meeting between traders and leaders from the two country. “Most definitely we will have the meeting in Tanzania to officially give them our complaints. We also need our Kenyans officials to help facilitate traders from across the border,” he said. Zachary Chacha, a boda boda operator, said their motorcycles are seized whenever they cross the border. “Often when our bikes are impounded we are required to part with Sh7,000, which is punitive yet our counterparts are allowed to move free in Kenya,” he said. Former Isebania MCA Charles Nyangi said residents hope the new agreement will help bring free movement, which has been elusive despite the East Africa Community integration. “We work with Tanzanians in Kenya especially in business, but when we go to their side we are mistreated. There is no brotherhood at the border,” he said. Nyangi said the border has potential for growth if the two countries work closely to ease trade.
