Construction of a new sewer line in Kariobangi has begun in earnest, Nairobi governor Mike Sonko has said. Sonko on Friday said the project will be fast-tracked in order to unclog the sewer line in Kariobangi North Primary which has been submerged for the last four months. Public health officers had threatened to close down the school over the deplorable sanitation. “Sewers in this area collapsed and stopped working including the connection for Kariobangi primary school many years ago. This is because the sewer lines there are of diameter 150 mm which was adequate for single dwelling house but there was a change of planning and multiple dwelling was allowed leading to population growth hence overload of all the infrastructure including sewers,” Sonko wrote on his Facebook page. He said works are ongoing in the school and they will ensure that the new line is in place before the start of the second term. The sewer has flooded the school`s playground, offices and classrooms. Despite the sewer menace, the school is facing overcrowding, lack of proper structures and does not have enough toilets for the students. Click here for the latest political news
