The show centres around various characters and their individual stories of struggle, survival and ambition. When a young man is killed for walking into the wrong place at the wrong time, his father angrily takes revenge on another boy who was seen near the dead young man. The tragic event affects and connects the lives of the people involved, as the twists and turns of the plot unfold. The show turns the daily struggle of the South Side inhabitants into an innovative depiction of a culture that binds the community it revolves around. It touches on many issues not excluding crime, sex and police corruption. But the show gives hope and highlights the life the young generation is growing up in. The youngest characters, Kevin, Jake and Poppa, really are the stars of the show. While they are best friends and live in the same hood, their outlooks (and outcomes) vary according to the choices they make. Kevin witnesses a murder, but it doesn’t deter him from his way. Jake looks up to his drug dealer brother Reg and subsequently decides to join the ‘family business’. Poppa is the brightest star of the three. Literally. The happy, chubby kid dresses up in bright colour shorts and bow ties and tops it with a with a matching top-hat. Poppa is the good in a world where everything is going wrong. The show is created by Emmy winning writer Lena Waithe and has already been renewed for a second season.  Star Rating: 4/5
