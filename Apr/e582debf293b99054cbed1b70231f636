Police have
been given names of bandits suspected to have killed a police officer at the Elgeyo
Marakwet-West Pokot border, a state official has said. Deputy county commissioner James Chacha said the police are pursuing
the armed bandits. He did
not disclose the number of bandits on police radar. "We have
received a number of names from locals and we will not rest until they are arrested
and brought to book," Chacha said on Monday. The armed
bandits opened fire on anti-stock theft unit officers who were pursuing stolen livestock
on the Marakwet East - Pokot South border on Friday. One officer was shot dead. The ASTU officers
were pursuing hundreds of cows and sheep that had been stolen by cattle
rustlers suspected to be from West Pokot. "We are sorry for the family of our fallen
officer killed in the line of duty. The suspect is known criminal and the
police are pursuing him," Chacha said. Chacha said
30 cows and 36 sheep were recovered by the officers despite the ambush by
bandits. He said an
AK47 rifle and 16 rounds of ammunition were also recovered from the suspected
bandits. The commissioner urged locals to be calm and not treat the attack as a fight
between two communities living on the border. Unconfirmed
reports said several bandits were gunned down during the fierce shoot-out that lasted for hours. He said elders
from Marakwet East and Pokot South have held meeting to quell tension and
identify stolen livestock. David Rono, Kenya Forest Service Embobut forest operation
commander, said a contingent of security officers comprising of ASTU,
KFS rangers and police reservists are after the suspects. Read: Bandits shoot dead policeman on Marakwet-Pokot border Click here for the latest political news
