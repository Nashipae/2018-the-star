A section of Thika residents and traders seek to block the merger of the Thika Water and Sewerage Company with eight other water companies in the county. They say the move will cause a water crisis in the region, reduce available water, hurt factories and discourage investment. They also say there was no public participation in the decision. In suit papers seen by the Star on Tuesday, the petitioners want the court to bar implementation of the Kiambu Water and Sanitation Amendment Act. They want the Kiambu government prevented from merging the companies, pending determination of the petition. The Thika District Business Association, Jamuhuri Ofafa Starehe Welfare Association and resident Kinuthia Kamwangi say in suit papers if the merger goes through, residents will suffer irreparable harm. The papers were served to the Kiambu government, the Attorney General, the Water Services Regulatory Board and THIWASCO. Kamwangi, the former Transition Authority chairman, says in his affidavit the assembly passed the Water and Sanitation Amendment Act 2018 on merger without public participation required by law. On Tuesday, residents said they won’t allow the merger and they were not consulted. “We are privy to information the county plans a ceremony on Friday to launch the purported Kiambu Water and Sanitation Company.  We don’t recognise the entity that has been created unconstitutionally,” Gathirika Kamanu, former Thika town Engineer, said.
