Kenyans had to dig deep into their pockets to cope with life last year, as inflation overshot Central Bank’s upper limit of 7.5 per cent to hit 8.7 per cent. According to government data, inflation hit its highest in five years. CBK normally targets inflation at five per cent, with a flexible margin of 2.5 per cent on either side in the event of adverse shocks. Under Treasury current inflation targeting regime, when inflation heads above target, the CBK generally interprets that as a signal higher interest rates are required to cool the economy. This is the first time in five years the country’s inflation is surpassing CBK’s safe gate since 2012 when it posted a compounded annual inflation rate of 9.4 per cent Kenya’s inflation eased in 2016 to 6.3 per cent after recording 6.6 and 6.9 per cent in 2015 and 2014 respectively According to Economic Survey 2017, the high inflation was as a result of increase in global oil prices and adverse climatic conditions that hampered agricultural productivity in the first half of the year. Kenya National Bureau of Statistics director general Zachary Mwangi said the government’s commitment towards agriculture under President Uhuru Kenyatta’s big four agenda on food security will help to ease inflation. He termed the invasion of Fall Armyworm the current danger threatening crop production and called for combined effort by stakeholders in the sector to combat the pest. “Harsh climatic conditions curtailed growth of the agricultural sector to 1.6 per cent in 2017 down from five per cent growth in 2016. Although the country is experiencing favourable climatic conditions for agriculture, Fall Armyworm remains to be key challenge to the sector," said Mwangi. He attributed the high inflation to uncertainties brought about by the long electioneering period, inflating retail prices of food items especially groceries. He lauded the government for subsidising the coast of maize flour in the second half of the year, cushioning the public from high prices. Food and non-alcoholic beverages index which is the highest in the consumer price index basket increased by 13.4 per cent to 234.90 up from 207.19 in 2016. This was the highest in recent times and accounted for 36.03 per cent of the overall index The index for restaurants and hotels increased by 5.5 per cent followed by clothing and foot wear at 3.7 per cent.
