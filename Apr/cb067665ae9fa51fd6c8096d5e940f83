The government through the Ministry of Sports and the Register of Sports has appointed an independent interim committee to handle the registration of Cricket Kenya, oversee constitutional reforms and set up an election timetable within the next three months. The committee comes two months after Cricket Kenya was left in a limbo following the resignation of three executive members after Kenya’s poor performance at the ICC Cricket World Cup qualifiers in Namibia. After Kenya were relegated to ICC World Cricket League Division Three following a wanting performance in Namibia, Jackie Janmohhamed resigned from her CK chairperson alongside Development Director Raja Sarkar. Three weeks later, treasurer Ravi Kaul, also quit leaving vice chairman, Palli Sehmi, as the only elected board member at CK. With this development, CK was set to elect new officials but behind the scenes meeting by a group of former national team members and other stakeholders brought an end to the process while calling for reforms at CK. Later, the group — Kenya Cricket Stakeholders Forum — was able to reach Sports Cabinet Secretary, Rashid Echesa, where they launched a massive bid to implement reforms in the leadership of the game. The group presented the CS with a memorandum on the reforms that need to be carried out at CK, including adopting a new constitution before fresh elections are held. Palli has been appointed to serve as the chair of the interim committee. He will be joined Kaul and former national team wicket keeper, David Obuya. Other appointees to the independent interim sports committee include Tom Tikolo, Tito Odumbe, Walter Trenk, Omole Asiko, Sukhban Singh and Rajesh Patel. The in-attendance agreed that the independent interim committee should have three members from NPCA, three stakeholders, two from Cricket Kenya and David Obuya.
