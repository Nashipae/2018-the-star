Radio Jambo's Annitah Raey walked out of her marriage to save her life. The now single mother says she may never marry again. And she is not looking to please society by being in a dysfunctional relationship. "I refused to die for love. I refused to die for a man. I refused to be a statistic. I will not be a name on a cross because I was trying to work on us. I will not leave my kid motherless because I want to please society. Who said that marriage is patience? Who said that I should die working on a relationship?" she said. Raey said an abusive relationship breaks the victim. "Have you ever wished [for] death? Wanted to sleep and not wake up in the morning? Have you ever questioned the existence of God and everything heavenly? Forget labour pains. This hurts more. It kills you when you are alive. It takes away your soul and leaves you void. You are dead alive." In conclusion, she said, "I have no remorse for leaving you. I feel no shame in saying I have two kids. I am a single mum of two and that will always be my greatest title."
