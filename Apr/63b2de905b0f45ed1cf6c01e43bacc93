Mwingi west MP Charles Nguna yesterday lauded ODM leader Raila Odinga over his efforts of embracing unity and promoting peace across the country by shaking hands with his former opponents. The latest handshake being that of former President Mwai Kibaki, which the MP Nguna said he is also eyeing to shake hands with Kibaki since he was and will still remain incomparable leader in this Nation. Speaking at Nguutani market the MP strongly pointed out that its time that politicians focus their energy on developing the country instead of fighting over 2022 which is far off and too early to be talked about. "The events of that year will unfold come 2022. It's time for developments rather than politics everyday. I don't know why many leaders are opposed to the handshake which has become their greatest concern," Nguna said. The MP said details on Raila's recent meeting with retired President Mwai Kibaki are yet to be revealed but that's doesn't matter saying peace is what matters. He has also visited former President Daniel Moi in his Kabaraka home in his bid to unify the country after a prolonged political tension which led to standstill of the country's economy. He finally called upon all leaders to put aside their political differences and focus on pure development.
