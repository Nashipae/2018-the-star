Former National Assembly Deputy Speaker Farah Maalim  has withdrawn an appeal challenging the victory of Garissa Township MP Aden Duale. “Take notice that the appellant herein, Farah Maalim, hereby withdraws the entire appeal, for all purposes,” he said in a notice. Last month, National Assembly Majority leader Duale asked the court not to allow the appeal, saying it was filed outside the statutory timelines of seven days after the judgment was made.

The petition challenging Duale’s win was dismissed on February 27. “The hearing and determination of the election matters are to be heard within specific timelines set by both statutes and the Constitution,” Duale said. “The said notice of appeal is contrary to the procedures, an abuse of the court process and ought to be struck off.” In the original petition, Justice Hedwig Ong’udi ruled there were no irregularities or malpractices to warrant nullification of the election, as Maalim had s ought.

Maalim had cited cases of voter bribery and improper transmission of results, which favoured the incumbent. He said voting throughout the constituency was not free and fair. Maalim admitted, however, he had no concrete evidence. “I did not see the bribery or anyone being bribed, but I saw a crowd negotiating,” he told court. Duale garnered 22,587 votes against Maalim’s 14,897. In October, the court allowed Maalim to access all the information contained in the KIEMS kits.  Click here for the latest political news
