The Senate has passed a law allowing governors to appoint deputies to fill vacancies. The National Assembly will debate the same Bill
and should it be passed, the President will sign it into law. It is commendable the Senate has found a way out of the
crisis highlighted when Nairobi Deputy Governor Polycarp Igathe
quit and the Nyeri Deputy Governor Mutahi Kahiga was sworn in as governor. It is important governors are able to pick deputies they have good rapport with and the two are able to work together. But this should not be a reason for governors to pick 'weakling'
deputies whom they can control, to the detriment of the people. Lack of clearly defined roles allows governors to sidestep deputies, whom they see as competitors rather
than partners. Previously deputy governors have complained the Constitution, apart from defining them as the principal assistants of their bosses, never outlined their responsibilities. It is important that as Parliament debates the bill,
MPs need to clearly define the deputy governors' role, instead of leaving it amorphous. It makes no sense to have deputy governors who have no roles and
mandates, yet most have impressive skills that can help transform counties. Quote of the Day: “Little minds are tamed and subdued by misfortune; but great minds rise above them.” —American writer Washington Irving (Legend of Sleepy Hollow) was born on April 3, 1783.
