University students from Ganze who had deferred their studies for lack of fees have received money from the area’s Constituency Development Fund. On Monday, Ganze MP Teddy Mwambire issued cheques for Sh3.4 million to 156 students. “Some of these students were in their last semesters but had to defer. Education is the only weapon that will alleviate poverty in Ganze. We want people to graduate in various fields to help Ganze,” he said at Ganze Boys’ Secondary School. Mwambire urged the students to give back to the communities once they complete their education. Beneficiary Philip Ndegwa of the University of Nairobi received Sh200,000. Kilifi County University Students’ Association chairperson Fikirini Katoi thanked the legislator for helping members. He said more than 600 students from the county deferred their classes last year for lack of fees. “Ganze has done it. The other six constituencies in Kilifi should follow suit. If we’re serious about development, we must ensure young people get education,” Katoi said. Mwambire also gave out cheques for Sh8.4 million to secondary school students. Kazungu Kadenge, 65, was among the beneficiaries.
