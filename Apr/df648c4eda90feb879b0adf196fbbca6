A former Telkom Kenya employee has sued Mathare North MP Anthony Oluoch for unfair legal fees. Adrian Sanita asked the court to scrutinise discharge vouchers used by the advocate in paying his dues. The dues arose from compensation by his former employer after the court found that Sanita and others were retrenched unfairly. The former employee of Telkom Kenya Ltd claims compensation cash was deposited into the advocate’s bank account and it was to be disbursed to a number of beneficiaries. The claimant says payments varied for individuals who were all at the same level of employment. Sanita says Oluoch deducted 30 per cent as advocate fees and taxes from the compensation, yet there was legal notice exempting taxes from the compensation money. “Oluoch’s law firm also deducted money for auctioneers and we don’t know at what point they instructed the auctioneers and the business they were meant to perform,” Sanita submitted in court. Sanita wants the court to set aside a purported consent by advocate Oluoch, terming it fraudulent as it bears forged signatures. “It is unfair for one to work for so long and fight a court battle, then an advocate gets half of the money,” he said. But Oluoch maintains that there was a valid consent, which was duly signed by all the clients he represented in the matter. He also says payments were effected and discharge vouchers were signed by clients. Oluoch says the clients were given an explanation as to how deductions were done, including the advocate fees. “Since the payments were made, no other person has filed a complaint except for the one herein,” Oluoch’s advocate submitted. He said the complaint is not in good faith. Justice Byram Ongaya of Employment and Labour Relations Court will on April 27 rule whether the consent is fraudulent or not.
