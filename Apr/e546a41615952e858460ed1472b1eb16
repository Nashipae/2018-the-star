Kenya’s Christine Ongare finally settled for bronze after succumbing to Northern Ireland’s Carly McNaul 5-0 at the Oxenfen Studios in the Gold Coast. The Ireland boxer dominated all the three rounds as all the five judges awarded her 30-27, 30-26, 30-26, 30-26, 30-26 against the Kenyan. However, Ongare had started well but as the bout progressed, she started getting tired as McNaul charged towards her. Ongare admitted that while she gave her best in the first two rounds, she could not take it anymore in Round three because she was tired. This was the only medal for Kenya in boxing after the rest of the boxers were eliminated in the earlier stages. “I am not really used to three bouts and the third round took a toll on me," she added.
