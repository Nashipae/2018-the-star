Google has announced taking down 3.2 billion advertisements in 2017 alone for violating their online advertising policies in their fight against ad fraud, malware and content scammers. The technology firm head of global product policy Jessica Stansfield said that top of the crimes noted in the fraud included advertising and phishing scams. “ We blocked 79 million ads in our network for attempting to send people to malware-laden sites, and removed 400,000 of these unsafe sites last year. And, we removed 66 million “trick-to-click” ads as well as 48 million ads that were attempting to get users to install unwanted software,” Stansfield said in a press statement. To further protect genuine publishers, the firm has announced removing 320,000 publishers from its ad network for violating publisher policies, and blacklisting nearly 90,000 websites and 700,000 mobile applications. “More frequently, we see violations of our scraping content policy. This type of policy violation occurs when bad actors try to make money as quickly as possible by copying news or content from other sites. In 2017, we blocked over 12,000 websites for “scraping,” duplicating and copying content from other sites, up from 10,000 in 2016,” she said. The firm has announced introduction of new policies that will address ads in unregulated or speculative financial products like binary options, cryptocurrency, foreign exchange markets and contracts for difference.
