Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho will fi nally get an offi cial residence after it’s construction was included in the medium term draft budget. His deputy William Kingi will also have a home. The construction will be done in two phases. The budget does not state the exact amount to be spent on the governor’s residence. The executive has been allocated Sh472 million. Sh387 million will be used for operational and maintenance costs while the rest will go to development. The governors residence is expected to be build with the Sh84.4 million development budget. The county will also buy a courtesy bus and media equipment. Assembly finance committee chairman Mohamed Hatimi yesterday said the proposed amount is “very little” compared to other counties. Nyeri will spend Sh200 million to build governor’s residence while Kilifi spent Sh140 million for the same. Former Meru Governor Peter Munya, now CS, allocated Sh300 million for a his residence in 2015. Joho has been living in his private home since he became governor in 2013. In 2013, reports emerged that he had allocated Sh390 million for his offi cial residence. “That was propaganda. We are very economical,” Hatimi said. Click here for the latest political news
