World half marathon record holder Joycline Jepkosgei completed a distance double after adding the 10,000m title at the Kenya Army athletics championships at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani yesterday. The world half silver medallist had on Wednesday clinched the 5,000m crown. Jepkosgei clocked a sluggish time of 34:52.4 to win the 25-lap race ahead of Peninah Kandie (35:07.4) as Jackline Chirchir completed the podium places in 35:30.0. Unlike in the 5000m race where she bid her time in the pack before striking, Jepkosgei surged to the front after eight laps with Valentine Chepkoech and Ether Chemtai right behind as the athletes went into single file by the start of the 11th lap. Kandie joined the leading pack at the halfway mark with none of the athletes willing to break away in the hot overcast sunny conditions. Kandie surged to the front in the 17th lap but Jepkosgei kept tabs as the two broke away from the rest of the field with eight laps to go. Jepkosgei hit the front with four laps remaining but Kandie was unable to respond but was still safe from the rest of the competitors and managed to add a silver medal to the one she had won in the 5,000m race the previous day. Jepksogei said she was using the championship to improve on her speed-work and was delighted with how things turned out. “I knew I had a good kick in the last couple of kilometres and this has given me confidence as I plan for road races later in the year,” said Jepkosgei. Little-known Eric Kiptanui cruised to victory in the men’s 5,000m race after clocking 13:34.4 with Cyrus Rutto a close second in 13:35.7 as Peter Ndegwa completed the podium placing in 13:36.8. Charles Simotwo won the men’s 1500m race in 3:40.5. Laban Kiplimo was second in 3:41.0 ahead of Nicholas Kiplangat (3:42.7). Mary Wanjiru took the women’s crown in 4.27.5 ahead of Judy Chepngetich (4:29.5) and Nancy Sang (4:31.5). The men’s 800m title went to Nicholas Kiplangat in 1:46.9 as Bernard Kipyegon (1:47.1) and Moses Kipkemboi (1.47.3) chased him home. Winnie Chebet won the women’s version in 2:09.3 with Rebecca Chepkemei second in 2:11.6 as Nelly Jeptanui settled for third in 2:12.7. Catherine Nandi topped the women’s 200m dash in 24.9 with Priscilla Tabunda (25.2) and Mary Tanui (25.4) behind. Charles Wamwea carried the day in the men’s category by clocking 21.0 with Gilbert Otieno second in 21.2 ahead of Samuel Ochukut who timed 21.4. Wamwea also grabbed the 100m title in 10.2 ahead of Otieno (10.4) and Emmnauel Letukunye (10.6). Tanui topped the women’s chart in the 100m dash in 12.2 with Petronila Muombe (12.5) and Tecla Cherotich (12.8) well beaten.
