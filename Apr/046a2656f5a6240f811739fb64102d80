Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka has urged leaders agitating for a Mulembe party to stop, saying it is ill-advised.Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula and his ANC counterpart Musalia Mudavadi unveiled the plans after a meeting at the weekend. The two pledged to forge  unity of purpose with their eyes on the presidency. They resolved to put aside any divisions that have stood in the way of the bid to galvanise the Luhya vote.

Kenya has 42 tribes... Let Musalia and Wetang’ula join other national leaders in ensuring the country moves in one direction.”Lusaka said he warned the two leaders against joining NASA, but the duo opted to “insult me”.“When we dissolved the New Ford Kenya party to be part of Jubilee, we had seen far. Had Ford Kenya, ANC and ODM dissolved to form NASA, Wetang’ula could not have suffered,” he said.

"I remember after I lost my seat, a very senior leader in this region sent me a message, saying 'what a relief'...I was in pain," the Speaker said.
