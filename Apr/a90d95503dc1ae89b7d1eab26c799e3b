MPs want President Uhuru Kenyatta to declare cancer a national disaster and inject more resources into research, screening, prevention, treatment and cure. Lawmakers yesterday backed a motion by Laikipia Woman Representative Catherine Waruguru to require establishment of a cancer fund to help Kenyans who cannot afford high costs of treatment. Every year, more than 28,500 people die of cancer; 78 people die daily. The numbers are increasing, largely because many people are too poor to afford even transport to health facilities. Palliative care is unthinkable, though not expensive. Some tests cost Sh13,000 and low- and middle-income earners — the majority of the population — cannot afford screening. Although the government says it has purchased equipment for radiotherapy and other treatment and equipped two county hospitals, this equipment lies idle for lack of trained operators. Kenya has only four radiation treatment centres, two of them in public hospitals in Nairobi. Even there, treatment and medication are far too costly. Therefore, Waruguru's motion is timely. It should be debated, passed and signed into law to save lives.
