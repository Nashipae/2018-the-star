Six former Siaya county officials, including Murang'a East deputy county commissioner Kepha Marube, were yesterday charged with forgery and flouting procurement laws. Marube was charged alongside Zakayo Ojuok, Tobias Oloo, Amos Okello, Thomas Adero and Collins Owino. They all denied the charges before Kisumu principal magistrate Patrick Olengo and were released on a cash bail of Sh1 million each. Marube served as Siaya county secretary during Governor Cornel Rasanga's first term. Ojuok served as a procurement officer, Oloo as supply chain manager and Adero as works officer. Okello was a member of the inspection and acceptance committee. They were charged with seven accounts of forgery and disregard of procurement regulations. Charges stated that Marube willfully failed to comply with the rules by awarding a Sh14.9 million tender to Samco Traders Limited on May 18, 2014. The tender was for the purchase, supply and installation of assorted sports facilities. Marube awarded the tender without evaluation and the approval of the tender committee. Oloo was charged with abuse of office. Prosecution said he used his office to improperly execute the award of the tender. Ojuok faced forgery charges. Prosecution said he made a false claim of a meeting of the tender committee that was relied on to award the tender. No meeting occurred on May 16, 2014 as Ojuok claimed. Adero was also charged with abuse of office for signing an interim certificate for the award of the tender. The certificate was used to pay Sh5.6 million to Samco Traders. Adero is accused of failing to visit the site to confirm if the works had already been done. Okello was also charged with abuse of office for issuing an inspection and acceptance report based on a fraudulent engineer's payment certificate. Prosecution said he knew that Adero did not visit the site. The case will be mentioned on May 2 before hearing starts on June 8.
