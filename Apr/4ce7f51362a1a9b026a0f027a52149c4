Young working men are not eating well. There is an increase in the number of under-nourished employed men, the Health ministry has said.The men are not starved, but choose to eat a meal a day. On the contrary, young working women were classified as obese.The Health ministry says 33 per cent of Kenyan women are overweight. Some 47 per cent of these women are in Nairobi and Kirinyaga counties.

Mugambi said women’s cases are different because they choose to cook - and eat the food. “This might be why we are seeing more obese women.” She called for more research to establish the exact reasons for under-nourished men and obese women.A study released by the World Health Organization last year showed Kenyan women are the ninth most overweight in Africa, which is attributed to poor nutrition.  Other counties that have a high number of overweight women are Mombasa, Nyeri, Kiambu and Murang’a.Mugambi said, “It could be the food environment. There are many fast food joints, which contribute. Use of sugars and fats is another factor.”Obesity and being overweight exposes one to diseases like hypertension and diabetes, which are expensive for the county and the patient to treat. Data from a government survey in 2015 showed 17.5 per cent of men and 38.4 per cent of women are either overweight or obese.
