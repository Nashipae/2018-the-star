You are more likely to suffer from high blood pressure and diabetes if you do 8 am to 5 pm job by sitting for long hours on your desk. Financial advisers are concerned about this increasing trend which they say is cultivating a sick workforce. Some employers say they are now cutting down their financial health budget because of the huge costs. A huge chunk of the money is used to procure medicines used to treat these diseases but can be saved if only the working class, took charge of their own health. “You might have a good health cover from your employer, but how you use it depends on your ability to value your health first. Why are people more keen to cure themselves but are not keen on putting aside money for emergency services?” Isaac Nzyoka, group managing Director of Health Business, UAP, Old Mutual Group posed. He spoke on Thursday during a panel discussion organised by Minet, an insurance firm that offers financial health advice and packages to companies and employees.

Minet CEO Sammy Muthui said that employers also need to cultivate a culture of wellness among their employees so that they can be more productive at work. “The cost of managing the preventable disease is increasing at an alarming rate. By the time people realise this, it might be too late because we are always thinking from a curative approach rather than a preventive one.” Muthui said. “When people go into retirement or are retrenched, they never think about tomorrow. In most instances, most people are added in WhatsApp groups or are called for barazas to help fund-raise to treat someone.” Patricia Kiwanuka, Managing Director and founder of revenue stream limited said. She added: “If you can worry about your children when you are working, and worry about your death when you are diagnosed with cancer, surely you had enough time to think about your life and plan for your life after employment." A 2017 survey by Consumer Insight showed that out of the 25 per cent of the respondents interviewed, 91 per cent have a health cover, a majority of who were covered by NHIF. Lack of enough money, knowledge and interest were cited as some of the major reasons why Kenyans view insurance as a non-issue.
