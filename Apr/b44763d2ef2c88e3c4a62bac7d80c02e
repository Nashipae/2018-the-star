The IEBC has collapsed. Three commissioners resigned on Monday. One quit last year. The chairman Wafula Chebukati and two commissioners are hanging on but they lack a quorum to conduct business. The CEO is suspended. To make matters worse, there is no official selection panel to choose new election commissioners. Chebukati and the two remaining commissioners have apparently indicated that they are ready to leave if they can negotiate a package. They have five years left on their contracts so in theory they could demand five years salary. But the commissioners themselves are partly, or largely, to blame for this crisis. They constantly fought and squabbled among themselves. We do not know the truth of what happened in the election because they lost their neutrality and adopted partisan positions. The commissioners failed in their duty. Under such circumstances why they should receive full compensation? They should be advised that they can face a tribunal with the prospect of no compensation, or accept a reasonable layoff package of three or six months salary.
