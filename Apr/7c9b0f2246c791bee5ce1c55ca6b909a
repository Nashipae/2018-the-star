The programme is a system that will provide healthcare and financial protection to all citizens of a particular country. UHC is part of Uhuru’s four key pillars in transforming the lives of Kenyans.
Other key pillars include raising the share of manufacturing sector from nine to 15 per cent of the gross domestic product, expanding food production and supply, as well as building 500,000 affordable houses by 2022.
According to the letter exclusively obtained by the Star, the doctors will arrive towards the end of May to allow quick deployment to rural areas currently neglected by local medics. It is believed local doctors prefer urban areas to maximise on returns.
“Following consultations with the President, he accepted the proposal for all 47 counties to pilot a minimum of 10,000 households and further directed the assessment of the service readiness and preparedness for the roll-out of UHC,” Health CS Sicily Kariuki told governors in a letter dated April 18 this year.
The letter was addressed to the Council of Governors Health Committee chairman Mohammed Kuti.
