The security detail of IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati could be restored by Friday, four days after it was clandestinely withdrawn by the State for unknown reasons. The security of two commissioners Ayub Guliye and Boya Molu was also withdrawn on Tuesday morning. IEBC communications manager Andrew Limo, however, told the Star on Thursday evening that there were indications the security of the electoral agency boss could be restored on Friday. “There are indications that security is being restored,” Limo said in a text. Limo did not, however, confirm whether the security of the other commissioners would also be restored. On Tuesday, Limo expressed concerns that the withdrawal of the security, including armed drivers, posed a security risk to the chairman and the commissioners.

The withdrawal of the security came just a day after three commissioners resigned saying their working relations with Chebukati was untenable. They cited, among other reasons, the compulsory suspension of CEO Ezra Chiloba which they said was a unilateral decision by the chairman but he passed it off as a collective agreement. Chebukati disputed this and said two of the commissioners, former vice-chairperson Consolata Nkatha and Paul Kurgat endorsed the vote to oust Chiloba at a past plenary meeting.
