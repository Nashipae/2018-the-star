Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho is still out of the country and reports by his administration that he returned during the Easter holiday appear correct. Joho has not seen in the county for over a month. Critics are piling pressure on the governor, asking him to end his “honeymoon” abroad and come back to serve Mombasa residents. But his administration said the critics are attention-seekers, who want to make a name by attacking the him, and one such critic is Jubilee activist Abdi Daib. Daib said, “Joho should end the honeymoon and ice-skating in the cleanest cities of the world and come back and clean the dirty county.” On Monday, a county official said Joho on Friday will attend a Water Conference in France.
