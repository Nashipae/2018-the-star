Torrential rains on Saturday forced mourners to take turns carrying a casket through a seasonal river for about a kilometre. This is after the hearse was unable to access the burial site in Mumoni subcounty, Kitui. Mourners waded through River Katse carrying the casket bearing the body of Jones Nzelu, 82. Earlier, some vehicles in the convoy got stuck in the mud and had to be pushed as the rains rendered the road to the burial site impassable. At a point, the convoy had to wait for the water in another flooded section of the meandering river to subside. The burial went without hitches once the casket reached the site.
