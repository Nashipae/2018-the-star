A judge has stopped the proposed sale of a property in Nairobi's Westlands area which was used to secure Sh118 million loan advanced to troubled Nakumatt. The property in question belongs to Park View Shopping arcade and is valued at Sh269 million. It was to be sold today (Tuesday). The property which measures 1.6946 acres is situated along Mwanzi road opposite Westgate shopping mall and is currently used as parking lot. The temporary order stopping the sale was issued yesterday by high court judge Fred Ochieng following an application by Nakumatt holdings administrator Peter Kahi. The administrator is opposed to the sale of the property in question which he terms it illegal. The decision by UBA bank to issue notice of sale is illegal because his consent was never sought, Kahi says. "If a company has a court appointed administrator one has to get the consent of the administrator to commence any legal action against the company," he argued. It was also argued that the sale, if allowed, will defeat the very purpose of appointing an administrator. According to court documents, the bank started the process of recovery after Nakumatt defaulted in paying the loan. And despite issuance of notice, the guarantor and Nakumatt did not bother to settle the outstanding loan, it was said. Consequently the bank said it is entitled to pursue the guarantor (Park View) to recover the loan. The bank is of the view that the administrator (Kahi) has no legal authority to stop it from selling the property. Only the guarantor has the legal authority to stop the sale. UBA bank argued that the guarantor is liable as long as the loan is unpaid. On January 22, 2018 the court put Nakumatt holdings under administration and appointed Kahi as administrator. On February 2 UBA kenya and Garam Investments auctioneers gave notification of sale of the property in question. The case will come up for ruling on May 9. Click here for the latest political news
