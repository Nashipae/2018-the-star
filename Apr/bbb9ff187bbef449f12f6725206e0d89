Police in Kilifi county have been accused of harassing mnazi (palm wine) sellers. Vocal Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa yesterday said police officers raid bars during legal operating hours and harass traders. The majority of traders are women, who depend on selling the drink to make a living. “Many children from poor communities are educated with money obtained from mnazi. Parents go through a lot of pain struggling to make a living,” Jumwa said. The worst-affected areas are Ganze, Rabai, Kilifi South and North, Malindi, Magarini and Kaloleni. But county commissioner Mutindika Magu denied police harass sellers. He said the palm wine business is regulated and traders must follow the rules. “One cannot take it from morning to evening and there have to be designated areas for selling it,” Magu said. Jumwa petitioned the county commissioner to intervene and stop rogue officers from harassing mnazi sellers. The police demand bribes and sometimes loot bars. “Liquor obtained from the coconut plant is not illegal, it’s a God-given, natural brew,” Jumwa said. She said the women selling palm wine comply with regulations. Regulations stipulate mnazi is to be sold between 5pm and 11pm. Jumwa said most traders close their bars by 8pm to avoid being harassed. She will team up with the county government and organise meetings with senior security officers to resolve the matter.
