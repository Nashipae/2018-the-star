Three KRA officials were arrested with a huge consignment of Mandrax at Eldoret International airport on Friday. They were nabbed after police acted on reports that the drugs, concealed as vitamins, were being trafficked at the airport frequently. A police source said that a similar raid was also conducted at a warehouse in Nairobiâ€™s Kasarani area. A man believed to be a kingpin in the drug business was arrested at the premises. The GSU were deployed to the Eldoret airport following a standoff between KRA officials and police officers stationed there. The standoff was as a result of the raid that exposed the collusion between the officials and criminals. Officials say the raid followed complaints of laxity by officials who facilitate criminal activities that expose the country to extreme danger. Click here for the latest political news
