Residents of Mandera and Wajir counties will not have electricity for the next two days, Kenya Power has said. In a statement on Friday, the supplier explained that floods affected transportation of fuel to generators in the counties. Sections of Garissa-Wajir road near Habaswein were flooded. "Our fuel tankers are currently stalled at the banks of Ewaso Nyiro river in Garissa," Kenya Power said, adding workers were looking for alternatives. The company assured customers living in off-grid areas that they will have sufficient fuel or continuous generation and supply of electricity. "We regret any inconvenience caused." Heavy rains and flooding have pounded parts of the county, cutting off roads and displacing thousands. Many have disappeared in the waters while others have been forced to swim through dirty water to get to their homes. Currently, many areas are flooded as several rivers burst their banks. Water levels in Tana River are above normal and could cause more destruction, officials say. April is the peak month for the long rains season which begins in March and ends in May. Most parts of Western and Central Rift Valley, and parts of Central Kenya and Nairobi, will receive adequate rains this season, reducing the possibility of food shortage later in the year.
