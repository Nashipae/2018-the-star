Lillian Muli, who is heavily pregnant with a baby girl, has savagely attacked keyboard warriors saying they are 'just sad, pathetic, insecure idiots, who have no self-worth'. "Some people out here desperately trying to get hits or gain relevance by maligning others names. Build your own brand don't use others' sweat to get to the top you will never get there that way! Actually, think of it this way it's the person you are writing about that people are interested in not you! How about you get a life than write about yours. But then again I wonder if anyone would even be interested in reading about a person as toxic as you...yawn it would be piriton overdose," she wrote.
