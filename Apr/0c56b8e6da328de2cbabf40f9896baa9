Kenya has made a new commitment to put at least 80 per cent of all people living in malaria prone areas on treated mosquito nets. The commitment was made during the Malaria Summit in London attended by 14 heads of state and government, including President Uhuru Kenyatta. In Africa, insecticide-treated nets have the greatest impact against malaria, accounting for an estimated 69 per cent of cases prevented. "I am committed to beating malaria in Kenya, the Commonwealth and beyond, and look forward to working with you all to deliver this shared goal,” President said during the summit.

Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki said the target was part of the Kenya Malaria Prevention Strategy 2014-2018 but was not achieved. "Kenya is yet to attain the set targets against these key interventions. For instance, while the strategy aims to have 80 per cent of populations at risk of malaria using appropriate interventions (including bed nets). Kenya has only achieved 52 per cent of these populations under appropriate interventions,” she said. Malaria prevalence is highest in western Kenya and the coast at more than 20 per cent, while national prevalence remains low at eight per cent.

"Further while the strategy aims to have 10 per cent of all children under five years with suspected cases of malaria receiving diagnosis by microscopy or rapid diagnostic test and prompt treatment, only 39 per cent of all children enjoy this right,” Kariuki said last week.
