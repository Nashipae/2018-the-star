Auditor General Edward Ouko says huge cash might have been lost through rampant pilferage and misappropriation at the Council of Governors. This comes barely a month after senators questioned the continued financing of the council. County Assembly and Investment committee chaired by Homa Bay senator Moses Kajwang’ directed the council to refund the counties all their annual contributions. In the 2016-17 report on the CoG’s secretariat, Ouko red flagged millions of irregular payments to workers and service providers. The CoG unjustifiably spent Sh31,142,450 on one lawyer, it says. The lawyer was handling cases involving the CoG, the Senate, the National Assembly and the IEBC. The council promoted and recruited staff and payments increased to Sh60,804,333, it says. Ouko said the Salaries and Remuneration Commission did not recommend this. The report also unearthed an irregular Sh7,671,260 for hiring a helicopter. It says the process was not backed by documents. “Documents in support of procurement and sourcing of the service provider whose contract was signed on September 15, 2016, were not provided for audit verification. Consequently, the propriety of this expenditure cannot be ascertained,” the report says. The auditor has also highlighted that the CoG secretariat faces eviction from its offices over rent arrears.
