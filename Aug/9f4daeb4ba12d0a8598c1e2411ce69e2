Newton Terer and a local chief were among five suspects arrested and detained in Eldoret over the loss of Sh6 billion at the National Cereals and Produce Board. The former NCPB managing director was in a list of seven suspects to be prosecuted over fraudulent payments for maize delivered to the NCPB stores. Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe and NCPB finance boss Kiprotich Ng'elechey were the first to be arrested in the swoop. Three others were also taken in. DPP Noordin Haji ordered the officials' arrest on grounds there is sufficient evidence to have them prosecuted for the said loss. The other suspects are traders implicated for colluding with officials at the Board to defraud the agency of billions of shillings in maize deliveries. They were held at the EACC offices in Eldoret town, the arrests bringing to ten the total number of suspects in custody so far.
