Top Kenya Cup sides are set to recall their big guns for the Kabeberi Sevens slated for this weekend at the Machakos Stadium. Table topping Homeboyz, who lead the log with 44 points following wins at the Prinsloo and Sepetuka Sevens last month, will have Kenya Sevens skipper Oscar Ayodi and Kenya 15’s winger Zedden Marrow back in the fold for the event. Head coach Paul Murunga said the return of Ayodi and Marrow will boost the side as they strive to keep ahead of the chasing pack in the circuit. “We have a good squad in terms of depth and talent and having Oscar back alongside the rest of the guys who have performed, will give the technical bench options,” added Murunga. He said the two wins in Nakuru and Eldoret were due to having good pre-season. “We started our training early and played in a couple of pre-season tournaments and that has helped us settle early and win the tournaments. Homeboyz face Nakuru, Strathmore and Menengai Oliers in Pool ‘A’. Mwamba, who lie second in the circuit on 38 points, will field Kenya sevens talisman Collins Injera and Billy Odhiambo for the Kabeberi event. Mwamba have lost both opening tournament finals to Homeboyz and tactician Kevin Wambua said the was optimistic of winning a leg of the circuit. “We have very young side and they have risen to the challenge by playing both finals. Collins brings a wealth of experience and leadership to the side and has been training while Billy has been out with an injury but looks sharp in training and will be a big boost for the side,” added Wambua. Wambua, back from a training stint in Christchurch, New Zealand with the famed Crusaders International High Performance Unit (IHPU), expects a competitive circuit. “All the teams are playing well and it boils down to how we execute the game in the two days tourney,” he added. Mwamba are in Pool ‘B’ and will face off with Impala, Blak Blad and Kisumu. Nakuru, Impala and KCB are set to tweak their squads for this weekend’s tournament.
