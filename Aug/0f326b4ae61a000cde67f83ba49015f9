A travel agency's employee was on Monday charged with defrauding her employer of $193,116 (Sh19,311,600) in an air ticketing deal. Eddie Murungi was accused of conspiring with Kennedy Atemba alias David Ambuku to defraud African Touch Safaris between July 13 and August 4 at the Indian High Commission Building along Harambee Avenue, Nairobi. Ambuku did not turn up for the plea taking. They allegedly conspired to defraud the company by means of signing a contract with the company using a non registered company - Kaoma Global Outreach International Limited. The two were falsely pretending they were in a position to market the complainant - [ATS] as a travel agent. Murungi, a senior consultant, faced additional charge of stealing the cash. Charges read that the money came to her possession by virtue of being an employee of the complainant. She denied the charges before senior principal magistrate Martha Mutuku at the Milimani law courts. Mutuku freed her on a Sh500,000 bond and an alternative Sh300,000 bail. The magistrate issued a warrant of arrest against Atemba, who was listed as the director of the Kaoma Global Outreach. He was allegedly called into the deal by Murungi to issue sale her employer's tickets. Four weeks after signing the deal, the management realised the debt had gone up which prompted the credit and sales managers to visit KGO International offices to issue them with invoices. They found the offices closed and Atemba told them on phone that he was busy elsewhere. The matter will be heard on September 22. Click here for the latest political news
