The government has allowed the disputed ring net fishing at Mayungu landing site in Malindi despite protests from some fishermen. The decision was reached during a charged meeting attended by top county and national government officials from Kenya Defence Forces and Kenya Wildlife Service. A majority of stakeholders voted in favour of the fishing method which is banned in many parts of the Indian Ocean along the Coastal line. However, Coast Assistant Director of Fisheries Collins Kambu Ndoro said ring net fishermen will only be done in the deep sea. He said anyone found catching fish in coral reefs will be arrested and charged. Further, he said ring net fishing will only be allowed from October to March. Ndoro said security personnel will be on high alert to ensure there is no fishing outside the designated areas. Village elders and fishmongers supported the finishing method. They said it will boost the economy and reduce crime among the youth. However, those opposing the method said it destroys corals, and the nets catch young fish. Zawadi Karisa supported ring fishing, saying it helps curb discrimination. "All women here depend on ring net fishing, those creating conflict are not locals.We want ring net to continue," she said. Beach Management Unit network chairman Charles Janji Nyale said the law must be followed in ring net fishing. Click here for the latest political stories
