Deputy President William Ruto and his allies should not make their 2022 ambitions look like a crisis for Kenyans, ODM national chairman John Mbadi has said. He urged Ruto and his supporters in Jubilee to stop focussing on 2022 politics, adding it is not part of the Big 4 agenda. Mbadi yesterday said Kenyans are interested in the development agenda. “They have been severally advised to slow down 2022 politics because they are mixing issues. But since they have ignored, we’re telling them to read the minds of Kenyans, which are not in a political mood,” he said. BUILDING BRIDGES Mbadi told Ruto and his allies to stop attacking opposition leader Raila Odinga during harambees. “Attacking Raila will not add them any value. They should know that people will receive and enjoy the money dished out in churches or schools during harambees. But the public knows they are walking a different path,” he said. Mbadi urged Ruto to take a break from 2022 politics and shift focus to the Building Bridges initiative to unite Kenyans. Building Bridges seeks to end ethnic antagonism, lack of a national ethos, divisive elections and build inclusivity. The task force has been seeking views on ways to deal with corruption. Mbadi said peace, unity and development are what pushed Raila and President Uhuru Kenyatta to have the handshake. WAR ON GRAFT His statement came after a group of Jubilee MPs allied to Ruto said the handshake deal is likely to interfere with Ruto’s bid for President. “Ruto and his team should know that what they say in public is not inspiring confidence in Kenyans. The minds of Kenyans are preoccupied with how to fight corruption and implement the Big 4 agenda. Their conduct does not resonate with them,” Mbadi said. “I appeal to the DP to control his allies because some say things which are likely to make him an enemy of voters.”
