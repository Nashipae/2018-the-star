IEBC chair Wafula Chebukati has assured a fair process and credibe results in the Baringo South by-election. The winner will succeed Grace Kipchoim who succumbed to colon cancer and was buried at her Kimoriot home in Mochongoi on May 5. "As you can see the sun is shining ... the weather is fair ... the commission will conduct a credible and fair process," Chebukati said at the Marigat Primary School polling station on Friday morning. During the general election in August last year, heavy rains left roads flooded and impassable, hindering the transportation of materials. Cynthia Kipchilat (Maendeleo Chap Chap), Paul Motoloi (Chama Cha Mashinani), Charles Kamuren (Jubilee) and Sylvester Sergon (Republican Labour Party) will face off in the contest. Chebukati acknowledged technical hitches with the KIEMS kits in the morning but said they were addressed. He said the entire process kicked off well at around 6am and is expected to end at 5pm. The turnout was low but he was optimistic that voter numbers would increase later in the day. Some 35,162 voters are expected to cast their ballots at 132 polling stations "The commission willl announce the results immediately after the tallying process is completed at Marigat Secondary School. We will announce the results even if [the process] ends at midnight," Chebukati said. The chair noted the electronic transmission of results in dispelling fears of irregularities. "Only vote counting is done manually and in the watch of the public and agents."
