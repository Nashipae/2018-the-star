Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission officers have pitched camp at the Bungoma county offices to investigate corruption claims. They have been at the offices from Thursday morning. The county has in the recent past been in the news for the wrong reasons after Soyisambu Mitua MCA Stephen Wamalwa blew the whistle over alleged fraud. Wamalwa cited a case in which Sh510,000 was paid to a hotel in Kisumu yet the Agriculture committee never participated in any meeting on the mentioned dates. The presence of the EACC detectives has caused panic among some officers in the procurement and finance department. “We have zeroed down on a cartel involving senior staff and some suppliers who have been engaging in dubious payments similar to the one at NYS scandal. Some people get paid yet they have supplied nothing," he said. The officer said there is enough evidence that public money has been misused. “We are investigating abuse of office and corruption because we have many petitions by members of the public on irregular appointments. Once investigations are complete people will be taken to court," an EACC officer said. Read: Bungoma MCA unearths assembly corruption scandal Click here for the latest political news
