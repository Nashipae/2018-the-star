Dairy farmers have been told to ensure safety and efficiency
in order to stay ahead of competition and run
competitive dairy operations. Caroline Edmond, the International
Dairy Federation director general said it is important for dairy farmers to be efficient
so that they deliver more quality milk and produce less foot prints in the environment. “We need safe and more sustainable products
to feed the growing population,” she said, adding that safety in the dairy sector
will be the key focus in the African Dairy Conference. She was speaking yesterday in a Nairobi
hotel while briefing the media on the three-day14th African Dairy Conference
and Exhibition. Dr Kipkirui Lang’at chairman of the Eastern
and Southern Africa Dairy Association said over 600 delegates will be attending
the conference starting today at the KICC to discuss among other issues harmonization
of standards in the dairy sector in order to facilitate trade. “Experts in the dairy sector will be sharing
strategic insights on how smallscale dairy farmers should ensure they produce quality
and safe products that meet the required standards. Thus will help African
farmers remain competitive in the global market,” he said. The conference will attract 600
delegates from 50 countries including dairy farmers, and will bring together
over 145 companies from 35 countries and more than 30 dairy experts. Lang’at said food safety will be the
central focus of the conference and farmers will get to see various technologies
that ensure quality and hygiene.
