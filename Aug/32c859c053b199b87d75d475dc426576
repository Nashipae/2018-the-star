The ramifications of dry coffers at Football Kenya Federation (FKF) have started to bite, forcing the national body to withdraw from hosting the Cecafa Senior Challenge for the second year in a row. Cecafa had agreed to hand Kenya the hosting rights after a successful tournament last year but the federation’s boss Nick Mwendwa announced their withdrawal yesterday citing lack of funds. “We have decided to cut down on the events that we are doing. We are not going to host Cecafa Senior Challenge this year and we have asked Cecafa to relieve us of that opportunity.” Mwendwa said the decision was arrived at following their struggle to clear debts accrued by the preceding regime, court cases and unpaid salaries for former Harambee Stars coaches Adel Amrouche and Bobby Williamson. “Our case against Amrouche is at the Court of Arbitration for Sports after we appealed when a one man bench at Fifa awarded him 600,000 dollars (Sh60m) earlier in the year. We will fight the appeal and see how it goes. Williamson has also gone to the labour court and his claim is Sh55 million,” he said. The FKF boss further disclosed that the federation was denied a chance to host the African Women’s Cup of Nations in November, thanks to poor facilities. The country was set to host the continental women’s showpiece after Caf stripped off Ghana the hosting rights and for the second time this year, the snail pace by the government to renovate the facilities saw the continental body deny Kenya the hosting rights. He, however, exonerated the government from the blame, citing their previous good relationship. "We all know that it is only Kasarani Stadium which fits the bill. The reason we asked to host this was because a third team gets the chance to play at the World Cup next year and I was hoping our Starlets can get the chance." He added: "I will not blame the government because I think they have been very helpful to us and we are talking with them."
