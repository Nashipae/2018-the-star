In the Country's capital , pedestrians continue to lead in fatalities with 184, followed by motorcyclists and passengers both at 32, drivers at 34, pillion passengers at 7 and pedal cyclists at 5.A  A previous report released in in June by NTSA covering January to May 2018 accident statistics revealed that Outering Road was Nairobi's most dangerous highway with 23 deaths.  This was attributed to the lack of footbridges and designated crossing areas.  However when NTSA launched its Northern Corridor and Nairobi County route mapping report last month, Thika Superhighway was ranked as the most deadliest road in Nairobi having 16 black spots.  In the report NTSA had recommend that to reduce the number of pedestrians deaths, more footbridges should be set up tn major city roads and also designated pedestrian crossings should be placed and marked on city roads.  However, a spot check by the Star had revealed that most pedestrians restrain from using footbridges due to insecurity, street children who have turned the facilities into homes and some footbridges being overtaken by hawkers.  Private vehicles top the list of most involved accident vehicles in Nairobi at 74, closely followed behind by PSVs at 70, commercial vehicles at 43, motor cycles at 25, Government vehicles at 4 and pedal cycle at 1.  Matatu Owner Association chairman Simon Kimutai had previously told the Star that the saccos have been having talks with the members on road safety measures and observance of traffic rules which has led to the reduce of matatu accidents in Nairobi.
