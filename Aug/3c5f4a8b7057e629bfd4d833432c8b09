Cotu Secretary General Francis Atwoli wants the crackdown on corruption extended to the NSSF. Atwoli claimed on Monday that he had evidence that workers' money is being looted at the National Social Security Fund. The Cotu boss said he and fellow NSSF trustee Jackline Mugo have, on several occasions, blown the whistle on looting but have been ignored. Atwoli said Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji and Director Directorate of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti should investigate the agency. He commended President Uhuru Kenyatta for efforts to end impunity, saying hisÂ directive for the demolition of buildings on riparian land will restore dignity in the capital city.
