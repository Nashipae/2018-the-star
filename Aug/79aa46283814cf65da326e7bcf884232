Nakuru Level 5 hospital will be upgraded to level six before the end of the year, Governor Lee Kinyanjui said. Plans are complete to upgrade other health facilities including Bahati, Subukia, Gilgil, Olenguruone, Molo and Naivasha to offer level four services. “The county is seeking to upgrade the hospital to offer level six services. The move will improve efficiency, offer better services and reduce the long queues at the facility,” Kinyanjui said during his State of the County address yesterday. Health CS Sicily Kariuki will tour the hospital this month to evaluate it. Once upgraded, the hospital will have the second biggest maternal health complex in the country, after Pumwani in Nairobi. It will serve five counties.
