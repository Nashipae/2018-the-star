Garissa is planning to set up a desk to look into gender-based issues following a rise in domestic violence. Cases of violence are being reported at the Garissa police station every week. Gender executive Zeinab Abdi yesterday said most women don’t know where to report. “We intend to train women, NGOs and other stakeholders to help those suffering in silence,” Abdi told the Star in her office. She attributed the rise in violence to lack of an office to handle such cases and illiteracy among women. Abdi said most cases happen in remote villages but are rarely reported because they are resolved through maslah - the traditional Somali way of conflict resolution. A woman was on Wednesday physically assaulted by her estranged husband in Madogo, Garissa town. The woman told the Star the husband beat her up for requesting for money to buy water from a nearby kiosk.
