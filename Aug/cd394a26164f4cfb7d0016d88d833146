Chandarana Supermarket bosses yesterday snubbed summons to appear before the National Cohesion and Integration Commission regarding a racially insensitive promotion. NCIC chairman Francis Kaparo said they will consider legal action to force the supermarket bosses to obey the summons and record statements.

Chandarana’s director Dipan Thakkar (pictured) did not issue any statement regarding the summons. However, one manager said they did not ignore the commission, but they received the invitation late. The management was summoned regarding a promotional email that appeared to suggest the supermarket would focus on white people in its marketing. “We are delighted to inform you that our supermarket chain, would like to give you free vouchers to winner/raffles/best performer/runners-up candidate in upcoming events. As we are now focusing on white people to ‘attract our supermarkets’ (sic),” the email reads in parts. Yesterday, an angry Kaparo said they wanted to give the senior management opportunity to tell their side of the story and formally respond to the allegations of racial bias in the chain’s marketing strategy. Despite the snub, Kaparo said they will still examine the offensive email and give the owners a fair hearing before taking appropriate action.
