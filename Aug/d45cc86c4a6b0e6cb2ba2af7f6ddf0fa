Deputy President William Ruto yesterday dismissed claims of cracks in Jubilee. He said the party is united and firmly under one leader — Uhuru Kenyatta. Ruto said JP was conceived and formed to unite the people and cannot have camps. He said claims he and his allies plan to take control of the party are generated by those who have all along held reservations about his ties with the President. “When we decided to bring our parties, TNA and URP, together in 2012, it was not by default. We decided to use them to unite the nation and end tribal antagonism and suspicion,” Ruto said at AIC Kamarich in Aldai constituency. He led a fundraiser for the church. The DP blamed the media for creating an impression that Jubilee’s lifespan is coming to an end. The primary aim of such news is to steer hatred and fear, Ruto said. “I know the same group of people has not rested and are behind all the fake news, opinion polls and headlines meant to depict me in bad light,” he said. Ruto said his detractors are sponsoring fake opinion polls and using all tricks to ensure his political future is bleak. He urged his supporters to be steadfast. Kenyans will decide who succeeds Uhuru, he said.

Ruto appealed to Nandi residents to focus on cash crops and use maize in their farms to prepare dairy feeds and other fodder, instead of growing for sale. He said maize and wheat farmers must learn from perennial marketing problems and target exports. “We can’t run away from the global and regional trade that has allowed free movement and marketing of certain crops under zero tariffs,” Ruto said.
