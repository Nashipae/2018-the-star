President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday witnessed the signing of an MoU between the Ministry of Transport and the Mediterranean Shipping Company for the revival of Kenya National Shipping Line. The MoU was signed by Transport CS James Macharia and Captain Giovanni Cuomo, the First Vice President of MSC, which is one of the leading global container shipping companies in the world. Speaking during the signing ceremony at State House, Nairobi, Uhuru said the revival of the shipping line was a priority for Kenya because it will create jobs for thousands Kenyans. “We are very keen to revive the shipping line. And we are confident that we can run the shipping line again,” he said. The Head of State welcomed the Government’s partnership with the Mediterranean Shipping Company in the revival efforts, saying he expects the relevant teams to work with dedication and speed so that the shipping line is launched soon. “This is a valued partnership between Kenya and the private sector. I look forward to launching the shipping line soon,” Uhuru said. In reviving KNSL through the partnership with MSC, the shipping line is expected to once again become an active participant in international seaborne trade which accounts for a significant percentage of Kenya’s total trade. The revival of the shipping line and the upgrading of Bandari College to a centre of excellence for maritime studies which was approved by the Cabinet this week is set to transform Mombasa into a trans-shipment hub.
