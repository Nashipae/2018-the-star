The management of Sinohydro quarry in Kilimambogo, Thika East, have cited business rivalry as the main reason for the suspension. The operations were suspended to give the National Environment Management Authority time to authenticate its compliance. The operations were suspended after residents demonstrated following a blast. Property was destroyed and residents were injured. But speaking in Thika town on Friday, senior supervisor Paul Kioko admitted that property was destroyed and said the company agreed to construct permanent structures. Kioko described the destruction as an accident which was handled maliciously through an ongoing feud with a rival local quarry director. “Nema officials visited the quarry twice since its closure and issued orders which we will follow. However, the three-month closure is punitive to the industry which has employed thousands of Kenyans,” he said. Kioko added that the closure may scare away foreign investors.
