Jambojet has flown 2.5 million passengers in its four years of operations, the airline said in a statement on Monday. The firm said it will have a 72-hour special fare of Sh3,000 one-way for 7,000 seats to all its Kenyan destinations. This is close to a 33 per cent discount on its lowest fare which is usually Sh4,500. CEO Willem Hondius said it was a breakthrough for the airline to hit such a major milestone. He said Jambojet reached its 1 million passengers milestone in February 2016. "In a little more than two years, the number of passengers flown has grown to 2.5 million," he said. "Our aim is to keep fares affordable making it a reality being part of the dream for many to fly." The 72-hour promotion will start on Tuesday August 28 until Thursday August 30, or when all 7,000 seats are sold out. Travel dates for the promotion are restricted to between September 10 and October 14. Available tickets are for the Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret, Malindi, and Ukunda routes. This is the second promotion the airline has run this year. The first being in April, where over 10,000 tickets were sold. The airline operates a total of 424 monthly flights from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, of which 248 flights are for the coastal destinations of Mombasa, Ukunda and Malindi. It recently increased its flight frequency between Nairobi and Kisumu from 20 to 24 per week. Read: Jambojet increases weekly flights to Kisumu Click here for the latest political news
