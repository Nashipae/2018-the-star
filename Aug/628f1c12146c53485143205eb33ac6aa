Bomachoge Chache MP Alfah Miruka on Thursday opposed a proposal by the Kenya National Parents Association that students in the country wear the same uniform. “The parents association needs to understand that uniforms are there for identity of schools. The proposal should be rejected by all,” Miruka said. The MP spoke at St Edward Nyabioto Mixed Secondary School in his constituency where he presented a school bus fully funded by the national government CDF kitty. He urged parents to concentrate their energies in moulding the character of their children to curb unrest, instead of dwelling on issues that cannot help the learners achieve their full potential. “Use of the same uniform will create more confusion in identifying and disciplining students who cause unrest,” he added. Miruka called on all education stakeholders to seek strategies to end unrest in schools. He added that he would spend 70 per cent of the fund to improve school infrastructure in the constituency. Miruka said he will buy eight school buses in his first term. Kisii Catholic Bishop Joseph Mairura, who was the chief guest, asked students to work hard and pass their examinations to show gratitude for the sacrifices their parents and guardians make. The bishop was accompanied by Kisii Diocese vicar general Father Jeremiah Nyakundi and parish priest James Obaigwa. Bishop Mairura praised legislator Miruka for buying a bus to help the St Edward students travel outside the county.
