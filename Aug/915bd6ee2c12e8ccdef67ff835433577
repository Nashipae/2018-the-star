Award-winning writer Yvonne Owuor was arrested in Lavington by City Inspectorate officers during the demolition of illegal structures on Friday. The Kenyan writer, who won the 2003 Caine Prize for African Writing for her story "Weight of Whispers", blamed her attack on mistaken identity by the ruthless city askaris. "So, Yvonne Owour, author of  Dust was clobbered and arrested yesterday for resisting arrest by kanjo - street slang for city askaris," read a tweet. It is said that Yvonne was waiting outside Lavington mall when the inspectorate officers descended on the informal traders located there. She did not run in the commotion as she had no idea what was happening. It was in the confusion that someone pushed her and got aggressive after she asked why people were being beaten. She was grabbed by a man who tore her clothes. At first, Yvonne says she thought she was being attacked by a gang, especially when the man was joined by other people in plain clothes. "They grabbed her phone, knocked off her glasses. She was terrified. Thought she was being kidnapped. She fought for her life as they dragged her off," a witness said. Yvonne, the witness adds, came to learn of what was happening when she got inside a van used by the inspectorate officials during the raid. She will be taken to the Nairobi county court on Monday and be charged be trading, dumping, assault and obstructing justice. Click here for the latest political news
