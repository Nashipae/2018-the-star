Uncovered manholes in Thika town have sparked an outcry and residents are demanding to know what happened to Sh60 million allocated for theÂ purchase of covers. They have asked the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate how the Kiambu government used the cash. Chairman for tuk tuks association in the town John Kamau blamed elected leaders for negligence. He said since they have abandoned voters they will be kicked out in 2022. Kamau wants county officials held accountable over the cash. He said should anybody fall into the manholes and get injured, they must be compensated. Thika businessman John Ngugi said the open manholes damage vehicles which get stuck in them. Residents said the manholes are dangerous to children and some people using them to dump garbage. Contacted, Kiambu Roads county executive Henry Wainya promised to respond to the allegations. However, by the time of going to press he was not picking calls. Click here for the latest politicals news
