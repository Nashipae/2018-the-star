Governor Mike Sonko on Tuesday suspended an employee of the Urban planning department for approving construction of the Southend mall. John Ojwang was asked to step aside over his role in the approval of the building which was demolished on August 8 in the operation to reclaim riparian lands. The officer is also accused of approving the construction of Gem Suites in Riverside estate. His suspension follows preliminary investigations ordered by Sonko in line with his promise that those who irregularly approved the works will be held responsible. The county government, in a statement, said the officer has been issued with a 14-day notice to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against him. Among punishments proposed in the notice includes termination of the officer's employment if the probe on the matter reveals he has a case to answer. "The county government has noted that most of the approvals were given in the 1980s and 1990s," Elkana Jacob, director governor press services, said. "These were mainly by staff who have since retired or left City Hall." The demolitions were initiated under the Nairobi regeneration project. The concerned task force is reclaiming Nairobi River and its tributaries which have been polluted with dumping and encroachment.
