The Directorate of Criminal Investigations is probing the suspected loss of more than Sh36 million at the Milimani law courts. The money is believed to have been swindled by corrupt judicial officers through fraud. An internal audit covering January 2016 and December 2017 has exposed the multimillion-shilling fraud. The report by Judiciary Directorate of Audit and Risk Management flagged multiple transactions revealing the loss of Sh36,000,334. Chief Registrar Ann Amadi has written to the DCI to start investigations. “We request your office to take necessary action on those found culpable,”  reads Amadi’s letter  to the DCI.

The DCI will need documents pertaining to the transactions. A similar report has been filed before the judiciary Ombudsman. It details how judicial staff pocketed the millions of shillings through fake receipts, alterations and double payments. More than 300 fake receipts are said to have been issued at the Commercial Division. Those behind the scam issued the receipts but failed to record in the counter book as expected. More money was lost at the Civil Division, which has a deficit of more than Sh498 million. At the Environment Division, about Sh7.5 million cannot be accounted for.
