Nairobi governor Mike Sonko has maintained the multi-billion shillings Oshwal Centre will be demolished because it is on a riparian land. Sonko on Friday said it sits on top of the river and will not be spared in the ongoing demolitions. The governor said the regeneration committee has recommended demolition of about 4,000 buildings which are either on riparian land or along the Nairobi River. "We have already issued a notice to Oshwal management to vacate their property. We don't want to be malicious, we shall give them enough time to remove their belongings," he said. "We want to be as humane to avoid subjecting people to more losses". Sonko also reiterated that part of Taj Mall along Outering Road will also be brought down.

Sonko's statement comes as police say they have launched a manhunt for National Environment Management Authority and county officers who approved the buildings. Police spokesperson Charles Owino said a special team has been formed to receive complaints on approvals. Click here for the latest political news
