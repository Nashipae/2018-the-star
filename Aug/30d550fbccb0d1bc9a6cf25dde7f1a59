The National Environment management Authority will demolish more than 27 houses on riparian land in Eldoret. Uasin Gishu Industrialisation executive Emily Kogos yesterday said the buildings are located along Sosiani River, which runs through the town. She said owners have been notified. The county government had said demolitions of all illegal structures and kiosks in Eldoret will proceed despite protests from a section of residents. In the past three days, 10 structures on road reserves were pulled down. Former Uasin Gishu governor aspirant Bundotich Kiprop, popularly known as Buzeki, has opposed the demolitions in Nairobi and other parts of the country.  He said the government should negotiate with owners to come up with amicable solutions, instead of ruining investments. The businessman said government officials approved some of the buildings and destruction would not be the best way to solve the problem. “We can have a conversation on everything. If mistakes were done, we can find better ways out rather than demolishing property, thereby making our country as a hostile place for investment,”Buzeki said. But Kogos said they are acting within the law. “We’re set to attain city status. We have to replan the town so land is used in line with regulations,” she said at the launch of City Walk Fashion Wear Shop in Rupa Mall. “We need investors and have to ensure our town is suitable to attract both local and foreign investment.”
