Health services have not fully resumed in most facilities in Nyamira even after striking nurses signed a return to work deal. The medics have been on strike for over two months. At the Nyamira county referral hospital is the most affected, only a few health workers resumed work after the deal was signed on Thursday. The nurses, through their National Union, signed a return-to-work formula with the County Government represented by County Secretary Eric Onchana. According to the agreement, the nurses who have been on strike will be paid their dues despite earlier threats that they would not be paid for the days they were on strike. "There will be no individual who shall be victimized for participating in the strike," read part of the agreement. Among other resolutions included constitution of a framework to communicate properly issues relating to salaries and employee affairs; remittance of statutory deductions from staff salaries to relevant institutions and operationalization of offices of county counsellors and county industrial relations officer. The KNUN Nyamira branch secretary Richard Oruta ordered all the nurses to report to their working stations as from Friday 24th at 8 am. However, the county executive committee member for health Douglas Bosire warned said the medics should resume duty immediately. "We agreed that the medics should end the strike and by now all of them should have been at their places of work. I do not understand why up to this time our facilities are lacking health workers," Bosire said. Other facilities affected are Nyamaiya health centre in West Mugirango constituency, Ekerenyo Sub County in North Mugirango and Nyamusi health centre. Click here for the latest political news
