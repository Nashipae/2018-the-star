A university has appealed for help to reclaim land encroached upon by private developers. Murang’a University of Technology council chairman Joachim Osur said an attempt by the institution to erect a perimeter wall has been hampered by the grabbers. Speaking during a graduation ceremony on Friday, Osur appealed to both the national and county governments to assist the institution to reclaim its land. More than 10 developers have grabbed part of the 70 acres belonging to the institution, Osur said. Some have built permanent structures. The university started reclaiming its land mid last year when it started constructing the wall, which prompted ownership battles. Vice chancellor Dickson Nyariki said the Murang’a police station quarters and Technology Primary School also are on its property. Murang’a governor Mwangi Wa Iria said the county government will champion the bid to reclaim the university’s land.
