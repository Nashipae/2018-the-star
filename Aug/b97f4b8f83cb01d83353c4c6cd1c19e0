Residents of Gikono village in Murang’a have now changed tune and welcomed the sanitary landfill set to be put up in the place. They had previously rejected the landfill, saying it would pollute the environment and contaminate groundwater, which they use through boreholes. Residents had urged the Nairobi Metropolitan Services Improvement Project, which is behind the project, to find an alternative site. Namsip had to conduct numerous public forums to enlighten residents on how the project will operate. But in a public participation forum held in the proposed site in Gikono on Wednesday, residents said they fully support the project. But they asked the government to initiate development projects in the area. Resident Muhia Nguku said they want more access roads and boreholes in the village. Namsip is in the process of tarmacking the 4.5km Kabati-Gikono road and has pledged to sink a borehole. The Sh1 billion facility will process more than 250 tonnes of organic waste produced in Murang’a county everyday. The waste will be buried and compacted in the facility that will be operational for 20 years. It will be managed by Namsip for a period of one year before it is handed over to the county government. The sanitary landfill was initially meant to process waste from five counties under the Nairobi Metropolis.
