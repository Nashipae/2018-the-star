KeNHA has reappointed Peter Mundinia as the authority's Director General for a second 3-year term effective August 2018. In a statement on Monday, chairman Erastus Mwongera said Mundinia has been instrumental in implementation of the Board's policies. He said the Kenya National Highways Authority boss has also been at the forefront in ensuring that all projects are implemented as planned. "He has superintended over implementation of a new organisational structure aimed at improving the Authority’s effectiveness and efficiency." "This has been a key focus area for the board following the re-categorisation of KeNHA by the government from Public Service category 3A to Category 7A1," he said. Mundinia has been at the helm of KeNHA since August 2015. He is a member of the Kenya Institute of Management. Mwongera praised the director for his accomplishments in completion of key roads among them Dongo Kundu bypass in Mombasa. He was hailed for the works on Voi – Mwatete and Mwatete – Taveta Road corridor, the Merille River- Marsabit- Moyale road, Webuye – Kitale road, Sotik – Ndanai – Gorgor road, and Masara – Suna – Kehancha road. The chairman further lauded Mundinia for helping the authority enhance resource mobilisation from the private sector under Public Private Partnerships (PPP) and Annuity Framework. "The first PPP road, which is at Bid Evaluation stage, is the dualling of the Nairobi – Nakuru – Mau Summit Road, whose commitment is expected in the coming year," he said. The chairman said that under Mundinia’s watch,  compliance rate to axle load limits has been a key result with over 95 per cent along the Northern Corridor. "The Director General has also embraced innovation and technology through the ongoing implementation and installation of virtual weighbridge stations within the national road network."
