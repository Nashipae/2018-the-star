The mutilated body of an unidentified woman was found on the banks of River Yala in Kakamega on Tuesday. Sand harvesters stumbled on a bag that they found suspicious near Lidambitsa shopping centre. In it was the body, with the head and feet missing. Western Regional DCI boss David Cheruiyot said initial investigations showed the woman may have been murdered elsewhere. "We are probing the incident although we are facing difficulties because there is no head. We will use fingerprints to identify her," Cheruiyot said, adding she may have been in her 40s. Police took the body to Kakamega County General Hospital mortuary. Residents decried a rise in insecurity in the area. Click here the latest political news
