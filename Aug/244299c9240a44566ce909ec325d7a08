An official of Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims has called on two warring groups that led to the closure of a Narok mosque to embrace dialogue. The mosque was closed on Monday after one group accused the other of radical teachings. Narok North Deputy Commissioner Ronald Mwiwawi said the two factions failed to provide sound leadership. “We will re-open it once we prove that they are preaching the right doctrine and that they are not compromising security,” said Mwiwawi. SUPKEM’s head of strategy and partnership Hassan ole Naado while attending Eid-Ul adha ceremony at Narok stadium on Tuesday said SUPKEM is ready to mediate between the two sides and have the Mosque reopened soon. Naado was accompanied by Narok SUPKEM Youth Representative Hussein Ahmed. “It is unfortunate that these two groups are fighting over ‘petty issues’ which was not worth the closure of the mosque,” said Naado. Naado said this is the second time in the history of Kenya that a mosque is closed after Masjid Musa in Mombasa. “In Muslims, when there is wrangle in leadership, the believers are not part to that but is the mandate of those in position to end their differences and forge ahead united. We are working round the clock to ensure it is reopened tomorrow,” said Naado. Click here for the latest political news
