 Youth from Kakamega, Bungoma and Siaya counties in Western Kenya want their governments to assign them 35 per cent of the agricultural development budgets. In their declaration after a two-day conference on agri-business at Bukura Agricultural College that ended on Friday, the youth also want the three governments to enact effective youth agribusiness policies and legislation in line with national and international policies. The youths also want the three counties to fully involve them in formulation and implementation of enacted policy documents. They also said that access to land and finances should be considered by their respective governments for youth development projects.
