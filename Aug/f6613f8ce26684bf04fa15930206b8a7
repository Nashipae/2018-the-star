Thousands ofÂ Kenyan boys had a blessing of milk and beer sprayed on them as part of a rare Maasai ethnic community initiation ceremony to mark their passing into early manhood. The colourful event, in Kajiado County, in the country's Great Rift Valley, happens just once every five to ten years for boys aged between nine and 15. In the Maasai tradition, a boy's "age set" is a critical.

All the boys painted their heads with ochre, a deep red pigment made from clay. Those initiates chosen to be future leaders of the age group were marked by elaborate white paint patterns on their faces and bodies.

"The ceremony is called 'Il Mirisho' which means people who have won...(within) five years they all will be circumcised and recognised as a moran," said community elder Ole Sakaya Matini.

Elders put rings made out of the bull's leather on the fingers of the boys, who were also smeared with oil. In the last part of the ceremony, elders sprayed the milk-beer combination onto the boys as another blessing.

The name chosen for this group, he said, is "Ilmemiri" -- meaning "people who have won", or "people who cannot be defeated".
