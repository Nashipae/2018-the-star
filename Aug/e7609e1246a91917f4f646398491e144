Nairobi business owners have until August 10 to pay all debts to the county government. These include land rates, unified business permit, advertisement, rental and liquor licence fees. “Nairobi County Government wishes to notify all residents and business owners who have defaulted on rates, fees and charges due to Nairobi county to pay all outstanding bills before August 10,” read a notice in a local daily yesterday. “On the lapse of this notice, the government will initiate enforcement measures to recover all revenue due to the county, including penalties and interests.” The notice said the county government does not intend to grant any rates and interest waivers. The county is seeking to improve its revenue collection and services. The county missed its 2017-18 revenue target by Sh9 billion. As of June 29, the county had collected Sh8.2 billion and had expected to hit Sh8.5 billion against a target of Sh17.2 billion by the close of the financial year on June 30. The former acting Finance executive Charles Kerich and Finance committee chairman Robert Mbatia said the prolonged electioneering period and post-election protests in the capital affected collection. Land rates have been the largest revenue stream, generating Sh10.27 billion over the last four financial years. The unified business permit was introduced in October 2016 by Governor Evans Kidero’s administration to allow traders to make one application to cover all operational requirements.
