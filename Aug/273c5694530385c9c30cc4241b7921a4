Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has ordered the waiver of all bills for patients who have been at Mbagathi Hospital for more than a month. Sonko said on Monday that all patients, whose bills are to be cancelled, should be discharged immediately. He issued a list of eight people who are among those unable to pay their bills. They are Virginia Mumbi, Carolyne Mwende, Mary Achieng’, John Ngashai, Cosmas Kioko, Susan Wanjiku, Jane Wavinya and Margaret Oloo. Sonko asked Health Chief Officer Mahat Jimale to make sure they are released immediately. The county chief said Jimale should liaise with Mbagathi's Medical Superintendent Joseph Karani to ensure the order is executed. The directive came a day after the Governor's impromptu visit of the hospital. It was reported in July that congestion at the hospital had forced mothers to share beds. The management and medical staff admitted facing difficulties attending to mothers. When the Star visited the hospital in the company of health officials, each bed had four mothers. Some in labour were waiting outside the room. A month earlier, medical superintendent Loice Mutai was sacked for alleged incompetence following complaints by patients and medial staff.
