EACC officials on Tuesday raided Kericho county procurement offices to start investigations into the Sh100 million Kerenga Airstrip expansion tender. The anti-graft agency made the impromptu visit after Belgut MP Nelson Koech wrote to the commission alleging that the tender was exaggerated. Kerenga Airstrip was set to be upgraded to an international airport. The county government had also acquired land from Unilever Tea Kenya for the proposed airport’s runway. The commission said it will seek orders to freeze the account of the officers linked to the controversial tender. In December 2017, Kenya Air Force officers from the Eastleigh Air Base in Nairobi and Kericho county officials said they had finalised a feasibility study and given the greenlight for the start of construction works.

The MCAs demanded the executive focus on the provision of clean water, building roads and ensuring there are enough drugs at the health facilities.
