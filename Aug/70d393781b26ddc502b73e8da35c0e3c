Garissa county yesterday  launched an anti-gender violence group in a bid to contain spiraling number of gender-based violence cases across the seven subcounties. National Gender and Equality Commission acting chairperson Florence Wachira said gender-based violence is not limited to women. She urged the group to not only focus on preventive measures, but also the root causes of violence in the society. County Gender executive Zeinab Digale said the launch was a historic milestone that will help in reducing the number of gender-based violence cases in the county. She said violations on the basis of gender is a human rights issue that ought to be supported by all stakeholders. “We have witnessed so many cases of gender-based violence in our homes and if we remain silent about it, we would be accomplices in creating impunity in our society,” Digale said. She said the county administration will fully support all anti-gender violence programmes in the county. The launch was facilitated by the county government in collaboration with the National Government Equality Commission and NGOs including Womankind Kenya, UNHCR, Red Cross, Aga Khan Foundation, Unicef, Action Aid and Islamic Relief. The county assembly recently passed the creation of a gender desk to ensure victims get justice. Garissa county commissioner Joshua Chepchieng warned elders against using ‘maslah’, the tradition way of conflict resolution.
