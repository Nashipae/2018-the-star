Those who write reports accusing the Kenya Defence Forces of engaging in illegal  charcoal and sugar in Somalia are envious. These were the words of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s ambassadorial nominee to Turkey, Lieutenant-General Johnson Ondieki. He appeared before the Kato Ole Metito-led National Assembly Defence and Foreign Relations Committee yesterday. Ondieki was asked to explain his sacking as  the head of UN’s military force in South Sudan in 2016. He was asked to justify Kenya’s continued stay in Somalia, as well why UN monitors are not allowed in Kenyan held camps. “We went to Somali because we were aggrieved. We are still there because we have not accomplished the mission,” said Ondieki, who was among the first ground troop commander during the Linda Nchi Operation. “Linda Nchi was a successful mission. We joined the Amisom Force on the AU request. Once an army integrates to AU or UN  force,  the rules of engagement change.” Ondieki added that once the integration is done the forces take commands from the AU. The nominee from Nyamira’s net-worth is Sh110 million. He boasts of 36 years of service to the military. Ondieki said when they went into Somalia, the charcoal business was ongoing, but not with KDF. “The discipline and training we have is an envy to most of the countries; anybody will do anything to malign us. When people make reports ... we must check the background of who is doing it and why. Those reports raise questions.” Read also: Muhoro defends DCI work, denies fraud claims Click here for
