Police are investigating a probable murder-suicide case in Tambach, Keiyo North. It is believed that Hillary Chengwony, 34, killed his cousin and injured two women before taking his own life at Kokwao village on Thursday night. Area police
boss Mwenda Meme said they were investigating the circumstances under which
Chengwony killed Edwin Kiptoo, who was termed his confidant. He said Kiptoo died of excessive bleeding from deep panga cuts to his head. “Chengwony called his friend Sammy Kipsang and informed him that he had killed Kiptoo. He asked Kipsang to report the matter to the police,” Meme said. "Police went to scene and found Kiptoo’s body lying in a pool of blood and Chengwony missing.” He said they found the man's body hanging from a tree in a bush near his home on Friday. Meme said
the two women who survived the 11pm ordeal were traumatised but would help police. He said they were yet to establish what the people were doing in Chengwony's house before the tragedy. The women were taken to Iten County Referral Hospital and the body to its mortuary. Click here for the latest political news
