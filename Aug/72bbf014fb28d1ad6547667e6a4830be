Nairobi Central OCPD Robinson Thuku has been ordered to record Central Police station OCS Simon Kerich’s statement over assault claims by a suspect. Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi directed Thuku to hand over the statement to Capitol Hill police station boss Caroline Kipruto. Kipruto is investigating claims by suspect Caroline Nthumbi who has alleged to have been assaulted while in custody at the Central police station. Sate counsel Kajuju Kirimi on Thursday said Kipruto had recorded statements of several police officers at the station but could not investigate Kerich because they are in the same rank. She sought to have the statement recorded by a senior officer. Thuku must have complied with the order before Wednesday when the matter will be mentioned to receive Kipruto’s report of investigations on Nthumbi’s claims. Nthumbi’s lawyer Kirathe Wandugi said a medical report from Mbagathi Level 4 Hospital indicated she was tortured. Click here for the latest
