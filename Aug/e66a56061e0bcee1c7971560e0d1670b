Former Kakamega senator Boni Khalwale has opposed reintroduction of zoning within the sugar belts. He said farmers and private millers such as Butali and West Kenya would suffer. “Why is zoning not imposed on maize so farmers in Trans Nzoia only sell their produce to millers within their county?” he asked. Khalwale urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to stop its implementation. Public millers had blamed cane poaching for their financial woes. They said supplies to their factories had significantly reduced and demanded zoning to protect their out-grower territories.
