Catching up with and over taking Gor Mahia might be asking too much of Bandari but the dockers showed they won’t relent in what looks like an impossible quest as they beat Tusker 1-0 in Ruaraka yesterday to fasten their grip on second spot in the SportPesa Premier League. Yemi Mwana scored the lone goal for Bandari who have now won four matches on the bouncy run that in any other era would have made them firm favorites for the championship. With seven matches to play, Bernard Mwalala’s charges are on 48 points, 11 adrift of the league leaders who have played three fewer games. Meanwhile, AFC Leopards moved into third place as they emerged victorious over Nakumatt in a six-goal thriller at Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos yesterday. The 4-2 win for Rodolfo Zapata’s men came courtesy of an early goal by Jaffery Owiti, a double from Ezekiel Odera and a second half strike from Marvin Omondi. Joe Waithira and Brian Nyakhan responded for Nakumatt either side if halftime. Mathare United snapped up their eight-match winless run with a battling 2-1 come-from-behind victory over Kariobangi Sharks. Eric Kapaito had put Sharks ahead but Chrispin Oduor leveled for the Slum Boys 10 minutes to half time with Abdul Ahmed completing the turnaround with an 84th minute winner. Ulinzi Stars slumped to a surprise 1-0 defeat at the hands of Sony Sugar. Enoch Agwanda scored in the first half stoppage time to give Sony a third win on the bounce which all but assured them of a place in the league next year. Wazito, meanwhile, gave their survival chances a shot in the arm as they thrashed fellow strugglers Thika United 3-1. The three points enabled them to move off the bottom of the table, now occupied by their victims Thika.
