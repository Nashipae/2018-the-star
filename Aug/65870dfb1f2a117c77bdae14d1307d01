National Hospital Insurance Fund is targeting to enrol over 360,000 elderly people for Universal Health Coverage by 2022 at an annual cost of over Sh2 billion. It has further expanded the scope of the programme to cover elderly persons aged 65 years and above. The plan includes providing medical cover for orphans, persons living with severe disability and vulnerable people. NHIF assistant manager for National Programmes Julliet Maara said the programme, funded by the World Bank, was launched in 2015 on a pilot basis. She said the Health Insurance Subsidy Programme has witnessed phenomenal success leading to expanding its scope country wide. "The numbers of those covered has increased from 21,000 people to 181,000 as at June 2018." "Going forward, we plan to scale up this programme and ensure the elderly and vulnerable persons have comprehensive access to medical services despite their financial limitations," Maara said in Nairobi on Monday. All the beneficiaries of this program are covered by the Supa-Cover Scheme and are brought on board through the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection. "The beneficiaries do not pay for the cover nor for the services at the Health facilities," Maara said. She noted that more than nine million Kenyans are still vulnerable and need to be enrolled into the scheme. Some of the benefits entitled to the beneficiaries include, prescribed laboratory and x-ray investigation services, packaged services among them Radiological Services (X-rays, MRI, CT-Scan). The cover will also cater for Oncological Services (Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, brachytherapy for cervix and prostate cancer) as well as renal services. Click here for the latest political news
