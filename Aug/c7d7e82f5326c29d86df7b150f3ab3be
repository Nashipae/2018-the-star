The 23-year-old man who bragged of sexual encounters with minors on Facebook claiming he could not be arrested was yesterday charged with child sex tourism. William Hanga was charged with “publishing information that is intended to promote or facilitate conduct that would constitute a sexual offence against a child”. The Wells Fargo employee denied the charges before chief magistrate Francis Andayi. Hanga allegedly published his picture between August 10 and 19 in a compromising position with a minor he said was a Form II female student.
