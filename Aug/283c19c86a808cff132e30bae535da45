Police in Elgeyo Marakwet have launched investigation into a puzzling theft of a vehicle belonging to a county government official in broad daylight. The Toyota Probox was broken into and stolen outside the Elgeyo Marakwet county headquarters in Iten on Thursday afternoon. Keiyo North police boss Mwenda Meme said the owner of the car was out for lunch and upon return, he discovered the vehicle was missing. Meme said police are suspecting a county worker might be behind the theft. He said DCI detectives traced the car’s movements to the Elgeyo Marakwet – Uasin Gishu border a few hours after it was reported missing. The offices are secured by administrative police officers and a security firm, raising questions on how the vehicle was stolen. "The police were informed that the car's door lock was faulty. That is why we suspect the thief was someone close to the owner and was aware that one door had no lock," Meme said. The OCPD said the vehicle owner reported the loss hours after the vehicle had been stolen. "Had he reported immediately, the car could have been found," Meme said. Timothy Kwambai, the owner of the stolen vehicle, said the vehicle’s number plate has been circulated as DCI continue pursuing the car thieves. In June, a saloon car belonging to a patron was stolen outside Champions Hotel and Club. Click here for the latest political news
