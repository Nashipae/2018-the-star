A man hanged himself after stabbing his mother-in-law to death  in Makithea village, Kitui  county. The Mwingi trader had travelled   on Tuesday night to Kaningo in search of his estranged wife who  had returned to her parents’ home following  a dispute. Kaningo chief Samson Kitheka said the incident took place at around 1.20am yesterday. He said the businessman was believed to have been enraged that his wife had fled their matrimonial home and was reluctant to return. “The man arrived at his in-laws at around 10pm on Tuesday night,  but found his wife absent. After  spending  some time  with the children  without their mother  returning,  he left behind a message  that  he would be back to thoroughly punish her,” the chief said.

When she  ventured out to  find  out where  the smell was  emanating  from, she was  attacked  by  the husband with a sharp knife and she wailed for help,” Kitheka said on the phone. The chief said the man attacked  his mother-in-law as she tried to  rescue her daughter. “The man  who had already severely stabbed his  wife and daughter then turned the knife on the mother-in-law and stabbed her in the abdomen,”  Kitheka said. He said the woman collapsed  and died. The chief said after  killing  his mother-in-law, the man fled to a nearby farm and  hanged  himself. “The  woman  and  his daughter survived the attack  but suffered serious stab wounds,” Kitheka said.
