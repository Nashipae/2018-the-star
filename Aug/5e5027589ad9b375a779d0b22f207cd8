EACC detectives have arrested Embakasi North MP James Gakuya over claims of corruption. The legislator was taken to the Integrity Centre for interrogation after his arrest on Wednesday. He is accused misappropriating public funds worth Sh40m allocated for road construction for the Financial Year 2014/15. "Investigations established that three companies associated with Gakuya were awarded contracts for the construction of the roads in Embakasi North," EACC said in a statement. The companies in which Gakuya is a signatory to the bank accounts were paid a total of Sh40 million. Gakuya is to be charged alongside six others. Only four out of the six suspects have been arrested while three others are still being sought by the commission. They are Cleopas Omariba (an accountant), Leah Guchu (fund account manager), Embakasi North chairman Richard Chuchu. They will be charged with various offences including "conflict of interest and wilful failure to comply with the law/procedure relating" to procurement. In 2015, the MP was arrested and charged with fraudulently selling a property to another MP. Click here for the latest political news
