The rise in global fertiliser prices will see smallholder tea farmers pay more than last year, Kenya Tea Development Agency announced yesterday. Lasts year the agency distributed a 50kg bag at Sh1,730 but this is expected to rise to Sh2,000. The average market price was Sh2,800. In 2016, farmers bought a 50 kilogramme bag of fertilizer from KTDA at Sh1,493. The agency said the landed cost for a tonne of fertiliser at the Port of Mombasa rose to $289.5 (Sh28,950 ) compared to $252 (Sh26,032 ) last year. The fertiliser requirement is usually determined in November and December ahead of procurement the following year. International monthly average prices for selected fertiliser by Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) show the cost of NPK fertilizer has been increasing since October last year with a tonne reaching $260 (Sh26,000) in June up from $252 (Sh25,200 ) in May. Prices are increasing at a monthly average of three per cent and 11 per cent annually. KTDA chief executive Lerionka Tiampati attributed this to the rise in global commodity prices including crude oil and natural gas which are key inputs in the manufacturing of fertiliser. “Final price per bag of 50-kg fertilizer will include additional costs such as import duty, port charges, handling, warehousing and transport costs to destination,” Tiampati said in a statement. KTDA has imported 84,770 tonnes of fertiliser from Russia to be distributed to over 600,000 smallholder tea farmers through the agency’s 69 managed tea factories. Arrival of the fertiliser comes at a time KTDA is finalising soil tests to ascertain the nutritional status of soils in tea growing areas. The tests will guide on the best fertiliser composition to improve productivity from small scale tea farms. Tiampati said application of fertiliser at the onset of the short rains in September is necessary to ensure consistent high quality and quantity of tea.
