Governor Ferdinand Waititu has said there is nothing he can do about the influx of patients to Kiambu hospitals. He said no one will be sacked over the matter because doctors and nurses are working well but are only overwhelmed by the patients. Waititu was speaking yesterday at Kiambu Level Five Hospital during a fact finding mission.

He said matters are worsened by people who wanted to politicise the situation. “The problem is influx and we should not politicise health facilities. Kiambu Hospital has a bed capacity of 320 and we are admitting over 800 inpatients ,what would you want us to do?” Waititu said. He denied that patients were being served bad food. He attributed the drugs shortage on the Integrated Financial Management System, which was not operational in July. “Ifmis was closed in July and our credit was squeezed and could not access our accounts, we will supply our facilities with food and blankets and for drugs we will make sure that essential drugs are stocked in all 171 health facilities across the county,” said Waititu.
