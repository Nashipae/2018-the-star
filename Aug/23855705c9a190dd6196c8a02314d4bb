Staff of a pharmaceutical company in Kajiado have accused their employer of ‘highhandedness’ through punishment and holding their pay for months.  The employees of Njimia Kenya Ltd narrated their grievances to the Star yesterday. They said they have not been paid for three months. The company is located on Maasai road off the Athi River-Namanga highway. It has 60 workers operating under one manager. CEO Daniel Wachira yesterday ordered security guards to chase away the Star team after we sought clarification on the alleged mistreatment. “Please don’t call me again and you can go ahead and write the story,” Wachira said. Two workers were two weeks ago fined Sh10,000 each for mistakenly cleaning tablets with turpentine. “A lab technician placed a wrong mixture in the processing machine. The workers were told to cut grass in the compound for a week but one opted to resign,” a worker said. The second worker paid the fine and proceeded to cut grass for a week before he was allowed back to his station. An employee said every time they ask about their delayed pay they are threatened with the sack. “We have to ask for permission before taking a toilet break. Those who work for longer hours are not paid overtime allowances.” When we confronted Wachira, he said, “Why are you calling me? What do you want? Those are issues pertaining to labour. How does it concern you?” Kenya Medical Supplies Authority head of procurement at Embakasi stores Samuel Okanda said Njimia Kenya Ltd is on the list of companies contracted to supply them with detergent, not consumable drugs.
