A man was on Thursday charged in a Naivasha court with possessing ivory and an unlicensed gun. Adan Abdi Mata denied the two charges linked to the killing of a black rhino in Lake Nakuru National Park on July 31. The suspect, who had no lawyer, was charged that on August 8 in Bahati village, Naivasha, he was found with six pieces of carved ivory worth Sh100,000. He faced a second charge of having a gun without a licence. Naivasha Resident Magistrate Martin Mutua released the suspect on a Sh500,000 bond and surety of the same amount. The case will be mentioned on August 22, and the hearing is on October 25. The prosecution did not oppose bond but called for stiffer conditions to deter the suspect from fleeing.
