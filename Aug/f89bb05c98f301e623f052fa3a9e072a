The Turkana government has approved Sh28 million to fight tree locusts that have invaded more 197,684 acres (80,000 ha) in the county. Tulabalany in Turkana West and Kokuro, Loarengâ€™ak and Kaeris in Turkana are the hardest hit. In an interview on Thursday, Turkana Agriculture executive Christopher Aletia said residents are in fear after their farms were swamped by the pests. He said the county is in talks with humanitarian agencies and the national government to seek intervention. Aletia said the national government has given 1,000 litres of chemicals and county another 2,000 litres to spray the locusts. They also approached humanitarian agencies to assist in the logistics. In June, tree locusts also invaded parts of Marsabit and Isiolo. A swarm occupied about 2,000 square kilometres (494,210 acres) in Merti sub-county in Isiolo, while residents of North Horr, Marsabit, have reported that the pests disrupted classes in some schools last week.
