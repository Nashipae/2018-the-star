The National Transport and Safety Authority has revoked licences for three PSV operators for failing to comply with the requirements. Kidatho Sacco, Silker Agencies and Giwa Sacco have been de-registered, Director General Francis Meja said in a notice on Friday. "The authority hereby invokes powers granted by section 34 of the NTSA Act. The public is therefore advised to take note of the above," Meja said. In 2016, 69 drivers were ordered to go back to school after the transport authority revoked their licenses. The authority made the move after a list of more than 80 rogue drivers was submitted.
