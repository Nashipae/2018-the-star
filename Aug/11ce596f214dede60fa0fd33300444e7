Thirty three Kenya Airways passengers were injured in an accident involving their shuttle at about 2 am on Tuesday. In a statement, the airline said 30 were treated and discharged while three were still in hospital. They were attended to at various hospitals in the city. The passengers were to fly to Bangkok, Thailand, but their flight was rescheduled due to a technical problem, so KQ found them accommodation at a hotel. The accident occurred as they headed to the hotel. A trailer hit the van from behind, forcing it offÂ Mombasa Road. Kenya Airways said investigations were launched and that the trailer's driver will be arrested. KQ opened a guest support centre at the JKIA for friends and families of the casualties. The hotline is +254 741 777 299. Click here for the latest political news
