Celebrated social activist and radio queen Adelle Onyango is among the seven-team youth advisory group that will play an important role in shaping the conversation at the upcoming Goal Keepers' Conference in New York. "It’s an annual conference, where conversations around acceleration to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals are had. It’s really a catalyst for action and brings leaders from around the world from various fields together to share what’s working, what’s not, what needs improvement and what are the solutions," Adelle told Word Is. Adelle continued, "I’m excited to be on the youth advisory group. We have a series of brainstorms to really make sure the conversations we have at the conference, especially in reference to the youth, are a good representative of issues affecting youth globally. We also brainstorm on who are the right speakers to have and structure of conversations." Adelle, who is representing Kenya, is joined in the youth advisory group by other young visionaries from countries including Nigeria, India and America. How does it feel to to be part of such a noble initiative? "I think it’s important for me, because as young Africans, we must be part of conversations that will affect us and part of building our own solutions that we can implement on ground," Adelle said. She said the issues that need to be highlighted include education. "It has become very important. Access to education that is relevant to present-day applications and dynamic changes. Also creating environments that allow young people to create businesses with less harsh barriers than what is on the ground at present. Finally, youth leadership in the areas that can enable us to be part of policy creation." Last year’s speakers included Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, former President Barack Obama, Nobel Peace Prize winners Leymah Gbowee and Malala Yousafzai.
