Mombasa governor Hassan Joho (pictured) wants to start a countrywide tour to unite Kenyans and back President Uhuru Kenyatta’s war on corruption. He said he will not retire from politics after his second term as governor ends, adding he has started a consultation process with like-minded county chiefs across the country. "The politicians I’m going to work with should be free from any corruption allegations to enable us to address past mistakes committed in this country against voiceless Kenyans," the governor said. Joho said he will rally governors who are serving their second and final term to ensure they are counted in his campaign to unite and serve Kenyans. "After meeting Mzee Moi and holding lengthy talks with him for the first time, I decided that Kenya is a country where leaders should work selflessly for the people," the governor said. Joho spoke in Maralal town on Saturday evening during a fundraiser to construct Asalah mosque. The event raised Sh6.3 million after which Joho promised to market beadworks from Samburu in his tourist rich county in an effort to promote Kenyan products. Click here for the latest political news
