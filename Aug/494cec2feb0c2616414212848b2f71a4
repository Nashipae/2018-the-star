The National Cohesion and Integration Commission has summoned Chandarana Food-plus supermarket's senior managers over the racist promotion email. The Francis ole Kaparo team says the officials are expected to appear before them at 10am today Friday. The summons came in the wake of a public outrage over the email which said that "free gifts was focused on white people." The management had publicly apologised saying the 'error was done by a newly recruited staff in the marketing department'.
