Nyali MP Mohamed Ali wants the dumping site at VOK area in his constituency closed because it is illegal. The MP said Mombasa county lorries and other people have been dumping waste on the land at night. The land has been the subject of an ownership tussle between the Mombasa county government and the national government. On Tuesday, the MP wrote to Environment CS Keriako Tobiko seeking his intervention.

Mombasa county had three dumping sites: Mwakirunge in Kisauni constituency, Kibarani in Changamwe and Shonda in Likoni. However, the Kibarani dumping site has officially been decommissioned and a recreational park will be set-up there instead. This leaves only two designated dumping sites in Mwakirunge and Shonda. But they are almost full. Mombasa generates about 2,200 tons of garbage daily. In June, environment executive Geoffrey Nato banned dumping of waste during the day. Poor coordination between the over 1,000 licensed garbage collectors and the recyclers has led to garbage overstaying in collection points.
