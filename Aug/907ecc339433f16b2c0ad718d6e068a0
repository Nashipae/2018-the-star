Canon Charles Onginjo has been elected bishop of the Anglican Church of Kenya, Maseno South Diocese. He defeated two others in the election held at ACK St Stephen’s Cathedral in Kisumu on Saturday. Onginjo replaces outgoing Bishop Francis Abiero, who took over the church leadership in 1994. Abiero will retire on November 4. The new bishop will be consecrated on November 4 at the main Church of St Stephen’s Cathedral in Kisumu. Onginjo was declared the winner after polling more votes than Zephaniah Kore and Boniface Obondi. The election was decided in the third round. Lawyer Ambrose Weda, who presided over the election, termed the process free, fair and transparent. He urged members to support the new leadership of the church to ensure unity, peace and growth. The bishop-elect urged his competitors to support him in developing the church. “I want to extend an olive branch and pledge to work together with my opponents after months of campaigns,” he said. Onginjo, the outgoing vicar-general of St Stephen’s Cathedral in Kisumu, was elected by a 23-member electoral college. Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o congratulated the bishop-elect and urged him to focus on unity, peace and reconciliation. Nyong’o said the electoral college that guided the process has lived up to its godly responsibilities. This election process, Nyong’o said, has exhibited the level of faith in God. “May the Almighty God shine his light upon his chosen bishop-elect,” the governor said.
