Kirinyaga governor Anne Waiguru has opposed a bill by Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria that seeks to bar exportation of raw coffee. Speaking on Wednesday at Kiamutugu when she opened an open air market constructed by the county, Waiguru said Kuria should have first consulted key stakeholders in the coffee industry before introducing the bill in Parliament. The governor said the major issue affecting coffee farmers is sourcing for a market that pays well. "Value addition before export could scare away buyers. What we need is a good market," Waiguru said. The county boss said European countries could seek alternative markets if Kenya makes it hard to purchase the product hence leave farmers at a loss. "Countries that buy coffee from us will seek to buy coffee from other countries like Uganda," she said. Click here for the latest political news
