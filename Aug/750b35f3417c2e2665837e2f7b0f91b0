Pressure is mounting on the National Land Commission bosses to resign. The NLC public hearing for properties at Kibarani, Mombasa, was yesterday disrupted by activists calling for the sacking of acting chairperson Abigael Mbagaya and other commissioners. They cited graft allegations including irregular compensation for standard gauge railway land. Mbagaya and the other commissioners said they will not resign. “You resign on facts, not allegations,” commissioner Abdulkadir Khalif said. Suspended chairman Mohamed Swazuri has been accused of irregular compensation for SGR. He wants his job back and has written to head of Public Service Francis Kinyua to intervene. Fredrick Ojiro was beaten up by police for leading the protest that was also supported by Muslims for Human Rights and Haki Africa. Ojiro said the public had lost trust in the commissioners. He said NLC was sabotaging the war on corruption. Read: NLC split as Swazuri fights back over job Click here for
