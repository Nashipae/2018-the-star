Four Nepalese nationals were yesterday charged in the Milimani law courts with trafficking eight women into Kenya for exploitation. They are Vikrant Thapa, Bir Magar, Suhankar Ghoshi and Stansloues Shikondi. Shikondi is a dual citizen of Kenya and Nepal. They allegedly brought five Nepalese and three Indian women between May and August for prostitution. Magar, Ghoshi and Thapa were charged with being in the country unlawfully. Thapa faced an additional charge of harboring the eight foreigners at City Park, a Vila House in Westlands by means of threats and force. They denied the charges before Cheif Magistrate Francis Andayi. They were remanded after Corporal Mary Ngau of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations filed to have them detained to prevent them from interfering with investigations. She said the suspects used violence against the victims before they were arrested in attempts to frustrate the investigations. Ngau also requested to have the case given priority hearing for the victims to testify before they are taken back to their country. The case will be mentioned on august 27.
