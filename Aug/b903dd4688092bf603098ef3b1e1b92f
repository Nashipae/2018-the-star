Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos personally inspected staff credentials as the county began a staff audit. Tolgos said the staff audit will establish the level of capacity of the county’s workforce and identify gaps in staffing. At least 2,600 county workers will be subjected to scrutiny. Sh12 million was allocated for the exercise in the 2018-19 financial year. “The outcome of this audit will inform better strategies and enable us to continue making our workforce more efficient and effective,” he said. The governor said those without proper academic credentials for their respective positions may be laid off.
