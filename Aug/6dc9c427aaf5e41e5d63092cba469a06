Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has dismissed a "fake news alert" stating he was arrested on Thursday by EACC detectives. Mutua's Press Secretary Mutinda Mwanzia said the alert was malicious. "We have noted with concern the fake alert whose aim was to tarnish the image of Governor Mutua. Relevant authorities must crack down on the perpetrators of such vile lies," he said in a statement. Mutua noted that he attended a memorial service for mzee Sammy Mbova, who was Machakos county adviser, at St Austin Catholic Church in Nairobi. The alert caused anxiety, with members of the public making inquiries. It came amid a toughened war by the DPP on corruption and other crimes, a move that has seen politicians and county officials arrested on allegations including abuse of office and disregard for procurement laws. Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero was arrested on Wednesday evening over corruption allegations. The ODPP said Kidero was arrested following investigations by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. DPP Noordin Haji noted he was satisfied by the investigations after reviewing the file and documentary exhibits against former City Hall officers.
