The Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Hajji wants Lawyer Prof Tom Ojienda stopped from representing National Land Commission chair Mohammad Swazuri in his corruption case. The DPP wants Ojienda to disqualify himself from the case saying he's guilty of conflict of interest because he is also the commission’s lawyer. He argues that there is a clear conflict of interest by Ojienda who also represent NLC and Swazuri while the main subject matter of the corruption case arises from the operations of the commission. Through state Lawyer Lilian Ogwora, he says that NLC is a public body and it is in the interest of justice that representation of a public body should not be in conflict of the interest of the body. “Based on the above, Prof Ojienda be stopped/recused from appearing in the ACC.No 33 of 2018 due to a clear case of conflict of interest” the application reads. He says it is in the interest of justice and in the interest the general public that the orders sought be granted by this court. “Prof Ojienda has represented NLC on several matters before various courts within the country including ELC No.1 of 2018 where the petitioner is the commission” argues the DPP.
