Squatters on a 60-acre plot in Nguu Tatu, Kisauni constituency, got temporary reprieve after the re-construction of a perimeter wall around it failed to take place yesterday. The land is the subject of a protracted dispute between the squatters and Bandari Sacco. Sacco CEO Joseph Bee said the court granted it orders to reconstruct the Sh30 million wall demolished by the squatters in March. However the contractor, Endpoint Kenya Ltd, said there was insufficient security. Bandari Sacco says it bought the land in 2011 from Hussein Dairy Farm for more than Sh300 million. The squatters claim they were have been living on the land for more than 10 years. Bee said he has documentation to prove ownership.
