Anglican Bishop John Okude of Katakwa Diocese has called upon teachers to cancel their planned strike in September as it would disrupt national examinations. KNUT has threatened to go on strike on September 1 to force the Teachers Service Commission policies to review its transfer policies known as delocalisation among other demands. "Even if their demands have not been met, the teachers should strike because it might not be the solution," Okude said on Sunday. He urged Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion to negotiate with the government to find a solution.
