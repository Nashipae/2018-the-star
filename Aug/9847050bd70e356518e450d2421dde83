ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has expressed doubts about success of the truce between Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta. He ruled out the possibility of joining government. Musalia joins his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang’ula in rejecting the formation of a government of national unity amid speculations a Cabinet reshuffle is in the offing. Speaking on NTV on Sunday night, Musalia said one year since the disputed August 8 polls, and even after the handshake, electoral reforms still remain in limbo. Musalia said the handshake’s only visible success is the return of calm. “What was identified as the cause of tension has not been resolved. As we speak today, the IEBC is in a shambles, its riddled with corruption and they are taking each other to court,” Musalia said. Read: I'll be on the ballot in 2022, Mudavadi says “One year has lapsed since the last election and we are not seeing serious effort to resolve the issues.” Asked whether the handshake would achieve anything, Musalia retorted, “let’s give them the benefit of doubt.” The former deputy prime minister said political instability after every election cycle will persist if electoral justice is not addressed. “In 2007-08, there was a handshake after the Koffi Annan-led talks. There was a handshake on the same Harambee House stairs... That handshake of 2007-08 was consequence of a bungled election. What we are seeing now is also a handshake propelled by an equally controversial process,” Musalia said. But despite declaration by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka of his intention to work with Uhuru, Musalia said he will remain in the opposition. “ANC is committed to the cause of the opposition. A good democratic society must have those that are in government and it must also have a vibrant opposition. As ANC, our position first is that we must not abscond our role as the opposition,”he said. Click here for
