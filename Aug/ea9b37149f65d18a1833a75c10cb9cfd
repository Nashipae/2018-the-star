A county Education director has expressed concern some Embu girls traffic bhang to schools by hiding it in their innerwear. Embu West subcounty director of Education Ann Githaiga said, “It’s not possible to find it even during thorough inspection.” She said vehicles ferrying miraa from Nairobi sell bhang to students. Githaiga said the business involving muguka, a type of miraa grown in Embu, is thriving and wreaking havoc among students. She said students end up dropping out and becoming criminals after becoming addicted to bhang. Githaiga spoke at St Benedict Mixed Secondary School on Friday during a price giving day. She said the student bhang smokers and traffickers woo their classmates, convincing them to try it and they end up becoming addicted. Githaiga said recently, students from a girls’ secondary school who had been arrested after attempting to burn a school confessed to their parents they started smoking bhang in primary school at the age of seven. The director urged parents to monitor their children and work with teachers to detect changes in behaviour. Githaiga said some of the wayward behaviors which include students burning schools are as a result of smoking bhang. She urged parents and residents to report bhang traffickers to the police. Githaiga also asked parents to punish their children when they misbehave and not leave all the work to teachers. She said lack of caning  by parents has contributed to unrest. Githaiga said failure by parents to cane pupils has made them “big-headed” and disobedient.
