A draft Bill proposes that the Kenya Water Towers Agency be transformed into an authority with more powers. The proposal is contained in the Kenya Water Towers Bill 2018 . Kenyatta University dean of law school Linda Musumba said the proposed authority will have a firm legal footing to effectively manage the counry’s water catchments. “Water fund and economic valuation of water towers have been added to the Bill,” she said.  Musumba spoke during a stakeholder consultation forum on Tuesday at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development, Nairobi.
