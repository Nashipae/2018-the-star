Five months ago, you resigned, saying you can’t work under IEBC chairman Chebukati. Your purported decision to unresign is unconstitutional, illegal, unlawful, corrupt and criminal. 1. The case you rely on is Nairobi HC Petition No. 212 Of 2018, Isaiah Biwott Kangwony versus IEBC. You are not parties to it. Any clerk will tell you court orders are only enjoyed by the parties. Not strangers. 2. The above case didn’t say you return to work. The petitioner had sought orders that IEBC be disbanded for lack of quorum. The petition was dismissed in entirety. 3. Further, within that judgment, the judge (Obiter Dicta) said your resignation was unprocedural ... He didn’t say it be undone. 4. The Constitution and established law set out how one can be removed from office. Personal resignation is not legislated. Everyone from Azerbaijan to Zimbabwe, irrespective of legal systems, is free to resign. There is no formula or method of resigning. Your resignation was in Order and Good. 5. IEBC commissioner is a full-time job. Employment law is clear that where one absents themselves from duty for even a few days, it is gross misconduct fit for Summary Dismissal. You absented yourselves for over FIVE MONTHS! 6. Your violated Constitution Chapter 6 and The Leadership & Integrity Act, No. 19 of 2012. You broke every article and provision. 7. Walking away from public office and wanting to come back is criminal and corrupt. If DPP Noordin Haji doesn’t arrest and arraign you tomorrow, it doesn’t mean you will get away. There is no time limitation on crime. One day, you will be arrested and charged. You are poster children for all that's wrong. You represent the worst in us. You love yourselves above all. We are yet to give decent burials to those who died because you mishandled the elections. The handshake between the President and the Prime Minister is still unfolding.
