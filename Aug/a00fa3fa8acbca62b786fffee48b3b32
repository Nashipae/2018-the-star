Three St Gabriel Boarding Primary School pupils who had been admitted at the Mwingi Level 4 Hospital after surviving a Saturday accident that killed 10 of their colleagues have left the facility. Medical superintendent Evans Mumo yesterday said two were discharged on Tuesday, but their parents took them to Nairobi Women’s Hospital for further examination. They are Diana Mwangi and Lyn Mutua. “We could not go against the wish of the parents. We thus provided an ambulance to take them to Nairobi,” Mumo said. The hospital referred the third pupil, Ashley Mwende, to Nairobi Hospital for further management.
