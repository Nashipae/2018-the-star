IEBC has promised action against its employees linked to the procurement flaws that saw protests against the commission ahead of the 2017 elections. Chairman Wafula Chebukati said the internal audit on major procurement of goods and services for the 2017 election has confirmed concerns raised over the tendering processes. "The report will inform internal actions the commission will take in terms of dealing with the issues raised," the poll agency chair said in a statement. "Further, the report will be forwarded to the relevant investigative agencies for action," Chebukati added. The audit had revealed that about Sh1 billion may have been lost through flawed procurement of
materials for last year's general elections held on August 8 and October 26. Among anomalies unravelled included goods being delivered after the polls, inflated tenders and undelivered goods.
