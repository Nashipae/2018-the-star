Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa is admitted to The Mombasa Hospital having fallen ill after receiving her brother's body from China. She was on Thursday put on intensive care but has since been moved to a private ward after her condition improved. A nurse at the hospital said the MP was discharged from the
ICU on Saturday. What she is being treated for remains unclear. "Her condition was serious but she has improved. Doctors are still monitoring her
condition," the nurse who sought anonymity said. The legislator did not attend her brother Jumaa Karisa's burial. The latter passed on after falling from a flat in China. Jumaa’s body arrived in the country on Wednesday and was
laid to rest at their Takaungu home in Kilifi on Thursday. Jumwa was at the Moi International Airport to receive the
body and later escorted the cortege to Takaungu. Kilifi woman representative Getrude Mbeyu broke the
news of her illness during Jumaa’s burial. Kaloleni MP Paul Katana and Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori also
attended the burial. "Jumwa is not feeling
well and could not be with us today for the burial. She was shocked after receiving her brother’s body," Mbeyu said. Also read: ODM goes after rebels, warns Jumwa and Dori over anti-Raila remarks Click here for the latest political news
