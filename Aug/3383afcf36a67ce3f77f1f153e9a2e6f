Mystery surrounds the death of a 19-year-old student at Nanyuki High School on Friday morning while attending the government banned tuition. Following the death of Joel Ichata, 10 people, including principal Oliver Munishi, his deputy, two subcounty education officers, two teachers, secretary and cateress and two students recorded statements at Nanyuki police station. According to Laikipia police commander Simon Kipkeu, the student, who was a candidate, was among other 45 who were at the institution. Kipkeu said the student, who is an orphan, fell sick on Thursday night and was taken to the nearby Huruma health centre where he was treated and discharged. The teenager was living with his grandmother in Rumuruti in Laikipia West subcounty. On Friday morning, he fell sick again and started to vomit blood and was rushed to the same health facility where he was pronounced dead upon arrival. “We have these people with us here at the station recording statement so that we can commence investigations. The government has banned holiday tuition,” Kipkeu said. Sources intimated the students did not leave the institution after schools closed for August holidays, with the number reducing from 59 to 45 by yesterday. The police commander said the school principal informed police officers that the students had reported at the institution on Monday in preparation for a geographical tour on Thursday.
