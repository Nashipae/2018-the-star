A group of politicians from Narok and Kajiado on Saturday said the Kikuyu, and particularly President Uhuru Kenyatta, owe DP William Ruto support in 2022. “The Kikuyu people cannot purport to claim they do not owe Samoei anything. Other Kenyans are watching you and will make their own judgement come 2022,” former assistant minister David Sankori said. “We are telling them to swallow their pride because those supporting Ruto for presidency are unstoppable.” Sankori spoke in Kenyewa-Poka ward in Kajiado East constituency during the homecoming ceremony for MCA Henry Kimiti. Kajiado governor Joseph Lenku and his Narok counterpart Samuel Tunai were present. Sankori said, “Kenyatta handed briefly the instruments of power to Ruto to go and sort out his case in The Netherlands and the Deputy President returned them as soon as he came back. As Kenyans, we are just asking why are the Kikuyu people talking ill of the DP and even swearing in the name of their gods that they will forsake him in 2022.” unity call “When their own was seeking the presidency, they praised Ruto for uniting his people and other Kenyans to vote for Kenyatta. What has changed them?” Narok East MP Ken Amarat and Kajiado West’s George Sunkuyia urged the Maasai to unite and support Ruto.
