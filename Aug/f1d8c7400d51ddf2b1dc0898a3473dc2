Senators have overruled the Council of Governors on the contribution of funds by counties to the CoG. The Senate County Assembly and Investment Committee yesterday directed the council to refund counties all the money they have been contributing as annual subscription fee. The committee chaired by Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang’ ruled that the disbursement is unconstitutional as the Intergovernmental Relations Act mandates the Treasury to fund the CoG operations. “The contributions made by counties to the CoG are irregular. The position of the Senate is that the amount be refunded failure to which the county officer authorising such payments be surcharged,” Kajwang’ ruled. The issue came up during the grilling of Siaya governor Cornel Rasanga over Auditor General Edward Ouko’s 2014-15 report. In Ouko’s report, Siaya had irregularly paid Sh3.7 million to the council now headed by Turkana governor Josphat Nanok. “Its (CoG) expenditure budget is provided for under the annual estimates of the revenue and expenditure of the National Government as stipulated in Section 37 of the Act (Intergovernmental Relations Act 2012 ) and, therefore, not eligible to receive money from the county government,” Ouko pointed in his report. About Sh2 million was paid for the annual subscription while Sh1.7 million went to the devolution conference hosted by Kisumu county in 2015. Rasanga said the government has failed to fund the council, hence the decision by governors to fund its operations. “We will get the refunds after the national government gives out the funding,” said Rasanga, challenging senators to compel the Treasury to release the funds. The council’s budget is divided among the 47 counties. In 2017, the committee recommended that 10 governors be prosecuted for violating the law and remitting funds to the CoG. This comes barely a month after senators blocked governors’ quest for immunity from civil and criminal legal proceedings while in office
