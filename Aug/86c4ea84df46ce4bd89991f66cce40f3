The trial of a man accused of making a Standard 3 pupil pregnant in Tana River county was prematurely adjourned yesterday after the girl, 13, went missing. The case, which has been going on for two years, took a new twist after some individuals took away the girl  on Sunday night. The girl fell pregnant in May 2016 and gave birth early last year. She resumed her studies this year after the school and a sponsor agreed to support her. Chief magistrate Cosmas Maundu ordered officers at Madogo police station, who have been handling the case, to produce the girl in court before August 20, when the ruling is expected to be made. Speaking to the press after the court’s direction, the girl’s father said her mysterious disappearance had shocked the family. “We spent the night in the same compound. But when we woke up this morning [yesterday] we were shocked to learn she had disappeared. We only found her child,” he said “We looked for her everywhere but did not [find her].” The girl’s sponsor said he is ready to pay for her education as long as she is willing to go on with her studies. “I was at first heartbroken when I heard about her pregnancy. But I was relieved when the school agreed to readmit her,” he said. “Most important is that justice should prevail for the girl, whose future was almost ruined.” Cases of shcoolgirls falling pregnant are common in the area. Elders have been blamed for abbeting the vice by advocating for ‘maslah’, the traditional way of resolving cases.
