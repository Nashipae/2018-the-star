Kenya’s Lucy Murigi clinched the third race of the 2018 WMRA World Cup, winning at the Sierre-Zinal run in the Valais village of Zinal, Switzerland, on Sunday . In an impressive solo effort, the reigning world champion won the race in 2:57:55— three-and-a-half minutes ahead of her nearest challenger. “I came here to attack the course record,” she said. “I tried and started fast, but unfortunately the hot weather made it impossible. I’m still really happy about my race, though.” Germany’s Michelle Maier, the 2016 winner, finished second in 3:01:31 while Switzerland’s Simone Troxler surprisingly made it to the podium in what was her first race on this course. Murigi sped away from her rivals in the early stages and never looked back. Spain’s Kilian Jornet won the men’s category for the sixth time.He completed the 31km course in 2:31:40—92 seconds ahead of his nearest challenger. Britain’s Commonwealth Marathon bronze medallist, Robbie Simpson, was second in 2:33:12. “It was a hot day, but I felt good and I tried to push hard in the second half,” he said. “Simpson put in a strong kick just after Chandolin, so I decided that was the right moment to make my move. The other guys today were very strong so I am really happy with my result.” Simpson held off a strong challenge from Kenya’s fast-finishing Robert Surum. Surum started slowly but made up significant ground in the latter stages to finish third. “It was a good race for me,” said Simpson. “I didn’t suffer too much in the hot weather today. Running here in ZInal was superb as usual.” Italy’s Francesco Puppi holds on to his lead in the overall WMRA World Cup standings despite placing fourth.
