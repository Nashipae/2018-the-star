Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet has blamed rising road accidents on "sheer stupidity" of boda boda riders and drivers. Speaking at Uppperhill on Wednesday he said, “It is sheer stupidity that causes unnecessary fatalities.” Boinnet spoke after receiving enforcement equipment from the National Transport Saftey Authority (NTSA). He told boda boda riders and drivers to obey traffic laws. Boinnet said most of the motorbike deaths occur because the rider and passenger do not wear helmets. “Anyone who thinks that since NTSA is off the road they can drink and drive is wrong. If you must drink, get someone else drive,” Boinett said. NTSA chairman Jackson Waweru said the enforcement equipment will help police improve road safety. "Speeding, reckless driving, dangerous overtaking, drunk driving and overloading of vehicles are some of the causes of accidents," he said. He also said unlicensed vehicles operating as PSVs and unroadworthy vehicles are also key causes of accidents. The NTSA identified 273 black spots nationally in July, with 199 (72 per cent) in the Northern Corridor and 74 in Nairobi. In January, President Uhuru Kenyatta directed that all NTSA officers be withdrawn from the roads following a rise in road accisents. The President said that traffic police officers should take over their duties on highways.
