Chief Justice David Maraga yesterday urged the National Gender and Equality Commission to fulfil its mandate.  He said independent commissions are the fourth arm of the government and the NGEC should carry out its constitutional duties effectively.  “I’m happy you’ve set out your work well. Let the entire country move together and let’s leave no one behind,” Maraga said during the swearing-in of the new commissioners.  Former commission chairperson Winfred Lichuma and her team left office last year after their term expired.  Maraga steered clear of DCJ Philomena Mwilu’s graft case.  “She is the Judiciary ombudsman. She has been discharging the responsibilities since she came to the office,” he said of Mwilu. “I don’t want to comment on a matter that is in court.”  Former Rongo University council chairperson Joyce Mutinda, Mureithi Chomba and former Nyeri woman representative Priscilla Nyokabi were sworn-in as new NGEC commissioners.  Mutinda is the new NGEC chairperson. She said the development was a testimony to the President’s commitment to ensuring the country seals the gender parity gap.  Mutinda promised to ensure the activities of the commission are based on the Big Four agenda.  “I’ll focus on the vulnerable persons — the ageing, disabled, marginalised and the boy child, who has been left out because of commitment to the girl child,” she said.  Commission secretary Sora Katelo said the equality problem must be fixed swiftly.  “When we have over 90 per cent of girls in Northeastern undergoing FGM, many Kenyans living in slums in deplorable conditions, women are battered, and illiteracy levels over 40 per cent, we have a lot of work to do,” he said.
