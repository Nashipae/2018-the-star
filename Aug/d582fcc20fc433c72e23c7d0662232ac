Three students were arrested in Nyakach, Kisumu county following the murder of a teacher. The three, two of whom are in secondary school and another in university, reportedly attacked Manasseh Ong'ole on Wednesday night. Two other people, who were with the teacher at the time of the attack, are fighting for their lives in hospital. Manasseh was hacked to death after a heated exchange with the students in a bar in Nyakach's Nyamaroka trading centre. One of the victims of the attack died at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Referral Hospital where he had been admitted with critical injuries. Johnson Alai, who was with the two, is admitted to Nyabondo Mission hospital. Kisumu County Police Commander Job Boronjo said the Directorate of Criminal Investigations have commenced investigations into the incident. He added that the team is on the ground collecting information regarding the incident. Kuppet officials led by the Kisumu branch executive secretary Zablon Awange demanded speedy arraignment of the suspects. He called for thorough investigations to ensure justice is served not only to the principal's family but also to the school. "Let no stone remain heavy or unturned in bringing the culprits to book," he said. Awange said security should be improved in Nyakach region to protect innocent teachers and residents. Koguta assistant chief Walter Oguche said the suspects had an argument with the teacher before he met his death. He said the suspects attacked the teacher after he declined to offer the learners a drink as they demanded. Oguche said the boys followed the teacher later when he was going back to school and reportedly killed him. They are being detained at Pap Onditi police station and will be taken to court once the investigation is complete. Click here for the latest political news
