Nakuru county secretary Benjamin Njoroge could be jailed for defying a court order directing he reinstates 29 workers dismissed last year. Njoroge and two other senior officers have been accused of contempt of court for ignoring a directive from the Environment and Labour Relations Court. According to the order, the employees were supposed to report back to duty from July 1, but the county has ignored the order. Efforts to get comment from the county secretary were fruitless and media liaison officer Beatrice Obwocha said she would respond in due time. Click here for the latest political news
