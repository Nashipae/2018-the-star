Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko wants his Kiambu counterpart Ferdinand Waititu to keep off the capital's issues, especially where ongoing demolitions are concerned. He said this on Tuesday in response to Waititu’s view that demolitions are not the solution to the construction of structures in restricted areas. Via his Twitter and Facebook pages, Sonko asked Waititu to stop meddling with Nairobi matters and find the balance between their friendship and the management matter. “My good friend and colleague should concentrate on his county. He should know we don't mix friendship with work. Even Weston, my Buruburu Casurina coco beach plot, Taj Mall and many other buildings shall not be spared if found to be on riparian or public land,” Sonko wrote. In a widely shared video clip, Waititu asks the government to divert rivers instead of tearing down buildings. He says the owners of the buildings should bear the costs. “If your house is next to a river, let the government tell you to cater for diverting the river but not demolishing your property,” he says. Some of the buildings that have been brought down include Southend Mall on Lang'ata Road and Ukay Centre in Westlands. Members of the public have continued putting the government on the spot by pushing for the demolition of those that are still standing.

All those who gave the permits will be prosecuted," he said. Demolitions have not taken place this week to allow the clearing of sites where structures were torn down. Also read: Impunity must end!
