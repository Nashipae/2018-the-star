The National Land Commission has raised the alarm over grabbing of more than 1,000 acres of communal land in Kerio Valley area targeted for prospecting of oil by British firm Tullow. NLC commissioner Samuel Tororei who led a fact-finding team during a visit to the region warned that grabbing of communal land in the region could lead to conflict. “We were shocked to find out that an entire communal land has been sub-divided and registered under some individuals without knowledge of the community that are turning residents into squatters on their own land,” he said. The commission has dispatched a team of investigators to the region to establish the truth on the emerging land disputes in the region where elders also want quick action to avert land problems. Clan members in Kerio Valley petitioned the NLC to intervene and investigate. “A large part of our ancestral land has already been grabbed and sold to influential personalities who hail from outside the region,” spokesman Joel Kiptanui said. Kiptanui, an 80-year-old elder, said they would not allow the grabbing to continue. A lot of the communal land in the region does have registration documents, making it an easy target for grabbers to register and sell it off to unsuspecting buyers. Tullow is prospecting for oil along the Kerio Valley which borders Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo counties classified as Block 12A and covers over 7,000 square kilometres. “We want the NLC to urgently come to the disputed land and correct the mess to avert conflicts that may be very urgly because the community will defend its right to own the land,” Kiptanui said. He said the grabbers had already blocked members of the community from accessing the land.
