Water rationing in Nairobi will continue despite the rise of water levels at Ndakaini dam. "Water rationing will go on in most parts of Nairobi because of historical failures but the county has promised to improve it through laid out mechanisms", Water CeC member Larry Wambua said on Tuesday. Nairobi gets slightly over half a million cubic meters per day against a demand of 700,000 cubic meters. This means there is a water deficit of approximately 200,000 cubic meters per day. Wambua was speaking at a public participation meeting organised by Nairobi City Water and Sewerage to highlight on issues affecting residents. In 2015, NCWSC partnered with the national government to rollout 24 underground water projects at Sh160 million each, to counter the deficit. Water rationing affects informal settlements, exposing many to threats such as typhoid, cholera and other diseases as a result of poor sanitation. Nairobi depends on supply from five water sources under the facilitation of Athi Water Services Board. Sasumua Dam supplies 52,800 cubic meters per day, Kikuyu Springs supplies 4,000m3 per day, Ruiru Dam 22,800m3, Ngethu Water Works 379,200 cubic meters and Thika Dam commonly known as Ndakaini 91,200m3.
