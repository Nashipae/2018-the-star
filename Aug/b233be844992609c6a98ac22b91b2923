Lawyer Apollo Mboya yesterday sued Kenya Power and the Energy Regulatory Commission, accusing the two of introducing new billing tariffs that are discriminative. The lawyer asked the court to suspend implementation of the Electricity Retail Tariffs announced this week pending hearing. Justice Nyamweya certified the suit as urgent and directed the matter to be heard on August 27. The judge further directed Mboya to serve KPLC, ERC and the Attorney General with the suit papers immediately. In the case, the lawyer argues that Kenya Power and ERC have no constitutional mandate to review electricity tariffs, and hence they have infringed on their consumersâ€™ right.
