Kisumu governor Anyang Nyong’o has urged  county leaders to focus on development instead of divisive politics. He said leaders should deliver on their campaign pledges. Nyong’o made the remarks on Sunday at Holy Trinity Church in Seme subcounty where he attended a thanksgiving service for the family of his personal assistant John Okise. He was accompanied by speaker Onyango Oloo. Nyong’o said, “The electorate gave us a mandate to represent them. The best way to reward them is through initiating economic development that can better their lives.” He reaffirmed his commitment to work closely with the county assembly to better service delivery. There have been many wrangles in the assembly, with a group of MCAs accusing the speaker of micromanagement, an allegation Oloo termed unfounded and baseless. “The assembly should not engage in persistent wrangles,” Nyong’o said.
