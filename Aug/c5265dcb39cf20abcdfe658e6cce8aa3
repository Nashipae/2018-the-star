Saudi Arabia ambassador nominee Oginga Ogego was yesterday asked how he will carry on his diplomatic mission given he is not Muslim. Some cities in Saudi Arabia are a no-go zone for non-Muslims. Queries over nepotism and failure to create jobs when he served as the Canadian ambassador popped up yesterday when he faced the National Assembly Defence and Foreign Relations Committee. Ogego, 61, has a net-worth that stands at Sh145 million. In his latest posting, he has been Deputy Commandant-Civil at the National Defence College. Other than serving as an ambassador to Canada accredited to Cuba he has served in Washington accredited to Mexico. He has also been a South Sudan special envoy.

He said he has no personal opinion. “Diplomatic relations are governed by the Vienna conventions which recognises different cultures and constitutional differences which include religious belief, providing a  framework for easy interaction,” Ogego said. He explained that his key role will be to promote Kenya’s interest. “Kenya won’t be discriminated against. If I was to speak Arabic and a Muslim, it would have been an added advantage.  But I am not.” On nepotism and tribalism at the embassy, he said he had no control over the matter as most of the staff he found at the Kenyan embassy in Canada were there before his posting.
