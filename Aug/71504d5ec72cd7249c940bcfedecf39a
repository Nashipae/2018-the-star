Kilifi county has ordered the closure of slaughterhouses and banned supply of red meat following an
outbreak of Rift Valley Fever. Authorities said they made the resolutions after positive tests of the disease, spread by
mosquitoes, in Malindi and Magarini. RVF was first reported in Tana River, the source of most meat consumed in Kilifi. Health executive AnisaÂ Omar on Thursday asked security chiefs in the county to enforce the directive with immediate effect. She asked veterinary, health, security,
and environmental management officers to work together to avert new infections. "Malindi is a tourism destination. I have
already written to the Italian consulate to assure them that everything
is under control," she said. Omar further said the county government has initiated plans
to engage investors to build an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Malindi sub-county. She spoke during the opening of a dispensary funded by Kaysalt Company in line with their social responsibility strategy. Omar reached out to the salt firms in the county to work with the government to construct an ICU at the Malindi Level 4 hospital. Kaysalt MD Dinesh Shikotra, deputy speaker Stanley Kenga, and nominated MCA Loice Ngari were at the event. Click here for the latest political news
