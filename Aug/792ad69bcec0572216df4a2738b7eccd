Rescuers have recovered two bodies after a tragic boat accident in the Indian Ocean in Jomvu, Mombasa. The search began on Monday after the boat capsized with 12 passengers on board. The survivors swam to safety. Experienced swimmers retrieved one body on Monday and the other on Tuesday morning. Passengers make daily deadly boat trip across Jitani Creek in Jomvu to Maugunja in Kilifi. The makeshift boats are usually overloaded and they lack safety gear. In the event of an accident when the tide is rough, passengers are forced to swim. Early this month, the Met Department issued an alert over strong winds and heavy current. Addressing the press at the scene, Jomvu MP Badi Twalib said boat operators will be trained on safety and will also be given life savers.
