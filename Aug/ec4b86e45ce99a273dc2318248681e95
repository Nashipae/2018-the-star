An Embakasi youth leader wants Taj Mall — set for demolition — to be used instead for Huduma Centre services. The mall is on a road reserve and is to be demolished on Thursday. A multi-agency team notified tenants to vacate. It was reportedly built for Sh5.5 billion. Simon Maneti from Mukuru Kwa Njenga yesterday said they benefit from the mall. Its owner Ramesh Gorasia supports young people and has helped to reduce crime, he said. “Youths in the slums are being engaged in activities funded by Ramesh. He also provides clean water in the slums by repairing boreholes,” Maneti said. “The county should put up a Huduma Centre in the building, instead of demolishing it.” A Muslim cleric also urged the government not to demolish the building. “Taj Mall is the only mall in Embakasi. It is a source of livelihood to the residents,” Sheikh Noor told the Star. He said it would be unfair to raze the building for being on a road reserve, yet the road has been built. “We plead with the government to reconsider its decision,” he said. Yesterday, the Star established that many rooms and spaces had been vacated, but a supermarket is still operating. On August 16, Ramesh dared authorities to demolish his property in an emotional press briefing. He however pleaded with the President to reconsider the move, saying the structure could be used as a school. “My President, don’t demolish it. It doesn’t affect the road. It’s a strong building that can last long,” he said.
