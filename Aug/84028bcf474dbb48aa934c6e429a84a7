She had been notified by someone who had her number,” Yego said.A sombre mood engulfed Kapsabet Funeral Home where the body of the deceased was taken by police as hundreds of athletes, friends and relatives including his brothers arrived.Former world 800m champion Janeth Jepkosgei, Chemos, a former world 3,000m steeplechase champion, his brother Aaron Koech, who anchored the 4x400m to a rare medal in Asaba and his father Kibett Boit (a former 400m hurdler)—were all present to view the body before it was transferred to Eldoret Hospital mortuary.Nandi County Government, led by the CEC for Sports, Elly Kurgat and chief officer for sports, who is also an athletics coach Ken Tanui, mourned the hurdler, saying his demise is big blow to the sport and especially his specialty.
