National Assembly Minority whip Junet Mohamed has filed an amendment to the Finance Bill. If passed, the plan to introduce 16 per cent VAT on petroleum products will be delayed for two years. Junet, the Suna East MP, wants the implementation of the Bill suspended to cushion Kenyans from high cost of living. If the Bill is enforced, it will portend hard times for low income earners, the lawmaker added. “It is clear that this Bill will hurt Kenyans. Treasury should suspend it. The uproar from Kenyans is a clear indication that tax will overburden them,” Junet said yesterday at Parliament Buildings. Presenting the budget statement in June, Treasury CS Henry Rotich said petroleum products will start attracting 16 per cent VAT from September 1. This will add about Sh17 on every litre of the commodity. Treasury says the implementation of the Bill is in line with agreements with the International Monetary Fund. In 2016 it was agreed that the government would do away with tax exemptions as part of a plan to grow revenues, reduce budget deficits and slow down debt. The tax was first introduced on petrol, diesel, kerosene and jet fuel in the VAT Act of 2013, with a three-year grace period. It was to come into force in 2016 but was deferred to September. Central Organisation of Trade Unions and motorists have protested, vowing to resist implementation of the Bill. Last week, Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli said workers will not accept Rotich’s  law, as it has left them poor. “Kenyans’ pockets have been dug deep and as workers, we will not continue keeping quiet and watch the government destroy our economy through unreasonable taxes,” he said
