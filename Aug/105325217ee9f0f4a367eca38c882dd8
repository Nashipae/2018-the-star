Gospel artiste Daddy Owen and his wife Farida welcomed their son a month ago. Speaking to Word Is, Owen said he nearly lost his son. “Fatherhood is and has always been amazing and I thank God for that. The biggest challenge was after the last check with the doctor, [just] before booking the hospital for delivery. The doctor told us to go for a scan because my wife said she was in pain, yaani kama labour pain, yet her due date was not near.” The result was shocking and his wife had to undergo emergency caesarean section. “We went for the scan and the results [showed] that the cord was around the baby’s neck... Thank God my late dad told me that pregnancy matters need to be planned [for] in advance, so I was ready financially. Farida was forced to go through emergency delivery five weeks before her due date.” The doctor told the couple there was a possibility of losing the baby. “The doctor said for a very long time he has had such cases, and those kids ended up dying. I was so stressed about losing my son. I decided to ask the doctor what the reason could be, and he said there is no documented reason.” Daddy Owen encourages men to support their women during childbirth and afterwards. “Once you have your wife in the delivery room, you appreciate your parents even more for the effort they put on you and for lack of sleep. “You must be there during the day and even at night to support your wife, otherwise she might end up in depression. Depression in this way, the baby is crying, she tries everything but the baby is still crying. That can lead to mental depression if we, men, are not careful. “Sometimes the baby might just be requiring a new environment which you, as a man, are capable [of providing]. Give her the confidence and assure her that you are with her all through. “My wife and I have shifts at night to take care of the baby and I am happy about that.” Daddy Owen’s son was born the same day as Julius Yego’s in Nairobi Hospital.
