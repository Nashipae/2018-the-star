Former Ugenya MP David Ochieng claims that his life is in danger. Ochieng said he has received threatening messages over the impending by-election. The ex-legislator recorded a statement at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations on Monday morning. On August 16, 2018, the Court of Appeal dismissed sitting MP Chris Karan's petition following the annulment of his election by the High court. Justice Hannah Okwengu said Karan's election was validly nullified in the petition by former MP David Ochieng. “The report is a response to the calls and information I have been receiving from August 1 2018, from concerned persons with regard to threats to my life,” he said. He said that on August 15, 2018, he travelled to Kisumu to receive the judgment in the Election Petition Appeal No. 13 of 2018 which was/ to be read on August 16 2018. While in Kisumu, he received a call from a friend in Ugenya who asked him to be careful as he went to court the following day. “I took this as a routine warning as election petitions are normally prone to political hooliganism that may sometimes create an enabling environment for mischief,” Ochieng said. After the court judgment, he travelled back to Nairobi on August 17 and since then he has almost on a daily basis received information from concerned persons about their fear for my life and personal safety. He said that on Sunday, he received a call with a clear and matter-of-fact warning that I should henceforth be careful as the interests in the impending by-election in Ugenya constituency may lead to some people planning to kill him.
