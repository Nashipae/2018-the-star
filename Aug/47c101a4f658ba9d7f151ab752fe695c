President Uhuru Kenyatta arrived in Washington DC on Saturday afternoon for an official visit that will see him hold talks with US President Donald Trump. The President will also meet executives of top US companies to promote Kenya as a preferred investment destination. Cooperation between Kenya and the US in security, governance, trade and investment, people to people cooperation; and partnership in regional and international matters will take centre stage during the Washington visit. The President, accompanied by First Lady Margaret Kenyatta, touched down at Dulles International Airport at 4:00 pm Washington DC time 11:00 pm, Nairobi time on Saturday and was received by a team of senior US and Kenya government officials led by Kenya's ambassador to the US Robinson Njeru Githae. Kenya’s Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Amb. Monica Juma says the President’s visit to the US is significant in many aspects. “It underscores the importance of Kenya-US relations, a relationship that is historical and that has been growing in both breadth and depth over the years to cover a wide range of areas from security and defence to governance, trade and investment,” Juma said in an interview ahead of President Uhuru's arrival. President Uhuru will on Monday morning meet business executives of leading US companies under the umbrella of the Business Council for International Understanding (BCIU) before he heads to White House for talks with his host President Trump.
