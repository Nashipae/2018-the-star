Onkar Rai claimed victory in the Chloride Excide-sponsored Hill Climb as the two-day event ended yesterday in Naivasha. Onkar, driving a Menengai Oil-sponsored Skoda Fabia, led from start to win his first-ever Hill Climb event of his career. The latest triumph follows his recent Nakuru Rally victory in the first round of the 2018 Kenya National Rally Championship. “I am excited and extremely happy with the Hill Climb victory. The victory is sweet and much appreciated. Beating the King of rallying Ian Duncan is a sweet moment in my rallying career. Duncan is one of the best drivers in the competition,” said Rai after winning the event which was also supported by Shell V-Power. Duncan stayed second for most of the two-day competition though he was not able to beat the inform Rift Valley Sports Club chairman. Duncan said he was now ready to sell the Mitsusbishi Lancer Evo10 after a brilliant show in the Kenya National Rally Championship series. Shivam Vinayak continued with his winning ways by clinching victory in the bike category after finishing in the all-important fourth overall place. Vinayak is the motocross champion. Onkar’s young brother Tejvir finished in the third position. Abid Ganatra was the best placed Buggy driver in the fourth place while Micky Hughes was the best-placed raid driver in the 10th position. Machines varying from ordinary rally cars to buggies and motorcycles were a spectacle to watch.
