Luhya leaders from Trans Nzoia have asked the government to suspend the crackdown on busaa outlets during the ongoing circumcision season in Bungoma and Trans Nzoia. Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa on Saturday urged county commissioners not to harass those enjoying the brew. The ceremonies commenced on Wednesday in Trans Nzoia,Bungoma,Kakamaega and parts of Busia where  boys of between 10 and 15 years from the Bukusu,Tachoni, Kabras and Banyala communities are undergoing circumcision. Speaking during the initiation ceremony at Bikeke in his constituency where four boys will undergo circumcision from the same family,Wamalwa said the traditional brew is important during the initiation process. He said busaa is not only used for entertaining guests, but is also relevant during sacrifices associated with appeasing gods. “We call on the county commissioners to tell police officers not to raid our people during this month since busaa is synonymous with the month-long exercise,” Wamalwa said. The legislator said the right of the communities to observe their cultural rights would be infringed on if the security systems bar them from celebrating as was passed on by their forefathers. The initiation process, known as Embalu, is observed every August of even years where boys between 10-15 years face the knife to symbolise transformation into adulthood.
