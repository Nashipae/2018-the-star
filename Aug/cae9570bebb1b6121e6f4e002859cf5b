A barmaid was on Saturday morning found murdered and stripped naked outside her place of work in Makuyu, Murang’a South Sub county. Area deputy OCPD Agripina Lugonzo said the deceased was last seen alive after the bar was closed at 11 pm on Friday. “The victim had blood in her mouth which indicates that she may have been hit on the head with a blunt object,” Lugonzo said. According to the police boss, the bartender told her co-workers that she needed to see someone urgently and left after someone kept calling her persistently. She said her colleagues retreated to their rooms at the back of the bar only to wake up in the morning and find the victim's naked body outside the bar. The deceased, Lugonzo said, had no other visible injuries but a postmortem is expected to reveal the exact cause of death. “We suspect the man who called her was either a close friend or a patron in the bar,” the deputy police boss said. She said that forensic experts visited the scene and collected evidence. Click here for the latest political news
