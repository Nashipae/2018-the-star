The Webuye weighbridge systems administrator was arrested on Wednesday on allegations of fraud and corruption. Stanley OIuoch, 36, was arrested after a complaint was filed at Webuye police station. The complaint was by George Mwangolo, a quality assurance manager of Societe Generale de surveillance (SGS) Kenya. SGS is a Swiss origin company that provides inspection and security services. The Kenya National Highways Authority contracted the company to manage the county's weighbridge operations. Bungoma East DCIO boss Paul Mumo said SGS agents started monitoring operations at the weighbridge after many members of the public complained. At his office on Thursday, Mumo told journalists that between January 2017 and May, Oluoch allegedly used forged bankers cheques payable to KeNHA, and amounting to Sh2,620,000, to release impounded trucks. The CID boss said investigations revealed that the cheques were signed by different people and organisations, on separate dates and for separate accounts, at Kenya Commercial Bank in Webuye. "He [lied] that the cheques had been cleared for payment by the truck owners," he noted. "This was in violation of highway rules and regulations at weighbridges." Mumo added that they later learned that the suspect had stolen all the money. He suspect will be arraigned in Webuye and issued a stern warning against embezzling saying culprits will face the full force of the law. The Webuye weighbridge has been on the spot after it was revealed three months ago that truck drivers had been colluding with officials to evade paying taxes by using alternative routes.
