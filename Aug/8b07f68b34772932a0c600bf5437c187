Kilifi deputy governor Gideon Saburi has asked politicians to embrace unity and work together to ensure development to the people. Saburi said party rivalry is still being witnessed more than a year after the 2017 elections. Speaking in Kaloleni on Saturday, the deputy governor said those who were opponents should not live in grudges but instead join governor Amason Kingi in developing the county. In Kilifi, opposition's ODM party won nearly all seats during the elections. “The time for party differences is over, its time for all of us to unite and support the development of the county,’’ he said. Saburi said President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga’s handshake was meant to bring peace to the country. The deputy governor said those who are already busy about 2022 politics should return to the development track. “Our competitors should stop being evil, they should join hands to push the development agenda,’’ he said.
