Villagers of Katse will now not walk 13 kilometres for medical care after the Mukekeni dispensary, which has been dormant for five years, was re-opened yesterday. Mumoni MCA Johnson Kanandu said it was reopened to boost health services in Kitui county. “This dispensary has been dormant but today it has opened doors for villagers to access medical care. The villagers will now be walking less than five kilometres to the centre as opposed to the past where they had to trek for 13 kilometres in order to get to the nearest dispensary,” he said. Kanandu promised the villagers he will not relent untill they access all the required medical attention. He urged them to register in the ongoing Kitui county health insurance cover for cheaper and easy access to medical care. In the plan, launched by governor Charity Ngilu, every household will be required to part with Sh1,000 per year to cover all family members under the age of 18. It supplements the existing NHIF cover. “I will ensure that those heath centres under construction are fast completed within my ward for the better living of my people,” he said. The dispensary chairperson Joseph Ngari urged the county government to ensure the facility is fenced, has a gate with a watchman, water tanks and a residential house for the nurse.
