The National Cereals and Produce Board is in chaos. The top executives are in court for spending Sh11 billion buying maize last year when they were only allocated Sh6 billion (see P4-5). The Agriculture ministry is vetting maize farmers to check they are genuine (see P11) and governors want the NCPB devolved to the county level (see P30). The NCPB is trying to act as a price stabilisation fund by supposedly buying when the price is low and selling when the price is high. But it is hopelessly inefficient and swallows billions in subsidies every year. The fundamental problem is that it is buying Kenyan maize at above the world price of maize in Uganda, South Africa, or America. This inevitably results in fraud. The only solution is to scrap the NCPB completely. The private sector can lease its silos and buy maize from the farmers at harvest time. If they make a loss, that will be their problem. If they make a profit, good for them.
