Dantez is a 14-year-old Kenyan rapper and gospel singer.Â In an interview with Adelle and Shaffie on Kiss, he opened up on his struggles doing music. "I started singing at the age of 10 years. I would walk from one home to the other and I would only earn 10 shillings from each home I visited, which was not a guarantee. Later, I started singing in the streets because I did not have money to go to a studio and record a song. I saved Sh3,000 for three months and recorded my first song." His mum was not happy with his son walking around borrowing money. "When I told her that I can sing, she beat me thoroughly," Dantez recalls. "I did my first song with the money I had saved. I did not stop walking in the streets now looking for money to do the video but I was lucky to get someone who did my video for free. I gave my mum the money I had saved to buy food." So how did he get to Nairobi? "While doing my hustles in the streets of Kitale, someone noticed me and connected to a forum called 'Maliza Umaskini foundation'," he said. "By then I was in class seven and they are now paying my school fees and I live there." He is currently in form one and his dream is to be an international singer to pass the message of hope.
