The country loses more than Sh8 billion worth of water annually through pipe leaks, an audit report released yesterday shows. The Water Services Regulatory Board (Wasreb) report on water lost in nine counties surveyed shows the Nakuru water company (Naruwasco), leads with 85 per cent water leaks. Other audited companies include Muwasco in Murang’a South, Ewasco in Embu, Nawasco in Nanyuki, Iwasco in Isiolo, Thiwasco in Thika, Mawasco in Malindi, Eldowas in Eldoret and Kacwasco in Kakamega. Malindi water company recorded the lowest water leaks at 31 per cent of the nine companies. The audit was done by Wasreb and key stakeholders such as the Netherlands Development Organisation. The report was launched by Water CS Simon Chelugui at the Kenya School of Monetary Studies in Nairobi. “Over the years, progress in this performance indicator has remained marginal with a reduction from 47 per cent in 2010-11 to 42 per cent in 2016-17. These levels are more than double the sector benchmark and way above the water services strategy,” he said. The audit, done between August and December 2017, raises concern that huge losses “paint a grim picture” for the water sector and urgent interventions are required. Chelugui said water leaks pose a serious threat to achieving President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda of food security, affordable housing, affordable healthcare and manufacturing. Wasreb chief executive Robert Gakubia said the findings present a huge gap between targets it set on minimum water leaks and the reality on the ground. “The goal of the National Water Services Strategy is to reduce non-revenue water to under 30 per cent while the Vision 2030 goal is to reduce this to under 25 per cent,” Gakubia said.
