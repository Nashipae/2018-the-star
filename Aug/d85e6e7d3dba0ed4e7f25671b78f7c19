STARRING: Mila Kunis, Kate McKinnon, Justin Theroux, Sam Heughan, Gillian Anderson, Hasan Minhaj DIRECTED BY: Susanna Fogel RELEASE DATE: August 3  If there’s anything that women can agree
with, is that being dumped via text must be one of the foulest things to ever
experience. When Audrey is dumped by her boyfriend via text she takes it badly.
She gets comforted by her best friend Morgan. The two have been best friends
since childhood. Audrey is later grabbed by two CIA operatives, Sebastian and
Duffer. They inform Audrey that her ex-boyfriend, Drew, is a CIA operative and
he is in deep trouble. Drew later turns up at Audrey’s
apartment but before he gets to explain himself, he is attacked by dangerous assassins.
He manages to give Audrey a package with instructions to deliver it to a café
in Vienna. Audrey and Morgan end up going on a trip that is beyond their
wildest imagination. In Europe the two ordinary American girls manage to evade
dangerous assassins as they live out a dangerous fantasy of being spies on a
mission to save the world. The film is confused to say the least.
It not only confuses us on what the characters ought to be but how we want to
feel about it in the end. It’s not bad, it’s not that great either. It’s funny
but it gets cringy at times. It’s comedic with a whole lot of action sequences.
In the end, it’s easier to think of it as an ambitious chick-flick cum action
comedy. Kate McKinnon, like in all her films, manages to deliver on her
thunderous comedic presence. However, there’s a stiffness with the rest of the
cast as they struggle to fit into their serious spy roles while trying to keep
up with the comedic streak.
