The Council of Governors has dismissed a directive by the Senate to refund annual contributions from counties. In a statement yesterday, governors said the Constitution empowers them to create groups and support their activities. “Article 189 empowers governors to establish working groups or committees to execute its functions. The council has established 18 committees to achieve its mandate,” CoG chairman Josephat Nanok (pictured) said. He was responding to a directive by the Senate County Public Accounts and Investment Committee that the council to refunds all subscription fees contributed for six years. Senators said the contributions are irregular. “The position of the Senate is that the amount be refunded, failure to which the county officer authorising such payments will be surcharged,” committee chairman Moses Kajwang’ said. Nanok said the council plays a significant role in devolution by providing vital data, dispute resolution mechanisms and capacity-building. “Parliament enacted the Inter-Governmental Relations Act that gave effect to the spirit of consultation and cooperation. One of the institutions established by the act the Council of Governors and the Senate must respect it,” Nanok said. The governors asked the Senators to wait for the Supreme Court to rule on a case challenging the remittance of the funds.
