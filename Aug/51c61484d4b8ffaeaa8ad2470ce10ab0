Police and Kenya Wildlife Service officials have arrested a suspect linked to the killing of a rhino at Lake Nakuru National Park on July 30. Six pieces of carved ivory, a homemade gun were recovered during the operation at Ndabibi North Lake at midnight in Naivasha. A junior KWS officer, who is not authorised to comment on the matter, said officers acted on a tip-off and arrested the man in his house. The officer said the suspect has been on their radar for months following the rise in game meat trade in Naivasha. KWS spokesperson Paul Udoto told the Star the suspect is strongly connected to the killing of the rhino. He said it is just a matter of time before other suspects are caught. Udoto said the suspect is being interrogated and will appear at the Naivasha Law Courts. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru said the man is being held at Kongoni police station. “We will not rest until the suspects who are at large are found,” Waweru said.
