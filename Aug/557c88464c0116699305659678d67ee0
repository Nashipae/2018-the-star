A 10-year-old girl has been rescued from forced circumcision and early marriage at Suguta Marmar in Samburu Central. Samburu County Commissioner John Korir said area chief and police officers rescued the minor. Good Samaritans reported the matter. “We got a report that a girl was to be married off today. She is here at the office, and we will take her to a safe place where she will stay and go to school,” he said. Police have intensified efforts to arrest the suspects. “We are pursuing elders and morans behind the plan. They have migrated from the village, but we will arrest them and take them to court," Korir said. He said nine other girls across the county have been rescued from the outlawed cultural practice, one week after schools closed. Samburu Girls Foundation, an institution that owns a girl’s rescue centre at Loosuk in Samburu Central, has received 15 girls rescued early marriages organised by their parents.
