IAAF has suspended the 2016 World U20 Championships 800m winner Kipyegon Bett on claims of doping. The Athletics Integrity Unity in a tweet on Thursday said the decision was reached after the 20-year-old allegedly failed to submit to sample collection as spelled out in Article 2.3 of the anti-doping rules. " The Kenyan middle-distance runner is provisionally suspended from all competition," the agency said. Bett won the 800 metres bronze medal at
last year's World Championships in London. The agency, however, says in its website that such suspension does not in any
way abrogate the presumption of innocence and is not an early
determination of the athletes' guilt. Earlier this month, AIU charged Lucy Kabuu Wangui with a violation of the doping rules after she failed a drug test. She tested positive for narcotic morphine, during the Milano Marathon in April. Samuel Kalalei, who won the Athens marathon last November, was the third
Kenyan athlete to have been found in breach of anti-doping rules. Kipyegon's case comes two
months after three times World 1500m champion Asbel Kiprop and African
Games 400m silver medallist Boniface Mweresa tested positive for banned substances. Three-time Boston Marathon winner Rita Jeptoo and Jemima Sumgong, the 2016 Olympic marathon
champion, were involved in doping cases too.
