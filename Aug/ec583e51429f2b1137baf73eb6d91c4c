Some people have already
commented that this violates the constitutional prohibition on treating people
differently because they are (or are not) married. It is unlikely to go to
court, perhaps, but the fundamental issue can arise in other contexts.  IS THERE DISCRIMINATION? Suppose two couples
arrive at a hotel reception, one couple is registered because they have a
marriage certificate, the other is not because they have no evidence of
marriage.  Clear discrimination on the
basis of marital status. It is also
discrimination against people who are married under a system of law that does
not involve issuance of a marriage certificate, such as customary law, and
perhaps Muslim Law. If the latter is true there is also discrimination on the
grounds of religion. It is what we call “indirect discrimination”: the effect
is discrimination on a particular ground even if it was not intended. It is
prohibited by Article 27 of the Constitution. Now all marriages are
supposed to be registered. But many are not, especially older established
relationships. And how do we deal with
“We come, we stay” marriages, which Justice David Majanja recently decided was
a sufficient marriage for at least some purposes?  ‘RIGHT OF ADMISSION
RESERVED’ This sign is still seen
sometimes in Kenya. People tend to interpret it as a colonial hangover, used to
exclude non-white customers. That may be so. 
It also is found in the UK, and in other countries, including South
Africa. People tend to justify
it as reflecting the right of owners of private property to control who comes
into their premise, and what happens there. This includes a writer in the Star in May, justifying refusal to allow
a woman to breastfeed her baby in a restaurant. You surely have a
perfect right to decide who comes into your home (unless they have a right of
entry under law, like the electricity meter reader or the police with a search
warrant). But, if you offer a service to the public, your right to refuse that
service is limited by the Constitution. In fact, it was limited
under the old constitution: “No person shall be treated in a
discriminatory manner in respect of access to shops, hotels, lodging-houses,
public restaurants, eating houses, beer halls or places of public entertainment”. Discrimination meant treating people differently on the
basis of race, tribe, place of origin or residence, political opinions, colour,
creed or sex. Laws could allow refusal for various reasons, including public
safety or health, or morality. One can see why this was a desirable provision,
especially in a country that was, for much of the colonial period, an apartheid
society. (In fact, it was a common provision in decolonising constitutions). In countries that prohibit discrimination, displaying a sign
saying “right of admission reserved” has no power to deflect the impact of this
law. A court held that when refusal to allow people into a London pub was based
mainly on racial stereotyping (namely that Irish Travellers and English Gypsies
are prone to cause disorder) it was a violation of the law. And when a Canadian nightclub refused to admit a first
nations person (on an excuse about dress codes) the Human Rights Tribunal held
this was discrimination and against the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It arose in South Africa when a wine farm, where people
could marry, refused to allow a gay couple to do so (though gay marriage was
legal), experts agreed the refusal was illegal.  WHAT DOES OUR CONSTITUTION SAY? In Kenya, it is not just
the state that has a duty to respect human rights: we all do. Other than in our
private lives, we must not, for example, discriminate. Many reasons that people
might be tempted to use as a basis for discrimination, are specifically listed
as forbidden. These are race, sex, pregnancy, marital status, health status,
ethnic or social origin, colour, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief,
culture, dress, language and birth. But that is not the end: Article 27 says there must be no discrimination “on any
ground” â€• the items in the list are examples, though they do cover all the
likely reasons for discriminating. The Constitution allows right to be limited by law and or
good reason.  And the limitation of
people’s rights must be no greater than necessary to achieve the valid purpose.
The message is: limit rights as little as possible. An example of a law that allows â€• actually requires â€• that
people be refused admission or told to leave is the Alcoholic Drinks Control
Act. It says that someone who has a licence to sell alcohol must expel anyone
who is “drunk and disorderly, violent, or quarrelsome”. And people under
18 years old must be excluded from anywhere (including part of a shop) where
alcohol is made, sold or consumed. Discrimination on the ground of age is
require by the law. These may be limits on rights, but they are clearly
justified by the need to avoid rights, and to protect the young. A02/08/2018  WHAT ABOUT RELIGIOUS RIGHTS? The hotel owner who wanted to see marriage certificates justified
this was from a Christian point of view. Under the constitution, Article 32, everyone
has the right to practice their religion. But that right can also be limited â€• at
least when harm to others is involved. Beliefs it is hard to control; action is
different. Suppose a person honestly believed that people of a certain
colour, or with a certain disability, are a danger. We would surely not expect the
law to allow them to discriminate against people of that colour or disability
in providing some public service like a hotel, transport or shop. Yet they
might also say: “Article 32 allows me freedom of belief and to manifest that
belief”.  That is true. But we would
expect a court to say the duty not to discriminate is more important than the
right to practice an irrational belief. There have been some recent cases with slightly more tricky
facts.  The American Supreme Court
recently decided a case in favour of a baker who refused to bake a wedding
cakes for a gay couple. It seemed to be influenced mainly by the rather hostile
way the baker’s religious beliefs were treated by the body that made the
original decision in the case. The Court also seemed to take seriously the idea
that the baker objected to using his creative skills in this way, exercising
his freedom of expression. The decision of the UK Supreme Court about a baker who
refused to make a cake with the message “Support gay marriage” is awaited. In India, the Supreme Court has just reserved its judgment
on whether excluding women from a Hindu temple in honour of a celibate god can
be justified on the basis of freedom of religion. The South African constitution says that no one may
discriminate “unfairly”. Kenyans thought that discrimination must necessarily
be unfair. The absence of this word makes it difficult for our courts to say a
particular type of discrimination is unobjectionable.  WE NEED A LAW Limitation of rights is supposed to be done only through
law. Despite my critical comments about Parliament’s law-making last week, we
do need something like an Equality and Non-Discrimination Act, preceded by a
national debate. Can discrimination ever justified on the basis of people’s
beliefs? Should religious beliefs be valued over other sorts of beliefs? When
is it legitimate, if at all, for a business to choose who it will provide its
services to? Might it be all right for a small guesthouse to be selective in
who it admits, but not a large hotel? When, if at all, is it permissible for
people providing rental accommodation to restrict who may rent? A law cannot override the Constitution, but it can help the
courts make difficult decisions, and guide citizens.
