With ten rounds remaining in the 2018 National Super League, the race for promotion has no a clear favourite with four teams jostling for the two automatic slots. Regarded as the most competitive football league in the country, the second tier has lived to the billing and produced four potential candidates— Western Stima, Ushuru, KCB and Nairobi Stima—who occupy the first four slots and are separated by three points. Western Stima and Ushuru, who are placed top and second with 52 points, risk being relegated to third and fourth respectively should KCB and Nairobi Stima win their match in hand. KCB, fresh from hammering GFE 105 3-0 over the weekend, have50 points and a win in their match in hand will steer them to the top with 53 points. Similarly, victory for Nairobi Stima, who electrocuted Ushuru 2-1 to stretch their unbeaten run to 18 matches besides taking their tally to 49 points, will see them scale to second spot with 52 points—surpassing both Western Stima and Ushuru courtesy of their healthier goal difference. The Nairobi-based power men have been scoring at will and boast of the best scoring form in the league having netted 47 times. Under the stewardship of Ibrahim Shikanda, Stima take pride in producing the leading top scorer Stephen Owusu who has 13 goals under his belt while his teammates Victor Ndinya and Joseph Kangethe who have eight goals each, have also been reliable goal poachers. Meanwhile as the four muscle for promotion, Isibania and GFE 105 risk to meet the wrath of the axe as they sit in the bottom two slots with 19 and 14 points respectively. Isibania had arguably their best start of the campaign, rubbing shoulders with the top seven clubs but financial constraints have derailed their route to a respectable finish. Students Green Commandos are also facing a tough puzzle in their fight to remain in the league as they are perched 17th with 19 points. However, they have three matches in hand.
