Ugandan import Phillip Wokorach and Kenya15’s international Felix Ayange have been recalled to the Kabras side for final two legs of the national Sevens series next month. Ayange and Wokorach have been playing for the national side in various assignments. Ayange played for the Kenya Simbas in the Rugby World Cup qualifiers cum Africa Gold Cup while Wokorach represented Uganda in the Rugby World Cup Sevens in USA as well as the Africa Gold Cup matches. Kabras, who are the defending champions, have struggled in the shorter version of the game this season and currently sit in fifth place with 48 points with two tournaments left. Coach Edwin Achayo said the return of the duo will boost their side’s hopes of winning a leg of the circuit. The sugar millers are yet to get to the semis and Achayo admits the circuit is competitive this year. “If you look at the top sides, the margins are very small and it can go either way but we have learnt our lessons from the last weekend’s Driftwood Sevens and we will relish the challenge in playing in Kisumu in a fortnight,” added Achayo. Achayo added that having Wokorach and Ayange will be key to their hopes of winning in Dala or Christie. “The two are gifted players. Wokorach is play maker and can also score tries. I am looking forward to those tournaments and winning,” added Achayo.
