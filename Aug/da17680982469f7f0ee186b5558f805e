Police have opened an inquiry into the shooting of a Mombasa inspectorate officer by a Shimo la Tewa Prison warden. Samuel Mwita shot Patrick Omondi in Buxton at about 7pm on Tuesday. The bullet penetrated the ear and neck of the victim, who was treated at Coast Province General Hospital and discharged on Wednesday. Inspectorate director Mohamed Amir said trouble started after Mwita committed a traffic offence and turned hostile. "It was during rush hour when he tried to pass over the pavement to beat traffic," Amir said. Mwita reportedly punched Omondi after his pathway was blocked. He then brandished his gun and shot Omondi prompting other county officers to restrain him and secure the gun. "The public started lynching him before he grabbed our female officer and used her as a shield. She was hurt," Amir said, adding action that matches the warden's act should be taken against him. "We will follow up and ensure he is charged," he said, adding the incident should not create tension as "we have a good working relationship with police". Mwita was arrested and spent the night at Urban police station. Police Commander Johnstone Ipara said he misused his firearm. "We are about to conclude the investigation. [You will know the position soon],," Ipara told journalists at a press briefing at Kenya School of Government on Wednesday. Ipara noted that no police office will interfere with the probe as "justice must be delivered". The police boss warned officers against misusing their weapons as they will be held accountable.
