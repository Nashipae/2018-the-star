Part of Oshwal Center is currently being demolished by its owner in Westlands. The owners began the demolition on Saturday after hiring their own bulldozer. The centre is opposite the Ukay Centre that was brought down on Friday. Earlier, Nairobi governor Mike Sonko said three sections of the centre do not sit on riparian land, and will not be demolished. “We are ready to preserve the temple, monuments and cultural centre because they are far from the river, but the rest of the structures like the hall are within the riparian distance and must be removed,” he said. On Friday, Sonko said the multi-billion shillings centre sits on top of a river and will not be spared in the ongoing demolitions. The governor said the regeneration committee has recommended demolition of about 4,000 buildings which are either on riparian land or along the Nairobi River.
