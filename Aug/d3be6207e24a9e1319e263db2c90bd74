A fresh bid has been initiated to ensure ODM and Jubilee Party are not the only outfits entitled to political parties funding by the exchequer. The Political Parties Liaison Committee and its partners are proposing changes to the current law on financing parties. PPLC chaired by Jane Njiru argues the law sidelines small parties. She said this is discriminatory and encourages dominance by big parties. Read: All political parties should get public funding, Wamalwa says The current Political Parties Act requires that 0.3 per cent of the national revenue be allocated to political parties annually. However, it is shared according to parliamentary seats and votes for presidential candidates in the previous election. “Without funding, these smaller parties are unable to meet this requirement of the law thus operate illegally not deliberately but because of a discriminatory party funding regime that favors only the big parties,” Njiru said. She spoke in Nairobi yesterday during a round table discussion with the Konrad Adenauer Foundation-Kenya, a German lobby. The proposed changes have been submitted to Parliament, Njiru said.
