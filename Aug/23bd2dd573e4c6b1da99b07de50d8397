Kenya is "disappointed" that its athletes suffered for lack of hotels and charter fights in Lagos, Nigeria, and will petition the Confederation of African Athletics (CAA) and the IAAF. Teams Kenya members were stranded for two days while en route to the 2018 Africa Senior Athletics Championships. In a statement on Thursday, Sports Chief Administrative Secretary Hassan Noor noted that Kenya played its part in full. Noor said it is beyond comprehension how Asaba was given the rights to host a high profile event without considering the logistics around connecting flights. "The connecting flight from Lagos to Asaba was the responsibility of the CAA and the Local Organising Committee which had assured us that all was well," he said. "We are made to understand that the chaos were caused by the fact that the LOC had offered charter flights services to just one company, under the name Overland Airways, despite having many other options."

Teams Kenya and South Africa were among athletes from 19 countries who were stranded at Murtala Mohammed International Airport ahead of the competition which began on Wednesday evening. Photos showed the teams at the Lagos Airport some 500 km away from the venue of the main event. The other countries that were affected include Uganda, Benin, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Egypt, South Sudan, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Cameroon, Morocco and Rwanda. Kenya is expected to field its 10,000m men's team, which it hopes will scoop medals despite the challenges.
