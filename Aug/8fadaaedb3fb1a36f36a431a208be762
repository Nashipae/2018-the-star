The Judiciary will not turn a blind eye to corruption in the corridors of justice, Chief Justice David Maraga has said. Maraga yesterday said some judicial officers ignore automated revenue collection established in 90 per cent of court stations. Instead, the officers insist on cash payments, an avenue for corruption. “As we address the external cases of corruption, we must look inward and see if there are logs in our eyes,” he said. “Instead of using M-Pesa to collect revenue, they ask convicts to pay cash.” Read: Maraga pledges to weed out corrupt judges and magistrates Maraga spoke at the opening of the 2018 Judiciary Annual Judges’ colloquium. The meeting comes at a time when the fight against corruption has gathered momentum and the Judiciary is challenged to play its role. The CJ said the judiciary is committed to ensuring all anti-corruption and economic crime cases are dealt with expeditiously. “This is the only way we can maintain confidence in the people we serve,” Maraga said. South African Chief Justice Thomas Mogoeng was the chief guest. He said corruption is running amok in many African countries’ judicial systems and must be dealt with firmly. Mogoeng said the need for the Judiciary in any country to be incorruptible is key to development. He added that corruption should not be fought in the government alone. Mogoeng said the private sector should also be checked. “There can never be corruption in government without a partner in the private sector. It takes two to tango,” the South African Chief Justice said. More: Judiciary will not shelter corruption, Maraga says at launch of economic crimes court Click here for
