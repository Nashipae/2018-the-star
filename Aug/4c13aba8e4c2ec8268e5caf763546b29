Female Members of Parliament on Wednesday stunned the House when they all walked in with white head scarfs. Nominated MP Cecily Mbarire said it was a peaceful protest for the two-thirds gender rule to be passed. Their male colleagues said they felt intimidated and threatened. The female MPs walked in at 2.36pm after Speaker Justin Muturi started the session. Male MPs chuckled and murmured among themselves. They wondered what the occasion was. The Leader of Majority, Aden Duale, asked the Speaker to give direction since such a thing has never happened in Parliament. “Speaker, the people wearing head scarfs are threatening and intimidating. I want you to tell us whether the dress code is within the standing orders,” Duale said.

We want to know if what we are seeing is in order. We need to be assured of our safety,” Duale said. But Muturi said the female lawmakers looked smart. He congratulated them and said women's dress code should be decent and formal. "I have been informed there is nothing hidden beneath the headgear. I have no objection to it as it will not affect business in the House," Muturi said. He urged female MPs to keep up the trend, saying they looked beautiful and smart. Muturi said he will allow them to wear head scarfs. Lugari MP Ayub Savula accused his female counterparts of intimidation. He said they should instead come with ways of implementing the two-thirds gender rule. Muturi said he will not entertain points of order on non-issues. Kitutu Chache North MP Jimmy Angwenyi said male MPs should also come with caps so that they can be "in uniform" with their female counterparts. However, Muturi dismissed that and said it is not unusual for women to cover their hair. Also read:Only MPs can implement gender rule – Parliament Click here for the latest political news
