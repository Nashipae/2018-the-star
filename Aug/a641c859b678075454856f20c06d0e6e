Kiambu residents have been urged to go for free medical screening to detect lifestyle diseases early. Mount Kenya University chairman Simon Gicharu said early detection makes management easy. He spoke yesterday during the ongoing free cancer screening medical camp at MKU’s main campus in Thika. The free services are being offered by health specialists from MKU’s Health Science department in conjunction with those from India’s Nanavi Hospital, Kiambu county and Zambezi Hospital. The medical camp is themed ‘My health is my wealth. Take steps to reduce the risks’. The camp is part of the university’s corporate social responsibility activities. About 50 per cent of patients admitted to hospitals in Kiambu county suffer from noncommunicable diseases. NCDs Kiambu coordinator Edward Maina said most of the affected are women under the age of 60. A survey by the Health ministry conducted in 2016 revealed 44 per cent of adults have lifestyle diseases including high blood pressure, diabetes and cancer.  These diseases account for 27 per cent of total deaths annually. On Wednesday, the institution announced it is planning to set up a Sh50 million, 100 body capacity morgue in Thika. The morgue will be constructed in partnership with the Kiambu government and will cater for bodies that are collected by police from crime and accident scenes. The facility will decongest the General Kago Funeral Home that has been overloaded by unclaimed bodies and those brought in by the police.
