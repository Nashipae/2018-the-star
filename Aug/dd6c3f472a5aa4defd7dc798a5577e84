Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya has asked the national government to transfer construction of rural roads to county governments. The function is currently under the Kenya Rural Roads Authority. The governor said the national government is still holding onto the important role of roads infrastructure as residents continue to suffer at the grassroots. “As a result, counties have been reduced to beggars as they struggle to borrow funds from the national government for construction of roads,” Oparanya said. He said counties receive only 15 per cent of the national cake while the national government gets 85 percent, yet “little is seen at the grassroots with regards to development from the latter”. The governor spoke on Saturday in Malanga village, Malava subcounty, during the funeral service of John Walubengo. Kakamega senator Cleophas Malala, woman representative Elsie Muhanda, Malava MP Malulu Injendi, nominated senator Naomi Shionga and Kakamega speaker Morris Buluma were present. Oparanya said the funds allocated to the Kenya Urban Roads Authority and the Kenya National Highways Authority should be transferred to the counties as “the two state corporations have failed in their mandate”. On the ailing sugar sector, Oparanya called on MPs from sugar-growing areas to ensure the Sugar Act repealled in 2013 is reinstated, adding it provided better solutions for the ailing sector. He also supported zoning of the sugar sector in cane growing areas, saying it will put farmers at liberty to deliver their produce to a factory of their choice avoiding exploitation by millers.
