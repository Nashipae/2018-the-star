Mombasa governor Hassan Joho’s trip to Rift Valley and comments about 2022 succession politics have sparked sharp criticism from DP William Ruto’s allies in the region. Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi said on Sunday that Joho has no moral authority to speak about leadership and corruption. "We know he came here to target the DP but we want to tell him he is not in Ruto’s lealgue. He is a nobody and his own record concerning graft makes him unfit to speak about the same," Sudi said. The legislator said Joho was involved in questionable business at the Coast and has failed to wipe out the drugs problem in the region. Sudi addressed the press in Eldoret, alaong with Jubilee officials Sammy Ruto and Paul Kiprop. Speaking in Samburu and Baringo last week, Joho urged Kenyans not elect corrupt leaders. The governor said all leaders should support President Kenyatta’s war on graft and accept a lifestyle audit. "I am ready to be subjected to a lifestyle audit. I have records and can explain where I bought even my clothes and other assets. But other leaders must also be ready to explain how they bought helicopters and assets all over," Joho said. The governor said that Uhuru should be ready to lose more friends in the war against graft to save the country and secure his legacy. "We are clean people and ready to be his friends," Joho said. But Sudi said he would rather have poor Kenyans as friends than have politicians like Joho who claim to be clean but are tainted. The legislator said the graft war targets certain leaders. "But we are ready for it because we will also table lists and evidence of people living like kings on public land in Kenya," he said. Certain families own almost half of the country through grabbing yet they are accusing the DP Ruto of graft, he said. But Sudi did not name the families. Click here for the latest political news
