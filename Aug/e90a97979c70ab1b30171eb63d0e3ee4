EACC detectives have arrested a Nairobi tycoon who was allegedly attempting to bribe Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko at his Kilifi home. The anti-corruption body said it arrested Praful Kumar with Sh1 million after they were alerted of the events at the governor's resident on Monday. The trader is said to have gone to meet Sonko at his Kanamai residence when the EACC officers were called in. EACC Lower Coast regional boss George Ojowi said Kumar had gone to Sonko's residence with the bribe for the governor to approve the construction of a hotel. The county government on August 16 stopped works at the facility situated near the United Nation offices in Gigiri. "The suspect had gone to the governor's residence with an aim to bribe him so that he can get an approval of a hotel under construction in Nairobi," Ojowi told the Star on the phone. "EACC officers recovered Sh1 million in cash from the suspect." He said the suspect will be taken to court on Wednesday to face charges related to bribery. Sonko, through his communication team, said he will not condone corruption. "We are here to serve Kenyans in a transparent way. We support the President's war on corruption. Therefore, in Nairobi, we must also say no to corruption and the culture of impunity." Click here for the latest political news
