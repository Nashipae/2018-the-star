The
Senate and National Assembly are locked in a simmering turf war over their
roles. Yet, to borrow the cliché, the law is very clear on the functions of the
two Houses of Parliament. Article
93(2) of the Constitution sets out the “respective” functions of the National Assembly and
the Senate. The Assembly “exercises oversight over national revenue and its
expenditure”, “reviews the conduct in Office of the President, the Deputy President
and other State officers, and initiates the process of removing them from
office”. It also “exercises oversight of State organs”. The
Constitution also defines the role of the Senate as being to “represent and protect the
interests of the counties and their governments”. Its law-making functions are
limited to “considering, debating and approving Bills concerning counties” and “determining
the allocation of national revenue among counties". It
exercises oversight over “national revenue allocated to the county governments”. From
the foregoing, it is clear that senators have no business scouring newspapers for scandals and summoning officials and heads of State departments performing national
government functions to interrogate them. The
friction that is being portrayed as a case of overlapping mandates
is false. It is about the penchant for MPs to ingratiate themselves
on the public purse which they are unlikely to resolve
on their own. It should urgently be referred to the Supreme Court for
interpretation.  Quote of the Day: “Wisdom oft times consists of knowing what to do next.”  Herbert Clark Hoover The 31st US President was born on August 10, 1874.
