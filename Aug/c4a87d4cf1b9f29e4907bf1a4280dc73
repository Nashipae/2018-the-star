Bongo superstar Harmonize has opened up about his struggles before fame. Speaking to Word Is, he said: "I used to sell water in Tanzania. Even when I started focusing on music bado ilinichukua miaka miwili to create a name for myself. I also worked as a hawker before." The Kwangwaru hitmaker says his first song, Matatizo, focuses on 90 per cent of his true life story. "At some point, I felt God had not planned I become a musician. There was a time I almost gave up in life, but my mother kept encouraging me to continue pressing on," he said. "Diamond has mentored me so much in music and even given me a platform to be heard out there." Harmonize never imagined his songs would be hits like they are today. "I know sijafika but God is good sahii. Watu wamenijua and I feel so humbled kusikia watu singing my songs line to line." His message to upcoming artistes is: "If you want to achieve something believe in yourself, you can make it. That is what made me who I am today."
