Former Kenyan Premier League side Western Stima will be out to revenge their 1-0 loss to Bidco United when they host Nakuru All Stars at Moi Stadium, Kisumu this afternoon. Stima blew a priceless chance to open a three point gap at the top of the standings as Bidco capitalised on home advantage to pick all points on offer. Today, Paul Ogai’s powermen will leave nothing to chance as a frustrating result will further dent their promotion ambitions. With 10 matches remaining and four teams in contention for the two automatic promotion, Stima will be hoping to improve their tally to 55 points. However, All Stars, who have rubbed shoulders with relegation for the better part of the season, will heavily rely on an in-form John ‘Softie’ Ndirangu, who has been phenomenal since his return from Kakamega Homeboyz in June. All Stars are placed 16th with 20 points. Another promotion chasing outfit, Nairobi Stima, will be up against a second-from-bottom Isibania at Awendo Stadium. The Nairobi-based powermen have gathered 50 points and may ascend to the top of the standings should they electrocute Isibania and Western Stima and KCB fall to All Stars and Bidco respectively. Tomorrow, Camp Toyoyo will host a double header where debutants Kangemi All Stats, who are placed 13th with 31 points will play a ninth-placed Coast Stima before paving way for a clash between former top flight side, Nairobi City Stars and St Joseph Youth.
