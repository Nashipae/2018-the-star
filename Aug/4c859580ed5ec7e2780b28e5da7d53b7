Devolution Cabinet secretary Eugene Wamalwa has condemned MPs for shooting down a joint committee report on contraband sugar. Wamalwa said the MPs showed they don’t have the interests of Kenyan sugar farmers at heart. “It is so disheartening to see MPs being mentioned as being corrupt by receiving a paltry Sh10,000 to Sh30,000 to shoot down the important report. They should have considered the plight of poor farmers,” he said. The claims have been denied. Speaking at the homecoming of Kabula ward MCA Vitalis Sifuna in Bumula constituency on Sunday, Wamalwa said all local sugar firms will collapse with the continued importation of contaminated and contraband sugar. “By legislators killing this report they have committing economic terrorism. They want many Kenyans to die from poisoned sugar imported from other countries. Theyshould be mindful of the majority Kenyans,” he said. Wamalwa called on the President to form an independent commission of inquiry outside Parliament to investigate the importation of contraband sugar. Bumula MP Mwambu Mabonga said President Uhuru Kenyatta should leave a good legacy in the Western region. “We want you to leave behind a clean legacy. Don’t allow the sugar factories started by your father the first President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, like Mumias and Nzoia, to collapse before your own eyes. You would have ruined it completely,” he said. He threatened to withdraw support for the Jubilee government if the state continues to humiliate Western cane farmers. Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa asked Majority leader Aden Duale to stop interfering with the sugar report.
