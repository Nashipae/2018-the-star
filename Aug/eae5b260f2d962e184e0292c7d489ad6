Former Nairobi governor Evans Kidero has obtained orders restraining a newspaper from referring to him as "a white a collar criminal" unfit for public office. Justice Mbogholi Msagha on Wednesday barred the Standard Group and journalist Geoffrey Mosoku from publishing any defamatory material - article, words, testimony or remarks concerning Kidero until the matter is heard. He says the words are malicious, false and reckless, outside the perimeters of justification, fair comment and responsible communication on matters of public interest. Kidero sued for defamation after the journalist linked him to theft of county funds in a story published on July 9. The matter will be heard on August 14. Kidero filed the case under a certificate of urgency.
