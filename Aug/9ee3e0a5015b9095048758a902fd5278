A Kenyan wanted by the Interpol for Sh8 million fraud in Uganda has been released by an Eldoret court after police failed to process his extradition. Chief magistrate Charles Obulutsa ordered police to release Rodgers Kiptanui accused of electronic fraud. Kiptanui is accused of obtaining money from several people through electronic fraud. Obulutsa said police failed to process the extradition documents and cannot continue holding Kiptanui. Police from Uganda were already in Eldoret to go with the suspect, but Obulutsa said, “police failed to initiate the process within the seven days they were given by the court.”
