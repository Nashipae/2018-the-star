The government yesterday strengthened security at the 14th Kenya Primary School Heads Association annual conference in Mombasa following morning chaos. President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to open the conference today. Coast regional coordinator Bernard Leparmarai led the security team deployed to restore order ahead of the President’s visit. “Whatever happened here in the morning was uncalled for. We expect the Head of State to be here tomorrow because he has honoured your invitation. You must therefore respect him,” Lemparmarai told the teachers. “You might have your differences but they shouldn’t play out before the President. Any unruly act will be met with the full force of the law.” Lemparmarai was accompanied by Mombasa county commissioner Evans Achoki, county police commander Johnstone Ipara, Education ministry director general Elyas Abdi.
