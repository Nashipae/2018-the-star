The National Land Commission has started evaluating 16 plots in Mvita, Mombasa. The plots host more than 15,000 “tenants-at-will” – a term denoting house-owners in a rented land. Some of the houses are more than two centuries old. The rent paid has accumulated to millions of shillings. “Tenants at will” are mostly concentrated in Mombasa. NLC boss Muhammad Swazuri yesterday said the valuation will take three days and a report will be out in two weeks. Landlords are willing to sell the plots, Swazuri said, but their “exorbitant” figures are extremely higher than those quoted by house-owners. In one case, a landlord cited Sh10 million while a buyer had Sh1.5 million. NLC is mandated to come up with an agreeable figure.
