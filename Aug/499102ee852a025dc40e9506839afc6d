County hospitals will today receive medicine and other supplies worth Sh146 million from the Kenya Medical Suppliers Authority. This will be a relief to millions of residents who have suffered for two years after Kemsa cut supply following a Sh285 million debt. The supplier demanded the county clears the debt it owes before supplies resume. In June, the county paid Sh58 million, but the authority still declined to restock facilities. Last month, Governor Mike Sonko pleaded with President Uhuru Kenyatta and Health CS Sicily Kariuki to direct Kemsa to supply the medicine. Yesterday, the county officials, led by acting Health executive Vesca Kangogo, spent the better part of the day overseeing the loading of the consignment in lorries for dispatch. Kangogo will flag off the supplies today.
