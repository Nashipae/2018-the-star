Kenya Power are looking for a man believed to have constructed illegal supply lines in Kwa Kalaa village, Kitui Central constituency. In a statement on Monday, Kenya Power said Jacob Allan Otieno Nyawade allegedly obtained Sh60,000 in connection fees per household from unsuspecting locals. He is accused of obtaining the cash by falsely pretending that he was able to connect them to the grid. The money was to be used to purchase poles, conductors and other materials needed for the job as well as for his labour charge. Otieno is a foreman of a firm contracted by the Rural Electrification Authority (REA) to extend HT lines from Kiara Trading Centre to Kwa Kalaa village. The company initiated the hunt following complaints by the affected villagers. The lot said that suspected REA contractors were extorting money from them to construct electricity supply lines to their homes. "Kenya Power dispatched a security team accompanied by other officers from REA to stamp out illegal connections in the area," read the statement. Kenya Power also recovered 3,400 metres of low voltage conductors and 25 poles last week from illegal connections, facilitated by Otieno. It is suspected the materials were stolen from Kenya Power and REA stores and some vandalised from a low voltage line at Kiara Trading Center. George Mbogoh, Kenya Powerâ€™s security in charge of North Eastern, said investigations are ongoing and those who will be found culpable will be arrested and charged. "We advise members of the public to always apply for electricity and make payment for the same at our offices. No payment should be done to an individual," Mbogoh said. The company advised against unmetered electricity as they overload the network thus causing outages and undermining the quality of power supply.
