Former Kitui governor Julius Malombe wants the Kenya National Highways Authority to take full responsibility for accidents on the Thika-Garissa road. He said yesterday that the state agency should swiftly redesign the section near Mwingi town. “It is devastating to see our children perish. Many people have also died in accidents on the road. How many deaths will occur for you to act?” Malombe asked during the burial of Joy Mutanu — the daughter of former Mwingi Central MCA Benerd Mwangangi. She and nine others died in a road accident at Kanginga on August 4. Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi said his constituency lost four children. “I called for quick intervention from the government. The road is under expansion. The contractor should move faster,” he said.
