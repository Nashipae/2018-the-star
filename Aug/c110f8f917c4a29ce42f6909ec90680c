The pressure to remain in the SportPesa Premier League is piling on bottom-placed Thika United after succumbing 1-0 defeat to Vihiga United yesterday at Thika Stadium. Regarded once as an elite club, Thika’s reputation has in the past two years nosedived and this sesaon’s poor run might see them drop to the National Super League—a slot they narrowly escaped last year in a KPL/FKF playoff. The worrying situation at the club coupled by scarcity of funds has seen them gather a paltry 20 points from 28 matcheswith only five matches to go. Yesterday, Thika squandered the home advantage to fall to Amos Kigadi’s second half goal—a result which interim manager Joseph Ruto would not have wished to record in his maiden appearance in the dugout. Ruto, a long serving goalkeeper trainer at the club, assumed the head coach roles after John Njogu mysteriously disappeared on the bench amid reports that he had been asked to step aside. A bright first half for Thika was, however, shot down by Kigadi who headed the ball home from Stephen Wakanya’s free-kick with custodian Allan Owiny well beaten. With the two bottom teams set to be relegated at the end of the season and third from bottom side facing NSL’s third place team in a play-off, Vihiga’s win briefly detached them from the red zone. They are now 15th with 30 points and will be relieved to have Chemelil, Wazito and Thika behind them. Meanwhile, Nicholas Kipkirui returned to secure a point for Zoo Kericho as his second half goal saw his side rally from a goal down to settle for 1-1 all draw against Mathare United at Kericho Green Stadium. Kipkirui, who has been serving a three match ban, found the back of the net in the 52nd minute to cancel Roy Okal’s 36th minute goal. At the same time, hosts National Super League debutants Kisumu All Stars were held by a visiting Modern Coast Rangers to a barren draw at Moi Stadium Kisumu.
