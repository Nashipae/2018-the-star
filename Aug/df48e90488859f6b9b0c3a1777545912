Police officers on Sunday gunned down two suspected thugs at Kihunguro in Ruiru. Ruiru police boss James Ng’etich said they were part of a four-man gang that robbed an Uber taxi driver of his vehicle in Athi River. Ng’etich said one of the suspects died on the spot while the other succumbed to gunshot wounds while being taken to the hospital. One who was shot three times fled to the nearby Israel Assemblies of God Church and asked faithful to hide him from police officers. Pastor Peter Maina said the service was halted when the man, who was bleeding profusely, entered the church. “We heard gunshots while worshipping. A bleeding man came into the church but in less than two minutes, police officers entered the church and asked the man to surrender,” Maina said. “I pleaded with the officers not to shoot him since he had sought refuge in a church but they dragged him out and shot him." Terrified worshippers watched in horror as the events unfolded. Pastor Bedan Ng’ang’a said they wiped blood stains and prayed to "cleanse" the sanctuary. Ng’etich told the Star that the taxi driver had been hired in Lang’ata on Saturday night to pick up a sick person in Athi River. When they reached their destination, they were joined by three armed men. “They bundled the taxi driver into the back seat and drove around with him before dumping him at a quarry unhurt. We tracked the vehicle to Kihunguro,” Ng’etich said. The police boss said officers laid an ambush and that when the suspects spotted them, they drew a pistol and fired, prompting retaliation. Pastor Ng'ang'a told the youth to desist from engaging in crime and get saved. Kihunguro residents praised police for fighting crime in the area, saying criminals have turned the area into their hideout. Resident Philip Mwaniki added that a few years, the area was a no-go zone as attacks were rampant. He said police are doing a good job. Click here for the latest political news
