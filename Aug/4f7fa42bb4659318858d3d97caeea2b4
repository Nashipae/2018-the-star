Changamwe MP Omar Mwinyi has been found guilty of assaulting two police officers during ODM party primaries in April 2017. Mwinyi, who was convicted on Thursday, had been charged with 11 counts. TwoÂ were dismissed for lack of evidence. Mombasa chief magistrate Evans Makori said the assault charges were proven beyond reasonable doubt. Makori said it was proved that Mwinyi was largely involved in the attacks on the officers by his supporters. The chief magistrate said the MP failed to control his rowdy supporters who caused the officers severe injuries. "The case has been proven reasonable doubt. I therefore convict the accused," he ruled. The accused will be sentenced in the afternoon. The punishment is 10 years imprisonment or a fine of Sh1 million. Click here for the latest political news
