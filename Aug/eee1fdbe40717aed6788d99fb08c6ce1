Christian and Scientific Association of Kenya has ccused some churches of misleading their followers on vaccines and GMOs.  The association said the vaccines and GMOs are safe. They said this yesterday at CSAK’s annual general meeting in Naivasha, which brought together religious leaders and scholars.  CSAK project director Prof Francis Muregi told reporters some leaders had blown the issue out of proportion, and mislead Kenyans over the use of the vaccines.  “We want to demystify the myth that scientists cannot come up with a drug that would be acceptable by faith-based institutions,” he said
