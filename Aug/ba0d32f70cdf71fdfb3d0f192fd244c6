Nasa leader Raila Odinga has urged Kenyans to back the Building Bridges team, which he said will unify the country. Raila yesterday said the fruits of the handshake will be realised after the 14 members of the Building Bridges team conclude their task. Speaking at Ofafa Friends Church in Nairobi’s Makadara constituency, Raila said the Canaan goodies including ‘asali’ [honey] will be realised soon. He called on Kenyans to support the team led by Ambassador Martin Kimani and lawyer Paul Mwangi.

The former Prime Minister was responding to Ruaraka MP TJ Kajwang, who earlier challenged the leaders to fast track their negotiations, claiming the Nasa side is getting impatient. “I want to urge you and President Uhuru Kenyatta to cook whatever you are cooking in the kitchen very fast. We told our supporters we are taking them to Canaan. The hunger will kill us,” Kajwang said. Raila said handshake goodies will start trickling once the team finalises its assignment. “That is why it is called the Building Bridges Initiative, it will take all, including Jubilee to Canaan. Let us build the bridges and after that we will have honey,” he said. The opposition leader said how his truce with Uhuru was as a result of hard choices that emerged before them following the January 30 mock swearing-in. Alluding to the biblical story of two women fighting over one child, Raila said they agreed not to divide the country and give the building of bridges a chance to unite the country.
