DP William Ruto will be the automatic Jubilee presidential candidate in 2022, despite other politicians seeking to join the party, Nandi senator Samson Cherargei has said. “Those rushing to join Jubilee should know the candidate for 2022 will be William Ruto. There will be no debate about it and they should be ready to back him,” he said. The legislator said the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga will not change the Jubilee strategy to have DP Ruto take over. Cherargei said in Nandi that those angling to join Jubilee or have a working relationship with Jubilee should know the party has owners who have already identified Ruto as Uhuru’s successor. “We will not entertain talk about nominations for a candidate or such things. We already have a Jubilee candidate. The  other people should organise themselves,” he said. Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter has been asked to stop holding rallies to undermine DP Ruto in Rift Valley. Keter has differed with DP Ruto’s allies in the region. About 100 MCAs met in Eldoret town and accused the MP of politically undermining Ruto to frustrate the DP’s 2022 presidential bid. “We will not allow him to hold any rallies and speak negatively against the DP. We will stop him,” said Uasin Gishu assembly Majority leader Josphat Lowoi, who read a statement on behalf of the MCAs. They said Keter is not the Kalenjin community spokesman and that his negative views on the DP are personal. Lowoi said they will not allow Keter to work with the DP’s rivals ahead of the 2022 elections. Two weeks ago, Keter attacked unnamed Kalenjin leaders he termed corrupt and who should seek national leadership in 2022. He said corrupt Kalenjin politicians are hiding behind the community to shield themselves from investigations. Keter asked Kenyans to reject Rift Valley politicians who have stolen public funds and want to be elected in 2022 to top positions. Click here for
