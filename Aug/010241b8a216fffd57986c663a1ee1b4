The Machakos government plans to tear down buildings on public property, including on riparian parcels. Illegal construction on riparian land blocks river flow and causes flooding and other problems. Governor Alfred Mutua yesterday said the county will recover land meant for Mavoko Stadium in Athi River and other parcels in Machakos town. “Some public land was stolen by prominent Kenyans, including serving and former senators, MPs, MCAs, councillors and senior government officials,” he told reporters outside his office. Deputy Governor Francis Maliti accompanied him. Mutua expressed outrage that the county lacks land for hospitals, youth centres, stadiums, schools and other facilities because unscrupulous developers had been on a grabbing spree. He warned the culprits against resisting the crackdown, saying the mood in the country has changed and impunity must be stopped. “I urge them to surrender the parcels honourably without resisting. One way or the other, we’ll get them back,” Mutua said. He said the political will to fight corruption and impunity “has reached astronomical levels” and most people fully support the initiative. The county will not be left behind in efforts to promote the rule of law and restore order in the management of public resources, the county chief said.
