Former Transport CS Michael Kamau has been directed to serve the ODPP with his application against his prosecution over a Sh33 million tender for a road in Bungoma. Justice John Mativo said on Monday that the AG, EACC and the Anti-Corruption Court should also be served ahead of an inter-parties hearing on August 28. Last week, Mativo certified the case as urgent after Siaya Senator James Orengo applied for a hearing before September 4, when Kamau is expected to appear for another case. Mativo directed Orengo to serve other parties who were told to respond within seven days. Orengo, who is representing Kamau in the case, said the present charges are premised on an illegal and unconstitutional directive from the DPP so they cannot stand. He said the court must suspend the criminal proceedings and declare that his prosecution is tainted with illegalities. Kamau was last month ordered to pay a cash bail of Sh500,000 after he pleaded not guilty to charges of abuse of office. He was further directed to present himself to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission for processing. Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti earlier ruled that the former minister should face trial and dismissed an application he had filed at the Supreme Court for the process to be halted. Kamau is facing two counts of abuse office and willful failure to comply with procedures and guidelines on the management of public funds. He is accused of ignoring the design of Kamukuywa-Kaptama-Kapsokwony-Sirisia Road, by Engiconsult Limited at a cost of Sh33,303,600, and entering a memorandum under which the resident engineer redesigned the same road without due process.
