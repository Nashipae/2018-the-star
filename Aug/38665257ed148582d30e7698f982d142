Chief Justice David Maraga yesterday ordered the completion by year’s end of all pending cases more than fives years old.The Judiciary is grappling with a backlog of 111,973 cases, all of which are more than fives years old. This, Maraga said, is an injustice to Kenyans.“Justice delayed is justice denied,” he told judges during the 2018 annual Judiciary Annual Judges’ Colloquium in Mombasa. He said use of technology and establishment of service weeks in different stations will help deal with the backlog.The CJ intimated some of the backlog is due to laziness of some judges and undue technicalities. “The backlog is a manifestation of denial of justice. Some of the injustice is clear,” Maraga said. He said some people have been made to stay in remand longer than their eventual sentences would require them to.
