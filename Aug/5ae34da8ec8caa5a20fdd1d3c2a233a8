Former Mungiki sect leader Maina Njenga has urged Kenyans to support constitutional reforms. He said he supports abolition of some seats “which give politicians a lot power and respect, but leave the country divided after an election”. Njenga, who is the chairman of the Amani Sasa outfit, said a Constitution with an executive Prime Minister is ideal because “it will balance the government and the opposition”. “A Constitution that brings about coexistence is in the offing in this country. We need to have an all-around Constitution that ensures equality” he said.

Njenga spoke at Soul Winning Ministries at Kamirithi village during a thanksgiving service organised by Bishop Harun Ngaruiya and his son on Sunday. However, Gigil MP Martha Wangare opposed the proposal, saying it was not the right time to change the Constitution so as “to accommodate some politicians”. Wangare said the government is working well and applauded President Uhuru Kenyatta for reaching out to opposition leader Raila Odinga to ensure coexistence between their supporters. Others present at the service were Kiambu deputy governor James Nyoro and Kabete MP James Githua who asked leaders to support the government achieve its pledge on the Big Four agenda. Githua urged residents to support Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto achieve the development agenda peacefully, adding politicking adds no value. He applauded Uhuru for his war on corruption. Githua joked about tabling a bill banning all Sh500 and Sh1,000 currency notes because “some corrupt people have hidden money in bags at home”. More: THE MAINA NJENGA FACTOR Click here for
