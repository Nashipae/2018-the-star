Busia County will benefit
significantly from the Multi-billion shillings’ 150 kilometers road project
that will link Eastern Uganda and Kenya through the Suam border in Trans Nzoia
County. The project funded by the African
Development Bank will cover 73 kilometers from Kapchorwa in Uganda to the Suam
border. A similar project will cover over 77km from Suam to Kitale town. The Ugandan side of the road will
cost US Dollars 105m.Upon completion the road will increase investment and
trade benefit between Kenya and Uganda and also ease movement of people. Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong who
witnessed the official launch of the construction works by Ugandan president
Yoweri Museveni on Sunday afternoon accompanied by Turkana governor Josephat
Nanok and their West Pokot counterpart John Lonyangapuo said his county will
reap big from the project once it is complete. “The Busia business community will
access markets in Eastern Uganda, Trans Nzoia and neighbouring counties with
relative ease. This will increase trade in the region which currently has poor
road infrastructure,’’ he said. The Governor on Saturday attended the
Young Achievers Award ceremony in Kampala to benchmark on how and why the youth
in Uganda are contributing to the socio-economic transformation of their
country. ‘’ I witnessed a great example of ‘’local
solutions for local problems’.’ The safeboda company is bringing the
classic mode of boda boda transport into the technological age by providing the
ability to hail a ride at the click of a smartphone, thanks to a young Ugandan
who came up with the new technology,’’ he said. Before travelling to Kapchorwa, H.E.
Ojaamong attended the Africa Now Business Leadership Breakfast meeting where
Busia County received thumbs up for offering a conducive business climate that
has seen Uganda overtake Kenya for the first in exports to the partner state.
