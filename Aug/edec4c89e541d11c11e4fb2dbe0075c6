Deputy President William Ruto does not own Taj Mall and he has no shares in the business, former senator aspirant and businessman Ramesh Gorasia said yesterday. “Ruto has zero shares. I can show you the title. I’m the owner of Taj Mall,” he told the Star. Gorasia also dismissed claims the mall was built on government land. He said he bought 1.75 acres in 1991 and another two acres in 1995 — both from Abuja Ltd. The building is in Embakasi. Last year, NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri said the government had compulsorily acquired part of the land in the 1960s. This was meant for expansion of Airport North and Outering Road, he said. Meanwhile, Gorasia urged the government to follow the law when demolishing buildings. He said the authorities should look for alternative ways of conserving the environment, instead of demolishing structures. Ongoing demolitions are carried out by cartels in government, he said. Gorasia said unscrupulous officers at Ardhi House are to blame for issuing documents for building on riparian land. He wants investors protected and called for systems that promote the rule of law and investor confidence. “Before demolitions, the state should arrest and charge people who approved construction of the buildings. Those who issued the title deeds should be responsible,” he said. “If a mistake has been done, let them divert the river, instead of demolishing a building worth billions that authorities have approved.”
