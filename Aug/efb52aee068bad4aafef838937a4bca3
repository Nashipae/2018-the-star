The Directorate of Criminal Investigations is probing the possible loss of more than Sh36 million at the Milimani law courts. An internal audit covering January 2016 and December 2017 exposed suspected misuse of funds. A report by the Judiciary Directorate of Audit and Risk Management flagged multiple questionable transactions. Chief Registrar Ann Amadi has written to the DCI to investigate the matter. "The report reveals a substantial amount of revenue was lost through fraudulent schemes. We are requesting your office to commence investigations and take action on those found culpable," reads Amadi's letter to the DCI. The Registrar further states that her office is ready to support investigators to ensure the culprits are brought to book. In response, the DCI asked for an appointment with the Registrar's office to get documents related to the probe. A similar report has been filed before the Judiciary Ombudsman. The report details how judicial staff may have pocketed millions through issuance fake receipts, alterations, and double payments. More than 300 fake receipts are said to have been issued at the Commercial Division. The suspects issued receipts but failed to record them in the counter receipt book. More money is suspected to have been lost at the Civil Division, which has a deficit of more than Sh498,000. At the Environment Division, about Sh7.5 million cannot be accounted for.
