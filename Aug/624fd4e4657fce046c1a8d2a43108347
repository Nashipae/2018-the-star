Workers at a water company in Murang'a on Monday closed taps supplying water to the town and its environs in protest. They later took to the streets to challenge the county government's move to take over water services. Governor Mwangi wa Iria, however, directed the Murang’a Water and Sanitation Company (MUWASCO) to immediately restore water supply saying the disconnection was illegal. "Murang’a people have a right to access clean water and I fail to understand how a government entity can wake up one morning and disconnect water to all consumers," Wa Iria said. He maintained that the water reforms is in the interest of members of the public and will be implemented at whatever cost. Wa Iria on Friday announced that he would take over water services and that water companies' staff would be absorbed into the county pay roll. The workers, he said, will have to sign a letter agreeing or declining to work under the county government. "Defiance will not be tolerated," he noted. Two weeks ago, the governor appointed professor Joseph Kimura to replace Peter Munga as Muwasco chairman and gazetted the appointment. Munga is yet to officially accept his resignation. This is likely to escalate a long-running battle between Wa Iria and Munga that stemmed in the governor’s first term. Wa Iria at that time accused Munga of sponsoring a candidate to vie against him.
