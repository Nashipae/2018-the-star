A woman and her two children were found dead inside a church compound in Uhonya village in Gem sub-county on Sunday night. Anna Onyango, 38, and her sons Dan Onyango, 12, and eight-year-old Lawrence Onyango were found dead inside a makeshift tent in the compound of the God’s Last Appeal Church. They are suspected to have been suffered carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a jiko the mother allegedly used in the tent. Chief of North West Gem location  Barrack Opondo said the woman and her two children had attended the church’s on-going annual prayer conference. He said Anna and her two sons had erected a makeshift tent where they spent that night but were not seen the whole of Sunday, only for their bodies to be discovered in the tent at around 9pm. Other conference attendees are also staying in makeshift tents. Opondo said the church leadership informed the police, who took the bodies to Siaya County Referral Hospital Mortuary.
