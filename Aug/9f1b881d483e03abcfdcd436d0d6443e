A teenage mother who had a needle left in her genitals after giving birth has threatened to sue a private dispensary for compensation. The 18-year-old woman has also given the Bungoma Referral Hospital two weeks to pay her damages for keeping her for two weeks before removing the needle. Macklin Amunga gave birth at Bulondo Dispensary on May 10, but during the process, a minor operation – episiotomy – was carried out because the baby could not pass through her birth canal. But during the stitching, a needle was left inside her genitals. This resulted in a lot of pain and she was transferred to the Bungoma Referral Hospital where she was admitted for two weeks. At the Bungoma Referral Hospital, an X-ray showed a needle was stuck in her genitals. "The medics at the institution, however, delayed for two weeks to remove the needle because the machines in the theatre were out of order," her lawyer Kennedy Murunga said. Amunga says the negligence by the Bulondo Dispensary and the Bungoma Referral Hospital staff in delaying the surgery caused her a lot of pain and urinary disorder. "The actions of your staff in conducting surgery subjected our client to excruciating pain that would have been avoided had the same be done diligently and procedurally, “read the letter in part. Macklin said she has suffered repeated urinary inconsistency, involuntary passage of urine and she in dire need of a corrective surgery. She wants the county government and the hospital to accept liability with 10 days or else she moves to court. “Ever since the incidence I can't control my urine and the pain is always on and off I have sought medical attention but I have always been told I needed a corrective surgery,” Amunga told the star.
