Six of the 10 St Gabriel Boarding Primary School pupils who perished in a grisly road accident in Mwingi were buried on Saturday in Mwingi. A brother and a sister - Andrea Kasyoka and James Muthui - were laid to rest at their father’s farm at Kairungu village in Mwingi West. Catholic Priests Fr Dominic Kitili and Fr Julius Muthamba presided over Mass. Another accident victim Winnie Mbete was buried at Kathita village in Ndaluni sub-location. The pupils died at Kanginga Bridge after their school bus was involved in an accident with a lorry on August 4. There were three burials in Mwingi Central. Joy Mutanu, a daughter of the immediate former MCA for Mwingi township, was buried at Kalisasi village. Stephen Mwangangi was buried at Mboru village also in Mwingi township ward as was Kennedy Matei whose body was interred at Ikuuni village in Mwingi Central. Mwingi Central Gedion Mulyungi attended the burials in his constituency, while his Mwingi West counterpart Charles Nguna did the same in his backyard. Former Kitui governor Julius Malombe attended Mutanu's burial. Nguna said a contractor who is rehabilitating the Thika-Mwingi road should be held responsible for the deaths. "The driver of the lorry that collided with the school bus which plunged into Kanginga River was driving recklessly," he said.
