A
judge has issued a temporary order stopping Chinese firm
Jiangxi Water and Hydropower Construction Company from proceeding with
Sh50 million construction of a storm water drainage in Thika. Justice Francis Tuiyott issued the order following an application by
lawyer Stephen Oganda representing John Karugu. Karugu is the director of Ventures Limited, a company that was subcontracted to work on the project. Karugu said they entered an agreement
with the Chinese firm to construct the storm water drainage at a
cost of Sh50 million but his firm was suddenly evicted from the project site
and another contractor given his job. He accuses the Chinese firm of breaching their contrac by evicting him without notice. Karugu
claimed Jiangxi Water and Hydropower Construction Company frustrated
the progress of project and it failed to remit adequate periodic
payments since the work began. The
judge granted temporary orders restraining the foreign firm, its agents, their subcontractors
or any other person from proceeding with construction of drainage. The matter will be mentioned on September 28.
