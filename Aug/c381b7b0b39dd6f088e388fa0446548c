Spokesman Paul Njuguna said the officers were on a humanitarian civil assignment before the attack by Al Shabaab militants. The troops were on their way to fetch and distribute water to residents. Both the water bowser and lorry were damaged. "The soldiers hit the explosive along the Kinga and Sankuri road injuring 10 others," Njuguna said. "We thank the locals who offered assistance to the soldiers and call upon them to assist in weeding out lurking terror elements."
