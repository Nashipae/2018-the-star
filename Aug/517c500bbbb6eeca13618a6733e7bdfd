The government has released Sh800 million to compensate more than 1,500 families who will be displaced to allow construction of the Eldoret Southern Bypass. The money will be paid by the National Land Commission before construction of the Sh5.6 billion project starts in two months. Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi assured the families that they will be paid as soon as possible and that the by-pass will ease traffic congestion in Eldoret town. “This is a very vital project that ease the movement of goods and people through Eldoret town,” sudi said on Thursday in his constituency. The Eldoret Southern Bypass will stretch from Ngeria area along the Eldoret-Nairobi road through areas next to the Eldoret airport before linking with the Eldoret-Webuye road at Leseru. Acting NLC chairperson Abigael Mbagaya is expected to visit the region in two weeks to finalise compensation plans for the families. Last week, the families protested against the delayed payout, arguing that the project had taken almost a year with no clear communication on compensation. The families had threatened to block contractors from starting the project funded by the African Development Bank.
