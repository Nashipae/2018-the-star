Eight police officers have been linked to the theft of nine computers at the Homa Bay county commissioner’s office on Wednesday last week. They include officers who were on duty on the night of the theft and their supervisors. Speaking to journalists in his office on Tuesday, Homa Bay DCI Commander Daniel Wachira said the officers are being treated as suspects after the initial investigations. Wachira said he has filed a report on the officers to the Director of Public Prosecutions for legal action. “The officers are the first suspects. They should explain where they were when the incident occurred. I’ve submitted a report to the DPP for advice,” he said. National and county government offices are located in the same compound with County Commissioner Irungu Macharia’s office. Thieves broke into the Deputy County Commissioner's, the Agriculture CEC's, County Disaster Department, the National Persons Living with Disability and the County Budget and Economics Forum offices. The burglars left behind printers, keyboards and other electronic devices. An official in the department of persons living with disability told journalists they lost important data.
