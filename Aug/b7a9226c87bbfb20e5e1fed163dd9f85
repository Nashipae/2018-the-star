President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday urged the youth to be at the forefront in the war against corruption and impunity. He said graft has become a big obstacle towards achieving development. Uhuru spoke at Kisii High School during the International Youth Day. “The power of fighting corruption is in your hands. You should not spare even your parents, relatives or friends,” he said. Uhuru cautioned the youth against being misused by politicians, saying they must take their lives seriously. “You must stop being used by politicians to fight in rallies. You need to understand they are out to ruin your bright future,” the head of state said.
