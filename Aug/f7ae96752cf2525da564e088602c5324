Anti-graft detectives yesterday grilled 19 members of the Nairobi County Assembly over bribery allegations. The members of the Labour committee were questioned after an audio recording of Utalii MCA Wilson Ochola, a member of the panel, emerged claiming they were bribed to alter a report. In the audio, Ochola claimed the members were bribed with Sh1 million to doctor a report on the controversial award of Sh1.3 billion medical cover to an insurance firm. The committee was probing the controversial award of the tender. Ochola claimed in the audio the money was given out by the director of the insurance firm. He alleged the director gave out Sh5 million for the members, but only Sh1 million was delivered. Ochola was the first member to record the statement with the detectives. He disowned the audio.
