Universities have been urged to create a parallel avenue of generating income to run the institutions. Mount Kenya University chancellor John Struthers urged varsities to venture into partnerships that will generate revenue. This comes as reports indicate universities are in a financial crisis. Struthers said the partnerships can support university programmes such as funding research. “Universities the world-over have to be committed to their core business – teaching, research and community outreach. To accomplish these roles, universities need funding. I wish to underscore the role of partners in contributing towards the universities’ capitation, which can happen either directly or indirectly,” he said. Currently, most universities rely on government funding and tuition fee from students to run activities. This is after the government in 2014 extended the benefits of subsidised university education beyond public institutions in a policy shift to motivate expansion of private universities. Struthers spoke during the MKU 14th graduation ceremony on Friday in Thika. This year, Mount Kenya University has received the highest number of government-sponsored students in the latest placement by Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service (KUCCPS) in the private universities category. Data indicates the university with a capacity of 4,995 received 2,247 students. The state funds these students through direct capitation per head count. The remaining amount is paid by students. MKU’s list of collaborations with universities and industry partners are quite extensive. There are more than 100 partners spread in all areas of specialisation such as education, hospitality and tourism, ICT, human health and allied sciences, animal health, pure and applied sciences and engineering, Struthers said. Universities with partnerships in Kenya include University of Nairobi, Kenyatta University, Egerton University and the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.
