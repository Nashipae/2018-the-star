Learners in technical and vocational institutions will receive as much as Sh40,000 loans annually from the Higher Education Loans Board. The government will also provide a Sh30,000 capitation for each TVET trainee. It has reduced the annual training fee from Sh92,000 to Sh56,420. TVET institutions have 382,000 learners. Together with new applicants, they will have their fees fully covered. Education CS Amina Mohamed yesterday said Sh26,400 of the Helb loan will be paid directly to TVET institutions for tuition. Another Sh13,600 will cater for trainees’ upkeep and will be deposited in their c bank accounts. “This year, the government has resolved to enhance financing to over 150,000 TVET trainees at an estimated cost of Sh10.5 billion,” Amina said. “We hope that before the October 31 deadline, learner will take up the opportunity and apply for the loan.” High Education Loans Board CEO Charles Ringera said they received 12,000 loan applications from TVET learners, compared with a target of 150,000. TVET principal secretary Kevit Desai blamed the low number of applications on “little knowledge among Kenyans on access to the loans”. The funds will be paid for the first time directly to the students under a new system named Smart Card Solution. “I direct that all TVET institutions implement the Smart Card Solution by December 31, 2018, to effectively and efficiently manage these funds,” Amina said. She said students undertaking science, technology, engineering, mathematics, agriculture and fisheries programmes will get special emphasis in the revamped TVET plan. The government targets these courses so the youth have the technical skills to drive the Big Four agenda. They include basic vocational skills such as plumbing, electrical wiring, welding, brick laying, painting, carpentry and tailoring. “TVET is instrumental to our national growth and development. Provision of technical skills to our youth will prepare them for self and gainful employment, particularly in infrastructure, agriculture, blue economy, leather, textiles and manufacturing,” Amina said. Helb statistics show that since its inceptionm, Sh84 billion has been lent to 671,448 students. Some 396,329 loan accounts worth Sh47 billion have matured for repayment. The remaining 275,119 borrowers holding Sh37.1 billion have not matured as the loans are held by students in colleges and universities. Some 190,554 students have cleared Sh18.2 billion loans, while 144,075 students are repaying theirs valued at Sh22.1 billion.
