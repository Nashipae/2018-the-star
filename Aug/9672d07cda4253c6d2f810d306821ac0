Knut Bungoma South Branch has said the September strike is still on as long as the TSC doesn’t come up with a clear policy on delocalisation of teachers. Speaking to the press on Wednesday, branch executive secretary general Ken Nganga said TSC should only transfer young teachers from their home counties. He said TSC should also consider the health condition of the affected teachers before posting their transfer letters to the office of the county and subcounty directors of Education. He added that some teachers are suffering from sensitive health conditions including asthma and high blood pressure so they should not be transferred from their counties because “they need special care from their families”. The executive Secretary hinted on the need for the TSC to consider placing teachers who have gone for further studies in higher job groups as is done for other civil servants in the Public Service. massive strike Nganga said many teachers have done Masters degrees to develop their careers and expand their research capabilities, but the Ministry of Educaton “seems to have turned a blind eye on their efforts to boost standards and students’ performance in national exams”. This comes after Knut national secretary general and ODM nominated MP Wilson Sossion called for a massive national strike in early September if Education CS Amina Mohamed and TSC CEO Nancy Macharia do not hold talks with the teachers union to address their concerns effectively.
