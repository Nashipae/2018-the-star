When driving slowly along a rough track
in the Athi Basin, I noticed a large predominantly green worm will beautiful
markings on an acacia branch. After stopping and looking properly we noted that
it was the worm that eventually becomes an emperor moth. Then I thought …..Wow! Isn’t this an
amazing part of creation  ….eggs hatch and
a tiny worms emerge and  consume large
quantities of leaves to grow into massive worms. The worms make cacoons and
after a short period change completely as they wiggle out their cacoons as
flying creatures we call moths and butterflies. What an incredible
metamorphosis to change from wiggly fat worms into a magnificently coloured
winged wonders. Interestingly there are a number of people
who believe that mankind is similar to greedy worms, until we find our true
purpose that God has given us on Earth. When we discover who we are, and emerge
with our hearts changed from within, we are transformed to use our gifts and
talents for good purpose in making this world a better place for all to live
together. Apart from my thoughts, worms and
butterflies are also a vital part of many ecosystems. Many birds and creatures
feast on worms in order to survive, butterflies land on a flowers to suck delicious
nectar through their proboscis, and accidentally gather pollen on their bodies
as they rub against the anthers. The butterflies then rub some of the pollen on
the next flowers they move to and then collect some more. Through this process,
the butterflies are able to pollinate numerous flowers as they move along.
Pollination allows plants to reproduce by producing seeds. The
challenge for us a humans is to know the habits of various species,, the
results will always be rewarding.
