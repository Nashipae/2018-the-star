Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji has dismissed claims that Deputy CJ Philomena Mwilu's arrest was influenced. Haji was responding to claims that her arrest might be linked to President Uhuru Kenyatta's 2017 remark when he said he will 'fix' the Judiciary when he is reelected. This after the Supreme Court revoked Uhuru's victory in the August 8, 2017, General Election citing irregularities and ordered a fresh poll. Uhuru has said he will respect the ruling and called for calm amid fears of unrest.

Speaking when he addressed journalists on Tuesday, Haji said every decision made on the arrest of Mwilu was done independently. "We are not being directed by anyone out there. We are independent...this decision was made independently of any factors or matters out there," he said. Haji said there have been concerted efforts to fight corruption and economic crimes, and Mwilu's arrest was one of them. "The fight has seen several high ranking officials and entities charged with various offences including asset forfeiture and confiscation," he said. In January, Uhuru dropped Attorney General Githu Muigai and demoted Solicitor General Njee Muturi in changes that ultimately targeted the Supreme Court and the Judiciary in general. Githu was replaced by Appeal Court President Mwangi Kihara while Njee's position was taken by lawyer Kennedy Ogetto, who was part of Uhuru's ICC legal team.
