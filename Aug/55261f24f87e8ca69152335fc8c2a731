Nairobi senator Johnson Sakaja yesterday urged Migori residents to vote for ODM senatorial candidate Ochillo Ayacko in the October 8 by-election. Sakaja, who was elected on the Jubilee ticket, said voters should pick Ayacko because of the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. Sakaja said Ayacko was “a handshake candidate” because his election will be the first since the March 9 truce. “I’ve heard there are other candidates vying in the by-election here, just ignore them and bring Ayacko to the Senate we are already booking a space for him,” Sakaja said. He was speaking at Kamagambo TTC in Rongo constituency during the burial of James Ombado. Ombado is the father in-law to ambassador Martin Kimani. Sakaja said the handshake has allowed him to comfortably walk into opposition strongholds without fear even when an election is imminent. He said he had thrown his weight behind Ayacko because Jubilee will not be fielding a candidate. The party position was announced by secretary general Raphael Tuju. “We have a few leaders in Migori who are still out to frustrate Ayacko’s win. They should step aside and support Ayacko. As Jubilee leaders, we are fully behind Ayacko,” Sakaja said. Sakaja said the handshake is set to expand the government as asked Ayacko’s opponents to step aside because they will be “accommodated.” He said Jubilee leaders will campaign alongside ODM’s Raila and his brigade for Ayacko if called upon to do so.
