Panic gripped an Elgeyo Marakwet county office on Friday afternoon after workers discovered suspicious paraphernalia at an executive's office. County workers said they found the paraphernalia, believed to be for sorcery purposes, at Finance CEC Isaac Kamar’s desk. It comprised cowry shells and some items that are associated with witchcraft. The incident caused a scare, temporarily paralysing services as officials camped outside the office for hours in the afternoon. "We don’t know how the paraphernalia got into the office. Someone must have sneaked in the items and left without being noticed," one of the workers said. When contacted, Kamar said he does not believe in witchcraft and added the items could have been meant to scare staff. "I can’t understand the motive but who believes in sorcery in the 21st Century," the CEC said. Click here for the latest political news
