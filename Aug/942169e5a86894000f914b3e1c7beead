Fourteen students have been arraigned in a Kapsabet court over arson at St Joseph Girls High School Chepterit in Nandi. The students did not take pleas before the Kapsabet senior principal magistrate Dolphina Alego as the charge sheets were not ready. The magistrate ordered the students to be handed over to their parents to return them to school 24 hours after they were arrested by officers from the DCI. There was drama at the court as six lawyers defending the students protested to the court over the continued detention of the students at the court cells. The lawyers pleaded to the court to direct the students be returned to school since the prosecution had not completed investigations. State counsel Clare Langat asked the court to have the suspects returned to the police and have them bonded before being returned to school.
