When you say you'll reclaim illegally acquired land, you don't stop before the job is done. There is a Kikuyu saying that when you remove your clothes, you must shower. You don't just wash your face, you wash the entire body. So President Uhuru Kenyatta must clean the whole body by going for all illegally acquired public property.      The land where the Weston Hotel stands belongs to the Civil Aviation Authority. Records clearly show that. So, if the President does not apply the law equally, we would understand that Kenya has levels of thieves. There are thieves without political power and those are the ones they are going after. When you protect a thief, you are a thief.      The President, if he is not being a hypocrite and if he means business, should be ready to lose friends, including the Deputy President, by demolishing the Weston Hotel. As long as the hotel stands, it's a symbol of impunity. It shows that some animals are more equal than others.     Remember this. A despicable act took place just next to the hotel. The merciless teargassing of Langata Primary School kids in 2015 to protect a land grabber. The President should be more concerned about his legacy than his popularity. He isn't running again. He should focus on what we will remember him for in 50 years.     He should not appease anybody by promoting impunity. He can use at least three reports — Kroll, Ndungu and TJRC — to recover stolen public property. As he recovers the land, he must also recover the stolen money.     Arresting suspects is fine but KRA must recover hidden loot. It would be a waste sending people to jail without recovering the money. The President can do a plea bargain. You return the money, you don't go to jail.       The President has the support of 50 million Kenyans in this anti-graft war. That support will actually be turned into love, but only if he really means business after 54 years of plunder.  The rights activist spoke to the Star
