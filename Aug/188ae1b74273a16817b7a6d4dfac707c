Three schools along the Marakwet-West Pokot border did not reopen yesterday following a banditry attack. Rustlers suspected to be from Pokot Central made away with more than 60 cows and sheep yesterday morning. Former Kapyego MCA Benson Kiptire said the first raid took place in Kipchumwa on Friday and the attackers proceeded to Komologon on Saturday. He said the government had withdrawn police officers. “The attack happened a few metres from Kamelei Primary School. Neighboring Tenderwa and Kalya schools are deserted. Teachers and pupils fear for their lives,” he said.
