Nyeri governor Mutahi Kahiga on Friday signed into law the draft charter that will elevate Nyeri town to a municipality. He said Nyeri will attract Sh230 million from the World Bank to help actualise the new status and improve services. The town will get a facelift. It will be decongested and new bus stations will be built, Kahiga said. The county will also tarmac its roads. Kahiga said the charter will now allow the county government to roll out a programme in the municipality. Instead, there will be a municipality manager and a board to run it. “Members will be appointed from professional bodies. The charter clearly indicates who is to be picked,” he said. The positions will soon be advertised in the newspapers.The board will have a minimum of seven members. “This charter fi xes the boundaries of our municipality. We would have longed to have two municipalities but were not able to meet the threshold. Woe will work with the boundaries of the old Nyeri municipality,” Kahiga said. He also signed the Nyeri County Revenue Administration Bill into law. It was an amendment of the 2014 Revenue Administration. It gives powers to the revenue director to review and collect rates and revenues. “We’ve set up a very ambitious plan of rising about Sh1 billion this financial year,” the county boss said. The county fell short of the target by Sh240 million after raising Sh760 million,” Kahiga said.
