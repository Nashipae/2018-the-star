Arrogance and pride of county officials are some the challenges I face as Nairobi speaker, Beatrice Elachi has said. "I did not come to fight, I came here to follow procedure.. let us stop the politicisation and move on... We want a county assembly where we respect each other," she said. "I want to tell Kenyans, that when you are given a civil servant's job you cannot work with pride and arrogance. You can't be that dumb and have impunity," she said. Elachi said there is a negative perception about a woman holding the position of speaker. "When you question things as the speaker, some people look at you through gender lenses. I don't want to think its about gender because we have a culture of impunity," she said. Elachi said she will strive to clean the assembly after five county officers were taken to court for conspiring to defraud City Hall Sh997,926. Primara Ventures is said to have been paid books that were not delivered. The books were to be procured for the county assembly resource centre in the 2016/2017 financial year.

"When you are a good person you follow procedures ... you can't come with arrogance to your employer," she said. In June, fights over the tender for the speakers' residence and claims of corruption fuelled the row between Elachi and Clerk Jacob Ngwele. The differences between the two escalated into a near fistfight, prompting the orderlies to separate them. Elachi and Ngwele were led away from the glare of journalists after they confronted each.
