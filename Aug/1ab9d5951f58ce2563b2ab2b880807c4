Irrigation farmers face huge losses after the River Tana changed course three weeks ago following the April floods. The farmers said the generators powering pumps were submerged and pipes in the irrigation systen are now hanging. The worst-affected farms are in Nasra, Tawakal and Rahma, where commercial crops include mangoes, vegetables, bananas and water melons. They are withering due to lack of sufficient water. The majority of the farmers are victims of past droughts and thought irrigation farming would ensure them a steady livelihood. Jamal Duale, chairman of Tawakal farm, urged the county to build dykes to redirect the water to its original course. Over the years, the river has changed course, leaving farmers desperate.
