Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tong’i has got a relief after his rival Zaheer Jhanda said he will not file a petition at the Supreme Court challenging his election. Jhanda, who lost in the Court of Appeal last week, said he respects the court’s decision and will wait to run in 2022. Tong’i was in court after former MP Chris Bichage challenged his win up to the Supreme Court. “We tried our best, but I cannot spend my life in court. Let Tong’i serve the people of Nyaribari Chache for now,” Jhanda said. In the August 8 election, Tong’i garnered 14,410 votes while Jhanda had 11,710 votes. Bichage was third with 10,445 votes.
