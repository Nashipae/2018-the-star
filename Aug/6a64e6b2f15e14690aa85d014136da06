Nairobi governor Mike Sonko has said he will not relent in demolishing structures built on road reserves and riparian land.  “It does not matter how well connected you are, if you have built on road reserve or waterways, that structure has to go down,” he said.  The governor said the law should not be applied electively on a few individuals but on everyone who has property on public utility. Sonko said he was aware his actions will make him an enemy of wealthy residents and politicians, but he is ready to deal with them  “I have been entrusted with the lives of over six million Kenyans.  Let them (tycoons) hate me and say that I will be a one-term  governor. I will not allow impunity to thrive under my watch,” the city governor said.
