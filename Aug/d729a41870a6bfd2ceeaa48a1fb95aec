A warrant of arrest has been issued against former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo for failing to clear a balance of Sh25million he owes to businessman Brian Yongo. The warrant was issued on Tuesday by a Nairobi court. Milimani commercial courts deputy registrar directed Muthangari OCS to arrest Jirongo 'with all convenient speed' unless he pays the balance as noted. The warrant reveals that the former legislator has paid only Sh 5 million leaving a balance of Sh20 million. Jirongo will also be required to cater the expenses and fess of the officers executing the warrant. The registrar noted that the officer who executes the warrant is entitled to fare or fuel in case they use a car. "You are further commanded to return the warrant as soon as it is executed or the money noted in the margin is tendered to you." "...with an endorsement certifying the day on which and manner in which it has been executed or the reason why it has not been executed," the warrant reads in part. In March last year, Yongo told the court that the money was to be settled in three instalments, the first one of Sh5 million paid on October 15. A similar instalment was to be repaid at the end of the same month while the final instalment of Sh15 million, was to be paid within 60 days. The businessman claimed he loaned Jirongo the cash between 2014-15, which was to be repaid a few months later. He argued that Jirongo failed to settle the debt prompting him (Yongo) to move court to recover the money. They later agreed to settle the case out of court but the former MP is yet to pay.
