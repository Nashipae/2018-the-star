The parents of a four-year-old girl in Ikutha village, Kitui county,are appealing for help to raise Sh1.5 million tocorrect her heart defect. Stacy Nzambi was born with the defect and she has been taken to several hospitals without getting better, the father, Sammy Makau, said. The 47-year-old father of two said his daughter suffers abnormal heartbeats and fever, causing them sleepless nights. At nearby Muthale Mission Hospital, the doctors referred Stacy to an imaging centre in Kitui. After a CT-scan in Kitui, doctors said the girl has a defect resulting from partial failure of one valve. This means sometimes the heart is unable to properly supply blood to most parts of the body. “This causes fatigue and severe pain. We sincerely need help,” Makau said. After further tests at Mater Hospital in Nairobi, the doctors said the heart defect could be corrected only through Sh1.5 million surgery. Irene Kanini, the mother, said her family has suffered a lot due to Stacy’s illness. Stacy appears to be getting worse as she now suffers recurrent nose bleeding and vomits blood. The parents fear she will die if surgery is not performed quickly. Well-wishers can reach Stacy’s mother Irene Kanini through telephone number 0724540013.
