Kenya’s female boxer Judy Waguthii is promising to inflict pain on her next two opponents when they go toe-to-toe in next few weeks. The World Boxing Council (WBC) silver super-lightweight  champion will prepare for her initial title defence with an 8 round non-title fight with Malawian Anisha Basheel, who incidentally is the current Commonwealth champion. The fight will be staged on September 8 in Nairobi. Waguthii, who recently won the StarTimes/SJAK Sports Personality of the Month of May, will fight for her first defence in Germany on November 24 with Prisca Vicot. The lady pugilist has been shaping up with Kenya Defence Forces team at the Nairobi Trade Fair and the Alpha Fit Gym on Ngong Road. “It’s a girlhood dream coming true and I’m psyching up for it,” said Waguthii, adding: “I’m glad I have one more fight to prepare at home before going into my defence. I honestly have no excuse after receiving the StarTimes award which will go along way in boosting my training. Fighting a build up before the home crowd will be a big inspiration.” The venue for the Nairobi non-title fight has not been named yet, although match promoters are working on modalities and the fight card for the showdown.The 33-year-old’s last fight was the WBC Silver title fight which she won to improve her ranking for the world title contention. Waguthii is now gunning to make it two in a row if her heavy training is anything to go by. She said: “I honestly believe that on my day, I will give it my all. My opponent is tough but I’m confident in my ability. She will probably meet her waterloo in this one.” Waguthii dominated the 10 rounder amid super weaving, bobbing and ducking hence racking up a unanimous score of 100 against Vicot’s 92.
