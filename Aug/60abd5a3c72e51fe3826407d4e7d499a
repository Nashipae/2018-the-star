The family of former Vice President Michael Wamalwa Kijana has not agreed whether or not his graveside will be a national monument. Wamalwa, a brother of Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa, died on August 23, 2003, at Royal Free Hospital in London. A committee is preparing for his 15th anniversary celebrations that will be held in Kitale tomorrow. In January during burial plans for the ex-VP's widow, Yvonne, the government promised to make Wamalwa's graveside a national monument. The committee planning the anniversary told journalists on Wednesday they have not concluded talks about releasing part of the land for the monument. "We are still considering various options. Wamalwa's family still lives on the land. If the government takes up part of it, the family will need to be resettled somewhere else. That may not work for now,‚Äù chairman of the committee Ronald Jumbe said. He said preparations for the anniversary are in top gear and 5,000 guests are expected. Bishop Maurice Crowley of the Catholic Diocese of Kitale will conduct Mass. Wamalwa was Kenya's eight Vice President.
