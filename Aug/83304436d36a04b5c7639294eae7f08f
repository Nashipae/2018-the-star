A borrower is seeking Sh34 million compensation from Ecobank for the sale of a property used to secure a loan which financed an irrigation project in Turkana County in 2015. The High Court, Commercial Division has been told the property was sold at a throwaway price without proper valuation. The contractor is also asking the court to compel the financial institution to pay it Sh20 million in damages for illegal auction of the property and for selling it far less than its market value. Mary Chege alongside her company Nakuru Machinery Services Limited through lawyer Titus Koceyo is asking the court to declare as null and void the sale of her property. The bank has been ordered by the High Court to file evidence in 15 days, failure to which a judgement shall be entered. “The auction was conducted in a private event in flagrant violation of banking rules,” Koceyo states. Koceyo is urging the court to cancel the sale as the amounts demanded as owing “were not actually due but arose from the charging of uncontractual interests and illegal charges and fees on the plaintiffs (Chege and her company) account.” The plaintiffs had been advanced a loan of Sh15 million by Ecobank Kenya Limited to finance the construction of a dam to supply water for Navemit Irrigation Scheme Phase I in Turkana County in 2015. Koceyo says the amount overcharged to the plaintiffs account is Sh5,327,557. The loan was to be repaid at a KBRR of 21 per cent.
