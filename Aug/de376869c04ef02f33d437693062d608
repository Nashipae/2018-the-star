Business was on Monday disrupted in Matuu town, Machakos, as residents protested against a rogue OCS. Inspector James Nyakanji was recalled to Machakos county headquarters yesterday. Yatta deputy county commissioner Edwin Chavari said the OCS was moved ahead of re-deployment to another station. More than 2,000 residents blocked the busy Nairobi-Garissa highway for close to three hours. They marched to Matuu police station to eject Nyakanji from office. The demonstrators comprised traders, residents and some politicians demanded that the OCS be removed from Matuu station. They were led by MCAs Judas Ndawa (Matuu), Joshua Mule (Ndalani), Nicholas Muia (Katangi) and Carol Musembi (nominated). The residents covered four kilometers to the station carrying twigs and placards. They said Nyakanji should not hold public office. But he denied the allegations, terming them malicious.He said he is a God-fearing man and cannot engage in illegal and immoral acts. Nyakanji threatened to sue those behind the demonstrations to tarnish his name. “All these are lies. I’m a Christian,” he said.
