A Bomet bridge constructed for Sh8.4 million, and which has been the cause of a heated debate among residents over its standards, will now be demolished. County Roads executive Philip Sawek yesterday said the contractor did a shoddy job. "We are yet to pay the contractor as has been claimed or reported. We are not paying them because they never did what was expected of them," Sawek said. The decision to demolish the Chepkositonik bridge in Bomet East, he said, was as a result of tests conducted which indicated the contractor used substandard materials. The bridge is four metres wide instead of the recommended nine metres. Sawek said he has written to Tripple Tie Construction Company to demolish the bridge. Click here for the latest political news
