Mount Kenya University Law School has received accreditation and admit 200 students per intake. Council of Legal Education CEO JK Gakeri said small numbers will ensure quality is maintained. The university’s law school has been operating under an interim licence. Among conditions for full accreditation, the university is required to maintain a full-time academic staff to student ratio of 1:15 within its first year. The university will furnish the council with a full list of students admitted and their qualifications. The council of legal education is charged with ensuring standards in legal training. It inspected the university in May this year. The council has also required the university to invest in institutional research and publication at its school of law. MKU held a luncheon over the weekend to celebrate the accreditation. Senior lawyers PLO Lumumba and Fred Ngatia urged law students to be flexible in the modern legal practice, which they termed “dynamic.” Lumumba called on students to study East African law and issues such as a common currency. “We need to look at these new fields and diversify law as it is no longer what is used to be when you were a jack of all trades and a master of none,” he said. MKU founder and chairman Simon Gicharu said the university was committed to producing quality graduates. The luncheon was attended by Rwanda’s Ambassador to Kenya, James Kimonyo. He said 100 Rwandese students are studying at MKU’s Thika main campus. Vice chancellor Professor Stanley Waudo and constitutional activist Yash Pal Ghai attended. Mount Kenya University joins Riara University, Nazarene University and the University of Nairobi as accredited law institutions. Other accredited institutions are Egerton University, Strathmore University, Kenyatta University, Jomo Kenyatta School of Law and Catholic University of Eastern Africa School of Law.
