Music streaming service Songa by Safaricom has changed the industry. The app, which was recently relaunched, offers music enthusiasts more than two millions songs for Sh5 per day. This advantage trickles down to the artistes as well. Rosa recently released her new single, Ride, exclusively on the app. “Rosa engaged with the Songa team to implement app and social media promotion of the track. Also having the song on the app means that there is already a potential reach of millions of users all around the country through the app,” Songa Music’s general manager Chinasa Udeala told Word Is. “Unlike before, Rosa would have had to engage in a PR campaign that will include trips all over the country and radio stations, expensive CD copy prints, including flyers.” But that is now old school. Things have changed. “Unlike 20 years ago, armed with a good music video, internet bundles and some simple online marketing strategy an artist in Kenya can reach the African continent and, indeed, the world with his or her music.” To get Rosa’s single Ride download the Songa by Safaricom app by dialing *812# on your Safaricom line or download it from Google play store.
