Anne Ngugi made a comeback in the media industry last month after landing herself a job at the British Broadcasting Corporation. The former K24 Swahili news anchor spoke to Word Is of her experience at her new workplace. "It is humbling to be at BBC. It is a humongous place, so the audience is not limited. Your target audience is quite big and as a journalist, you tend to think bigger, not just locally. Your level of integration and networking becomes different. You appreciate other people's way of life and make new friends," she said. Adding, "A newsroom will always be the same. What changes is the magnitude of people doing the work." Early on, Anne was a TV news anchor but is now doing radio. How is the experience? "Now I'm on radio but still doing special features for TV. I tend to look at life as a journey and wherever life puts me, I receive it with everything that I have. "Of course there is a difference but I am totally okay with that. Plus I make friends with everyone and in every place I go, even in supermarkets. So I am so fine."
