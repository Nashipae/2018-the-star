A city magistrate on Monday sounded an alarm over the increase of insecurity incidents in Nairobi CBD after the transfer of Central OCS Alphonse Ngundo. Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi of the Milimani law court cited this in court proceedings on Monday. He whether police transfers has something to do with the increased number of suspects charged before the court on a matter related to the CBD. "This has not been the case for the last four years," he said. Ngundo was transferred to Ongata Rongai, Kajiado on July 30 as the staff officer in charge of personnel. He was replaced by Simon Kerich who was the officer in charge of crime at the Kamukunji police station. He left the station on Monday last week. And Andayi noted the increase in crime, including burglary, where at least five people were charged in a day with stealing within the CBD. This followed a case of a man who allegedly broke into an Mpesa shop near Kenya Broadcasting Corporation's offices and stole Sh400,000. There was also another suspect who pleaded guilty to breaking into a business premise on Tom Mboya Street, stealing Sh302,000 and mobile phones from several shops.
