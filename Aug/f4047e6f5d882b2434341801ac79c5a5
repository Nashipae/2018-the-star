A family in Ikinu village, Githunguri, is in agony after the body of their relative went missing from Kiambu Level 5 Hospital mortuary. Njeri Mburu, the widow of Stephen Mburu, 62, said on Tuesday, she and her family friends went to the mortuary and demanded the body but the one produced was not of Mburu. “On July 27, I brought my husband to Kiambu Level 5 Hospital who was suffering from anemia and low blood sugar and was admitted, but unfortunately he did not make it and passed on at the hospital where his body was marked on the forehead and also a tag was put on his leg.” “On Monday, I came and cleared an amount close to Sh7,000 so that I could pick the body for burial on Tuesday but I was not allowed to view the body of my husband and was told I will do so when picking the body.” John Mwaura, the MC who was to conduct the burial ceremony of Mburu, said everything was set at home: booking of the church and burial ground. Family and friends had gathered to bury their relative. “It is disheartening that we had prepared everything for the burial of my childhood friend whom I have been with for over 60 years. Now we have come to pick his body but he is not to be seen and no one is telling us what could have happened to his body,” he said. The mortuary attendants had reportedly released six male bodies for burial on Tuesday but one body had gone missing. The hospital administration tried to recall the bodies which had been released with three bodies being returned from different parts of the county for confirmation. Pastor Kungu Kiberenge, who had concluded the mass to bury one of the bodies which had been released on Tuesday morning by Kiambu hospital mortuary, said he received a phone call that he should stop the mass and the body be returned and he complied. Medical superintendent Jesse Ngugi said he had no comment. By the time of going to press, the body of Mburu had not yet been relocated with other bodies which had been released being waited for.
