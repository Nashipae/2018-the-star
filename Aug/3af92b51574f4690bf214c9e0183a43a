Anti-corruption officers are hunting for five Migori county government officers who escaped arrest as their six colleagues appeared in court on Thursday. The 11 are members of the Migori Tender Committee who are facing charges of flouting procurement laws. It is said they did not follow section 27 (3) of the Public Procurement and Disposal Act of 200 and Regulation 10 (2) of the Public Procurement and Disposal Regulations of 2022. The six were arrested by Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission detectives on Wednesday evening. They were apprehended over the award of a tender for buying furniture for Governor Okoth Obado's residence to Arryan Limited. They are Francisca Onyango, Lazarus Ogutu, Charles Wambora, Tom Kwasi, Collins Bala and James Amenya. The officers did not take plea before justice Richard Odenyo , the prosecution noting that the others had not been found. Odenyo freed the suspects on Sh30,000 bond each and said they will take plea on August 27. Those at large are Elekia Odari, Dan Odhiambo, Jackline Magero, Martin Wandabwa and Joshua Opondo. Two months ago, the EACC officers raided the homes of business people who had worked with the county.
