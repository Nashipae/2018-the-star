Deputy President William Ruto has asked his critics to stop bugging him on whether he owns a chopper or not, saying the one he uses belongs to Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria. There has been speculation on social media that the deputy president had purchased a Sh1 billion military-like chopper that arrived in Kenya in early June 2018. But the claim was dismissed in a video that went viral on Saturday. In the clip, whose filming location is yet to be established, the DP, while accompanied by Kuria, tells the attendees that those who have been asking about the chopper now have answers. This was after Kuria, who spoke before the DP, had confessed and said that "as a Christian, he wanted to make things clear that he owns the chopper in question." "The Principal here insinuated that the chopper belonging to the DP landed here. Let me make you understand that it belongs to me," the Gatundu South MP said. Following Kuria's assertions, the DP asked his critics not to ask any further questions on the issue as the owner of the chopper has settled every worry they have. He thanked Kuria for coming out on the matter and for always letting him borrow the plane which he uses to traverse the country. "My brother Kuria has just clarified that I borrow the chopper that I use from time to time. People have been on my case over the issue. The owner has been identified." "Those who had questions have the answers. I thank Moses Kuria for being a gentleman and speaking the truth. Whatever he has said, let it be that way," Ruto added.
