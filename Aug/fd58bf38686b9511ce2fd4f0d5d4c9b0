Yesterday President Uhuru Kenyatta met President Donald Trump at the White House. This singular honour shows how far Kenya has travelled since 2013 when it was almost ostracised by the international community and a senior US official declared "choices have consequences". Uhuru deserves congratulations for that successful journey but Kenyans themselves also deserve praise for coming together and stabilising Kenya's position as the regional power house. President Moi visited President Carter at the White House in 1980 and President Kibaki saw President George W. Bush there in 2003. This is the second time that Trump has met an African leader. In April he allegedly described President Buhari of Nigeria as "lifeless". By contrast, Uhuru is full of life and hopefully will charm the American leader and convince him that Africa is not a "shithole". America still leads the world, despite the increasing rivalry with China, and Kenya dominates Eastern Africa. The two leaders should not allow the petty issues that divide us, like mitumba, to get in the way of consolidating this longstanding and important alliance.

The people will always have the last word.  Ai Weiwei The Chinese sculptor was born on August 28, 1957.
