The office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has ordered the arrest of a Makueni man captured on camera assaulting his wife. Through the DPP’s official Twitter account on Tuesday evening, the police have also been ordered that Julius Nzomo be arraigned in court. The incident occurred on Monday in Kya-aka village. The man who was armed with a panga fled on Tuesday evening after throwing stones at neighbours and threatening to “kill” anyone who tried to follow him. “We almost arrested the suspect but we gave up the chase when he started throwing stones at us,” neighbour Peter Muendo said. Nzomo’s father yesterday said he last saw his son on Monday. He said his son is sometimes violent. “I have never seen him assault his wife but there was a day he threatened all of us,” he said. A neighbour said Nzomo was a violent man.
