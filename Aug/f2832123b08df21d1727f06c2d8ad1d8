Two police officers were among six people arrested on Wednesday for stealing a water bowser belonging to the Narok county government. Narok county commissioner George Natembeya said the cops were arrested after other suspects were found with the vehicle in a garage in Juja. He said the officers found the vehicle, which was stolen in Narok town on June 30, being dismantled at the said garage. "Police took time in getting the evidence and acted swiftly to recover the vehicle," Natembeya told reporters on Wednesday. He did not reveal the names of the susp At least 16 mobile phones, several SIM cards, car number plates, fake money bills, identity cards, torches, and other goods were recovered from one of the suspects who is a GSU officer stationed at the Ruaraka headquarters. "The officer is currently on interdiction after he engaged in robbery cases which are before a court in Coast region. I believe this is the part of gang behind the car theft syndicate," Natembeya. He said the stolen vehicle was overhauled and its number plates changed to erase suspicion. "As we are speaking, negotiations to sell the water bowser were at advance stage. We acted fast before they completed their deal," he said. He said that the suspects will be arraigned on Thursday. Three county government workers, including the vehicle's driver and turn boy, had been arrested and took a plea before a Narok court. Click here for the latest political news
