Suspected fraudster James Muiruri was yesterday charged at the Milimani Law courts with conspiracy to defraud a businesswoman out of Sh1.08 million. Muiruri was accused of obtaining the cash from Millicent Owuor by issuing her forged allotment letters for three plots. He is said to have obtained the cash on February 1, falsely presenting the letters as genuine from Nairobi Lands chief officer Stephen Mwangi. Muiruri allegedly conspired with others still at large. He denied all the charges before senior principal magistrate Martha Mutuku. He was detained at the Central Police Station until Tuesday. Click here for the latest political news
