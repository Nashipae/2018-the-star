The Ugandan regime finally produced Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, also known as Bobi Wine, after a week in military detention but re-arrested him again over trumped-up charges. His arrest and that of his colleagues from Arua is a gross violation of all international conventions and Ugandan law. The attempted court martial of a civilian demonstrates President Yoweri Museveni’s desperate attempts to suppress opposition to his despotic rule. It is a mockery of the very democratic ideals that he loves to lecture the world about. Bobi’s incarceration has elicited wide international condemnation for brutal torture and disregard of basic human rights tenets. From the streets of Nairobi to London and Jo’burg where demonstrations have been held in solidarity, the world now knows the skeletons inside Museveni’s closet. President Museveni, who fancies himself as an African philosopher, has ruled Uganda with an iron fist since he shot his way into power over 30 years ago. He continues to use state instruments to annihilate the opposition and terrify the electorate. Although his despotic mix of civilian and military rule is pervasive and entrenched, the international community continues to look away because of economic and strategic interests. Bobi’s torture should open the world’s eyes to Museveni’s inhumane machine that maims, jails and kills political opponents in the guise of law and order. It is endangering the long-term prosperity and security of Ugandans and the region and must be held to account by international institutions of justice.
