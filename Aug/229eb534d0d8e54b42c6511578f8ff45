Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui has congratulated President Kenyatta for signing an investment contract to set up a pyrethrum processing plant in Nakuru. The governor said the contract with US biotechnology firm Kentegra will develop the pyrethrum market. “We wish to congratulate President Uhuru Kenyatta for his historic visit to Washington DC. The revival of pyrethrum is critical to the restoration of economic livelihoods to thousands of families who live in the agriculturally rich parts of Nakuru,” Kinyanjui said on Tuesday in a statement. Pyrethrum farmers have suffered poor returns for many years and many of them uproot the crop. In a bid to revive the sector, Parliament enacted a bill that liberalised the sector, which was previously controlled by the Pyrethrum Board of Kenya, now known as the Pyrethrum and Other Industrial Crops Directorate. Kinyanjui said his government will work with the private sector to enhance value addition and explore new markets. He said the entry of US biotechnology firm Kentegra will open up the North and South American markets. “It is our prayer that in the next few years, Kenya will regain her global position as a market leader in pyrethrum. The enthusiasm demonstrated by our farmers has given us motivation to invest further and reclaim our position,” he said.
