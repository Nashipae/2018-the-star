Sirisia MP John Waluke spent Thursday night at the Industrial Area remand prison after he failed to comply with the bond terms set by the court. Waluke denied several counts of fraud in relation to a contract his company Erad Supplies and General Contracts Ltd won to supply 40,000 tonnes of maize in 2004. Chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti ordered him to sign a personal bond of Sh5 million and a surety bond of Sh3 million plus a Sh2 million cash bail.

Sources say he managed to bring a car that would be deposited as surety, but it took a while to verify the car since the investigating officer was supposed to verify all the documents before he cleared the surety. Waluke is a co-director of the company alongside Grace Wakhungu and the late Jacob Juma. However,Wakhungu did not appear in court as expected and the court issued a warrant of arrest against her. Waluke was accused of uttering a false document. It is alleged on February 24, 2009, being the director of Erad, he knowingly and fraudulently uttered a false invoice for $1,146,000 (Sh114 million) to be used as evidence in the arbitration dispute between his company and the National Cereals and Produce Board.
