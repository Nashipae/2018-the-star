The Luhya community is not ready to produce a president in 2022, Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka has said. Speaking on Friday on Sulwe FM, he urged Luhya politicians to stop deceiving themselves that they are ripe for the presidency. The former Bungoma governor said Luhya leaders lack logistical preparedness to run for the country’s top seat in 2022. He said the community was still divided and therefore unable to consolidate its votes behind one of its own. Lusaka said other communities had united behind their leaders and spoke with one voice, a factor that is crucial for any meaningful presidential run. “Luhyas leaders are still divided. They are not speaking in one voice, which is our main undoing. We must unite and negotiate for a stake in the government, otherwise backstabbing will only mess us up,” he said. Lusaka said political antagonism among Luhya politicians has exposed the community to exploitation by other regions. “Divisions among Luhya leaders will always cost us. If one of us gets it, we should celebrate instead of calling each other names. That is how you strengthen each other politically,” he said. Lusaka cited ODM leader Raila Odinga, whom he said has a huge political advantage because he commands the entire Nyanza. “Even if he asked Luos to jump into Lake Victoria today, the people will obey and do it. Luhya lack that one person who can unite them,” Lusaka said. Luhya leaders who have declared interest in running for president in 2022 include ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetang’ula and Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya.
