Public health officials have been deployed at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology to ensure safety of food sold to participants in the Kenya National Music Festival. About 120,000 children are taking part. The officials have been working with the hotels that have pitched tent at the university to prepare and sell food to participants. Nyeri governor Mutahi Kahiga said the county personnel will be available to ensure participants are in good health. “To ensure the safety of the food, we have engaged public health officers to work with the hotels that are running here,” he said, The county also dispatched nurses, fuelled and equipped ambulances and hospitals established to cater for any emergencies. “Our hospitals will be on high alert. But even within that facility, we have set up five healthcare centres so that all goes well,” Kahiga said. Kenya Music Festival chairman Peter Wanjohi said hotels were established on university grounds to make it easier to feed children. “If we decided to take the 120,000 children to town to feed them, it would be a nightmare,” he said. Wanjohi was speaking at the institution yesterday. The event started on August 6 and will end on Saturday. The winning teams are to perform at Sagana State Lodge. Last week Wanjohi said the event would feature 600 genres of music, dance and elocution. This is the first time the national level of the festival is being held in Central region. This year participants include learners from Uganda and South Sudan, Wanjohi said. The learners are being accommodated in 39 institutions within a 20km radius from the venue. Wanjohi said more than 600 support staff are coordinating the logistics and ensuring the event runs smoothly. The theme of the festival is ‘Enhancing National Unity, Cohesion and Integration’. Wanjohi said the festival will help inculcate these values in the children. The organisers have partnered with several stakeholders to ensure the success of the event.
