Detectives in Mombasa have arrested three people in efforts to break a cartel of car thieves with roots at the coastal town and in Nairobi. Teresia Wambui, Daniel Kariuki, and Lass Wanjiru were arrested and taken to the Central police station on Saturday. This was after they were reportedly caught stealing a car on Moi Avenue, Mombasa. They were busted by members of the public who called the police. The three were cornered after they rammed a tuk-tuk in an attempt to escape with the stolen Toyota Fielder. "We suspect these three persons have been robbing our people of their hard earned sweat," Mombasa police commander Johnstone Ipara said. He paraded the suspects and warned their accomplices that their days were numbered. Ipara said the lot will be paraded at the police station the whole weekend for identification and will be taken to court on Monday to face various charges. The three were booked for robbery, causing an accident, failing to stop after causing an accident, and driving on the wrong side of the road. "There is somebody in this town who hosts the thieves. We believe he is the head of the cartel. We will bust them," Ipara said. In April, police arrested a gang of four men who attempted to steal a car at the Makadara grounds in Mombasa CBD.
