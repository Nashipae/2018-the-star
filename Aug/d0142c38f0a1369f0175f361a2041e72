The government will spend a whooping Sh1.4 billion to compensate 4,000 Kwale residents to be affected by the construction of Mwache dam. Water and Sanitation CAS Winnie Guchu said the process is ongoing and that the construction of Sh14.8 billion dam will begin next year. "Compensation takes a large per cent of the project," she said at English Point Marina, Mombasa on Friday. This was during the ministry's consultation meeting with the National Assembly department committee on environment and natural resources. Guchu said the evaluation and design for the dam, located across the Mwache River at the Fulugani village, has been done. The Coast Water Supply Master Plan has identified the dam as the preferential, viable, and necessary long-term option for water supply to Mombasa and Kwale. The project consists of dam construction and catchment management component. If realised, the dam will provide 196,000 litres of water daily. Catchment management activities will on the other hand increase the forest cover Kinango constituency. Guchu said they are in touch with Water Resources Management to check water pollution. "Industries built on riparian land have installed underground pipes that discharge effluent into the river," she said. Guchu said Kenya Water Institute laboratories will test the quality of water before release adding that bamboo trees will be planted at the cleared riparian land. The government has for the past two weeks demolished structures on riparian land in efforts to conserve the environment. Julius Wanjau, head of the multi-agency team in Nairobi regeneration, said at least half of the buildings built on riparian land have been brought down. Click here for the latest political news
