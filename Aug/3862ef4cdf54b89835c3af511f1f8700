Homa Bay governor Cyprian Awiti on Tuesday dished out Sh25,000 to calm youths who stormed his office. He has been away for about two months for eye surgery. Upon return, more than 100 youths held him hostage. They pushed their way as aides called in riot police. The youths, said to be his supporters, stayed put and expressed their anger at the presence of the officers. They warned that they would need another candidate to fly the ODM flag should there be a by-election. Awiti has lost two election petitions to his rival Oyugi Magwanga. His last hopes lie with the apex court. The youth said the county boss has failed. “We don’t have a governor. Let ODM give us another candidate in case of a by-election,” one youth shouted at the main entrance. Efforts by Awiti’s aides to sneak him out through the back gate were unsuccessful. The irate youths blocked all the entry and exit points. They demanded Sh50,000, but Awiti could only offer half. Awiti said he does not fear another poll. “Some individuals spread propaganda that Awiti fears going back to election. I never went to the courts in the first place. My opponent did. I was told there are avenues to justice, so I must use it,” he said.
