Reclamation of the Mau complex will form a critical part of Jubilee’s legacy, Kajiado governor Joseph Lenku has said. Lenku in a signed statement on Tuesday asked Kenyans to support President Uhuru Kenyatta to fully restore the water tower. “The Mau settlement was an act of greed and impunity by some people. We don’t see this kind of forest destruction in other forested areas in the country. There should be nothing special about Mau,” he said. The Governor said President Uhuru will safeguard Jubilee’s resolve to conclusively settle the matter, unlike the former regimes that made the attempt but failed. “Jubilee government must not join the list of regimes that were blackmailed and failed to solve the environmental degradation that is affecting the region,” said Lenku.

The Governor lauded the head of the Anglican Church Jackson Ole Sapit for asking Rift Valley politicians to support the conservation of the Mau. Click here for the latest political news
