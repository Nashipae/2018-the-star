The Kitui Deputy Governor's official car, which was reported lost on August 9, has been found outside a pub in Kiembeni, Mombasa. Police who traced the car to the location arrested driver Anthony Kang’oti who was found drunk. On the day the car was reported missing, Kang’oti reportedly dropped DG Wathe Nzau at the memorial service of the 10 St Gabriel pupils who died in an accident. The mass took place at St Joseph Seminary in Kitui county. Kitui county police commandant Anthony Kamitu said the DG filed a report at Mwingi police station after his car went missing and the driver switched off his phone. "We tracked the driver's phone to Kiembeni and recovered the vehicle, a Toyota Land Cruiser Prado TX registration number KBW 893V, parked outside the bar," he told journalists at his office. "Kang'oti was arrested and locked up at Kiembeni police station to wait for escort to Mwingi police station, where he will be charged with misuse of a government vehicle." Kisauni OCPD Sangura Musee said members of the public told them the car remained parked outside the bar for three days. Click here for the latest political news
