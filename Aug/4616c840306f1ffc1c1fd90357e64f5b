A Senate watchdog committee yesterday turned away Nairobi governor Mike Sonko’s representative and demanded the county chief appears before it in person. Sonko sent acting Finance CEC Charles Kerich to relay his apology and ask for a new date. His letter said he was unwell. Yesterday was the second time Sonko failed to appear before the County Public Accounts and Investment Committee chaired by Homa Bay senator Moses Kajwang’. The governor was supposed to appear before the committee on July 4 to respond to queries raised by Auditor General Edward Ouko on the county’s expenditure in 2014-15. He asked for a postponement, saying he was unprepared.

The committee resolves the governor be compelled to appear before the committee vide summons on a date to be decided by the secretariat,” Kajwang’ ruled. Article 125 of the Constitution gives Parliament and its committees the same powers as the High Court to enforce attendance of witnesses, which includes issuing arrest warrants. Kirinyaga senator Charles Kibiru called for summons to be issued against Sonko. “Let us do what we always do to other governors not honouring committee invitations,” he said. Narok senator Ledama Olekina said, “We see the governor driving luxurious vehicle and here he is saying he is unwell. It is in contempt of the proceedings.” Kisii’s Sam Ongeri said Sonko’s letter is inadmissible in the absence of a confirmation from a physician. “Some of us have to drive from very far away. It is quite painful that after driving all the way from Kisii you are met with this letter in the morning,” he said. Click here for
