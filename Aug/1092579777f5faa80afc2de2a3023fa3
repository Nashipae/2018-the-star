Media personality and comedian Dr Ofweneke and gospel singer Nicah were once husband and wife, but the marriage did not work out.  The comedian accused his baby mama of infidelity, while Nicah accused him of being a wife beater.  Well, Nicah recently posted a picture from her Facebook memories and made a joke out of it, saying how the two were deeply in love at the time the picture was taken.  Followers questioned her if there were chances of the two getting back together, to which she replied: “No, I will never go back to Egypt.” The Naringa singer later deleted the post, which had already attracted hilarious comments.  Speaking to Word Is, Ofweneke was asked to comment about that but claimed to have not seen the post.  “Nicah and I talk, but we basically talk about our children and nothing more. We are in good terms because of the children but whatever she is doing with her life, that I respect even if I don’t know what she does.”  Asked if he would go back to his ex wife, Ofweneke said everybody has moved on with their lives. He said he enjoyed the marriage in the time it lasted but will one day marry again.  “I don’t regret my past because there is a beautiful baby involved. It was good when it lasted and I enjoyed my marriage, but I will marry again when the right time comes.”
