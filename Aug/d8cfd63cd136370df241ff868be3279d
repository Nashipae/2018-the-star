A family in Malindi is living in fear over claims that a senior KDF officer has been threatening them yet his marriage to their daughter failed. They alleged the soldier based at Eldoret Barracks, who divorced his wife six years ago, threatened to kill them. The family claims the soldier sent 14 police officers to arrest his estranged in unclear circumstances at their home. Family spokesperson Fatuma Abdala Said told journalists they are now living in fear. Speaking in Malindi on Saturday, she said their daughter had a child with the KDF officer. She said they went separate ways and wondered why he is baying for their blood. Malindi police boss Matawa Muchangi confirmed the arrest. However, he said the woman was arrested for using abusive language on them. Muchangi told the family to record a statement if they had received threats. Fatuma said armed police officers stormed their home and demanded to see their daughter. “At the police station we were treated badly as if we are not human beings, it was as if we are criminals,’’ she said. Fatuma said the KDF officer has been visiting his child at school with "strange people", and they fear he could be having ill motives. She said he has been using his influence and position to intimidate them. Click here for the latest political news
