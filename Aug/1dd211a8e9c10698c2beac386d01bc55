The National Assembly yesterday rejected amendment to the Finance Bill that would have increased tax on intra-bank or cross-bank cash transfers above Sh500,000. The 0.05 per cent excise duty would have applied to individuals transferring money through agencies or other financial service providers. Treasury CS Henry Rotich introduced the excise duty on June 14 during his budget speech, which took effect on July 1. It was part of the proposed revenue enhancements to help the government meet its huge expenditures. The amendments had excluded tax remissions and refunds from KRA, transfers from KRA’s collection accounts to the Central Bank and transfers by or to the national government, county governments and the CBK. High Court judge Wilfrida Okwany suspended implementation of the ‘Robin Hood tax’ after the Kenya Bankers’ Association sought court orders, saying “bank transfer” was vague. The association had raised concerns it would threaten the future of vibrant financial services sectors, investment environment and the capital market. Yesterday, efforts by Kiambu Town MP Jude Njomo to amend another section of the bill and have banks and other financial institutions reserve at least 10 per cent of its loan portfolio for lending to SMEs were thwarted. Minority leader John Mbadi said the move would send a wrong signal to the economy. “We don’t want to send a wrong signal to the economy that we are a country of regulations. I oppose this amendment,” he said. Legislators Millie Odhiambo (Suba North), Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay) and John Walukhe (Sirisia) backed Njomo. They said the change empower the SMEs and precipitate economic growth. “We must also have a human face in this Parliament. It’s in our own interests as legislators to defend our small and medium enterprises and the youths of this country,” Odhiambo said. Njomo withdrew the amendment.
