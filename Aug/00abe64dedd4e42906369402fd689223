A Diamond Trust Bank manager has been charged in Milimani with stealing Sh25 million from customers' fixed deposit accounts. Via Twitter on Sunday, the DCI said Peter Sungu, from Kisii county, was arrested after the theft was discovered through an internal reconciliation process. At Harambee Sacco, Habil Onyango, who is a front office services activities manager and strong room custodian, removed amounts totaling Sh1,783,392 from the vault and used it for personal purposes. "The money was meant for the sacco area delegates and miscellaneous expenditure," the DCI said. Police also reported that Family Bank Relations Officer Abel Onyango, through swapping SIM cards, accessed customers’ accounts and withdrew Sh1.5 million without their knowledge. He was also taken to court. Following these incidents, DCI boss George Kinoti told banks, mobile money service providers and regulators that many cases of fraud are by their employees. He advised them to do thorough background checks before engaging them in any way. On August 17, Kinoti warned the public about criminals using the IEBC register, which is available online, to register SIM cards which are then used to commit crimes. He spoke during a mobile money fraud risk engagement forum by Safaricom and the banking industry. The DCI director noted that the fight against SIM swap fraud was on course.
