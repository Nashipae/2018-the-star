Cases of wrong drug prescription leading to fatalities have increased, the Kenya Pharmaceutical Association has said. The agency blames doctors, nurses and the government for the deaths. Chairman Patrick Adera yesterday said the government is not employing more pharmacists and technologists to curb patient mismanagement. The boss said the country has about 14,000 such technologists and less than 3,000 have been employed. As a result, he said, nurses and doctors in public hospitals have been assigned the role of prescribing medicine. This, Adera adds, has caused prolonged suffering to those misdiagnosed. “The only way to go around this challenge is to have the real practitioners play their roles,” Adera said on the phone. The association has warned President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda on Universal Health Coverage might be derailed if more professionals are not hired. Even with healthcare being devolved, pharmaceutical technologists have been pushed to the back burner. Adera said direct absorption of pharmacists stopped after devolution. “The recruitment procedures for counties have locked out pharmacists and technologists,” he said.
