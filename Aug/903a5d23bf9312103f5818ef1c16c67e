The Embu assembly’s Infrastructure committee has urged the county to follow Nairobi’s example and demolish buildings on road reserves and riparian land. Committee chairman Muriithi Kiura said some developers have grabbed land on road reserves and riparian land with impunity. He said the buildings have hindered expansion of public utilities and interrupted the flow of water, leading to flooding. Kiura said it is not significant whether developers have ownership documents because the land was illegally acquired. “The ongoing demolitions should be extended to Embu to fight corruption from the national to rgw grassroots level,” he said. He said many buildings on road reserves and water sources have been marked for demolition for years, but no action has been taken. Kiura said the owners should pull them down before the county government does so. He was supported by Runyenjes ward representative Steve Munene and county assembly Budget committee chairman Robert Ireri. Ireri said those who have built on riparian land have worsened the water shortage and put lives at risk due to flooding when it rains. He said those who have built on the riparian land have violated the law and should not be spared. “Their structures should be torn down,” Ireri said. Munene said a lot of riparian, public land and road reserves were grabbed during the local authorities era. “This has made it impossible to expand facilities like markets and stadiums,” he said.
