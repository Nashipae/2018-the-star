One person died yesterday at dawn in a house fire in Bonyamori, North Mugirango constituency. Haron Oange, 85, said to be a relative of Nyamira deputy governor Amos Nyaribo is believed to have died from burns. The fire broke out at 2.30am. The destroyed house neighbours that of the deputy governor. The deputy governor was not home during the incident. The Nyamira county fire engine and residents were unable to contain the fire as it spread fast due to strong winds. Nyamira North police boss Robert Kipsum said the cause of the fire is being investigated. The OCPD said the fire might have started from the kitchen and spread very fast before gutting the house where the old man was sleeping. "We are investigating to establish the real cause of the fire. The public should be made aware that it is the neighbouring home to the deputy governor, not the deputy governorâ€™s residence that got destroyed by fire," Kipsum said. The body has been taken to the Nyamira County Referral Hospital morgue.
