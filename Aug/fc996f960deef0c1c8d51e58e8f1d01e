Kisumu governor Anyang’ Nyong’o yesterday warned residents against building on road reserves. He called for compliance with the law to enable his team to improve services. He said his administration will repossess grabbed public land and demolish illegal structures, including those on riparian land. Nyong’o said houses and stalls on road reserves pose risks to motorists and travellers and must be pulled down to avert tragedies. Illegal construction has also been blamed for ruining drainage. The national government has launched a crackdown to demolish buildings, especially in Nairobi. Nyong’o spoke after launching tarmacking of Carwash-Sije road in Manyatta B, Kisumu Central. The two-kilometre road will cost Sh87 million and will be completed in 10 months. It is part of the Sh4.5 billion urban upgrade programme funded by the French government. Sh537 million projects are underway. The bridge is welcomed by residents who face transport problems during the rainy seasons. The county is upgrading roads, bridges, floodlights, social halls, health facilities and markets. Nyong’o has also launched construction of Sh24 million Kakoth Bridge in Kolwa East, Nyando subcounty. Other ongoing projects include Sh120 million Rweya Centre of Excellence, 4.5km Impala-Dunga road costing Sh301 million and Sh5 million lighting of Chiga market. Nyong’o said efficient transport is crucial for growth and his administration will focus on improving roads so residents and visitors can travel and ferry goods. He was accompanied by city manager Doris Ombara and city management board members. On Wednesday, Nyong’o said the county will complete the upgrade projects before launching others. “We must build for the future and create business opportunities. We’re working on a new geophysical system that will ensure modern planning and zoning of the city,” he said.
