The government has told dairy farmers to produce their own animal feeds to cut down the cost of producing a litre of milk by Sh7. Agriculture chief administrative secretary Andrew Tuimur said the current cost of producing a litre of milk at the farm level is at Sh21. This is double the cost of production for dairy farmers in Uganda which is at Sh10. “We are encouraging dairy farmers in Kenya to conserve fodder and start making their own animal feeds. This will help reduce the cost of production by about Sh14 per one litre of milk,” he said. Tuimur spoke yesterday during the official opening of the 14th African Dairy Conference and Exhibition at KICC. He said according to a study that was recently done in nine counties, making of own feeds can bring down the cost by Sh7. “Our target is to bring the cost to Sh14 to ensure dairy farmers benefit and if one can sell a litre at Sh35, then they will have made optimum profit,” Tuimur said. Margaret Kibogy, the managing director of Kenya Dairy Board, attributed the high cost of production to expensive animals feeds and labour. She also said that unlike in Uganda where dairy farmers practice open grazing, in Kenya 60 per cent of the milk in Kenya is produced through zero grazing while 15 per cent is through open grazing. “This is because land is small in Kenya so farmers especially in Central Region where there are many dairy farmers opt for zero grazing. This makes dairy farming an expensive venture,” she said. Kibogy said the government has been encouraging farmers to embrace mechanisation and also produce own quality feeds. They are aiming to reduce the cost by Sh14 where a farmer scan comfortable sell a litre if milk at Sh35. Tuimur noted that milk production has grown rapidly over the last half a decade and that the Kenyan dairy sector is growing the fastest in the region in production, processing and marketing. More than 10 milk processors plants ahve been commissioned across the country in three years, he said.
