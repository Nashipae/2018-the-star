The Busia county government has bought drugs worth Sh90 million from the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority to address shortage. Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi on Tuesday said medicine will be available in county hospitals. Mulomi made an impromptu visit to Busia County Referral Hospital where he talked to patients and staff. He urged the administrators to take care of hospital property when he spotted abandoned beds in the compound. “We cannot dispose of working beds when other hospitals are lacking. Those beds have to be kept safely or donated to hospitals,” Mulomi said. Governor Sospeter Ojaamong earlier confirmed there was enough stock, despite public outcry that most public hospitals do not have medicine. Speaking at the Matayos drugs store, he said his government will install ICT centres in health institutions to monitor drug dispensation. “We need to network all centres and ensure the drugs store is used for the intended purpose,” he said.
