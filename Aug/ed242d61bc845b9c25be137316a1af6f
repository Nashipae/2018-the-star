Silver Boy’s journey in the music industry has not been easy. His born-again parents, who are both pastors, thought he had lost it and tried to block from performing in entertainment joint. They wanted him to sing gospel music. But the promising upcoming artist says he is in Bongo to stay. Silver Boy, real name James Bundi, was discovered by Watanashati Classic when manager Keyfar Mundia saw his performance. He now has two hit songs under his belt, Maromba and Haitowezekana, and is the talk of town. Silver Boy’s father Justus Mwenzi, is the head pastor of East African Pentecost Church, Igembe South, while his mother is chairperson pf EAPC parish. He is on a mission to change the narrative that Merus can’t sing. The 23-year-old says he is only interested in giving his fans the best music. He burst onto the scene in July and is the talk of radio shows, social gatherings and social media. Silver Boy says he will only continue on to higher education if he majors in music. “Watanashati discovered my potential. They called me and now, they are like my family. They gave me a chance. They have done my branding. I am a beginner in the industry but doing great, I thank my fans for support and appreciation,” he says. His videos were directed by Danny Prince.
