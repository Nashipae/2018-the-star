Moses Nandalwe, better known as Mr Bungoma Moneybags, has launched a free ambulance to help Sirisia patients reach hospitals with ease. Sirisia is one of the poor constituencies in Bungoma with residents unable to afford basic healthcare. Speaking during the launch at Malakisi Muslim High School on Monday, Nandalwe said the ambulance will be fueled weekly to deal with emergency cases. “Majority of the people in this region are very poor. They can’t afford money for treatment in case of an emergency," Nandalwe said. He said the ambulance will save pregnant mothers whose plight have been reported on many occasions.
