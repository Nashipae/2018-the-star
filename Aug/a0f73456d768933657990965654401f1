Migori ODM Senator nominee Ochillo Ayacko has begun campaigns for the October 3 by-election, amid divisions among party leaders. His campaign caravan transversed major towns yesterday after he was given a direct ticket on July 27, a decision that has divided the party. Some party officials have said they will defy a directive by the Orange House to campaign for Ayacko. They said the decision to hand him a direct ticket was against democracy which the party stands for. On Monday, the county ODM organising secretary Joseph Nyambori, Uriri constituency chairman Ooko Atong’a and his secretary general Amos Kepher said they will not campaign for Ayacko. A number of party activists and officials, including Nyanza ODM Coordinating Committee chairman Ochieng Ruku, also said they won’t support Ayacko. “In the last elections, we had party officials who went against ODM nominees in several seats and campaigned for independent candidates as they were not satisfied by party decision, in this spirit we won’t support Ayacko,” Kepher said. Atong’a said they will not accept a decision to curtail democracy.  Governor Okoth Obado has taken a similar stand. Obado who said he would support Dalmas Otieno of National Liberal Party ticket who was locked out of ODM nominations. Atong’a said: "We won’t be intimidated by our party and we want other leaders to respect Obado who is the county ODM patron, our decision is to support Dalmas at the ballot."
