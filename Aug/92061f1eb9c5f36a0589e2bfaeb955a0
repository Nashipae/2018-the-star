The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (Knbs) has launched a pilot registration programme ahead of 2019 population and housing census. The pilot programme will take place for one week in 12 counties across the country between August 24th to 31st. The counties include Nairobi, Kwale, Kilifi, Makueni, Nyeri, Tharakanithi, Mandera, West Pokot, Kericho, Busia, Kisumu and Kisii. Speaking during the launch on Friday, KNBS Director General Zachary Mwangi said the programme will only take place in selected sub-locations in the 12 counties “Census is a complex process and it has three phases. Phase one is the preparatory stage with activities like mapping,” Mwangi said, Phase two is the actual enumeration stage where the actual census is conducted and the third phase is the post-enumeration. KNBS has so far mapped 28 out of the 47 counties and is scheduled to continue after the pilot census is complete next week. Mwangi said for the pilot census, the organisation has 380 enumerators who have been well trained, 72 supervisors and a number of coordinators.

Nairobi County Commissioner Amos Mariba said that security has been prioritized during the pilot programme. He applauded KNBS for choosing Nairobi to host the launch of the pilot census. “We have properly diploid security officers and urged residents to interact with the security officers ahead of the census,” Mariba said. He further gave out a hotline number 22068 for the residents to reach out in case of any security issues. In Kenya census is normally conducted after every 10 years and has been consistently taken place since 1969 in August from the night of 24th.
