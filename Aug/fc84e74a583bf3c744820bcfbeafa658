Inadequate supply of clean water could ruin the government’s Big Four agenda, the Water Companies Sports Organisation (Wasco) has said. Chairman Elijah Omendo on Friday said pursuit of universal healthcare would suffer if efforts are not put in place to increase supply. He said clean water prevents waterborne diseases and reduces the financial burden of treatment. Omendo said farming, manufacturing and housing sectors need sufficient water for production and constructions. He spoke during a media briefing in Nyeri Water and Sewerage Company offices at the ongoing Wasco games in Nyeri town. “If the water sector can be in a position to provide that as a component, then definitely that agenda will also be realised,” Omendo said. Some 15 disciplines are being undertaken in indoor and outdoor games, including ballgames and athletics. Nyewasco MD Peter Gichaaga said the sports event will give participants an opportunity to interact and know more about the company.
