Former world marathon record holder Wilson Kipsang is currently doing at least 40km a day in readiness for the next month’s Berlin Marathon.
The two-time London marathon champion,  said the mileage in training is to ensure he is fit for Berlin race. He said he is currently enjoying top form and can not rule out a course record if not a world record currently held by his training-mate at Volare Sports, Dennis Kimetto.
Kimetto broke Kipsang’s world record of 2:03.23 in 2014 after winning the race in 2:02.57 ahead of his training-mate Emmanuel Mutai.
“I am trying my best to be fit enough to take on the world champions at Berlin. I am currently undergoing intense training to ensure I achieve my target of the best time possible,” said the 2012 Olympic Games marathon silver medallist..
In 2016, Kipsang finished second behind Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele, who was named in the provisional starting list but later pulled out of Berlin.
“I ran a good race in 2013 and I want to emulate that and come home a better man. My target is to come with a world record if possible depending on the weather and my shape on the day,” added Kipsang, who is also the 2014 New York City Marathon champion.
Last year, Kipsang failed to win New York City Marathon, finishing second to three-time World Half Marathon champion Geoffrey Kamworor.\
“I miscalculated my timing in New York and Kamworor was on point, which was good for us as Team Kenya. It was good for Kamworor to win his maiden title on the course,” added former world marathon record holder. Owing to a bad weather in Japan, Kipsang fell to Dickson Chumba, failing to defend his title early this year.
“This year in Tokyo, It was too hot for me and I failed to run the way I had planned. Being the defending champion, you have a lot of burden since everyone is looking upon you but luckily, just like in New York, a Kenyan won the title, which was a great deal,” added Kipsang.
