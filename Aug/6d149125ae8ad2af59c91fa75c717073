Mobile service providers risk stiffer penalties from Communication Authority for poor quality of service. The regulator yesterday extended the quality of service check which previously only covered voice, to data and SMS. Among the things to be tested include network coverage, dropped calls, failed calls, speech quality, internet accessibility, latency in data services among others. The new framework, is made up of three components â€” network performance, customer experience and end-to-end performance to be fully adopted over three years. "Voice is no longer a pre-dominant service, data is. With the new rules, we urge service providers to be more careful with their consumers moving forward because they can easily bring you down," CA licensing, compliance and standards director Christopher Kimei said. The authority has acquired the quality of service measurement tools at a cost of Sh400 million from German firm Rohde& Schwartz. CA director general Francis Wangusi said service providers who have been freezing internet bandwidth for consumers should be more careful. "What we are introducing this morning will monitor how well or poorly you deliver your services, and we will be here to impose heavy penalties on you," Wangusi said. He said failure to meet the minimum threshold of 80 per cent quality of service will attract a penalty of 0.1 per cent of the operators gross revenue. In the financial year 2014/2015 the three telcos, Safaricom, Airtel and Telkom were fined upto Sh190 million for poor services. The penalty moved higher to Sh311 million in the 2016/2017 financial year. Unlike in the previous years where the test was done once annually, they will now be done three times a year. They will be conducted in Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret and Nyeri. CA chairman Ngene Gituku cautioned mobile dealers for overseeing the sale of substandard devices penetrating the market.
