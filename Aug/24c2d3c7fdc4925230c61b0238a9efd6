The National Treasury missed its borrowing target for the weekly sale of Treasury bills by 41.5 per cent. Data by the Central Bank of Kenya shows bids worth Sh14.04 billion were accepted for the three-month, six-month and one-year government debt securities during Thursday’s auction, against a target of Sh24 billion. T-bills are short-term instruments the government uses to raise cash to offset deficit in the budget. Central Bank received bids worth bids worth Sh14.51 billion during this week's auction signaling low investor appetite for the short term government securities. Investors shunned 91-day T-bill which was undersubscribed by 85.76 per cent to rake in Sh569.69 million of the Sh4 billion offered under the debt facility. Bids accepted for the 182 and 364-day T-bills failed to meet the target by 48.5 and 16.8 per cent respectively. This means CBK collected Sh5.15 billion and Sh8.32 billion of the Sh10 billion offered under both facilities. CBK data shows the government securities market maintained a robust performance last month, up until last week. The government’s fiscal agent collected Sh35.1 billion, Sh52.53 billion and Sh49.8 billion during the first three weeks of July. This dropped to ShSh21.2 billion last week. “The government securities market recorded subdued performance during the week ending July 27, 2018 reflecting low liquidity resulting from slow government payments synonymous with the beginning of the financial year,” CBK said in last week’s bulletin.
