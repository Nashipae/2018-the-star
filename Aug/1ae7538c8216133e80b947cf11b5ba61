Gor Mahia local dominance in the 2018 SportPesa Premier League came to a bitter end yesterday following their 2-1 loss to Bandari at Mbaraki Stadium Mombasa. Gor watched their 22-league games unbeaten run come to an end at the hands of the ten-man Bandari who capitalised on the home advantage to move second on the standings. Bandari, under the stewardship of Bernard Mwalala, made good their threat to soil Gor’s good run as first half goals from Dan Guya and Congolese national Yema Mwana rendered Jacques Tuyisenge’s goal null and void. Guya headed home the opener in the tenth minute from a corner delivered by Joshua Oyoo before Mwana doubled the scores for the home side in the 36th minute after a poor aerial clearance by Gor’s back line. After a disastrous first half, K’Ogallo resumed for the final stanza firing from all cylinders but Bandari’s defence proved equal to the challenges posed by their opponents. In the 59th minute, goal scorer Guya was stretchered off with an injury with Abdalah Hamisi replacing him. The long inroads to Bandari’s area finally bore fruits in the 77th minute as Tuyisenge halved the deficit after being teed up by Philemon Otieno. Five minutes later, Fred Nkata received his marching orders and despite being numerically disadvantaged, Bandari held on to scoop the three points. Following the win, dockers moved second with 45 points, 11 adrift of Gor who remain top with 56 points. Click here for the latest political news
