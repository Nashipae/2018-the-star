Three schools along the Marakwet-West Pokot border did not open today following banditry attacks in the area. Residents said armed bandits suspected to be from Pokot Central raided the area and made away with more than 60 cows and sheep in the wee hours of Monday. Former Kapyego MCA Benson Kiptire said the bandits had attacked residents in Kipchumwa on Friday, before raiding Komologon on Saturday. Kiptire claimed the attacks erupted moments after the state withdrew a team of police officers deployed on the border in the first week of August. “The attack happened a few metres from Kamelei Primary School. The neighbouring Tenderwa and Kalya primary schools are deserted because teachers and pupils fear for their lives,” Kiptire said. He added: “We have made several calls to local authorities including the county commissioner and his deputy but no police officers have been deployed to restore order.” He said peace meetings have been held, but bandits who are known, have not been arrested. “Last week, residents decided to arrest three suspected bandits and handed them over to the police. People are tired of police inaction,” he added. Marakwet East Deputy County Commissioner Stephen Sangolo said police officers have been deployed to pursue the bandits. He assured students and parents of the affected schools that additional security officers will be deployed to the institutions. “We have not arrested the suspects but we are working closely with security agencies in our neighbouring county to recover the stolen livestock,” he said.
