The Court of Appeal has upheld the election of Starehe MP Charles Njagua and dismissed the petition by his rival Steve Mbogo. Justice Fred Ochieng ruled on Friday that the first time Jubilee Party MP was validly elected and that Mbogo did not provide sufficient evidence on claims of irregularities. "It was not open to the learned judge to ramage through the hand written notes and the first respondent's submissions to find something to use to nullify the appellant's election when the order for scrutiny was unambiguous," Ochieng added. Mbogo moved to the appeals court after the High Court dismissed his petition against Njagua, popularly known as musician Jaguar, on February 26. While making the move on February 12, he said the judges at the lower court did not provide the forms that he claimed were not signed. At that time, the court slapped Mbogo with a Sh10 million fine.
