Arthur Chiluba and Jamaican artiste Maxi Priest are working on a collaboration. The two met through Jamaican producer called Paul. "I sent him a song I had done earlier and he was impressed. He requested to get me a bigger artiste on it and so when Maxi Priest heard the demo, he loved it and decided to do a verse too," Chiluba said. Priest is in Kenya for his first-ever concert. He will also shoot the video of the song. "We are shooting the song in Kenya at the Railway Museum because it is easy to access since it is in the town centre. The inspiration behind the song is love and nothing else. It has a despacito feel and not reggae , like what most know Maxi Priest for." How was it working with Maxi Priest? "[It] was very easy for me because he accommodates you regardless of his fame. He is really passionate and he is also easy to work with," Chiluba said. Sauti Solâ€™s Live and Die in Africa and Unconditionally Bae dances were choreographed by Arthur Chiluba Chiluba has done three solo songs so far. His first song was with comedian Oga Obinna called Wololo.
