Fit-again Telkom quartet of Barbara Simuyu, Flavian Mutiva, Tracy Karanja and Ann Juma will be available for selection ahead of tomorrow’s tie against Chase Amira as the Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) women’s Premier League second leg gets underway at the City Park Stadium. The four missed the team’s last encounter where the local champions won 1-0 against United States International University Africa. The 20-time domestic champions, who seems unrivaled in their match to claim this year’s title, have won their past seven matches and will be out to maintain their unbeaten run against the fourth-placed bankers who will descend to the pith for the second time without their head coach, Linnet Onyango, who decamped to Sliders. Telkom head coach Jos Openda said three points remains their target. “It will be business as usual. We are going for the three points and a big winning margin. I am happy the four players who missed our last match have recovered and will be available for selection,” said Openda. Today, bottom-placed Western Jaguars will count on home advantage when they host a ninth-rooted Parklands at Kakamega grounds in the men’s matches. Jaguars have gathered seven points from 11 matches and risk to be axed to the less prestigious second tier,Super League. However their head coach Michael Malungu is confident that his charges will make good use of the home comfort and keep their top flight status which is in jeopardy. In other matches Greensharks will kick off their double fixture against eighth ranked KCA and are bound to meet 2012 champions Sikh Union tomorrow. Butali Warriors BATTLE Wazalendo and Nakuru while JKUAT and Vikings will be eyeing their first wins of the season when they face off in a mid-morning encounter.
