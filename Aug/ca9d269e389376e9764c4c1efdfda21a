Two Mombasa-based KEBS officials, an importer and a clearing agent have been arrested over alleged illegal importation of sugar through the port. The four were nabbed on Thursday night by DCI sleuths from Nairobi. A source within the directorate said the officers had been in Mombasa for over a week, gathering evidence to nail them. The DCI's Coast regional coordinator Joseph Ng'ang'a said the officers were reporting to the headquarters. The four are to be arraigned at Mombasa High Court on Friday. The investigation, that is a joint effort by the DCI and the Kenya Revenue Authority, has extended to tax evasion. Four days ago, their joint statement said they are focused on collusion between taxpayers and KRA employees. Three Kenya Ports Authority staff and one KRA official were arrested for concealing and improperly declaring of goods worth Sh6 million that were stored at Embakasi ICD. They are Tom Oyugi, Enock Omondi and William Lang'at who works for KPA and Muchemi who is a KRA employee.
