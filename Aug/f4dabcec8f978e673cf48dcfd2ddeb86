The Health ministry has released the National HIV-ART Care and Treatment Guidelines and training documents. They include how to prevent tetanus infections during medical circumcision. It also includes the Early Infant Male Circumcision Training Manual for Healthcare Workers. The guidelines were released at the People’s Park in Machakos county on Wednesday. Health Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman said the ministry will continue to train workers. “With this plan, we will ensure 80 per cent of Kenyans are tested and aware of their HIV status. We acknowledge that as the world changes, we should be continuously rethinking and considering ways to promote HIV prevention, treatment and for services to be of high quality and accessible to all,” he said. Aman said the ministry has designed interventions to minimise risks and increase access to preventive care. The new guideline has been informed by recent evidence which shows 43 per cent ( four out of every 10 people) living with HIV remain undiagnosed worldwide. “These findings have significant implications in our fight against HIV,” Aman said.
