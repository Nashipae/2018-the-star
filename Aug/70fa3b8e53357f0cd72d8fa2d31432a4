The Magistrate Court has declined to accept High Court orders stoping Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu’s case. High Court Judge Chacha Mwita suspended criminal charges against the DCJ said her petition raises constitutional issues that need to be addressed.

"As far as I am concerned there is no order stopping this trial,” he said on Wednesday. Mugambi said court orders must be specific and should not leave room interpretation. He said Mwilu’s file number contradicted the one before the Magistrate court. “This is because the file number in which her lawyers extracted reads as 292 /2018 yet her file before the magistrate is 38,” Mugambi said. “It is not yet clear why there are two separate files,” he added.
