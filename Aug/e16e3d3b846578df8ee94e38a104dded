Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has dismissed concerns over the health of opposition MP Robert Kyagulanyi, better known as musician Bobi Wine, calling them "fake news". There have been reports that Kyagulanyi was gravely injured when he was arrested last week after being accused of treason. In a statement, Museveni says that he has checked with army doctors and they told him that he has "no head or chest injuries or bone fractures". Last Thursday, lawyers for the opposition MP said he had been so badly beaten in military custody that he could barely see, talk or walk when he appeared before a military court. Kyagulanyi's brother, Eddy Yawe, told the BBC he had managed to see the MP while in custody. He says his brother recounted how he had been brutally tortured by a group of soldiers, including on his genitals, and that they had injected him several times with an unknown substance. The opposition MP was charged with unlawful possession of firearms after being arrested in the run-up to a by-election.
