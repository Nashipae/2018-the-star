KPA will hire a private consultant to help in filling the vacant position of managing director, Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia said on Friday. He said the Kenya Ports Authority board will in the next few weeks advertise calls for Catherine Mturi-Wairi's replacement. The latter was ousted in May. "We want the recruitment to be done independently to avoid all the funny stuffs on the recruitment process," Macharia said. "We cannot rush to do our things. Expect the advert in the next two weeks after which a competitive recruitment process follows," the CS said. Daniel Manduku was appointed the acting managing director after Mturi-Wairi's removal on grounds of non-performance leading to congestion at the Mombasa port. KPA board announced that Manduku will be acting for two months. The board, early this month, announced that they had extended Mandukuâ€™s tenure by another four months. Meanwhile, the Transport CS also announced that the Kenya Railways Corporation board has appointed Philip Mainga as the acting managing director. The KRC business research manager was handed over the management of the railways following the suspension of Atanas Maina. Maina is among top government officials suspended over irregularities in SGR compensation payouts.
