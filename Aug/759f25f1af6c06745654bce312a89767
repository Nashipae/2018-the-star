Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong'o and his Siaya counterpart Cornel Rasanga have disassociated themselves from an advert going around social media claiming that they will officiate a dinner organized by 'Nyanza Development Forum '. Both governors, through their press team, said they haveÂ not been invited to the forum. "The organizers of the purported dinner are advised to be respectful to our institutions and the holders of such offices," Nyong'o said in a statement. According to the message circulating on social media, the dinner is set to be hosted on August 31 in Nairobi. Rasanga through his communication director also disassociated himself from the said dinner. Rasanga said the advert was misleading. "The Governor will and is able to share his views on "the handshake" with the public at various open fora where no charges are levied on Wanaichi from time to time," the statement stated. ODM party leader Raila Odinga is alleged to be the chief guest. Click here for the latest political news
