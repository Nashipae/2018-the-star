Former minister Dalmas Otieno has bowed out of the Migori senator by-election to concentrate on a presidential appointment as a member of Salaries and Remuneration Commission. Dalmas yesterday said he wants to focus on the vetting. He is the second candidate to bow out of the race. Businessman Eddy Oketch who was to vie on the Federal Party of Kenya ticket bowed out in favour of Ochillo Ayacko on Wednesday. The move followed a meeting with ODM leader Raila Odinga. The decision increases Ayackoâ€™s chances of winning after he was cleared by IEBC to run on an ODM ticket yesterday.
