The Court of Appeal has set aside orders that reinstated more than 100 engineers and technicians of Kenya Airways last year.  Judges William Ouko, Kathurima M’Inoti and Fatuma Sichale said the order issued by the Employment and Labour Relations Court judge Hellen Wasilwa was not justified.“In our view, without hearing the parties and in the absence of KQ’s response to the motion, there is no way the court could have determined that special circumstances existed for the issuance of a mandatory injunction at an interlocutory stage. The special circumstances, if at all, had not been demonstrated…,” they said.

Justice Wasilwa issued an order temporarily reinstating them, citing safety and the sensitivity of the issues involving the aircraft and security of human lives. The national carrier being aggrieved by the orders, appealed the decision on grounds that Justice Wasilwa erred in law by issuing a ‘mandatory interlocutory injunctive order’ against Kenya Airways without affording them an opportunity to be heard.KQ said Wasilwa erred in law by issuing the order yet the employers had sought to be compensated in monetary terms.The appellate court said they were in agreement with KQ that short of the parties being heard and short of KQ’s response to the motion, there was no way the court could have reached the conclusion that there were special circumstances that warranted the issuance of the order at the ‘interlocutory stage’.“The judge one-sidedly took it upon herself, without expert evidence, to determine issues of safety of air travel,” said the appellate judges.The court held that “for an interlocutory mandatory injunction to issue, an applicant must demonstrate existence of special circumstances…. a temporary injunction can only be granted in exceptional and in the clearest of cases.” More: KQ advertises engineer,technician jobs after sacking 140 Click here for
