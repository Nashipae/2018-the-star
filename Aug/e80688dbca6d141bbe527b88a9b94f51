IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati has asked the two ex-commissioners who returned to their office after resigning in April to write to him on their mission. The electoral agency is short of four commissioners following the exit of deputy vice chair Connie Maina, commissioners Margaret Mwachanya, Paul Kurgat, and Roselyne Akombe. Maina and Mwachanya returned to their offices in the wake of the August 10 ruling which held that they did not follow due process while quitting. "I did not manage to see them but let them put what they want to tell me in writing...They are no longer commissioners of IEBC and we don't have offices of former commissioners," he said. Chebukati told journalists on Monday that after the commissioners write to him, the IEBC will address the issues they have raised. "They came back today but I had other engagements. They cannot come to the offices and claim that they want a space in their offices." "They are not supposed to be working here. There is no place for them in the IEBC. They came on Friday and we were surprised." Earlier, Chebukati maintained that the three commissioners, of which two returned to office on Friday, resigned. Chebukati says the two cannot be allowed back as they had handed over commission assets in their possession having followed the due clearance procedures.
