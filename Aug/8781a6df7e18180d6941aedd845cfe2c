There was drama after residents scrambled for free meat during Eid ul-Adha celebrations at Athi River Mosque in Machakos County on Tuesday. The locals comprising both Muslims and Christians engaged in a 15 minute scuffle when they were told by the mosque's leadership to line up so as to be given the free meat. The leaders were forced to momentarily stop the exercise and seek the assistance of armed AP officers before proceeding with the donations. Sheikh Ali Abdallah Omar, the local Imam, said the chaos were caused by non-muslims who attempted to use force to get the meat. "Non-Muslims were using force in an attempt to get the meat, that's why we sought for reinforcement from AP officers," Omar said. He addressed the press during the celebrations at the mosque. The exercise later went on successfully under tight security of the officers. Omar said 1,000 Muslims and more than 500 non-Muslims received the donations of meat and bacon. "We have slaughtered cattle and goats and shared with the less fortunate members of the society including our Christians," said Omar. He said as Athi River Mosque, they celebrated Eid ul-Adha as was the case in Mecca. He said Muslim leaders should unite to avoid splinter groups after the Chief Kadhi Ahmed MuhdharÂ said the celebrations should be marked on Wednesday. Omar said situations in which Muslims celebrate Eid ul-Adha in two different days should not arise. "The Kenyan Constitution recognizes the Kadhi Court. There are several institutions that deal with Islamic issues. We have confidence that if Muslim leaders come together and agree, there would be unity and togetherness in the religion," Omar said.
