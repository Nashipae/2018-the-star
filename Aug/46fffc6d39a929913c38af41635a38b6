Higher sugar, potato and petrol prices drove up the average annual inflation to 4.35 per cent, fresh data has shown. This is the third month in a row the inflation rate has gone up after falling to the lowest point of 3.73 per cent in April this year. Kenya National Bureau of Statistics data show a kilo of sugar went up 6.66 per cent to Sh137.11 during the review period. A kilogramme of potatoes cost consumers Sh60.12 while petrol cost Sh113.07 per litre, a 3.1 per cent rise for both items. During the review period, tomato prices registered the biggest drop of 21.67 per cent to cost Sh95.60 per kilogramme. “Between June and July 2018, food and non-alcoholic drinks index decreased by 2.4 per cent. This was due to decrease in some foodstuffs outweighing increases recorded in respect of others,” KNBS director general Zachary Mwangi said in the monthly release. The statistics show the cost of basic items including Kale (Sukuma Wiki), beans, sifted maize flour and maize grains dropped marginally whereas consumers paid more for rent, kerosene, electricity, LPG gas and charcoal. “Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels index increased by 0.12 per cent in July 2018 compared to 0.52 per cent recorded the previous year. This was mainly attributed to increase in prices of kerosene, electricity and cooking gas,” he said. The transport index increased by 0.62 per cent during the review period due to the increase in fuel pump prices.
