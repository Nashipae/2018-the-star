Detectives are investigating the shooting of former Garissa Finance executive Idris Mkutar in Keleleshwa, Nairobi. Mkutar on Sunday suffered serious injuries in the head. He was left for dead outside a city hotel. Nairobi deputy police boss Richard Kerich yesterday said DCI officers have taken up the case. “The victim is in hospital with injuries in the head,” he said. It is said that a gang of three followed the former county official to his car and shot him in the head at close range before escaping. Nothing was stolen. Mkutar was admitted to Nairobi Hospital in critical condition. Police have yet to determine the motive of the shooting. Witnesses told police officers that Mkutar had gone for prayers at a nearby mosque and was leaving for his house when the attackers ambushed him.
