Chandarana Foodplus bosses finally appeared before the NCIC yesterday and said the employee at the centre of the “racist” email saga had disappeared. The store’s bosses failed to appear before the commission last Friday and said they saw the  summons late.

He said Patel had absconded duty since July 27. The employee is accused of authoring an email which said the supermarket wanted to focus on “white people”. Rajan said Patel was a new hire as a marketing executive and that controversy about the email was due to her inadequate proficiency in the English language. Asked about how Patel would write such an email that communicated important marketing policy without approval from the management, Rajan said, “this was an oversight on the part of the management.” “The employee is a holder of Masters degree and had worked in Poland before,” he added. Rajan denied the perception that racism is rife in the chain store, saying they have 1,200 employees, of which only 2.3 per cent are expatriates. Kyalo Mwengi, the commission’s legal adviser, said the missing employee is an Indian and her work permit expired on yesterday. He said the Immigration department had been alerted to have her not flee the country. More: Chandarana punishes author of racist promotion email Click here for
