Kenyan-born
Hollywood actor Edi Gathegi is expected in the country in
December. He is expected
to jet in for the festive season and tour various parts of the
country during his stay. This will be Gathegi's third visit since he left at the age of three. His last visit was a year ago. In an interview with
the Star then Gathegi said he planned to visit the country in the next 24
months. But it seems the visit will be sooner as Word Is has learnt that the
star will be around this Christmas season. Born in Umoja estate, Eastlands, Nairobi, Gathegi moved to the United States at the
age of three and settled in California. He attended the University of
California before focusing on his acting career. In May, Gathegi was
among nominees of the Lucille Lortel Award in the outstanding
featured
actor
in a play
category. Gathegi will feature in a new Netflix Movie The
Last Thing He Wanted. He
joined the film in July
2018, alongside
DC star Ben
Affleck (Batman
role Justice League),
Toby Jones, Rosie Perez, Mel Rodriguez and Carlos Leal. The
movie is an American-British
political thriller directed by Dee Rees based on the book by the same
name by Joan Didion. Gathegi is also expected to be in StartUp, which
has
been renewed for a 10-episode third season. The
second season of the show launched on September 28 last
year and received a warm reception, prompting Crackles to renew it for a third season.
