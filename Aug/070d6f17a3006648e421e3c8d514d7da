Suspended National Land Commission chairman Muhammad Swazuri has asked a court to vary orders that bars him from accessing his former office. Swazuri wants the court to interpret an order issued by anti-corruption court chief magistrate Lawrence Mugambi a fortnight ago restraining him from going to the NLC offices unless he is accompanied by a police officer.

Swazuri appeared before the magistrate on Thursday accompanied by his lawyer Tom Ojienda ready to argue the application, but they were directed to go back on Friday. This was after the prosecution said they needed more time. State Counsel Lilian Obuor said the accused filed the application late on Wednesday evening. While granting Swazuri and others bail, magistrate Mugambi ordered the officers to stay away from their offices and only visit them in the company of a police officer. Swazuri later wrote to Head of Public Service Francis Kinyua demanding his job back. In a four-page letter dated August 14, he also launched a scathing attack on acting chairperson Abigael Mbagaya, accusing her of misinterpreting the court order. On Thursday, Ojienda said the orders, as framed are not clear. In the case, the prosecution alleges that Swazuri and his co-accused conspired to pay more millions as compensation for public land that was irregularly acquired. The prosecution claimed they all conspired to commit crimes which led to the loss of Sh222,375,000 of public funds, in payments for three pieces of land belonging to KRC. Others charged included the commission CEO/secretary Tom Aziz Chavangi and directors Salome Munubi, Francis Mugo, Gladys Muyanga (Ministry of Lands) and Obadiah Wainaina (surveyor).
