Promotion chasing Ushuru’s bid to return to the National Super League (NSL) summit suffered a major blow as they lost 2-1 to Nairobi Stima at Karuturi Grounds. Ushuru, who are second with 52 points,level with leaders Western Stima — who lost 1-0 to Bidco United on Saturday — were hoping to open a three point gap but the Ibrahim Shikanda-coached powermen struck twice in the first half to deny the taxmen the three points. Washington Gicovi opened the scores for Stima in the 13th minute before Brian Musa doubled lead in the 20th minute. Ushuru managed a consolation in the 34th minute through Barack Odhiambo, who scored from the spot. Prior to the game, Stima were fourth with 46 points and the win saw them put pressure on the two leaders and could finally complicate matters if they win their match in hand. The result left Ushuru winless in two matches having played Coast Stima to a one-all draw in their last encounter. At Camp Toyoyo, former Kenyan Premier League side Nairobi City Stars came from a goal down to settle for a 1-1 draw with Kibera Black Stars in a local derby. Highly-rated Stephen Njuguna, who has been on the radar of elite clubs, threw Kibera ahead in the 38th minute but Jaswell Ngugi replied for City Stars in the 83rd minute to share the spoils. Hosts Coast Stima were held to a barren draw by visiting Isibania at Mbaraki Stadium.
