Ugandan MP Robert Kyagulanyi, commonly known as Bobi Wine, has reported that his driver was shot dead by police inside his car. The Kyadondo East legislator said in a tweet that they were in Arua for campaigns at the time of the shooting. A by-election is expected to be conducted in the area on Wednesday in the race to replace slain MP Ibrahim Abiriga. Bobi Wine and a number of opposition leaders were there to rally support for Independent candidate Kassiano Wadri. The rallies went on smoothly throughout the day before police started clashing with Wadriâ€™s supporters. The latter were reportedly battling supporters of the NRM candidate Tiperu Nusura. Bobi Wine further states that his hotel has been cordoned off by the police following the incidents. Click here for the latest political news
