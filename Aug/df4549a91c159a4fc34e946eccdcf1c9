Sirisia MP John Waluke was charged on Thursday in relation to an alleged million dollar contract between Chelsea Freight and the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB). He was held at the Milimani basement cells before taken to court. Via Twitter, the ODPP said Waluke faces the charges alongside Grace Wakhungu. The two are directors of Erad Supplies and General Contracts Limited. Waluke and Wakhungu are accused of fraudulently uttering a false invoice for $1,146,000 (Sh115,061,838) as evidence of an arbitration dispute between their company and the board. The two allegedly acquired Sh297,386,505, purporting it to be the cost of storage of 40,000 metric tonnes of maize, as incurred by Chelsea Freight in loss of profits and interest. Waluke denied four counts of fraudulent acquisition of public property. He was taken back to the cells ahead of a ruling on his release on bond at 2pm. Click here for the latest political news
