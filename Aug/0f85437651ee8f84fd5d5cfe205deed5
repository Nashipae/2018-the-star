Ethiopia's prime minister has
appointed a team to advise his government on the privatisation
of state-owned enterprises, his chief of staff said, as part of
reforms the new leader has instituted since taking office four
months ago. Since becoming prime minister in April, 41-year-old Abiy
Ahmed has turned Africa's most populous after Nigeria on its
head with his plans to reshape politics and the economy. "PM Abiy Ahmed has set up an Advisory Council on the
privatisation of large state-owned enterprises," Fitsum Arega,
Abiy's chief of staff said on Twitter late on Friday. "The Council will ensure the process is managed with utmost
transparency and accountability." Abiy's government has said that it is open to selling off a
host of state-owned firms, either partially or entirely, as part
of economic reforms designed to “unleash the potential of the
private sector”. The government was tendering for advice from global business
consultancies including McKinsey and PwC, the country's
information minister told Reuters in July. Ethiopia has achieved one of Africa’s fastest growth rates
over the past decade, averaging up to 10 percent a year. But investors complain about its stifling and antiquated
socialist bureaucracy, where the default answer from fearful
civil servants is “no” and importing something as mundane as
cotton can take six or 12 months. Besides his stated desire to attract foreign capital into
one of Africa’s most closed states, Abiy has brokered peace with
Eritrea, with whom Ethiopia fought a border war two decades ago. Click here for the latest political news
