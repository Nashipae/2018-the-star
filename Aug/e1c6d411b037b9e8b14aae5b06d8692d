The controversy pitting the Kakamega government and an investor in the Sh200 billion Mwale Medical and Technology City could be resolved soon. The investor, Julius Mwale, and Governor Wycliffe Oparanya met yesterday and agreed on the way forward. The two will sign an MoU to end the bad blood over implementation of the project. In late 2016, Mwale moved to court to block the county government from demolishing the proposed city on grounds that he did not obtain approval for the project from the government. Yesterday, a source who attended the meeting between the two told the Star that they agreed that all court cases by the two parties be withdrawn before signing of the MoU.
