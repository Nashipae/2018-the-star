The Machakos county assembly has suspended vetting of subcounty administrators. The MCAs also suspended hiring of deputy subcounty administrators, senior ward administrators and senior deputy ward administrators, who are also the village council administrators, undertaken by the public service board. Through its oversight committee chaired by assembly speaker Florence Mwangangi, the members told the board to stop all interviews on the internally advertised vacancies and desist from any action on the previously interviewed candidates. In a communication by Mwangangi on Wednesday, the board was further required to submit the list of shortlisted possible recruits. However, the executive, through chief officer James Kathili, condemned the assembly’s decision on suspending the recruitment. Kathili said the assembly is overstepping its mandate. He said under the principle of separation of powers, the executive is the originator and implementer of policy. Kathili said the assembly legislates and oversees, while the judiciary settles disputes. He said the assembly is causing confusion. “They act as if they are the executive and judiciary as well. They even issue conclusive orders akin to judicial orders,” Kathili added. He said the oversight authority is guarded by reports of independent investigations or agencies mandated by law.
