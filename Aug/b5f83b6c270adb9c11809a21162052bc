A court has ordered the Â  disposal of 27 uncollected bodies that have been lying in a Naivasha mortuary for the past five months. The order followed an application by the Department of Public Health on grounds they had congested the mortuary. Most of the bodies were collected by police either from accident scenes or those found dumped along the highways. The court gave the department the authority to inter the bodies at Longonot cemetery with immediate effect. A senior officer from the department said this would be carried out over the weekend or on Monday. "We issued several notices to members of the public about the bodies. We have to dispose them in a public cemetery," the officer said. Meanwhile, a sanitation crisis has hit the only public cemetery in Naivasha due to lack of water and toilets, forcing mourners to relieve themselves in the bushes. There are now fears of a disease outbreak in Longonot area where the cemetery is located due to the current crisis. The crisis started when Naivasha town cemetery was closed last year after it filled up. John Mwangi, a resident, said they had raised their concerns with the county government but their grievances had not been addressed. Click here for the latest political news
