The High Court has declined to issue orders readmitting a Form 4 student expelled from a Nairobi school for alleged involvement in drug and substance abuse. The student was suspended from school on February this year. The school’s disciplinary committee recommended the student’s exclusion from the school, but with a rider that he could return to the school, though conditionally, only to sit his KCSE exam. The decision was communicated and referred to the Nairobi County Education Board, who recommended that the student be relocated to another school. Justice Wilfrida Okwany in her ruling held that readmitting the student to the same school would send a negative message to the rest of the students. “This is a national school hosting more than 1,000 students from all over the country. They are equally entitled to their right to protection from the negative influence or behaviour that may arise from readmitting students who had already exhibited deviant behavior,” the judge ruled.
