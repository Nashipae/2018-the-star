An Orange Democratic Movement official has hit back at Sports CS Rashid Echesa and demanded that he respects party leader Raila Odinga. National youth leader Joash Muricho said it is wrong for Echesa to abuse Raila publicly, yet he is responsible for his success. He spoke at a press conference. “Echesa, respect Raila, he is not your age mate. He is responsible for your political success,” he said. “Raila is a national politician, the fact that he embraced the March 9 handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta tells you who he is." Muricho told Echesa to fight for the welfare of sportsmen and sportswomen. "Pay players well, build the national football team and tell us about the stadiums you have constructed,” he said. On Saturday, Echesa accused the former Prime Minister of plotting his downfall. He claimed Raila wants him removed and the post given to another Luhya leader. Click here for the latest political news
