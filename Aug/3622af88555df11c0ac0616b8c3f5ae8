Elders on Friday “cursed a powerful land cartel” that has grabbed at least 1,500 acres of community land in Kerio Valley. Kongot and Sego clans in Keiyo South recently discovered their communal land has been fraudulently registered by strangers and sold out to third parties in an intricate land racket. A sacred ritual to cast a spell was conducted by Kongot clan elders on the disputed land on Friday. Clan elders chairman Joel Kiptunoi said elders resorted to cursing the cartels after petitions to state agencies to revoke title deeds and revert back the land to the community failed. Cursing rituals, among the Kalenjin is carried out by selected elders with “saint-like” behaviours. A goat was slaughtered and the blood sprinkled on the land amid chanting of ritual songs before elders left the venue quietly and in a hurry as per traditions. Kiptunoi said the spilling of blood signifies that doom and death will befall the grabbers and their families if they fail to surrender the land. “Justice will be found. Those who grabbed our land may think they are powerful, but they will soon face the consequences and pay for their sins,” Kiptunoi said. Clan secretary Nicholas Kiplagat claimed they are aware of a syndicate involving the National Land Commission and state government officials to grab communal lands in the valley.
