Kenya Bureau of Standards staff will undergo fresh vetting, Industrialisation Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya has said. Speaking during an update of KEBS market surveillance on sugar sampled across the country, Munya said that plans are underway to restructure, increase KEBS staff and vet the current ones. He said that he has directed the board to lay out measures on how the vetting which should begin immediately will be carried out. “We have a plan of increasing the staff but we first want to look at the ethical standards of who we hire, because we can hire people but they have an ethical deficit,”Munya said. He said that officers KEBS and other multi-agency officers are part of the problem in the fight against fakes and counterfeits. In June this year, the then KEBS managing director Charles Ongwae and nine other senior officials were charged over importation of substandard fertiliser and circulation of fake KEBS stamps. Ongwae has since been replaced by Kenya Investment Authority chief executive Moses Ikiara as acting managing director. Also arrested in the same month for questioning was KEBS coast regional manager Martin Nyakiamo. Last week two KEBS officials were charged alongside Kilindini Port health officer and director of an importing company with releasing 10,000 bags of substandard sugar into the country.
