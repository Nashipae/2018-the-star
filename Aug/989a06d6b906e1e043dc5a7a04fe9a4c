Contributors to the National Health Insurance Fund will receive their claims faster following the implementation of an electronic system. At least 500 health facilities in Nairobi already have the system, and online claims will take effect in other hospitals countrywide by the end of September. NHIF Chief Executive Officer Geoffrey Mwangi said the electronic claims system will shorten the processing period and minimise fraud. He spoke on Monday during a stakeholders' forum for FOPA Association Kenya. The association brings together former Members of Parliament, senators and women representatives. The new system that will replace the manual system is expected to be efficient, faster and convenient. Mwangi said tracking claims will be easier for NHIF and health providers. He said as members grow in future all services will be automated," Mwangi said. The Fund's key achievements include expanded benefits package for members needs, biometric registration and implementation of Linda Mama for expectant mothers. During the Rapid Results Initiative programme, NHIF registered 51,117 new applicants. Their target was list 25,000 members in the 100 days starting from May 3.
