Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi has asked Chief Justice David Maraga to deny owners of buildings on riparian land court injunctions. He said merchants of corruption are regrouping to frustrate the demolition of the buildings that were approved illegally. "We know corruption fights back ferociously, but the courts should not give any leeway," Wandayi said. The MP who spoke in Udenda, Siaya, on Friday praised the demolitions being done by the county government and the national government. He said it will help fight impunity. Wandayi said the perpetrators of impunity and corruption should not be given breathing space. He said the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga is the beginning of the rebirth of the nation that Kenyans have been yearning for many years. "The wrongs and failures of previous regimes are being rectified. The demolitions must be supported to preserve the environment," he said. Wandayi said the demolition of buildings on riparian land and reclaiming of public land should be done in all the 47 counties. At the same time, he commended the government for arresting and charging "big fish" in the fight against corruption.
