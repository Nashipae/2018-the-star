A fortnight ago, Justice Wilfrida Okwany ruled that the resignation of three IEBC commissioners was unprocedural. All Kenyans had expected the trio of Connie Maina, Margret Mwachanya and Paul Kurgat to be gone for good. But Maina and Mwachanya are now latching onto the High Court decision to brazenly reclaim their jobs. What’s changed? As they dramatically and emphatically resigned, they stated that chairman Wafula Chebukati was incompetent with zero ability to lead. The three said the IEBC had become dysfunctional and incapable of delivering its mandate. So, the two ladies’ attempted return is driven purely by selfish interest. They seem to be yearning for the trappings of power — GK-fueled cars, bodyguards and lofty pay. Their conduct is shameful, immoral and unacceptable. It’s a clear breach of public trust and the embodiment of impunity. In fact, they should be surcharged if they are still being paid. These back-and-forth games further erode the integrity of the IEBC, which is already in tatters. The honourable thing for all the IEBC brass, including Chebukati, to do is resign. They should spare Kenyans this circus. If they don’t quit, Parliament should initiate their removal and the DPP should investigate the commission.
