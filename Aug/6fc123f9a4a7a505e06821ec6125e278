Kenya Medical Supplies Agency (Kemsa) on Thursday supplied drugs worth Sh146 million to Nairobi county, ending a Sh234 million debt deadlock. The medicine, flagged off from Kemsa stores in Embakasi, was disbursed to Pumwani, Mbagathi, and Mama Lucy hospitals. Governor Mike Sonko warned county employees against diverting the medicines to private chemists saying perpetrators will be severely punished. The debt row was ended following intense discussions between the supplier and Sonko. The parties reached a deal on how the same would be handled. In an official notice to all County Health officials, the governor also warned against misuse of the drugs. "I want to be very clear on this that any county officer who will steal the drugs will be sacked and be prosecuted," Sonko warned. Kemsa CEO Jonah Manjari said the agency will help the county to end months of shortages in various health facilities in Nairobi. The lack of drugs saw a hue and cry from the residents demanding for better healthcare. "We are fulfilling our mandate of delivering quality and affordable healthcare to all Kenyans," Dr Manjari said. KEMSA last supplied Nairobi county with medicine in February 2017 as a result of non-payment. "We are looking forward to a relationship that will see Nairobi residents receive uninterrupted health care services," the Kemsa boss said. Acting Health executive Vesca Kagongo, who represented Sonko at the flag-off, welcomed the supply. "We promise to ensure the drugs are well utilised by our county hospitals," Kagongo said.
