The long wait for the completion of Kinoru Stadium will soon be over after the contractor James Muya confirmed they have covered 87 percent of the construction works. The facility was part of the four stadia earmarked to host the Chan championships in January before Kenya was stripped the hosting rights, thanks to their last minute rush in renovating the stadia. Morocco was then handed the hosting rights. While addressing the parliamentary committee on Sports, Culture and Tourism who toured to inspect the ongoing works, the contractor revealed that the VIP Lounge, public toilets, the roof and back up generator room were the remaining bits and remained hopeful of an early completion. He said: “The roof work are going on and they will be done very soon. We are also yet to complete the VIP Lounge but we are currently doing the plastering works. The public toilets and the generator room are also not complete but they are under construction.” The facility, which recently staged the June 1 Madaraka Day celebration, has been under construction in phases and is set to meet the international standards after completion having been given the nod by Caf officials who toured it before the works began. The contractor announced a restriction in the usage of the facility as the grass on the playing surface was not ready for mowing. The committee’s chairman Victor Munyaka, who doubles up as the Member of Parliament for Machakos Town, noted that the project took much longer due to lack of funds and urged the national treasury to release funds. He also asked treasury to ensure the other facilities earmarked for face-lift including Kasarani, Nyayo, Wote and Marsabit are completed. He further urged the government to consider building a national stadium in Kisumu.
