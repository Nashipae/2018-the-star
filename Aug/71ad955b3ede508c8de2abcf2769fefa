President Uhuru Kenyatta’s order freezing expenditure on new
projects until old ones are completed has elicited mixed reactions from the
public, politicians and experts. On the face of it, this is
a sound policy decision to address flagrant wastage of public funds. The country is littered with hundreds of unfinished projects initiated
by different institutions using public funds. They stalled because of changed priorities or lack of feasibility. In the worst cases — such as those funded from CDF — projects were
abandoned with the exit of the MP who initiated them; similar ones
began. Beside
such petty politics are national projects that stalled because either
the government ceased funding, a contractor abandoned the site over a dispute
or nonpayment. These projects are often subjects of protracted court
battles. The President’s directive will not resolve them unless it means closing
our eyes to sink funds where much has been squandered without holding responsible
parties to account. As pointed out, the directive was knee-jerk and
a wee bit late. It violates the PFM Act and the constitutionally
laid-out participatory
budgeting process. In the interest of good governance, law and order,
the President
should set up a task force to review all unfinished projects, establish
the underlying reasons and take remedial actions, effective the next
financial year.
