With 17 days before the Berlin Marathon, Olympic champion Eliud Kipchoge is plotting to dip under his personal best of 2:03:23 Currently, he is not resting on the laurels and has taken his training to the next level. Kipchoge has been lowering his Berlin Marathon time since his first appearance in 2013 when he clocked 2:04:05. He ran in 2:04:00 in 2015 and further lowered the time to his current personal best (2:03:32) last year. Recent photos shared by the Olympic marathon champion on Facebook show an intricate and strictly-managed training, with world beater running with a host of pace setters at his training base. But the striking feature is Kipchoge’s latest ambition to become the first athlete to run under 2 hours. On Tuesday, Kipchoge said he was speeding 15x1000 metres twice daily to build his speed work as the clock ticks towards the September 16 race. The London Marathon champion will be seeking a third win in the German race after running away with the title in 2015 and 2017. “I finished the week on a high after rigorous training,” Kipchoge said on his Facebook post. Speaking about his new ambition of running Under 2 hours, the 2:03:05 personal best marathoner said: “Anything is possible so long as you believe.” “Any athlete can achieve his dream. I advise them to put their mind in covering the full distance of 26.2 miles. If your mind is focused, then you are done,” he said. If he wins, Kipchoge will be the second runner to grab the Berlin title thrice after Ethiopia’s Haile Gebreslassie. Kipchoge will have former world champion Wilson Kipsang for company. Kipsang beat Kipchoge in the Berlin course to set the personal best time of 2:03:23. Dennis Kimeto ran the current record of 2:02:57 on the same course.
