Trans Nzoia county has met 35 per cent of the demand for clean water, a county executive has said. Environment, Water and Natural Resources boss Maurice Lokwaliwa (pictured) yesterday said the county aims for at least 50 per cent by 2020. He said the Kiptogot-Kolongolo project will pump water usinggravity and will benefit more than Kwanza 70,000 residents. The county will use Sh1.3 billion for the project. Lokwaliwa said another project will draw water from Cherangany Hills to double its supply from the current daily 10 million-litre supply to  20 million. The county also plans to rehabilitate the Nzoia River Scheme to improve supply. “The challenge we have is the high cost of pumping water. We will use solar energy,” Lokwaliwa said. He said a solar station will be established and a plant installed to pump water from River Nzoia. The project will be expanded to Moi’s Bridge to increase coverage. The CEC said they will also upgrade their sewerage system.
