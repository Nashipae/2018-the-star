Kiambu DCIO has been ordered to record statements of all persons that came into contact with the body of Kiambu businessman Peter Macharia found dead in his home during the conducting of the first postmortem. Principal magistrate Justus Kituku gave the orders on Friday in regards to an application made by the parents of the deceased to know of the whereabouts of his Adam’s apple that went missing after a second postmortem. They were dissatisfied with the initial one. Lawyer Beth Fundi, representing the family of Macharia, informed the court there was a first postmortem conducted, but the family sought a second. The first autopsy result showed Macharia died due to neck compression from hanging, with suspected chemical poisoning. The autopsy results were however silent on whether the missing body parts were inside the body or not.

They were all in agreement there were crucial missing body parts, which were thyroid bone and thyroid cartilage(Adam’s apple), which was not mentioned in the first postmortem and were crucial in determining the actual cause of death. The autopsy was conducted in the presence of chief government pathologist Dr Johansen Odour, the three pathologists who conducted the first postmortem and Prof Kiama Wangai, the family’s pathologist. It showed Macharia died as a result of lack of oxygen due to a rope going around the neck. A third injury was also discovered on the leg, which showed there was a bruise on his left leg below the knee. The postmortem also confirmed the injury on his head. Those sued include the funeral home, Esther Ndung’u, who is Macharia’s widow, and pathologists Dorothy Njeru, Peter Ndegwa and Okinyi, who witnessed the first autopsy conducted on June 22.
