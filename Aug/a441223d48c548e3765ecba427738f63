British Prime Minister Theresa May was honoured with a 19-gun salute upon arrival at State House, Nairobi on Thursday. She inspected a guard of honour ahead of her bilateral talks with the host President Uhuru Kenyatta. May was received by Uhuru and DP William Ruto before the deafening sounds of the fired cannons rented the air. National anthems for the two countries were played as the two leaders prepared to inspect the guard of honour. May is the first British PM to visit Kenya in 30 years since Margaret Thatcher toured in 1988.
