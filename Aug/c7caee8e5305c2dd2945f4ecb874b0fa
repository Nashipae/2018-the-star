National Assembly minority leader John Mbadi yesterday defended MPs for rejecting the sugar importation report despite public criticism over bribery claims. He said the report had numerous loopholes and approving it would not have helped Kenyans to know the truth about the cartels. Mbadi accused the joint parliamentary committee that conducted the probe of protecting sugar barons. “The report was rejected because it did not meet the required standards. Majority of MPs, including me, discovered it was not going to help sugarcane farmers,” the MP said. Mbadi spoke at the Ongoro Lutheran Church in Kabondo Kasipul constituency. He said the committee was expected to reveal to Kenyans the existence of poisonous sugar and business people connected with the illegal importations. The Suba South MP said he voted against the report with a clear conscience.

But what I know is that the report was half-baked,” he added. Mbadi said he will still shoot the report should it be brought to Parliament as it is. “Kenyans wanted to know whether our sugar contained mercury or not. If mercury was discovered, we wanted to know who imported the sugar but none of this came out in the report. My position on the report has not and will not change,” he said. The minority leader warned MPs against castigating their colleagues for rejecting the report. “MPs who now castigate the rejection of the report in funerals did not speak that day. Let them not cheat the public. They need to read its contents first,” he said. But Public Accounts and Investment Committee chairman Moses Kajwang’ urged the Senate to open fresh inquiry into the importation of the illegal sugar. He said he will table a motion in the Senate so the probe is handed over to them. Read:Muturi to MPs: Produce dossier on sugar bribery claims Click here for the latest political news
