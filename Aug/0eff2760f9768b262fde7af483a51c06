The Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya (ADAK) will partner with the Law Society to provide professional training and capacity building to advocates with a view to enhance their capacity in handling Anti-Doping cases. This was revealed by the CEO Japhter Rugut when he made a presentation during the LSK Annual Conference in Kwale. Rugut decried the low numbers of lawyers grounded on anti-doping jurisprudence citing it as the key reason why the agency will undertake the capacity building activities. “We currently have many matters in court at the Sports Disputes Tribunal we have instituted since inception. What we have found out is that we have very few lawyers in this country who have specialized in Anti-Doping issues,” said Rugut. The Agency will put in place mechanisms to ensure that lawyers participating in these sensitization and training forums earn Continuous Professional Development (CPD) points through their society, the LSK. Speaking during the same event on Friday, LSK CEO Mercy Wambua welcomed the proposal by the Agency observing that as a contemporary phenomenon Anti-Doping is one of the areas that would benefit lawyers. “Our CPD Committee sits annually to review emerging areas which it then factors for our members professional training. Clearly, Anti-Doping is one of those areas where advocates are required to apply specialized knowledge since it is an emerging issue.
