Homa Bay county risks losing World Bank funding for a major agricultural project due to leadership disputes. The bank has deposited Sh50.6 million pledged for the 2017-18 financial year for the National Agricultural Growth Program. The project will be implemented in 20 wards where dairy, groundnut, banana and fish farmers will be trained and funded for value addition to their produce. The county government has not yet wired the required Sh5 million to the Central Bank for setting up project infrastructure before the October 21 deadline. The World Bank will disburse Sh140 million in the 2018-19 financial year. The implementation committee is unable, however, to carry out any business following battles over who should be included as signatories to the project’s special account. According to the schedule, community mobilisation, training, transfer of money from the Central Bank to the project’s special account and training of farmers must be done before the deadline. No activity has been initiated. Duncan Ojiem (chief officer Agriculture and Food Security) and Erick Adel (former coordinator) have been left out of the project and replaced by Ben Onyango (chief officer Livestock and Fisheries). Elvis Odalo has replaced Adel as the project coordinator. Last week, Adel protested before the assembly Agriculture committee over his exclusion as a signatory before his dismissal. He said he could not coordinate the project if he is not authorised to control the account as required by law.
