Five people charged at the High Court over the death of a pastor in Imenti South will each be given a state lawyer. Duncan Kiunga, Nahashon Kiogora, Felix
Karani, John Gituma, and Kiambi Mwaja are accused of raping and killing Roselyne Munala of the Redeemed Gospel Church on June 23. They are alleged to have dragged the pastor into a thicket, hit her with a blunt object in the
head and raped her. The five are also accused of stealing the pastor's mobile phone worth Sh8,000. Munala's family learnt that she was missing after she failed to
return home. The five appeared before Judge Ann Ongijo yesterday. She said each will be given a state lawyer before they are allowed to take plea. The case will proceed on August 29. On July 24, judge Francis Gikonyo ordered that the five be taken for mental tests before they can take plea.
