The Sh900 million Isiolo Phase Two water project has been completed and handed over to the county government. The project started in 2011 and was implemented by the Northern Water Services Board. It was funded by the national government and the African Development Bank. The project will supply 6,500 cubic metres of water per day to 60,000 people in Isiolo. It will provide water for the various Vision 2030 flagship projects such as the airport, abattoir, resort city, refinery and Lapsset projects. Water CS Simon Chelugui on Monday said, “Rugusu Springs is best for the project intake as there are no human settlements and the source is well-protected. There are no chances the water could get contaminated.”  The CS spoke in Isiolo town. Chelugui said his ministry is a major enabler of the Universal Healthcare plan spelt out in the government’s Big Four agenda. He urged the four counties selected to pilot the UHC programme to come up with a list of all health facilities and identify those not connected with water and electricity. The four counties are Isiolo, Kisumu, Machakos and Nyeri. Chelugui said success in the four counties will indicate if the programme can be rolled out nationwide. “The ministry’s objective is to ensure at least 80 per cent of Kenyans have access to safe drinking water by the year 2022,” he said. Isiolo deputy governor Abdi Issa praised the national government’s effort in focusing on Isiolo. He said the county with a population of 180,000 people is expanding. Issa said the project is relief to Isiolo town residents who have been suffering for a long time. Resident Elijah Mugambi and Salesio Kiambi said the water will change the fortunes of residents. They, however, said the water is still not enough.
