A matatu driver in Bomet is nursing serious injuries after a police officer allegedly knocked out his teeth for refusing to part with a bribe. Bernard Yegon was hit with a pistol and his clothes torn during the incident near Rorok Tea Factory at Konoin in Bomet yesterday. In an interview with the Star, Cheruiyot said four police officers demanded "lunch" as he waited for a passengers to pay fare. “I told them I did not have money since I was waiting for money. They grabbed me and started searching my pockets,” Yegon claimed “I tried to resist. One of them who had a pistol said I was rude and hit me on the jaw." In pain, Yegon said he fell down and one of the officers took Sh40,000 from his pocket and vanished.

Yegon said the officers fled the scene after realising the public was becoming inquisitive. The incident sparked uproar and matatu crews threatened to hold protests across the county to demand action against the officers. Bomet Matatu Owners Association chairman Jacob Kerich condemned the incident. He wants the officers arrested and charged. He gave the County Police Commandant Naomi Ichami two days to take action or they take to the streets. Yegon was treated at Mogogosiek Health Centre in Konoin. He said was frustrated as he attempted to record a statement at Mogogosiek police station. He was forced to travel to Bomet to make a report, but was referred back to Konoin. Konoin police boss Alphonce Peter could not be reached for a comment. Click here for the latest political news
