Rarely does Ulinzi Stars endure such a miserable run of results thus a run of four win-less matches has left the soldiers coach Dunstan Nyaudo pondering on how he can stem the slide.
Ulinzi have dropped to sixth in the SportPesa Premier league standings on the back of three successive defeats against opponents they would ordinarily run out of town.
With just a point picked from a possible 12, Nyaudo has stated that his focus in the next transfer window, will be on getting strikers. The team is reeling from three straight losses and a draw in the last four matches, none of which has produced a goal, which the coach blames for the current slump.
The team has not been short of creativity, and after the 0-1 loss to Posta Rangers on Sunday, Nyaudo clearly frustrated, lamented at the profligacy seen in the past few matches and didn’t hide his plans for the coming transfer window.
“We have a good team but what the past few matches have shown us is that we seriously need strikers in the team. We need to invest well in that. We have a deficiency in that department and I think that is where we will focus most of our energies when it comes to the transfer,” he said on the club’s official portal.
“We have not scored in four games and for an ambitious team that we are, that is a very big concern. We may concede, but whenever we fail to score, we cannot win a game,” he said. That is clearly a wake up call to the club’s strikers like Oscar Wamalwa and Cliff Kasuti not to mention Masita Masuta—all of whom have struggled for goals hence the soldiers problems.
Their shoddy run of form is not about to get any easier with a tricky away fixture to relegation threatened Chemelil Sugar next on their schedule this weekend. Chemelil are just four points above the drop zone and need to get victory to avert the possibility of being dragged into the relegation mire.
