The arrest of singer and MP Bobi Wine in Uganda could lead to a major crisis if President Museveni is not careful. Three quarters of Ugandans are younger than 25 years. These youth could easily swing behind Bobi Wine, who has backed winners in two by-elections. Last week the back window of one of Museveni's cars was broken by a stone thrown by a demonstrator during the Arua campaign. This was unfortunate but cannot justify beating up four opposition MPs and charging them with treason in a military court. In the 1990s President Daniel Moi forcefully cracked down on dissent but he only succeeded in strengthening the multi-party opposition. He lost the 2002 election in a landslide. Museveni has been in power for 32 years. Most Ugandans were born after 1986. They don't feel an automatic sense of gratitude to him for rescuing Uganda from the murderous Amin and Obote 2 regimes. They can easily turn against him. Museveni should moderate his approach to Bobi Wine. Otherwise he risks losing the 2021 election in a landslide.
