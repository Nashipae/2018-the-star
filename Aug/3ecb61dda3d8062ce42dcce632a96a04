The five people accused of killing a Meru county pastor will each be allocated a state lawyer before pleading to the charge. Judge Ann Ongijo said this on Wednesday when Duncan Kiunga, Nahashon Kiogora, Felix Karani, John Gituma and Kiambi Mwaja were arraigned at Meru High Court. On July 24, Judge Francis Gikonyo ordered mental checks for the accused ahead of plea-taking. They were found fit for trial. Prosecutor Patrick Mitine said the mental examination would be carried out at Meru Level Five Hospital. The five are the suspects in the raping and killing of pastor Roselyne Munala, of Redeemed Gospel Church, at Mitunguu shopping center in Imenti South on June 23. They are accused of dragging Munala into a thicket and hitting her with a blunt object on the head before sexually assaulting and killing her. The victim's Sh8,000 phone was stolen. Munala's family reported her missing as she did not return home that night. The case will proceed on August 29. Following the murder, residents held protests over increasing insecurity and accused police of laxity. The Meru County Ministers Forum, led by patron Edward Buria and chairman Richard Musangi, prayed at the pastor’s home and the scene of Munala's murder. They want the case expedited.
