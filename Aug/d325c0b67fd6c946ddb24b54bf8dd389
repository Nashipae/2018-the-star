Kenya has only about 2,000 lions left compared to 2,280 in 2004, according to Kenya Wildlife Service. The revelation comes as the World marks World lion Day today. KWS communications officer Paul Udoto said Kenya is losing an average of 100 of its 2,000 lions yearly due to growing human and wildlife conflict, poisoning of carcasses and loss of prey. Globally, there are only about 20,000 lions left. "Did you know there are only about 20,000 lions left in the wild having vanished from over 90 per cent of their range land?" KWS tweeted. Lion Day celebrated on August 10 aims to raise awareness of the majestic hunter, the ultimate feline and the king of the jungle. According to National Geographic, Africa’s Lions population has decreased by 90 per cent in the past 75 years and attribute this to poaching. "Among the many threats to the shrinking lion population are snares, which poachers use to indiscriminately capture prey," it said. According to a 2009-2014 report by the Kenya Wildlife Service on conservation and management strategy for lions in Kenya, the big cat’s population on the continent has gone down by 30 to 50 per cent. The KWS report estimated that the population of lions in Kenya in 2002 was 2,749 but dropped to 2,280 in 2004. Click here for the latest political news
