It’s exactly one year since the last general election, which
was historic in many ways. It was the first election in which the presidential results
were nullified by the Supreme Court, and the repeat subjected to a second petition.
As the court established, the election was marred with such irregularities and
illegalities as to render the results null and void. Even worse was the repeat sham election that precipitated
widespread protests, with fatal consequences. Not since Independence has the
country been so divided. It moved from bad in the 2008 post-election violence to extreme
with the 2017 cessation threats. At the
centre of the recurrent threat to our nationhood is the management of elections,
which is in tatters. The conduct of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries
Commission has twice pushed this country to the precipice. While credit is
shared by Raila Odinga and Uhuru Kenyatta for the belated display of statesmanship
that has returned the country to normalcy, the drums of war are still reverberating
in the early campaign for the 2022 election. A lot of work needs to be done to secure the country’s future,
end the cycle of electoral disputes and violence, and institutionalise competitive
democracy. Yet nothing is being done in time to fix the IEBC juggernaut
four years to the next election, and with by-elections and boundaries review beckoning. Why are Parliament and the presidency dragging their feet and allowing such waste of public resources?
