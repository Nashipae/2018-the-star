The Saturday night Mwingi accident that killed 10 pupils from St Gabriel’s Primary School died dimmed the dreams of a parent whose child wanted to be a neurosurgeon. The postmortem ended yesterday. Former Mwingi Township MCA Bernard Munyasya yesterday said his daughter Joy Mwangangi wanted to be a doctor. Munyithya Musyoka, a board member of Mwingi West CDF board, said his son Muthui Munyithya wanted to be an engineer. Muthui died alongside his elder sister Kasyoka Munyithya, who wanted to be journalist. Munyasya said, “Joy was a bright  girl. She performed well in school. At the end of last term she scored 436 marks and was top of her class.”
