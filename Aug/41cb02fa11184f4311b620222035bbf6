The government has committed to connect the Lake Turkana Wind Power project to the national grid by the end of this month. Energy CS Charles Keter told the parliamentary Energy committee that construction of the key Loyangalani power line to evacuate electricity from Marsabit to Suswa, a sub-station in Narok, is currently 86 per cent complete and should be ready by end of August. ‘’The 428-kilometre power line linking the 310-megawatt wind power plant to national grid is 86 per cent complete, with the remaining work to be completed within a few days,’’ Keter said. Kenya has up to September 1 to connect the power to its grid, failure to which power users stare at a Sh1 billion monthly penalty to the project’s financiers. The National Treasury allocated Sh5.7 billion in a supplementary budget to be remitted to Lake Turkana Wind Power for last year’s delay, with the fine expected to be recovered this year from consumers through monthly bills. The 310MW wind power project, the biggest of its kind in the continent is funded and built by Danish investors for DKK 4.63 billion (Sh72.2 billion). Keter attributed the delay to challenges that faced Spanish companies, forcing the government to resort to another contractor, who committed to complete the project. In January, the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company (Ketraco) awarded a consortium of Chinese companies a Sh9.6 billion contract to complete the section by August 31 after terminating the Spanish firm’s contract. The Energy Committee led by Nakuru Town East MP David Gikaria was however skeptical on the September 1 deadline. ‘’This is not the first time you are giving promises in this project. Kindly assure this committee that Kenya will not be subjected to further penalties on this project,’’ Gikaria said. Danish wind turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems was ready to launch the project by end of last year but the installation of the transmission line delayed it. Construction of the power line started in November 2015.
