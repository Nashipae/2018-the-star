The Ministry of Education has directed examiners to stop coaching KCSE candidates.  The plan is part of this year’s measures to hide the examiners’ identity. Basic Education PS in a circular released last week said coaching is against Kenya National Examination Council regulations.  The PS said examiners should not use the training, experience and status Knec gives them for financial gain, as it is illegal. “This practice can cause anxiety, cheating and negative publicity for Knec-contracted professionals,” circular says.  Speaking to the Star yesterday, Knec chairperson George Magoha said examiners who violate this law will be punished. “This is one of the updated measures in this year’s KCSE examination. We don’t want to compromise the exam ... cartels are out there and we are closing gaps that might lead to sabotage,” he said.  Magoha further said the commission will vet and train personnel who will handle the exam next month.  The training will involve physical and document security before, during and after the examination.  This year’s exam will involve 1.6 million students in KCSE and KCPE exams, out of which 663,820 will sit the KCSE exam. Kenya Certificate of Primary Education tests will start on October 30. Rehearsals for the three-day examinations will be held on October 29 and the papers will end on November 1. KCSE examinations will be done between November 2 and 28.
