City Hall yesterday pulled down private clinics, pharmacies and laboratories near Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital in Umoja. The county bulldozers brought down more than 30 private medical clinics opposite the hospital. Dr Musa Mohammed, the superintendent of the hospital, had on August 2 written to the county government to withdraw licences of the private facilities around its premises. He argued that they were tarnishing the name of the hospital and disrupting operations.

They accused the county of not notifying them of the demolitions. They said their facilities were licensed by both the Pharmacy and Poisons Board and the county government. “The Pharmacy and Poisons Board inspected our premises before giving us the legal documents. Why is the county doing this? This is unfair,” Caroline Omwaya, who owns Miriara Chemist, said. Records show more than 1,200 patients seek treatment at Mama Lucy hospital daily. But the facility has been grappling with challenges, including shortages of drugs and staff. There have been claims some of the private medical clinics are owned by doctors working at Mama Lucy hospital. They are said to have been channelling drugs to the pharmacies, where they then refer the patients. It is further alleged the doctors refer the patients to the private units for clinical and lab services. The owners of the destroyed clinics denied the claims. They accused the management of failing to restock the hospital. “If a patient goes to the hospital and does not get drugs, where else should he or she go if not in the private facility? We should not be blamed because it not our fault,” another proprietor said. More: Over 4,000 buildings to go in operation to secure Nairobi River Click here for
