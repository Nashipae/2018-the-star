Laikipia launched the county statistical abstract 2018 yesterday at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre. The document provides four-year data on all sectors of the county’s economy. “With this document, I can confidently say that the economy potential of the county will be greatly unlocked,” Governor Nderitu Muriithi said. “It will not only help us in making decisions and policies, but will also help both local and international investors who want to invest in our county.” The document contains a comprehensive set of indicators that are useful for planning, monitoring and evaluation as well as providing information on research. It provides data on agriculture such as the types of crops grown and livestock kept, as well as trading activities. In addition, information on the environment and water availability as well as the mode and means of transport and communication is provided. The data on education includes the number of learning institutions, number of children in school and those out of school. It also provides data on demographics. “You require accurate data in order to make informed policy choices. Whether it is about industrialisation, universal healthcare or  improving agricultural productivity, you need data” Muriithi said. “This is the reason why we have put in effort to have data that will help us in making decisions.” In a speech read by Planning PS Julius Muia, Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich urged all the 47 counties to partner with the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics to generate county-specific statistics to guide their planning and development. The CS said quality statistics that are accurate, reliable, timely and comprehensive will help the counties in developing integrated development plans. “Let’s us partner and create the much-needed synergies to avail comprehensive statistical information that is essential for effective delivery of basic services to all Kenyans,” he said.
