Garissa politicians yesterday condemned an altercation at Fafi Girls Secondary during a parents’ day. Two weeks ago, chaos erupted when MP Abdikarim Osman demanded that the programme be changed to make him the guest of honour. The programme had listed Basic education national director Habert Sheikh as the chief guest. Garissa Township MP Aden Duale said leaders should serve as an example to youth, especially secondary school students. Others who condemned the incident are Sophia Abdinoor (Ijara), Omar Shurie (Balambala), woman representative Annab Gure and Fafi’s Abdikarim Osman. During the incident, police had to shoot in the air to disperse opposing groups of Osman and Sheikh supporters. “Children look up to us as role models. When we resort to fighting and name-calling, we set a bad example,” Duale said. Meanwhile, the National Assembly Majority leader said the national and county governments need to work together to end poverty. Bura MCA Abdullahi Omar said, “Politicians should focus on serving the electorate, not political sideshows.”
