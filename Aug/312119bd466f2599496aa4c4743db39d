At least 2,000 children have dropped out of school due to insecurity caused by bandits and cattle rustling in Baringo. More than 1,200 pupils who initially schooled at Kapng’etio, Rugus, Mukutani and Noosukro primary schools cannot be accounted for after the schools were closed due to insecurity. “The number of school dropouts keep increasing every year, owing to effects of insecurity. There is need of an urgent audit on pupil's attendance,” Knut Baringo branch Chairman Silas Ruto has said. Some 800 pupils are also missing in other schools that operate partially in the volatile areas among them Tuluk, Chepkesin, Barketiew, Ng’aratuko, Kagir, Chemoe, Kosile, Arabal, Ng’elecha, Kapndasum, Kiserian, Chebinyniny, Rugus and Kapkechir. Ruto attributes the rising number of dropouts to pregnancies among teenage girls and early marriages as a result of poverty. “Some of them may be undergoing lifetime trauma after losing their parents to bandit while some have fallen victims of poverty,” he said. However, County Director of Education Willy Machocho refuted claims of alarming incidences in schools saying security has been reclaimed back. “We have resettled and integrated our pupils from the most affected schools like in Kapngegtio and Mukutani to safer learning institutions,” he said assuring that the KCPE candidates shall write their exams peacefully. About 300 pupils are currently camping at a temporary Internally Displaced Persons camp at Eldume in Marigat, Baringo South after surviving Mukutani Full Gospel Church attack in March 2017.
