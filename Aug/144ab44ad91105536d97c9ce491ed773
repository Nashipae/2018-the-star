ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi on Friday reiterated his call to President Uhuru Kenyatta to set up a special commission to unearth the truth about contraband sugar. This comes after National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi's ruling on Thursday stopped the House from debating afresh the rejected sugar report. Muturi declined to have the revised report of the joint committee on Agriculture and Trade reintroduced on the floor of the House for debate. This is despite MPs using millions of shillings for air tickets and sitting allowances during the probe and drafting of the report in Mombasa. "It would seem like the lords of contraband sugar have won over oversight institutions since there is no probe by either by the Directorate of Investigations and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission," Mudavadi said.

Mudavadi said DCI George Kinoti is overwhelmed by the fight against corruption and the “inertia” in the EACC is not helping matters. "It is time President Uhuru listened to the voice of reason and the pleas of leaders from Western Kenya to set up an inquiry," he said. Mudavadi said more than 500,000 Kenyans in the sugar belt regions of Western and Nyanza are being impoverished by sugar cartels. He said cane farmers have been abandoned by the state and especially by ministries that are supposed to protect them. Mudavadi criticised the regulations gazetted by Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri to allow zoning of sugar belt areas in curbing cane poaching. Click here for the latest political news
