One of the developers accused of grabbing Kibarani dumpsite has surrendered the title deed to the National Land Commission. General Tyres gave the document for the parcel number MN/V/1793 measuring 0.4991 ha to the commission during a public inquiry at Kenya School of Government in Mombasa on Thursday. According to records, Halid Ahmed is listed as the owner of the land. While appearing on behalf of the company, Akra Mohamed who handed in the document,Â said they were heeding a government call. "The government wanted its land back we are returning it," he said. The NLC had asked the owners of the land to provide a letter of allotment, receipts of payment of allocation and Part Development Plan. They were also to submit deed plans, title deeds, leases and other documents of ownership. On July 30, President Uhuru Kenyatta had ordered that the title deeds be revoked. He wants the land reverted back to the county government. This followed a meeting he held with Mombasa governor Ali Hassan Joho as well as Cabinet secretaries Najib Balala (Tourism) and Keriako Tobiko (Environment). The President also agreed to Joho's request for a city regeneration intervention modelled on the Nairobi Regeneration Programme. Earlier, National Assembly's Environment committee had visited the dumpsite to probe claims of land grabbing. The MPs had stopped reclamation of the Indian Ocean at areas bordering the dumpsite following the allegations. But Mohamed denied encroaching on the ocean. He said the land was bought from a second party in 2000 and has never been developed. Related: Uhuru asks Swazuri to revoke Kibarani titles, backs Joho's recreation centre project
