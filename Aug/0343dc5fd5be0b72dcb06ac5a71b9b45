Two lorry drivers accused of defiling two Iten schoolgirls denied the charges on Thursday and were released on Sh300,000 bond each. Edwin Korir
and Hillary Mengich, who work for a Chinese road contractor, allegedly touched the
girls inappropriately. They denied the charges before senior principal magistrate Hezron Nyaber, who freed them on bond with two sureties of the same amount. Marakwet
West police arrested the men on Tuesday night after finding them with the girls in a lodging. Kimnai
location chief Francis Kanda said Korir and Mengich disappeared with the minors after completing the day’s work. “I got a
tip-off from residents who saw the men and girls booking rooms. I called
administrative police officers who found them in their rooms,” the chief said. Area police
boss Ibrahim Kosi said the suspects were questioned at Kapsowar police
station before being taken to court today. “This is a
very serious offence so police are conducting thorough investigations," he noted. He told
parents to closely monitor their children during school
holidays to minimise cases of defilement. Meanwhile,
Keiyo North police boss Mwenda Meme has decried rising cases of defilement and
incest. Meme also expressed concern about a low number of convictions and blamed victims and other members of the public, who do not provide evidence. “Most of
these cases end up being thrown out of court because victims prefer out-of-court settlements," he said, adding that some parents relocate with victims, making it difficult for police to find and punish the perpetrators. The case will be mentioned on August 8. Click here for the latest political news
