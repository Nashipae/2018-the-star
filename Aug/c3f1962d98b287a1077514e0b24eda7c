After two days of claims and counterclaims, the 75-year-old Mnangagwa
secured a comfortable victory, polling 2.46 million votes against 2.15
million for 40-year-old opposition leader Nelson Chamisa. The
election, the first since the army’s removal of 94-year-old Mugabe,
passed off relatively smoothly but its aftermath revealed the deep rifts
in Zimbabwean society and the instinctive heavy-handedness of the
security forces. On Wednesday, troops backed by armored vehicles
and a military helicopter were sent in to crush demonstrations by
stone-throwing opposition supporters who said Mnangagwa’s ZANU-PF party
had rigged the elections. Six people were killed as soldiers, some with their faces obscured by camouflage masks, opened fire with automatic weapons. The
following day, soldiers ordered civilians off the streets of the
capital, despite calls from foreign governments and international
organizations for calm and for political leaders to show restraint. Police
then sealed off the headquarters of Chamisa’s Movement for Democratic
Change (MDC) before storming the building and arresting 16 people. The
search warrant said they were looking for unlicensed firearms, grenades
and stones. Coupled with video of soldiers
firing on unarmed demonstrators on Wednesday, the raid does serious
damage to Mnangagwa’s efforts to rehabilitate the image of a country
synonymous with political repression and economic collapse. Wednesday’s violence and the use of soldiers
to control the capital confirms suspicions that the generals who ousted
Mugabe - including army chief-turned vice-president Constantino Chiwenga
- are firmly in charge, analysts said. “Deployment of troops
reveals the uncomfortable truth that, eight months after Mugabe was
ousted, the army remains the pre-eminent political force,” said Piers
Pigou, a Zimbabwe expert at the International Crisis Group think-tank.
