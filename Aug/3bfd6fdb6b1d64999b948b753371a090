Residents of Dandora have again demanded that the county government relocates the Dandora dumpsite. Through their representative, Wilfred Olal, the residents said the relocation was first promised in the early 1990s during the term of Embakasi MP David Mwenje, but it was never done. They spoke on Monday during the official opening of Dandora Community Justice Centre Phase II. The dumpsite, which lies on more than 30 acres, receives  waste from nearby estates such as Kariobangi, Baba Dogo, Marigo and Korogocho. Every day, more than 2,000 metric tonnes of garbage are dumped in Dandora, the Nairobi government says. “We understand that there are some people earning a living from the dumpsite but it has caused a lot of environmental issues. The dumpsite is also partly to blame for the high crime levels in our area. Pollution from the dumpsite has caused skin diseases, abdominal pains and eye infections among children. The governor recently promised to set up a waste recycling plant but no progress has been seen so far,” Olal said. The county government shelved plans to relocate the dumpsite because it cannot find a site. Dandora was , which was declared full 2 yeas ago.
