The alarm clock buzzed at 04h30 as we awoke to a new day! We packed the car and arrived at the gate just after 06h10 on a cool, cloudy morning. The masterplan was to spend the entire day in the park and just enjoy all of creation, from the smallest to the largest creatures. Well, I have to say it was an amazing day, as our plan manifested into a wonderful reality. Some of the roads were a bit rough and rugged due to damage from the intense rains earlier this year, so driving very slowly is required. There were many rewards, four sightings of black-backed jackals totalling nine jackals, some mating lions on the road above the Athi Dam, a family of white rhino near the Langata forest with a baby,  many zebra, eland, coke’s hartebeest, impala, grants gazelles and tommies. Herds of giraffe walked in the road, as well as large herds of buffalo. The bird sightings were numerous, including seven Pied (Eurasian) Avocets in the Athi Dam, and a number of beautiful grey crown crane families and many “LBJs” (little brown jobs) — a name we give to the many small birds that we could not name. As we watched the sunset over the Hyena dam, the tranquil peace was tangible and very real. The Nairobi National Park is a place that is really worth spending some time in. Plan your day ahead, take plenty of water and enough food, camera, binoculars, and note that there are no clean, hygienic toilets in the park. Indeed the day in the park was a real “soul tonic” medicine for the inner being, an escape from the fast-paced world around us.  The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00.
