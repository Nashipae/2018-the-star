She was one of my advisers," he said in an address that he issued before leaving for Kisii county. He visited with politicians including Governor Anyang' Nyong'o, Speaker Onyango Oloo and Seme MP James Nyikal. Raila also spoke on corruption and steps that can be taken for Kenya to be free of the vice. He wants the war on corruption extended to county governments as it must be fought at the national and county levels so public funds are prudently used. The ODM boss reiterated that his handshake with Jubilee Party President Uhuru Kenyatta is anchored on uniting the public and solving injustices including corruption and those brought on by conflict. "We must get rid of corruption in counties to spur development. Those involved in graft must be arrested and charged," he said. Raila insisted on the lifestyle audit, noting that every Kenyan should account for their wealth. "Those who have massive wealth must explain how they acquired it," he said. On the demolition of illegal structures in efforts to reclaim riparian land, Raila said counties should join the exercise.
