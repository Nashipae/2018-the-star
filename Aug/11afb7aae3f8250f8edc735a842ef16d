Kenya Commercial Bank is still the top bank in terms of market share, according to Central Bank of Kenya. According to regulator's 2017 banking sector market share, KCB remains the largest by assets with a market share of 14.4 per cent and total net assets of Sh555,630 billion, followed by Co-operative Bank at 9.93 per cent and total net assets of Sh406,402 billion while Equity Bank comes is third position at 9.85 per cent and a total net asset worth Sh382,830 billion. Fourth in the list is Stanchart at 7.11 per cent, Diamond Trust Bank with 6.72 per cent and Barclays at sixth position with 6.57 per cent. Others are Commercial Bank of Africa with 6.05 per cent, and Stanbic at 5.65 per cent among the top tier lenders. Market share Index is calculated by taking into account bank results across five key performance indicators including total net assets, total deposits, total shareholdersâ€™ funds, total deposit accounts and total loan accounts. Notable changes in this latest report include the rise of Co-operative Bank to second position, displacing Equity to third position as well as Barclays' drop from fourth place two years ago to sixth in 2017. It is unclear whether the loss of market share by Barclays has any connection with possible market jitters surrounding the change in ownership and rebranding currently underway. Stanchart and DTB have retained their ranking at fourth and fifth respectively.
