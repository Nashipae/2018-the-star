Former K24 news anchor Ian Wafula is among the journalists who have switched station, moving to British Broadcasting Corporation. However, he recently confessed that his move was not easy because he was rejected four times by BBC before they picked him. “New
chapter. Looking forward to starting soon at the BBC as Broadcast
Journalist, News Review. I’d like to call it my new home but it’s bigger
than that, the next step in my career. I’ve seen God’s manifestation in
this process having been rejected 4 times after endless tests and
grueling interviews. What’s yours is yours, at the right time,” Wafula said on social media. He gave special thanks to Larry Madowo. “The three challenging words 'You deserve better' took me off my comfort zone to yearn for great."
