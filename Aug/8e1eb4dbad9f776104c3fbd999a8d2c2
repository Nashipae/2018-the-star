In a case of a hunter becoming the hunted, Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu yesterday found herself in a familiar territory but in a different capacity. She sat calmly in the dock when her name was called out. Mwilu and her co accused — lawyer Stanley Muluvi — did not plead to the charges as it was past the gazetted court hours. She was arraigned a few minutes after 5pm. Instead, she was released by Anti-Corruption Court magistrate Lawrence Mugambi on personal bond, meaning that she was only required to sign documents for her release and giving an undertaking that she will not skip court. Mwilu and Munuvi face 13 charges relating to cash allegedly received from Imperial Bank, which is now under receivership. They will take a plea today. Orengo said the defence team will raise constitutional issues concerning the charge before Mwilu takes a plea. He said the charges cannot stand. Although she has been used to people bowing before her, giving her way to pass and being addressed as “your lordship”, it was her turn to reciprocate to a judicial officer of a lower rank. Mwilu at one time broke into laughter as she chatted with her lawyers who sandwiched. Her bodyguards watched from a distance, a clear contrast to what they would do on a normal day. The  DCJ was represented by more than 16 lawyers, including James Orengo, Okong’o Omogeni, John Khaminwa, Nelson Havi, Harun Ndubi, Dan Maanzo, Julie Soweto, Jackson Awele, Edward Waswa, Josephine Mugure, Caroline Kamau, Peter Kaluma, Milly Odhiambo, Antony Oluoch and Mutula Kilonzo Jr. Dorcas Oduor will lead a team of senior prosecutors, including Emily Kamau, Christine Gakobu and Duncan Ondimu.
