The government has apologised to residents of Nguluku and Maumba who were relocated to create space for mining in Kwale. Mining PS John Omenge also apologised to squatters who previously occupied Bwiti for failure to honour the relocation agreement. Those relocated were to be given 5.5. Omenge said they were resolving the matter. Principal Secretary Mining John Omenge also appologized to squatters who previously occupied Bwiti for failing to honor the relocation agreement to the letter. Omenge noted that in the agreement relocated persons and the squatters were to get 5.5 acres each but that did not happen and they are working to resolve that. “We came here to resolve the problem because residents of other areas have said they won't be relocated if they will be faced by similar challenges," Omenge said. Those relocated to Bwiti from Nguluku and Maumba areas have been given tittle deeds for their plots but the squatters were left out. The decision has caused conflict between the squatters and the new settlers. "The squatters are bitter for being left out of the land allocation. The conflict is worse only that it has not exploded into war,” Fatuma Mwakinyizi said. Some said they were relocated top swampy places. “The land is not suitable for constructing houses,” Gideon Masyuki said. Omenge said they were setting up a committee to resolve the issues. The committee will include local administrator, leaders and residents’ representatives.
