Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa has appointed a seven-member commission of inquiry into deadly post-election protests. Two days after the vote, six people were killed when the military opened fire on protesting MDC Alliance supporters, who alleged that party leader Nelson Chamisa had been robbed of victory. Ruling on an official opposition challenge to the result, the constitutional court said it had found no evidence of fraud and confirmed that Mr Mnangagwa was winner of the 30 July election. The commission will be led by former South African President Kgalema Motlanthe and he will be assisted by national experts, a UK lawyer and a former Commonwealth secretary-general. It has three months to look into the motives behind the 1 August protests, the role of the military and its use of deadly force. The military’s actions damaged President Mnangagwa’s international standing and he hopes the independent inquiry will prove his commitment to the rule of law. Click here for the latest political news
