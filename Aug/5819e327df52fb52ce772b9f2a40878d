Musalia Mudavadi has a chance of becoming President in 2022. However, his chances are anchored in how successfully he mobilises the Luyha nation behind him. Musalia must manage to brand himself and come out as the undisputed leader of the Luyha. If he fails to do that, then it becomes very difficult because Kenyan politics is hinged on community support. After galivanising the community behind himself, then Musalia can go out and seek votes from other communities. So he has to vanquish other leaders from the Luyha nation who have declared interest in the presidency. I don’t know why Musalia is going round in circles. There are not many Luhyas who will vie for the presidency. Only Musalia, Moses Wetang’ula and Wycliffe Oparanya have declared their interest. Musalia needs to vanquish them and emerge as the undisputed leader of the Luyha nation. Then he can see which other communities to negotiate with so that they can work it out and get the numbers. If Raila runs for President, it will be very difficult for Musalia because there are so many people who still believe in the former Prime Minister. If they both run, Raila will get some Luhya votes, he might not get the numbers he got last time, but he will manage a good number. If they both share those numbers, it will be very difficult for either of them to clinch the presidency.That bloc has been voting for the opposition. With Raila running, Musalia will get some votes and possibly Deputy President William Ruto will also pick some votes. That way, Musalia’s chances will be very slim. Musalia needs to forget that people will pick him as a compromise candidate. That he definitely needs to forget. You can only become a compromise candidate when you have a solid bloc behind you. Mwai Kibaki became a compromise candidate in 2002 after his competitors realised he was the strongest candidate with a strong bloc behind him. The political analyst spoke to the Star
