Police doctor Zephaniah Kamau yesterday told a Nairobi court that a dentist accused of killing her husband 13 years ago was of sound mind and fit to stand trial. Medic Nisha Sapra was charged with manslaughter. She denied killing her husband Yogesh Mohan. Kamau examined Sapra in September 2005. He said she, then 47, was of sound mind with no mental history. Kamau testified before chief magistrate Roseline Onganyo. He presented Sapra’s mental assessment report as an exhibit. Kamau told state prosecutor Edwin Okello that blood samples from the medic had been taken elsewhere for examination. Pathologist Jane Wasike said the autopsy indicated Yogesh had a wound in the abdomen.  She said he died from organ failure and blood infection caused by penetrating abdominal wound. “I examined the abdominal wound. It was measuring seven by eight centimetres,” Wasike said. She said upon opening the body, she found there were large amount of fluid in the lungs and purse in the liver. She also noticed abnormities in the intestines. During cross-examination by defence lawyer Kioko Kilukumi, Wasike said the infection could have been caused by other causes not necessarily the abdominal wound. She said she formed the opinion from medical notes she got at Nairobi Hospital where Yogesh had been admitted. Sapra is out on bond. She had earlier been charged with murder and the offence reduced after she petitioned the High Court.
