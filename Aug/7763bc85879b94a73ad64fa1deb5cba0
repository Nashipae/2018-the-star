Police and local divers are searching for a body of a woman who was allegedly killed by a crocodile in Lake Victoria on Thursday. Regina Akinyi, 36, was attacked while taking bath at Dunga beach, near Kiboko bay at 8 pm. She left the house with her elder daughter to shower before she was killed. On reaching the Lake, her 16-year-old daughter rushed back to get a towel. On her way back, she heard her mother screaming for help and suddenly she disappeared. The girl alerted her father, Evans Odhiambo who was taking care of their two-month-old baby. “I had taken the baby to bed and was waiting for them to come back so that we have supper," Odhiambo said. He rushed and plunged into the lake, searched for his wife in vain. Odhiambo only found a basin floating on the waters barely two meters from the shore. Underneath, he found one of the sandals his wife was wearing. He called for help from his employer Shabbir Gohar who alerted Railways and Maritime police. But little could be done as it was raining given the thick clouds that hampered visibility. Odhiambo said,” his wife was not epileptic, has no blood pressure neither did she exhibit any signs of illness. We exchanged pleasantries before she excused herself to take a bath.” “My wife was a good swimmer and it is shocking how she could even drown on less than a metre deep shore,” he added. Kisumu OCPD Meshack Kiptum said the body has not been found. He said a joint search mission for the body has been launched. On Wednesday, another man was killed by a hippo at Usoma beach in Kisumu West while on a fishing expedition. He had stayed in the hospital for six months after attacked by a crocodile last year while fishing. Click here for the latest political news
