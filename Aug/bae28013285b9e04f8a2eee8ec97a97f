Kenyans were woken up with prayers in the wee hours of Tuesday as Muslims celebrated Eid Al Adha. Eid is an Arabic word that means feast or festival, and Adha means sacrifice. Muslims celebrate Eid ul-Adha to reflect on Prophet Abraham’s unwavering obedience when he was asked to sacrifice his son. The prayers which began at around 6 am were heard in many neighbourhoods as Muslims celebrated the feast of slaughtering. The animals, goats and cows, to be slaughtered have to be healthy. In Mombasa, the faithful gathered at the Tononoka Grounds for the celebrations. Adorned in kanzus, they flocked to various mosques and open grounds for prayers. Several leaders among them Raila Odinga and Kenyans alike wished the muslims a blessed day. "On this #EidAlAdha I would like to wish all our Muslim Brothers and Sisters #EidMubarak May you be blessed today and always," Raila said. Kenya Defence Forces said "‏ On this holy occasion of #EidAlAdha, may the blessings of Allah fill your lives with happiness and open all doors of success now and always. Eid Mubarak!" "I would like to wish all my Muslim friends a very happy and peaceful #EidAlAdha ! Let it be an opportunity to show compassion towards the poor and the most vulnerable in our society. May the blessings of The Almighty be with you always. #EidMubarak to you all," Chris Kirubi said. On Monday, President Uhuru Kenyatta sent his holiday greetings to the Muslim brothers and sisters. "As Muslim faithful across the nation embark on the solemn festivities, I congratulate each one of them on behalf of the people of Kenya and wish all Eid Mubarak. May Allah accept your sacrifices," he said. More on this: [Statement] Uhuru: I wish you all happy Eid-ul-Adha celebrations
