Africa 10, 000m champion Alice Aprot will be seeking to launch a successful title defence at the 2018 Africa Senior Athletics Championships in Asaba, Nigeria this evening. Aprot, who is also a two-time African Games champion, will be joined by Stacy Ndiwa and another experienced runner, Pauline Korikwiang, a former world junior cross country champion. Korikwiang observed that they are ready for the task ahead. “We have recovered well following our challenges upon arriving here,” she said.“We trained well back at home and while here and we hope to perform well and make Kenya proud.” “Our quest here is to win medals and I am certain we will conquer if we work as a team,” said Korikwiang. Despite having been in the sport for 15 years, she said she feels in good shape. “I think my career is just starting,” she joked. Aprot chose to play it easy saying: “Let’s talk after the race.” Meanwhile, a host of other top Kenyan stars will be in action today, with triple jumper Isaac Kirwa and hammer thrower Dominic Abunda chase for continental glory in their straight final events this afternoon. Before then, Mike Mokamba, Peter Mwai, Millicent Ndoro and Hellen Syombua will bend on the blocks in the hunt for semi final slots in their respective 200m heats. Africa 400m silver medallist Maureen Jelagat and 2016 finalist Jane Chege also have the tricky task of going through a competitive 400m hurdles qualifying round. Jelagat said her immediate target is to reach the final of her specialty. “I want to first reach the final, which will put me in a good place to upgrade on my silver medal from Durban two years ago,” said Jelagat. In addition, former world champion Eunice Sum, experienced Emily Cheritich and Olympic bronze medal holder Margaret Nyairera will take the track in the qualifying rounds of the 800m.
