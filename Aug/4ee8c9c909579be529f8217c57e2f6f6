The Kenyan film industry has lost a great man. Charlie Simpson, who was the founder of Film Studios Kenya, passed away this month. Film Studios has been involved in hundreds of films, which won 11 Academy Awards. British philanthropist Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, wrote a tribute, saying: “He’d just want us to rejoice in laughter at his magnificent life and the delightful children and grandchildren that he has left in this world. ‘Don’t run out of birthdays,’ he’d tell us with a twinkle in his eye.” Charlie led the most extraordinary of lives, which took him from Glasgow to Kenya, where he worked on films like the romantic epic Out Of Africa. “He fell in love with the country and its people, choosing to bring his family up there. I’ve been lucky enough to spend time with Uncle Charlie in Kenya, and we have had a memorable time exploring the countryside.” Richard added, “As a great-grandfather himself, Uncle Charlie has given me lots of advice since I became a proud grand-dude. Uncle Charlie knew and taught us the value of storytelling, of connecting with other people and the world around us.”
