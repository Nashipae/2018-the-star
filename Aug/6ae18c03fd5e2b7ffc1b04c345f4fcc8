Hundreds of Mbeere South residents have demonstrated against KenGen, demanding piped water from the seven hydropower generating dams. The residents of Mavuria and Kiambere wards were led by MCAs Ngari Mbaka and Masters Mwaniki. They blocked the Kiambere-Kivaa road on Monday, prompting police to intervene. The residents marched to the Gitaru power station offices, where the administration of the dams is based. But the firm management did not respond to them. "For the last 40 years the seven forks hydropower generating dams and stations have been in existence, many residents have been killed by crocodiles while fetching water from the dams for lack of clean drinking water," a resident said. The residents said many others have been scarred by the crocodiles. They said the company supplies its staff with piped water from the dams and wondered why it could not do the same for neighbouring residents. The residents said they were not compensated for the land they gave up for the dams. Mwaniki, who is also the Embu county assembly minority leader, said residents will not stop protesting until they are assured that they too will be provided with piped water. Mbaka said residents feel neglected. He said a school that is some distance from the dams doesnâ€™t have piped water.
