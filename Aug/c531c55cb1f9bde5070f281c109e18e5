The Court of Appeal has dismissed the appeal filed by Ugenya MP Chris Karan following the annulment of his election by the High court. Justice Hannah Okwengu said Karan's election was validly nullified in the petition by former MP David Ochieng. The court said the campaigns in Ugenya were perverted hence the exercise was not free and fair. The High court had also ruled that Karan's campaign was "perverted" and that the August 2017 vote in Ugenya was "compromised". Karan suffered a double blow as the judge ordered him and other respondents to pay Sh7 million in cost. The verdict followed Ochiengâ€™s argument that his campaign was hampered after he was accused of having a hand in IEBC ICT manager Chris Msando's murder.
