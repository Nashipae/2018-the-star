In an exclusive interview with the Star, Kavemba said the county is focusing more on improving the non-motorised transport. "A lot has been done for motorists, we want to also ensure that pedestrians and cyclists are given attention. The number of road fatalities involving pedestrians is alarming," he said. He also said the county will carry out more awareness campaigns to educate residents on safe road usage. "It is unfortunate that many of these deaths occur when people are crossing the road. We have zebra crossings and footbridges. That is why we would encourage people to use these designated areas to avoid being knocked down," Kavemba said. Kavemba said Governor Mike Sonko is determined to ensure that the county records the least road fatalities. "We will do campaigns to educate people on the dangers of drink driving, using mobile phones while driving and other common human errors," he said.
