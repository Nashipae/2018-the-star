Freedom fighters across the country could soon heave a sigh of relief following plans by the Dedan Kimathi Foundation to allocate them land. More than 8,000 freedom fighters are to benefit from a land settlement programme at Rimuruti in Laikipia county. The programme is being spearheaded by Mau Mau fighter Dedan Kimathi’s last-born daughter Wanjugu Kimathi. Wanjugu said she has identified 40,000 acres on which the freedom fighters will be settled. The land is worth Sh2.1 billion. The foundation will implement the project in phases as it raises the amount. In the first phase, about 3,000 war veterans will be settlled on 12,000 acres in a few months’ time. Beneficiaries will register with Sh5,000 to go towards purchase of the land.
