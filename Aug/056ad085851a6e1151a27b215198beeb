More than 16,000 tablets distributed to primary schools under the Digital Learning Programme have been stolen since the initiative started. ICT Principal Secretary Jerome Ochieng on Friday said the government distributed 900,000 tablets to 19,000 schools in the first phase of the programme and 2,000 schools will benefit in the next two months. More than 10,000 teachers have been trained to handle the programme. Ochieng said they are working with school administrators, parents and other agencies to ensure the devices are safe. The entire project will cost Sh11 billion. “We’ve asked the schools to work with the regional administration and parents to ensure that the laptops are safe because they are for the benefit of our children,” Ochieng said in Eldoret. The Parliamentary Committee on ICT visited the assembly plant at Moi University-owned Rivatex. The other plant is at JKUAT. Each assembles 1,000 devices per day. MPs present included Mark Nyamita (Uriri) and Silvanus Maritim (Ainamoi). The PS said phase two will entail putting up digital resource centres in each school so the devices are used by all pupils. The tablets were distributed to children in lower classes. More than 1.2 million devices will be given to the resource centres, each getting 50 devices. More than 5,000 schools already have the centres but are yet to be equipped. The government will expand the project.
