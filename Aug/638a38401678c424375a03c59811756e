Women Representatives cannot account for Sh4 billion allocated for projects across the 47 counties. Auditor General Edward Ouko in his 2017 report said he cannot ascertain Sh4, 103,958,103 disbursed to the county committees. “Even though there were board minutes to support approval of transfer of funds to the county committees detailing the amounts and the period, the basis of approvals were not provided for verification,” he said. “Records of the county committees’ bank accounts were not provided for examination. Consequently, it has been impossible to ascertain compliance with the Fund’s regulations, receipt of funds and validity of payments.” Ouko raised the alarm over the use of a Sh123 million emergency reserve of the national government Affirmative Action Fund. The Auditor General said the money which should cater for emergencies could not be accounted for. The regulations state a two per cent of the fund sum should be un-collected to cater for unforeseen problems.

The Affirmative Fund is meant to address the plight of vulnerable groups by reducing poverty through socioeconomic empowerment among women, youths, the elderly and persons with disability.
