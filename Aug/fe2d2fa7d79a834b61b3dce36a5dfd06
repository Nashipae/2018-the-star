A section of Muslims in Kwale have called for the removal of Chief Kadhi Ahmed Muhdhar following his conflicting announcement of Eid Ul Adha dates. Muhdhar had announced that Eid-Ul-Adha will be celebrated on August 22, but the Interior CS Fred Matiang'i announced it to be today, August 21. They said today is the day to mark the celebrations following yesterday’s Arafah which is the 9th day of Dhu al-Hijjah Pilgrimage. The faithful accused the Chief Kadii of wanting to divide them. “His is a constitutional office and if he cannot do what he is expected to do as a Muslim then he must be removed,” said Sheikh Hamisi Mwachirimu. Mwachirumu added that the Chief Kadhi is not supposed to rush in announcing dates but should learn to consult other Kadhis before giving out any date. Earlier on, Majority leader Aden Duale said he will move to JSC to take action on Chief Kadhi Ahmed Muhdhar. Duale asked Islamic scholars, Imam’s, Namlef, Supkem and Majlis Ulama to convene a meeting to discuss the "misconduct and culture of dividing" Muslims. "We don’t hear or see him in the development of Islam in Kenya, Islamic functions. We only see him when he wants to divide the Muslim community,” he said. Another faithful Hassan Mzinga said it is not the first time Muhdhar is bringing confusion around the date on Eid Ul Adha. “You are not above the law, you are a Muslim like any other and you ought to follow the law the same way we are following,” he said. A section of Muslims have celebrated Eid-ul-Adha today while others who follows Chief Kadhi's announcement, wait until tomorrow.
