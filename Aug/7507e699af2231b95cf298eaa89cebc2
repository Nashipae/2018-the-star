The trial of former Youth PS Lillian Omollo and former NYS Director General Richard Ndubai will take place from January 7 to 31 next year. The dates were agreed upon during an inter-parties hearing before principal magistrate Peter Ooko on Wednesday. Omollo was sacked in July in a mini-reshuffle by President Uhuru Kenyatta and replaced with Francis Otieno. She came to the limelight early this year when she and 48 others were implicated in yet another National Youth Service scam. Omollo rubbished claims that NYS lost Sh9 billion, saying that she and Ndubai revolutionised the service and sealed all loopholes for misappropriation of funds. A loss of Sh9 billion would mean NYS was technically and operationally closed for the two financial years, she said. All the suspects will face the trial next year. They have all denied charges of conspiring to defraud the agency.
