Murang’a women MPs yesterday appealed to Governor Mwangi wa Iria to resolve water issues. The legislators castigated this week’s confrontation between the county government and Murang’a Water and Sanitation Company, leading to disconnection of water to Murang’a town. Kandara MP Alice Wahome, woman rep Sabina Chege, Maragua MP Mary Waithera and her Kigumo counterpart Ruth Mwaniki said the fights have tainted the image of the county and appealed for constructive talks between the two parties. They spoke at Kigumo Bendera. “Let the two sit down and decide who is supposed to be providing water to residents,” Chege said.
