Traffic congestion has worsened in Nyeri town since Monday when the National Music Festival began. Heavy snarl-ups have been experienced in the morning and evening when participants head to the venue at the Dedan Kimathi University from their hotels and places of residence and upon return. The jam has forced school buses to remain on the roads past the recommended time of 6pm. Residents, who are not used to traffic jams, have been urged to be patient as the 92nd Kenya National Music Festival continues. The event will last for a week. “I know we will cause some inconveniences especially traffic jams. We appeal to residents to bear with us,” festival chairman Peter Wanjohi said. Wanjohi spoke to reporters at the venue yesterday. He attributed the jam to the mandatory security checks conducted on those accessing the venue. “I think it is necessary because we want to ensure the venue remains safe,” Wanjohi said. About 120,000 people are estimated to be attending the event. Students are being hosted in 37 villages located at a radius of 20km from the venue.
