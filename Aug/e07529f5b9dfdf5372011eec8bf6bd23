KWS rangers and locals have freed an elephant which had been stuck at the Kiboko campsite in Chyulu Hills for three days. Kenya Wildlife Services said in a tweet on Wednesday that the operation, although difficult due to marsh, was a complete success. It said the animal was rendered weak from exhaustion and was at first unable to stand up on his own. The wildlife agency noted that through supportive treatment, including intravenous fluids, the adult elephant is now well and on his way to the bush.

Last year, three elephant calves got stuck in mud at the drying Lake Kamnarok in Baringo county where they went to drink water amid the drought. They were among more than 700 elephants that came from Rimoi Game Reserve across the neighbouring Elgeyo Marakwet county.
