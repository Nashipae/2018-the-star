Former NGO board Chairman Fazul Mahamed has been appointed the director general of Private Security Regulatory Authority. Fazul resigned as NGOs Coordination Board boss after a troublesome tenure that saw him termed 'controversial, defiant and adamant'. More on this: Fazul Mahamed resigns as NGOs Coordination Board CEO Eric Okeyo, vice chair of the regulatory authority board, told the Star on the phone on Monday that Fazul reported to work on July 2, 2018. "Yes, we recruited him after he applied. The process was competitive," Okeyo said. He said the authority is planning a retreat with the directorate of the personnel management where the organisation structure will be discussed. "Fazul is the only employee at the moment," he said. Okeyo said that during the retreat, they will explore the possibility of hiring more employees to the regulatory body. Fazul is responsible to the authority's board for the overall leadership of the organisation and oversees the day-to-day running of the organisation. He is also responsible for planning, coordinating and implementing the Board decisions and other statutory functions. During his tenure at the NGOs Board, Fazul ordered the shutdown of many organisations in the country, mostly on the premise of illegal operations. His crackdown on NGOs, especially during the elections season, granted him a fair share of name-calling by activists, the Opposition and some government officials. More on this: Term of pure joy?
