Nyeri’s 27 coffee cooperative societies will be audited this week in efforts to revive the ailing sector. The audit will focus on membership and production. The National Task Force on Coffee Sub-sector Reform recommended a pilot project be launched. Nyeri is one of the selected counties. The national government will team up with the county to provide farm inputs. On Saturday, Governor Mutahi Kahiga (pictured) said they recently met President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House, Nairobi, to discuss coffee farming. Those who attended are Deputy Governor Caroline Karugu, MPs Kanini Kega (Kieni, Gichuki Mugambi (Othaya), Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira), James Gichuhi (Tetu), Ngunjiri Wambugu (Nyeri Town) and Athony Kiai (Mukurwe-ini), Woman Representative Rahab Mukami and Senator Ephraim Maina. “Senior cooperative officials from Nairobi will visit the county. Together with local cooperative officials, they’ll audit all our 27 coffee cooperative societies,” Kahia said at St Peter’s ACK, Nyeri town. He attended an event organised by the Nyeri Central Boda Boda Welfare Association to mark its first anniversary. He said boda boda riders play a vital role in transporting coffee from the farm to the factories. Starting next week, the county will give contracts for murraming 320km roads so riders can move easily, he said. Click here for the latest political news
