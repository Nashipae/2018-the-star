Accountants want the county and national governments to involve citizens in decision making. They said the unsuccessful plan by the national government to increase VAT on petroleum products showed the government’s failure to involve wananchi in its decisions. Mbaya said the national government appeared to have listened only to the International Monetary Fund to increase VAT on petroleum products instead of seeking the views of wananchi. CPA Mike Mbaya said only public participation can help Kenya achieve Vision 2030. ‘’There is need by the county and national governments to have citizens fit within Vision 2030 to get Kenya into middle or higher income country. This can only bear fruits if citizens are involved in budget making process,’’ he said. He spoke during a public finance management workshop in Busia Town on Thursday, organised by the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya. ICPAK public policy and research officer Hillary Onami said the attainment of the ‘’Big Four’’ Agenda would also be achieved through the involvement of all citizens. He  said the institute will help President Uhuru Kenyatta in meeting the ‘’ Big Four’’  agenda both at national and family levels through participatory budgetin. Onami said there was need to develop capacity of citizens to expedite the realisation of the Big Four.
