The government has declared Tuesday, August 21 as a public holiday for the Idd-ul-Adha celebrations. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i, in a gazette notice, said: "It is notified for the general information of the public that Tuesday, August 21 be a public holiday to mark Idd-ul-Adha, 2018." He invoked section 3 of the Public Holidays Act. The holiday is an Islamic festival to commemorate the willingness of Ibrahim (also known as Abraham) to follow Allah's (God's) command to sacrifice his son. Muslims around the world observe the event, which is a four-day Islamic festival starting on the 10th day of the month of Dhul Hijja. In the Kenyan context, Idd-ul-Adha will begin in the evening of Tuesday, 21 August and end in the evening of Wednesday, August 22. It is the second of the two major Muslim celebrations after Idd-ul-Fitr which took place in May and June. Idd-ul-Fitr is celebrated to mark the end of the holy month ofÂ  Ramadhan.
