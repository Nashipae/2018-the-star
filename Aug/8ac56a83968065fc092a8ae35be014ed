The Judiciary will set the pace in the war against corruption by dealing expeditiously with cases, Chief Justice David Maraga has said. "Corruption cases will not be dragged or adjourned. Culprits must carry their cross irrespective of their status in society," he said. The CJ spoke on Thursday during the official opening of the LSK Annual Conference at Leisure Lodge in Kwale County. Maraga said judges will be flown to other counties to hear cases. He reiterated that those found guilty will not escape punishment. The CJ said corruption cases found to have a basis will be pursued vigorously and lawyers should read the mood when handling such matters. Maraga told civil society groups to keep challenging Acts violating the Constitution for the betterment of the country. At the same time, he asked the National Assembly to increase the allocation to the Judiciary. "Let Parliament realise that the Judiciary offers critical services and should be facilitated to do its work," he said. Maraga said Sh5 billion is needed to build at least 10 courtrooms in all the 47 counties. "Budget allocation to the judiciary is minimal and it hampers courts' operation. With the money we can improve the situation by building washrooms in the courts," he said.
