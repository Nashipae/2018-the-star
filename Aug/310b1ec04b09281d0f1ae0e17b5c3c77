Former 400m hurdles world champion Nicholas Bett who died in a road accident last week will be buried tomorrow at his Simat home in Lemook village, Uasin Gishu. Bett's body will leave Moi teaching and referral hospital Mortuary today. The burial ceremony was earlier set for Friday but was pushed back after Government officials including National Police Service made a request. Deputy President William Ruto is expected to lead the government delegation at the burial. The 26-year-old died in a road crash along Sochoi-Lessos Road last week just a day after returning from the continental championships in Nigeria. Bett made history in China by becoming the first Kenyan to win a gold medal in a short distance race at the world stage. He won the 400m hurdles finals at the 15th IAAF World Championships in Beijing in 47.79 world leading time, beating Russiaâ€™s Dennis Kudryavsten in 2015. Click here for the latest political news
