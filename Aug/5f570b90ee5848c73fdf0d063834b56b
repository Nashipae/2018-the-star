A woman in Kisumu has been sentenced to eight years in jail for causing grievous harm on her husband's private parts. Erica Iminza Shihenda, 23, skinned John Kisuvana Tsumala’s private part using a sharp knife while he was asleep at their home in Huruma estate in Eldoret town on the night of May 22. Eldoret Chief Magistrate Charles Obulutsa said he was satisfied with the evidence presented by the prosecution. The court heard that the complainant was awakened at 2 am by excruciating pain from his private part which was partially skinned by the sharp knife. He was saved by doctors who carried out an operation to restore the private parts at the Moi Referral Hospital. Kisuvana said the incident happened as he slept after a domestic quarrel and he had tried to sort out the matter out of court in vain. He welcomed the verdict. Iminza has 14 days to appeal. “It was difficult to sort the matter out of court and the law has taken its course. I'm happy for the court decision it will become a lesson to other women in our country who subject men to torture in their homes," he said. Obulutsa said the prosecution had proved its case and that evidence indicated that the mother of two committed the offence against her husband. Separately, four family members have been arrested in connection with a AK 47 rifle and 86 rounds of ammunition found at their home near Kesses in Uasin Gishu County. They include a couple, their son and his wife. Eldoret South OCPD Wilson Abuduba said the son, identified as Joseph Kiptoo Shikutwa is a wanted criminal in the region.
