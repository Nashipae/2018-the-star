Counties should use mobile clinics and ambulances for intended purposes only, the Health ministry said on Tuesday when 10 vehicles and equipment were donated by a Korean agency. Principal Secretary Peter Tum said the ministry will work with all counties to ensure the vehicles are well maintained and equipped with drugs and personnel. He spoke at the ministry's Nairobi headquarters during the handover of the vehicles from the Korean International Cooperation Agency. Korean Ambassador to Kenya Young Dae Kwon handed over seven mobile clinics, three ambulances and 20 motorcycles for use in Kajiado. "The partnership between Kenya and the Korean government has been in existence for a long time now," he noted. He cited a maternal and child health outreach project that arose in 2016, from the partnership, to improve access to services and increase awareness. The project being implemented by Kajiado will come to a close on December 31 this year.
