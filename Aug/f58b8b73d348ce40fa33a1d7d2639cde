Rampant cases of extra-judicial killings, forced disappearances, unresolved high-profile murders came to haunt President Uhuru Kenyatta’s nominee to the Malaysian diplomatic mission yesterday. The former DCI boss Ndegwa Muhoro was taken to task over accusations that he was involved in land fraud and sacking of highly trained officers during his tenure. Also standing in his way was a memorandum of objection from lawyer Ahmednassir Abdullahi who said he is unfit to hold public office. He denied the accusations. Muhoro said his net worth is Sh88 million, to the surprise of members of the National Assembly Defence  and Foreign Relations committee. "Everything rises and falls on leadership. You were at the DCI for eight years. You’re here today giving us promises on what should be done. Why didn’t you do what you’re telling us when you were at the DCI? Cases of economic crimes haven’t been resolved. We still don’t know what happened with George Muchai, Jacob Juma and Chris Msando. You’ve been implicated in Mbiu Koinange and Jane Wanjiru land issues,"  South Mugirango MP Sylvanus Osoro said. Yatta’s Charles Kilonzo asked, "You have been accused of many things. You start off with a huge baggage that will affect your work. Couldn’t it have been better to clear those issues, including the ones in court, before you take up a new assignment?" Muhoro said the accusations are a hearsay, baseless as no one has provided concrete evidence.
