Four people died instantly while several were injured in an accident at Sobea along the Nakuru-Eldoret highway on Friday. Rongai police boss Japhet Kioko said the 4am accident involved a 14-seater matatu which was heading to Nakuru and a truck. The matatu rammed the truck which was parked off the highway after it developed a mechanical problem. Kioko said two men and women were killed on the spot after the speeding matatu crashed on the stationary trailer. "A number of survivors were rushed to Nakuru Level Five Hospital for treatment," he said. The Nakuru-Eldoret highway is notorious for reports of fatal accidents, mostly attributed to careless driving.
