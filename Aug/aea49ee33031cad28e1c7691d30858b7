An illegal secondary boys school with 66 students and one toilet has been closed. The private school was housed on the fifth floor of a residential building in Malindi town. All students shared one toilet. Malindi subcounty director of education Veronica Kalungu and cops led by area police boss Stephen Wachia raided the Tawheed Boys High School yesterday. All the students were ordered to go home as the institution was not registered. “Residents had complained about the school and threatened to close it down if action is not taken,’’ Kalungu said. She said the school administration also broke the  law because it lacked operating documents. Kalungu said the school offered both day and boarding facilities for students from Kilifi and other counties. The boarding students were housed in the fifth floor of a building with grilled windows and one toilet. Some of the students came from as far as Nairobi, Mombasa and Lamu. She asked how parents followed the progress of their their children’s learning in an unregistered school. Kalungu said residents could not bear the school and sought intervention from the Ministry of Education. The school was also expensive as parents paid Sh93,000 per year for boarders ,while day scholars paid Sh45,000. Kalungu said the school had 25 KCSE  exam candidates but suspects they were registered in another school. “The students are being taught by teachers who have no TSC numbers, this is a total disgrace. I pity the students and their parents,” she said. Kalungu warned parents taking their children to private academies to be cautious and always check the history of such schools.
