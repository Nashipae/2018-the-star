Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko on Thursday repossessed a grabbed public land in Highridge estate, Westlands. The land, which was previously earmarked for construction of Highridge county dispensary, was grabbed several years ago and sold to unsuspecting buyer. Sonko warned that he will not relent in the war against land grabbing saying those culpable should surrender the parcels back or risk being forcefully evicted. "As promised, we will not spare anyone in this campaign aimed at restoring to the public what belongs to them," Sonko said. The governor has assigned a team of county officers to inspect all cases of land grabbing.

"I want to assure you that the governor is fully committed in implementing his manifesto as promised to Nairobians," he told reporters at the site. "One of the major promises by the governor was reclaiming grabbed public land and I can state here that this is just the start of the initiative," Kariuki said. He was accompanied with acting Nairobi Health executive Veska Kangogo, Health chief officer Mahat Jimale, County Attorney Lydia Kwamboka, among others. Kangogo promised that the county government will put up a fully equipped health centre at the repossessed land. She further added that the county government will construct an Early Childhood Centre (ECD) at the same site. Parklands/Highridge MCA Jayendra Malde, who was also present during the event, welcomed the move. The team also toured North Ridge Primary School in Parklands where a private developer is said to have grabbed part of the schoolâ€™s land. They promised further investigations on the case before action is taken to reclaim the school land.
