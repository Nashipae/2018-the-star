The Law Society of Kenya is up in arms over a message in a billboard erected by the Federation of Kenya Employers CEO Jacqueline Mugo. In a letter, LSK CEO Mercy Wambua said the move by FKE to list legal services among those outlined in the billboard is in violation of the Advocates Act. Wambua wants 'legal services' expunged from the list on the billboard erected at the roundabout of Silver Springs Hotel next to Doctors Plaza. "It has come to our attention via a billboard you have caused to be erected on the roundabout of silver spring hotel next to the doctors' plaza Nairobi hospital on an iron in county that purports to be a person qualified to provide legal services in Kenya contrary to Section 9 as read together with Section 33 of the Advocates Act," Wambua said. Other services offered by the federation are industrial relations, research, and advocacy, training, management consultancy, and projects. LSK is concerned that the term legal services put the FKE in contravention with the provisions of the Advocates Act which reserves the provision of legal services for advocates. The society says that any unqualified person who wilfully pretends to be, or uses any name title implying that he/she is qualified or recognised by law as qualified to act as an advocate, shall be guilty of an offence. LSK has demanded that FKE ceases with immediate effect from purporting to provide legal services and/or holding itself as capable of providing legal services. They also want the billboard immediately corrected to remove the words and has threatened to sue the federation should it fail to amend the billboard. "Further we demand the billboard erected as aforementioned be immediately corrected to remove the words (legal services) from the services rendered by the federation, failure to which we shall be constrained to take necessary legal action," the letter states.
