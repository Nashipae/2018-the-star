Two police officers were denied bail by a Narok court after they pleaded not guilty to stealing a water bowser belonging to the county government. Peter Mutuku Kiio and Benard Wainaina are alleged to have stolen an Isuzu FV2 registration number GK B 057B valued at Sh11 million on June 30, 2018. They appeared in court together with Philemon Cheruiyot, Timothy Kamoye, John Kimani and David Jambaji. Mutuku was also charged with being in possession of 63 papers that resemble Sh1,000 notes that were found at his home in Drive Inn in Nairobi. He is attached to GSU headquarters at Ruaraka, while Wainaina is a police officer based in Mandera. They faced another charge of being in possession of ammunition without a firearm certificate. Narok Chief Magistrate Wilbroda Juma denied the suspects bail after the state counsel said the first accused had attempted to escape. Senior Counsel Zachary Omwega said the suspects will interfere with witnesses or flee if freed. He added that witnesses had expressed fear that they may not freely testify if the accused persons were released on bond. The court was informed that the first accused is on interdiction allegedly due to similar offences committed in Mombasa. The case will be mentioned on September 13.
