A 35-year-old woman from Teso South constituency of Busia on Wednesday gave birth to a baby boy weighing 6.2kgs. Evelyne Osinya of Ong'ariama village said this was her sixth child adding that she has given birth through caesarean section twice. The overwhelmed but joyous Atieno told journalists that she did not experience any complications during her pregnancy. Faith Atieno, Alupe sub-county hospital administrator, said the baby was in a good condition and that the doctors are closely monitoring him for blood sugar. "Although the baby's blood sugar was lower than normal this morning, we will continue taking care of him to ensure that this normalises," Atieno said. She, however, said that such babies are mostly born of overweight and diabetic mothers. The medic called upon women with such conditions to attend anti-natal clinics regularly during their pregnancy. "Diabetic and overweight women are at a greater risk of giving birth to overweight babies and their condition should be monitored very carefully." Click here for the latest political news
