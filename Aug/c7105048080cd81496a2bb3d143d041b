A Kisumu secondary school teacher was hacked to death because he refused to buy alcohol for several students, the Star has learnt. Police said some suspects have been arrested but did not identify them. Two suspects are secondary school students and one is a university student. Manasseh Ong’ole, a teacher at Guu Secondary School in Nyakach, was murdered on Wednesday night after he and two friends left a pub at Nyamaroka market centre. Ong’ole was carrying two friends when they were attacked after his motorbike stalled.  He was hacked to death with a panga. His two friends were injured, one of them critically. He is admitted at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Referral Hospital. The other is at Nyabondo hospital. Nyakach police boss Henry Malova yesterday said they have gathered sufficient information on the matter. A source familiar with the case said Ong’ole refused to buy alcohol for the youths. He sought anonymity. "The teacher told them they are students and he could not buy them alcohol, prompting a quarrel," the source said. The source said a panga and bloodstained clothes were found inside the house where the three students were sleeping. The murdered teacher comes from Teso, Busia, and he had been teaching in Nyakach for 10 years. Click here for the latest political news
