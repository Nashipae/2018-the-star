Nairobi governor Mike Sonko on Wednesday said he picked Miguna Miguna for the deputy governor's post out of anger and bitterness. “I want to apologise because I selected Miguna Miguna out of anger and bitterness. There was a lot of pressure, intimidation and blackmail and so I gave them Miguna,” Sonko said during an interview on Milele FM. Sonko has been without a deputy following the resignation of Polycarp Igathe on January 31. The governor said sorry for picking the controversial lawyer without consulting his Jubilee party. Miguna was deported in March to Canada in a messy citizenship row. He has now picked four women to fill the post awaiting the recommendation from Jubilee Party. They are Jane Weru, Caren Nyamu, Bishop Margret Wanjiru and Agnes Kagure. Sonko blamed the advisory committee for the delay following the rejection of Miguna by the assembly. Various women's groups have been lobbying for Kagure, however, court cases threatened to derail her chances. A gender activist and insurance executive, Kagure has been voted Agent of the Year for seven years by the Association of Kenya Insurers. Nyamu contested for Woman Representative in Nairobi on the Jubilee ticket but lost to ODM's Esther Passaris. Weru is a lawyer with a masters degree in NGO management from the London School of Economics. Currently, she an executive director of Akiba Mashinani Trust - an NGO. Wanjiru, the televangelist-turned-politician, unsuccessfully ran against Sonko in the Jubilee primaries.
