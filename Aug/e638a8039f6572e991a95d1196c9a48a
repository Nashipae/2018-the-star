Kipipiri MCA Paul Ngeche has accused Nyandarua deputy speaker Zachary Njeru of violating house standing orders by making decisions even with a lack of quorum. Njeru on Thursday ruled in favour of a special sitting on Friday despite their being only seven members in the assembly at the time. The house has 39 members of which 13 must be present for quorum to be met. “The special sitting is provided for in the standing orders. But the procedure through which Njeru called for the sitting is wanting. It was an expression of ignorance and disregard of house powers,” Ngeche said. The sitting was called to allow Finance executive Mary Mugwanja table the County Appropriations Bill. Ngeche said a motion for the same had not been tabled.
