The summons against two Coast ODM MPs will derail the spirit of the Handshake, Coast leaders have said. Led by Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi, the leaders said the summons go against efforts started by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga on fostering unity in the country following the March 9 truce. Speaking on Saturday at a Kilifi Hotel after meeting MPs from the coast region, Kingi said the handshake should provide unconditional interaction between leaders from different political divide.

He said the leaders from the coast region are watching keenly the development of the summons which he said are counterproductive in the context of the handshake. "As leadership we are watching whatever will happen from now going forward on how this will unfold. It is very evident that the effect of these summons will have such serious devastating political effect especially at the coast,” Kingi said. Jumwa and Dori were on July 27 served with show cause letters by ODM Chairman John Mbadi for gross misconduct against the party and its leadership. This is after the two led other coast MPs in drumming support for Deputy President William Ruto in the coast region. Some 21 MPs attended the meeting. MPs present during the meeting included Ali Mbogo(Kisauni),Tandaza Sawa (Kinango),Paul Katana (Kaloleni),Ken Chonga (Kilifi south) and Jones Mlolwe (Voi town). Others are Ali Wario (Bura), Ali Wario (Garsen) Said Habaa (Galole) Shariff Ali (Lamu East) Stanely Muthama (Lamu west) Danson Mwashako (Wundanyi) among others.
