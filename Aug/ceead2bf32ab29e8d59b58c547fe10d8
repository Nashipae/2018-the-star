Dagoretti North MP Simba Arati has asked Raila Odinga to intervene and secure the release of politician Don Bosco Gichana, who is detained in Tanzania. Speaking at Gusii Stadium during the closing ceremony of the Kenya Inter-counties Sports and Cultural Association games, Arati said Gichana has been unfairly detained for the last six years. “I’m humbly requesting you to use your friendship with Tanzania’s President John Magufuli to secure the release of Gichana or to speed up his trial,” Arati said. Gichana was arrested in 2013 and charged with money laundering and fraud in Arusha and Dar es Salaam. His case has, however, not been concluded. Raila did not address the matter when he spoke.
