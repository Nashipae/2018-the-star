Kenyatta National Hospital is working on a plan to set up a bone marrow transplant unit for children with cancer with support from the Israeli government. Israel ambassador Noah Gal Gendler said: "We are going to work together with the hospital to make sure the children are taken good care of, especially those suffering from cancer." "We cannot let our children die because of the diseases they are suffering from. We need to save more lives," Gendler said. The envoy spoke on Thursday during the handover of a specialised digital X-ray for radiology of kids suffering from cancer at the hospital in Nairobi. Israel donated the cancer equipment through Mashav - an Israel agency for international development cooperation. Acting KNH CEO Thomas Mutie said he was happy with the Israeli government for continuously being friends and identifying areas of collaboration and investment. Dr Mutie appreciated the ambassador’s effort for extending another project leading to the renovation and equipping the Pediatric patients playroom. "KNH has had a long and fruitful relationship with the Embassy of Israel which in 2011 facilitated the renovation and equipping of the Paediatric Cancer Ward 1E, and in 2014 the renovation and equipping of ward 3D." "We can’t understate training facilitation for medical personnel, entertainment shows for the children and also therapeutic puppetry training for nurses with an aim of promoting healing and relaxation to the patients," Mutie said. He said the Kenyatta National Hospital has embraced private-public partnerships as way out for it to realise its vision and excel in health services provision. Dr Mutie encouraged investments in hostels for cancer patients who lack accommodation when seeking treatment at KNH.
