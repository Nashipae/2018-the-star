Vicmas Luodollar has weighed in on claims that Octopizzo buys views on his YouTube channel Octopizzo's new song Oliel garnered 1.4 million views in one day. The artiste has 66,000 subscribers on the channel. Vicmass told Word Is, "If buying views will put food on his table, then I don’t have a problem with that. Every artiste is buying views, from Nicki Minaj to Jay Z and the rest. It is not new to us. There is a lot people are doing outside here, so let us focus on our circle and leave the rest to the people who are concerned. "Nikiona mtu amevaa nguo, sitaki kujua kama ameomba ama ni yake. The same way, if I see someone with a million views per day, I don’t want to know if they bought [them] because those people who are not in the country will not know if they are bought or not." Would you buy views? "I wouldn’t buy views and that is why it took me 10 years to build my brand and there is no one who doesn’t know I can deliver and that is what will sell my music. It is my work to build myself from the mistakes I make rather than lying to myself that I am dope while I am not. I will never buy views. "Octopizzo is my mentor and if he will buy views for his videos I would be happy because [he] has good visuals and audio. No one can compete [with] his work." Vicmass is currently promoting two new jams Ongiri and Chamuma ahead of his forthcoming EP record produced by Major Static. He aims to encourage single mothers who think everyone is against them.
