Laikipia county government has invited public universities in the country to set up a campus in Nanyuki Town to meet the education needs of the locals. This follows the closure of Karatina and Kenyatta University campuses over reduced number of full time students. A task-force toward this initiative has been formed and educationist Ng’ang’a Kamithi named its chairman. A report presented to six representatives of six universities on Saturday pointed out that the devolved unit is looking for a university that can offer faculties that resonate with the county’s development agenda.
