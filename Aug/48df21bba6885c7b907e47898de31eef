Likuyani MP Enock Kibunguchy has no doubt that the bullets that killed his driver Douglas Wamakacha were meant for him. Wamakacha was shot dead in an attack at Soy Highway Motel at about 9 pm on Sunday.

He said he went to the motel after a church service for a meeting with some of his constituents. "After the meeting, I told my driver to go start the car as I settled the bills. It was at that time that he was killed," he said in a televised interview on Monday. "One suspect came upstairs and looked at us then went away. They may have been following us for a long time. "I have no doubt that that bullet was meant to kill me. Even if you kill me, you will not be an MP. You will not even
manage to have the forest that you want because in my absence there will be many other  Kibunguchys who will fight for the rights of the people of Likuyani." The MP said the murder may be connected to the acrimony that followed the 2017 general election and petitions that were filed in Kakamega and Kisumu. He said they will make sure Wamakacha's killers are found and punished, "even if we have to retreat to Luhya customs". Kibunguchy said he has a bodyguard but does not travel with him because "my first [source of] security is God". "You can have 100 bodyguards but if people want to kill you, they will kill you. Presidents walk around with more than 100 bodyguards and end up being killed," he said. Click here for the latest political news
