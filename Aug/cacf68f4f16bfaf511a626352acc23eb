Five people have been arrested for operating unlicensed petroleum facility in Kisumu. Police alsoÂ recovered 4,500 litres of export diesel. The suspects were arrested during a joint operation by Energy Regulatory Commission officers in collaboration with DCI and GSU. In a statement on Thursday, the commission said it would demolish the illegal site. "During the raid carried against illicit trade and export fuel dumping, a vehicle registration Number KAN 022 was impounded," the regulatory body said. ERC said the suspects were arraigned for charges including operation and construction of a petroleum business without a permit. The commission has been carrying out raids on various petroleum facilities across the country in a bid to fight adulterated fuel. In July, 99 suspects were arrested in Industrial area, Nairobi for operating unlicensed petroleum premises. Last year, the commission closed six petrol stations for selling substandard fuel. They included Legit Kinamba in Nyandarua, Capital filling station Busibwabo in Busia, Sylvester Okoth filing station in Busia, and Petronas service station in Kiambu. The experts implored on Kenyans to be vigilant and immediately report any instances of malpractice or suspected fuel adulteration activities.
