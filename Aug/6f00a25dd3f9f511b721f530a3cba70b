Former Bobasi MP Joash Manoti , whose billions of shilling city mall was brought down on Thursday is also among prominent businessmen who will be required to present their papers before DCI investigators.  The two are some of the people whose properties have been demolished besides claims that their buildings had been approved by the Government.  Police spokesman Owino Wahong'o said the land lords will be required to record statements as well as provide the police with information of how and who approved their buildings.  The police have opened investigations into the building approvals. Investigators are now targeting city planners and county Government officials who approved the buildings with the aim of prosecuting them.  Officials from NEMA , National Construction Authority are among Government officials who are likely to face arrest and prosecution over the controversial building approvals.
