NLC chair Mohammed Swazuri and Kenya Railways MD Atanas Maina have been charged with several counts of corruption-related offences. The two were charged on Monday alongside 10 public officers from the Ministry of Lands and the Kenya Railways Corporation. Swazuri denied five counts of abuse of office and an alternative charge of breach of trust. The prosecution claimed they all conspired to commit crimes which led to the loss of Sh222,375,000 of public funds, in payments for three pieces of land belonging to KRC. The two directors of the three companies that were paid were charged with unlawful acquisition of public funds, through payments by the NLC to their accounts. They all denied the charges before Anti-Corruption Court Chief Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi.
