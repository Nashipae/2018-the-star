Two police officers linked to
the death of a businesswoman at City Park, Nairobi, two months ago
walked to their temporary freedom yesterday after they were granted bail. William Chirchir, an
Administration Police officer from Makadara, and his co-accused
Godfrey Kirui from Industrial Area were freed by Justice Stella
Mutuku on a Sh700,000 bail each. The judge ordered the duo to execute
a bond of Sh2 million with two sureties of Sh1 million each. They were given the
option of depositing the cash with the court’s registrar to secure freedom pending
trial. She said the prosecution failed to table compelling reasons to deny bail. Chirchir and Kirui denied killing Janet
Waiyaki on May 20. Waiyaki, 41, and Bernard Chege, 26, parked at City
Park when they were attacked. At the magistrate's court, they refused
to plead to another charge of the attempted murder of Chege, who was left with gun wounds. The prosecution opposed
their release on bail, saying they are likely to interfere with witnesses. State prosecutor Catherine
Mwaniki said she wanted to secure evidence of key witnesses. Waiyaki's husband
George Kirubi urged the judge to
reject the application by the accused, citing threats. Kirubi referred to an incident
where someone allegedly shot at his house on June 17. He said three days
later, he was pushed off Jogoo Road by a vehicle. A fire broke also broke out at his business premise at Gloria Hotel on June 23. But Mutuku said all rights must be considered. “An arrested person has a right
to be released on bail or bond on reasonable condition, unless there are
compelling reasons”. The judge directed the file
to be placed before Jessie Lesiit on September 19.
