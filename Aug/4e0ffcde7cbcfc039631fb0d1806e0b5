Kisumu-based journalists
have asked Governor Anyang Nyong’o take disciplinary action against Tourism and
Sports executive Achie Alai for disrespecting the reporters. Led by Kisumu Journalists Network chairman Dickson Odhiambo, the scribes also want
the executive to apologise for handling them in an irresponsible manner. "Journalists should not be mistreated when they are performing their duties. We have the mandate to inform and educate the public," Odhiambo said. Achie, who
is also the acting executive for Communication, called journalists silly after the reporters asked Finance executive Nerry Achar to explain the financier of
Nyong’o’s foreign trips and the benefit of the tours to residents. The county has increased travel expenditure from Sh140 million to Sh168 million. When asked to quantify the accrued benefits of the trips, Achie became emotional and referring to journalists as “silly” before storming out of the
press briefing at Nyong’o’s boardroom. “Such are
silly questions,” she said. Click here for the latest political news
