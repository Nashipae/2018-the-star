ODM issued a direct ticket to former Energy minister Ochillo Ayacko in the Migori senatorial by-election to avert chaos during nominations, national chairman John Mbadi has said. Some individuals had planned to disrupt party nominations, the Suba South MP said on Sunday. The plot was to paint ODM as a party incapable of conducting credible nominations, Mbadi aid during a funds drive at Ongoro Lutheran Church in Kasipul Kabondo constituency. “We realised there were some people hiding behind the calls for free and fair nominations, yet their aim was to cause chaos and mudsling against the party,” Mbadi said. He said it made no sense to ask aspirants to pay nomination fees while some people were planning to disrupt the exercise. The chairman said Ayacko got 63 per cent of delegates’ support prior to issuingthe ticket. “The party did a lot of considerations before it issued the ticket. The party’s assessment indicated that Ayacko was the most popular among the aspirants,” he Mbadi said. He urged Migori residents to vote for the ODM candidate, dismissing accusations that the party imposed Ayacko on the people. “The party has rules that guide it before it comes up with its candidate, hence, Ayacko was not just given the ticket without proper reasons,” Mbadi said. The decision to award a direct ticket has sparked criticism from some party members in the county. Governor Okoth Obado opposed the move, saying the party should have given all interested aspirants an opportunity to vie for the ticket. Obado has said he would not support Ayacko on grounds he was improperly nominated. The by-election will be held on October 8. Mbadi said he expects ODM loyalists to support the party’s decision. “Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju announced they will not present a candidate for the by-election and nobody questioned his decision. Why do some ODM members oppose the party decisions?” he asked.
