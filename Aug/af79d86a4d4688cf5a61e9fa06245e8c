National Super League leading top scorer Stephen Owusu is confident of hitting his target of 20 goals at the end of the season. The Ghanaian has found the back of the net 16 times for Nairobi Stima and has cast his hope on experience to bang more than 20 goals, a target he set at the beginning of the season, shortly after arriving from Tusker. The burly forward was part of the big names axed at Ruaraka at the beginning of the year but later found a new home at Stima and has been scoring at will and hopes to lay his hands on the second tier’s best scoring accolade besides aiding the powermen to the top flight. “I want to reach my target of 20 goals at the end of the season and lift my club to the top flight. The main reason why I settled for Stima was to rediscover my scoring form and I am happy I am more aggressive in front of the goal and sharper as compared to last season,” he said. “I also hope I will win the Golden Boot although my priority remains helping the team finish in the top two. I have not struggled to adapt in the NSL since I am an experienced player who has played in many countries and I find it easy to beat defenders and score goals.” Despite enjoying arguably his best form since arriving in the country in 2015 from Nigerian side Sharks FC, Owusu quashed reports linking him with a return to top flight football. He insisted that he is happy at Stima and will either return to the elite league should Stima earn promotion or sign for an undisclosed South African club whom he said have shown interests in his services. The former Esperance man has been instrumental for Ibrahim Shikanda’s Stima, propelling them to sit second on the log with 55 points, three shy of leaders Western Stima. The club boasts of the best scoring form netting 52 times in 27 matches and will go top of the league should they win their match in hand.
