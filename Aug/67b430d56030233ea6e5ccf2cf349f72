ODM party leader Raila Odinga has left the country for a week-long trip to Germany. Raila left Jomo Kenyatta International Airport at about 4.30pm on Friday. His high-profile foreign trips have triggered speculations that he is poised for a key role as Kenya’s roving envoy. Since the historic March 9 handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta, Raila's profile has risen dramatically. He has undertaken one diplomatic assignment after another on behalf of the President. Raila visited countries ranging from UK, India, South Africa, and Zimbabwe among others. The Star earlier established that the government had issued a communique to all its missions abroad to treat Raila as a senior government representative whenever he visits.
