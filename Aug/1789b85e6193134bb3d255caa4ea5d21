Deputy Chief Justice Philomen Mwilu has moved to High Court to block her prosecution in the Sh12m graft case. Mwilu filed the case through her lawyers on Wednesday. She is seeking orders to stop her from taking a plea. The move came hours before she was due to appear for plea taking following her arrest on Tuesday. The application challenging the plea taking will be heard before Justice Chacha Mwita. If the judge grants the order, the DCJ will not take the plea on the 13 charges levelled against her. Lawyers Nelson Havi, Harun Ndubi, Okong'o Omogeni, John Khaminwa, and others argued the petition before Mwita. In the application, Mwilu has sued the DPP, DCI, the Attorney General, and chief magistrate of the Anti-corruption court. Through lawyer Okongo Omogeni, she says the allegations against her are "purely commercial transaction concluded at arms length  and which have no rational correlation with the pursuit of criminal justice." The charges, she says, have been contrived by the office of the DPP for malicious or ulterior motive. "The said charges have been commenced in abuse of court process with the singular objective of embarrassing me," she says. The judge argues that the impinged charges are not  coincidental and appear to be part of a larger scheme to embarrass her in her capacity as a DCJ.
