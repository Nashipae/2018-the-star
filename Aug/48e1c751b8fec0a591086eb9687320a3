Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has told Sports CS Rashid Achesa to stop seeking cheap publicity using Raila Odinga’s name. He said Achesa should use his negative energy on upgrading his academic qualifications. Speaking on the phone on Thursday, Odhiambo said Achesa is not Raila’s equal. Earlier this week, Achesa accused Raila of plotting to kick him out of the Sports docket. State House has denied reports of a looming reshuffle. The ODM MP said it is a shame that instead of focusing on their work some Cabinet secretaries have resorted to name-calling. Odhiambo said he excepted to hear talk of development from the CS, especially after the President warned his Cabinet to desist from politics. He said Achesa, unlike his colleagues, has never been in the news with any development agenda. Instead he is always moving around politicking and hurling insults at ODM members, Odhiambo said. Achesa told Raila to leave him alone as he is not the appointing authority. Raila, in an interview with a local TV station, denied any involvement in government operations. Raila said he only supports President Uhuru Kenyatta for development sake and he has no intention of joining the government or manipulating state appointments as alleged by Achesa.
