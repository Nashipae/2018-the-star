The ODM party has said it will work hard to reclaim the Homa Bay governor seat if a by-election is called, chairman John Mbadi has said. The Supreme Court is set to start hearing governor Cyprian Awiti's petition after the appellate court dismissed his previous appeal challenging the nullification of his election. Awiti’s election win was successfully challenged in High Court by his rival and former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga. But Mbadi said subject to the outcome of the court, the party brigade will pinch tent in Homa Bay to ensure their candidate retains the seat.

Speaking on Saturday during a fundraiser at Got Adundo primary school in his constituency, the Suba South MP condemned what he termed as the high-level corruption in Homa Bay. The chairman said ODM party leadership had instructed Awiti to crack the whip on corrupt officials. Mbadi who was accompanied by Ndhiwa MP Martin Owino noted that rampant graft was tainting the image of the county and hampering its development agenda. “We’re surprised with reports that most Homa Bay MCAs embroiled in squabbles because of graft in the county assembly,” Mbadi said. He said,“ the party will not hesitate from taking action against the members who are tender-preneurs.” Also read: Court nullifies Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti's election, orders fresh polls More on this: Homa Bay High Court allows votes scrutiny in Magwanga petition against Aw Click here for the latest political news
