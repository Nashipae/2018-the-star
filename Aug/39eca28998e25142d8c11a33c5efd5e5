The Siaya government has been accused of swindling Sh110 million meant for project management committee allowances. The committee on roads, public works, transport, and communication made the accusation. Committee chairperson Eric Odawa on Thursday presented a report in the assembly on how the county government has “pocketed” the PMC allowances since 2013. According to the report, the county government has not paid the PMC allowances since the advent of devolution totalling to a sum of Sh110, 031,525. The report indicated various project management committees across the county have not been given allowances; allegations that were confirmed by the chief officer of finance. The committee said the project management committee members are centrally managed from the county government, while their payments are domiciled with the county finance department. The committee also learned that despite the lack of PMC payment, all contractors have been paid their dues less five per cent. A spot check with the committee revealed that a Siaya deposit account had a balance of Sh0 instead of Sh110,031,525 they have been deducting contractors. The chief officer for finance through his submission to the committee reported that the Sh110,031,525 meant for the PMC allowances was used to pay contractors in 2016-17. But the committee revealed there was no evidence supporting the allegation on the payment of the contractors as alleged by the finance chief officer.
