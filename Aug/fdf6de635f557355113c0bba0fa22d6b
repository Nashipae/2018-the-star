Leadership positions at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, Africa, will be held by subregions on a rotational basis. Members on Sunday passed amendments that will ensure each subregion gets a chance to lead. The changes took effect immediately. Those to be elected today at the 49th CPA conference in Gaborone, Botswana, will serve for three years before surrendering to another subregion. The CPA Africa has four subregions — the Southern region, East Africa, West Africa and Central Africa. Kenya National Assembly speaker Justin Muturi praised the amendment and said it cures monopolisation of the positions by some regions. “The main objective of the motion was to ensure there is equity and balance in the distribution of the offices of the association among the subregions,” he told the general assembly. “It was argued that the contested electoral system had the potential of creating divisions within the region. It was, therefore, imperative to change the system by introducing a regional roster.” Muturi chaired the Committee of Experts. Based on the change, the powerful position of executive committee chairman is reserved for East Africa. As of last evening, it was not clear if the other regions would have candidates considering the changes to the law took effect abruptly. If the other regions will not have candidates, then Muturi is likely to be the automatic successor of Lindiwe Michele. The East African countries have rallied behind the Kenyan speaker.
