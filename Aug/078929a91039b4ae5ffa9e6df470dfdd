Governors are demanding more powers to manage public land. Council of Governors chairman Josphat Nanok said they want to be included as trustees for land titles belonging to all state agencies not directly under the national government. He cited unalienated government land as defined by an Act of Parliament, land sold to the state and reversion or surrendered land for which ownership cannot  be established. “This means that county governments are mandated to hold vast areas of what constitutes public land in trust for residents,” he said.

It was attended by the CoG, National Land Commission, Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, Inter Governmental Relations Technical Committee and the Judiciary. Officials from the Lands ministry, the Education ministry and the Office of the President did not attend. Nanok said counties were worried that title deeds for some schools, health facilities and other public facilities are being held in trust by the Treasury Cabinet Secretary. The council said county governments should carry out any form of restitution, compensation or alienation of public land, transfer and variation of ownership of public land. Nanok said this power  will enable counties to fulfil their function of planning and development. It will also enhance transparency and accountability in public land administration, he said. Transfer of land was also raised during the meeting. There was consensus that land initially held by the national government has not been transferred to the county governments. Additionally, there have been challenges in accessing land related information from the national government.
