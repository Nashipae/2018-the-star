Tanzanian police are holding two suspects found with a vehicle believed to have been stolen from State House, Nairobi. Hamisi Issah, Kilimanjaro province Assistant Commissioner of Police, said the Nissan Patrol V8, registration number KCP 184V, was nabbed with fake Tanzanian registration number T954 DEQ on its way to Kilimanjaro from Kenya. "This vehicle is from Kenya and we have reason to believe it was stolen. It was nabbed at the Msomali barrier in Bomangâ€™ombe," Issah told local media on Wednesday. "We interrogated those who were with this vehicle and they gave contradicting statements. On further inquiry, we discovered that the vehicle was reported stolen on August 19," Issah said. He said the two suspects, who are residents of Moshi Municipality, are being held in Kilimanjaro in wait for their arraignment. By time of press, the Star had not established if State House has reported a lost car to the police. Click here for the latest political news
