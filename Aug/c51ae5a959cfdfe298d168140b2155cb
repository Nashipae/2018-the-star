The motion to impeach Kisumu speaker Onyango Oloo has been shelved after ODM intervened. Market-Milimani ward representative Seth Ochieng’ failed to table the motion and said he had been de-whipped. He was to present the impeachment motion. Yesterday, he made a surprise retreat following the directive from the party. “I have been de-whipped by the party not to bring the motion of impeachment in the House,” the MCA said. The MCAs, who resumed from recess, have been pushing for the impeachment of Oloo alleging mismanagement of the assembly. The assembly has been dogged with wrangles since the inception of devolution. Ochieng accused the speaker of frustrating Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o by deliberately delaying bills sponsored by the Executive. He also accused Oloo of micromanaging and single-handedly making key decisions without consulting MCAs. The speaker dismissed the allegations as baseless and unfounded.
