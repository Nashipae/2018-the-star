Machakos county commissioner Abdulahi Galgalo yesterday said infiltration of criminals from border counties hurts security. Galgalo said some of crimes reported in Machakos are committed by gangs from Nairobi. He, however, added that security has been intensified. Galgalo said the Machakos security team has laid strategies on eliminating crime in all the eight subcounties. “We want to tell the public about the security in Machakos.” He addressed the press at his office in Machakos town on Thursday. “[On Wednesday] People were hacked in Masii. There have been numerous house break-ins, theft and violent robbery in parts of the county in the past,” he said. The county commissioner said three people have been arrested in connection with the incident and will be charged in court. He said the police are looking for two suspects. Galgalo said four others were arrested with household goods in Athi River subcounty. They were arrested in a swoop on Wednesday evening. Police sources said a similar crackdown was conducted by officers from Kitengela town in Kajiado on the same day. Galgalo asked residents in Athi River and its environs who had been robbed to go to Athi police station and identity lost property. He praised the public for working with the officers in providing information on the criminals. Galgalo also praised officers for being swift in making the arrests in Athi River and Mwala. He told security agents to be more vigilant in maintaining law and order.
