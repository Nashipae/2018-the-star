Police were deployed to disperse a riotous mob that stormed Syungila AP camp in Kitui Central on Tuesday. The members of the public were armed with petrol in readiness to torch the station on grounds an officer at the camp had an extra-marital affair with a married woman from the area. When the woman's husband got wind of the 11am incident, he rushed to the AP camp and found the policeman's house locked from outside. The man locked the house with another padlock as the locals cheered him on. A contingent of armed police officers led by the Kitui Central AP commander Nicholas Mutua arrived and dispersed the crowd. The mob regrouped and barricaded the Kitui -Thika road. They lit bonfires, disrupting traffic on the route. Governor Charity Ngilu visited the scene and demanded that the AP officer is transferred from the camp. "Police officers are supposed to provide security to the locals but not snatch their wives." Mutua said the officer has since been moved to another station.
