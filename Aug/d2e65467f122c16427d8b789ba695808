Second-placed Nairobi Stima seek to overtake Western Stima in the National Super League today when they take on Kibera Black Stars at Camp Toyoyo grounds. A win for Nairobi Stima will see them top the log with 58 points same as Western Stima but the Nairobi side have a better goal difference. The game will be televised live on free to air Bamba Sport alongside the game between Ushuru and Modern Coast Rangers. The tax men will hope to rediscover their form and return to the promotion mix. Third-placed KCB will entertain Administration Police in an earlier encounter at the same venue. A derby involving log leaders Western Stima and Kisumu All Stars on Saturday will be the highlight of the weekend matches. Western Stima’s interim coach Paul Ogai and Kisumu All Stars’ Nick Aketch have both vowed to give the fans an entertaining game. The first leg ended in a draw. “It’s a normal game but it will be interesting facing my former assistant coach. My boys are ready for a win,” said Aketch. Ogai said: “It will be a tough game against my former employers. They know my tactics but we want to win in order to enhance chances of qualifying to the SportPesa Premier League.” The former Kisumu All Stars assistant coach saidhe is focusing his energies on working on the team’s porous defense. “We are scoring goals but also conceding unnecessary goals,” added the coach.
