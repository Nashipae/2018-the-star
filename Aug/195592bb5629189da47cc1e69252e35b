Ambassador nominee Sarah Serem was pressed to explain her pay cut decisions when she served as Salaries and Remuneration Commission chairperson. The National Assembly Defence and Foreign Relations  committee compelled her to apologise. Some legislators sought to settle scores. The commission had slashed MPs’ salaries. She has been nominated to be ambassador to China. "I know MPs looked at salaries reviews as skewed, but it cuts across the Public Service. It’s only that the others affected didn’t have a forum to speak out," Serem said. The committee accused her of being domineering and not being a team player. The MPs said she is a hardliner with poor negotiation skills. Serem denied she was biased against them. "At the SRC, it was a change process and this transformation is never interesting. It’s the reason we needed firmness. It’s only MPs who don’t understand me.  I’m the most diplomatic person. But I’m sorry. However, we had to do the work. It meant good for Kenya," she added. Serem said the notion that she is a lone ranger and is domineering came about because she was the spokesperson of the commission, served as its face and articulated all its policy and communication to the public. "All decisions I communicated were the commission’s decisions, not mine. They were arrived at after a series of discussions and consensus building,"  she said. Click here for the latest political news
