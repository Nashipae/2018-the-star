Sofapaka beat Ulinzi Stars 1-0 in the weekend’s main highlight pitting former Kenya Premier League champions at Narok Stadium. Umaru Kasumba netted all the important goal in the dying minutes of the game to aid his side consolidate the second spot in the league which had been briefly occupied by Bandari following their Saturday 3-1 win over Posta Rangers. Kasumba, who has been missing in action for a month due to a hip injury, connected Stephen Waruru’s pinpointcross in the 89th minute to separate the two football giants. Elsehwere, Mathare United’s quest to end their win-less run which had stretched to six matches, was thwarted after bowing 2-1 to 10-man AFC Leopards at Machakos Stadium. Wyvonne Isuza threw Leopards ahead in the 28th minute from the spot after James Situma had scythed down Jaffar Odenyi in the box even though replays of the live match show the incident happened outside the box. Guilty of conceding the penalty, Situma redeemed himself with an equaliser at the stroke of half-time after he rose high to nod the ball past Ezekiel Owade. Leopards regained the lead in the 59th minute through Marvin Nabwire—a goal which separated the two sides at the final whistle.Efforts to add more were punctured after Isuza received his marching orders in the 64th minute for a second bookable offence. At Awendo Stadium, Thika United woes deepened after going down 3-1 to Sony Sugar.Thika, who are placed second, fell behind barely three minutes into the game as Robert Mudenyu found the back of the net from close range. Enoch Agwanda doubled the scores in the 19th minute before Tobias Omondi made it three in the 50th minute. Daniel Lewa’s 60th minute goal proved to be a consolation as the damage had already been done. Away at Sudi Stadium, Wazito held Nzoia Sugar to a barren draw.
