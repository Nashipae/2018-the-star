AFC Leopards centre half Michael Kibwage has called upon his teammates to shift their focus in defending the SportPesa Shield Cup as well as finishing second in the SportPesa Premier League. Having watched Gor Mahia defend the league over the weekend after amassing unassailable 71 points, Kibwage has challenged his colleagues to borrow a leaf from better rivals and win the Shield which will guarantee them a return to the continental football as Kenyan representatives in the Caf Confederations Cup. Ingwe are set to face National Super League side Kenya Police in the quarter finals next weekend and Kibwage believes Leopards have the capacity to defend the Shield crown they won last year after edging Kariobangi Sharks 2-0 in the final staged at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. The Kenyan international said: "We have to quickly shift to defending the Shield Cup which will enable us return to continental football. Itâ€™s also the remaining trophy on offer and we should direct our efforts on it now that the league is gone. We should also fight and finish second in the league." The former Kakamega Homeboyz defender was at pain to describe the 2-0 loss suffered in the hands of Gor Mahia where he revealed that their plan to get an early goal and frustrate their rivals backfired and hence handed Gor their 17th league title with six matches to spare. First half goals from Boniface Omondi and Bernard Ondiek were all Gor needed to bag the Mashemeji Derby bragging rights. He said: "We had planned to get an early goal and ease pressure on our side but in turn we were punished for leaving an exposed defence.The early goal quest saw our attacking midfielders press for a goal leaving the back exposed and we were punished through counter-attacks."
