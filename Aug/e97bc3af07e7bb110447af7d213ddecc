ODM leader Raila Odinga has expressed disappointment with the unending crisis in South Sudan. He said Kenya will not, however, stop taking a central role in the negotiations between President Salva Kiir and former VP Riek Machar. Raila spoke after a meeting with representatives of civil society groups from South Sudan. He said the team had briefed him on developments in the country and expressed their strong desire for Kenya to take over the peace process. "We had hoped that independence in South Sudan would give way to reconstruction as happened in Vietnam and Algeria after protracted wars. But we have been disappointed." "We, however, remain committed to the strategic partnership between our country and theirs and we will not give up," Raila said on his twitter page.
