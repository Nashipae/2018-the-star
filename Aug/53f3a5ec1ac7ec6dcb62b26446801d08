President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday witnessed the destruction of Sh1.5 billion illicit goods in Machakos. He warned leaders not to politicise the fight against corruption, impunity and economic crimes. Uhuru said he will neither be scared, threatened or side-tracked in his determination to clean the country. He warned that no corrupt individual will be spared irrespective of their real or perceived seniority in society. “All corrupt people will go to jail without compromise. But due process of the law will be followed so that those who think they have been wrongly accused can demonstrate their innocence and be vindicated,” the Head of State said. The President told senior managers in government institutions to carry their own cross whenever caught in corrupt dealings. He said they should stop passing the buck to their juniors. Uhuru appealed to all the 47 governors to follow his example and rid the counties of corruption. Some 149 motor vehicles worth more than Sh71 million were also destroyed. Foodstuff, fake electronics, drugs, laboratory equipment, construction materials, alcoholic drinks, counterfeit cigarettes, motorcycle tubes, energy saving bulbs, cables and sex toys all estimated at more than Sh165 million were set ablaze. The illicit goods were destroyed at the East African Portland Cement Grounds in Athi River. An inter-agency crack team led by Deputy Head of Public Service Wanyama Musiambo seized the items. It comprises the Police, the Kenya Revenue Authority, the Kenya Bureau of Standards and the Anti Counterfeit Agency. Since March when the team was formed, it has destroyed contraband goods worth more Sh7.4 billion to date. It was set up following concerns raised by the Kenya Private Sector Alliance when they met President Uhuru at State House Nairobi on May 10. Machakos governor Alfred Mutua and his Kajiado counterpart Joseph ole Lenku supported the President in his renewed fight against graft. Click here for the latest political news
