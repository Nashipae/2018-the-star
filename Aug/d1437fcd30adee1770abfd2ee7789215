Two leaders yesterday urged the government to post more female teachers to Garissa. Girls’ schools have been disadvantaged for a long time because they lack enough female teachers, Garissa woman representative Annab Subbow and Ijara MP Sophia Abdi Noor said They spoke at Fafi Girls’ Secondary School during the institution’s parents’ day on Sunday. Only four out of the 11 girls’ schools in Garissa are headed by female principals. The number of female teachers is also low. Subbow said for girls’ performance to improve it was imperative that more female teachers are posted to the schools because girls are more comfortable with them. “We have time and again raised this issue with the government through the Ministry of Education. It is unfortunate even the few girls’ schools we have in region are still struggling with teachers, especially female ones,” she said. Noor blamed the poor performance of girls in national examinations on the low number of female teachers serving in the county. She said besides learning, there are many personal issues that girls can only freely discuss with their female teachers as opposed to male ones. “I am appealing to the Ministry of Education to seriously look into this matter because it is one of the biggest contributors to poor performance among the girls,” Noor said. She urged Form 4 leavers joining college to take up teaching to improve education and help solve other problems facing the county. She said Education CS Amina Mohamed, being a woman and a mother, ought to understand the unique problems that confront girls. County Knut secretary Abdirizak Ismail said even though not having enough female teachers in girls’ schools might not necessarily affect their performance, the students are more comfortable when they are managed by a female teacher. He urged the government to support female teachers in training colleges and promote those from the region who are already in service.
