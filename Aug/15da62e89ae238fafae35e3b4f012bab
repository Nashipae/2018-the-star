Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has said he will not divide the Kalenjin community ahead of the 2022 General Election. The senator asked politicians to stop the 2022 election debate and instead deliver services. He urged leaders from the Rift Valley region to first solve problems facing local farmers. “I was given the job of senator by the people of Baringo and that is where my focus is. I have said severally that 2022 will be guided by the grace of God,” Gideon said. Speaking at a fundraising in Turesia, Elgeyo Marakwet county ,on Sunday, Gideon said 2022 politics will derail development in the Rift Valley. The Baringo senator hinted at running for President after Uhuru Kenyatta’s term ends. He said: “I am following the footsteps of our missing cow…and we will bring the cow home, and after that we will drink the milk.” Gideon added: “But when the time of elections comes, you, the people of Kenya, will decide.” His sentiments were echoed by Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos who said residents of the Rift Valley have many problems that have to be addressed before 2022. Tolgos said he will not join the 2022 election debate when more than 400 Keiyo teachers who lost land to cartels in Eldoret have not been given back their property. “We can’t keep talking about 2022 when locals displaced to pave way for fluorspar mining in Kerio Valley have not been compensated,” Tolgos said. Tiaty MP William Kamket accused politicians who have started 2022 campaigns of silencing Moiben MPs Silas Tiren and his Nandi Hills counterpart Alfred Keter. “We are aware that Tiren and Keter are being told to remain silent so that they don’t derail 2022 ambitions of an individual,” Kamket said. Gideon was accompanied by MP Tiren, William Chepkut of Ainabkoi, Daniel Rono of Keiyo South and several MCAs. The senator said he will table a bill to overhaul the National Cereals and Produce Board when Senate resumes from recess.
