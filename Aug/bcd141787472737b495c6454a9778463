The government will support Director of Public Prosecutions and his DCI counterpart in the fight against corruption, DP William Ruto has said. Ruto said oversight institutions that include Parliament must protect public resources. The DP spoke at Eldoret Sports Club where he launched a youth training and empowerment programme on Saturday. Kesses MP Swarrup Mishra initiated the programme for 700 youth. Ruto said the government has no time or space for quarrels and propaganda adding that "It is focusing on serving Kenyans." “Those who want to engage in propaganda and stories please give us a break," he said. He said Kenya can only be changed through hard work for economic growth. The DP said 200km of roads are under construction in Uasin Gishu. He said once completed, the roads will ease movement of people and transportation of goods. Ruto said in 2013 only 60,000 households were connected to electricity in the county, but currently, the number has risen to 200,000. He said Sh800 million has been provided to connect another 20,000 households in phase two and three of the project. The DP said Sh500 million has been set aside for the cash transfer programme for elderly, the disabled and orphans in the county. He said they will also be enrolled in the NHIF scheme. Ruto said Sh1 billion medical equipment has been given to Uasin Gishu county. He said the state is developing technical training institutions to help provide manpower for the success of the Big Four agenda. Ruto said from September, Sh30,000 bursary will be given to each of the 120,000 students who will join technical training colleges. They will also each access Sh40,000 each in loans from HELB.
