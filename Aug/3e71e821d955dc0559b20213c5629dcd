The national government is ready to begin construction of the Sh64 billion Thwake Dam, Water Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui said on Friday. He spoke in Makueni when he toured the site to check the preparedness of the contractor ahead of the commissioning of the project by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The CS said the contractor is assembling machines and his team of 57 Chinese professionals. Chelugui was accompanied by Water Principal Secretary Joseph Irungu and Chief Administrative Secretary Winnie Guchu. The CS said they were behind schedule by six months but promised the project will be completed within 56 weeks. "Compensation is one of the issues that could impede the project. We have Sh700 million to pay the remaining 170 people displaced by the project," he said. Makueni Deputy Governor Adelina Mwau promised the support of the county government.
