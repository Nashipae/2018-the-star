Activist Okiya Omtatah has filed a case challenging the imposition of VAT on agrochemicals through the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 2018.Under a certificate of urgency, Omtatah says the changes imposing 16 per cent VAT on agricultural pest control products was sneaked into law and enacted through a process that blatantly violated the Constitution.“The imposition of VAT on agrochemicals is unreasonable when its impact on farmers and the development of local manufacturing of the products is taken into account,” Omtatah saysThe Act, the activist says, discriminates against agricultural pest control products to the extent that similar ones used to control human pests and diseases are not subject to VAT.“I am aggrieved that contrary to Article 41 ( 1 ) of the Constitution the imposition of 16 per cent VAT on the agricultural pest control products is not reasonable, given its cascading negative impacts on food production, availability and costs,” Omtatah says.

The law removes agricultural pest control products from the list of products that are zero-rated under the VAT Act, and subjects them to 16 per cent VAT.Omtatah says the implementation of the new tax came into force retrospectively on July 1 this year, more than two weeks before the date of assent on July 18.Prior to 2014, the Valued Added Tax Act and previous Finance Acts zero-rated agricultural pest control products. With the enactment of the VAT Act 2013, the VAT status of agricultural pest control products changed from zero-rated to exempt until April 3, 2017, when they reverted to zero-rated.He wants the court to declare the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 2018 unconstitutional to the extent it was not subjected to consideration by the Senate yet it was a Bill concerning proposed amendments to agricultural pest control products, which fall under the devolved function of agriculture.Also sought is an order suspending the implementation of Section 1( 2 ) (a) and (c) of the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 2018. It states, that provisions relating to the Income Tax Act and the Value Added Tax will come into force, retrospectively on July 1, 2018.
