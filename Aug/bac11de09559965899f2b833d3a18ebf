Nandi county will use more than Sh300 million to set up its own milk processing firm that will benefit more than 17,000 small-scale dairy producers. Governor Stephen Sang has set aside Sh110 million for starting the project and he has also kicked off consultative meetings with farmers and other stakeholders over the plan. “This project is part of our strategy to have farmers do value addition so that they can benefit more from their produce, be it milk or cereals,” Sang said. He met the stakeholders on Tuesday in Kapsabet town. The county, however, faces a shortage of raw milk that will meet the new processing plant’s capacity of 200,000 litres. Farmers in the region produce about 51,000 litres daily.
