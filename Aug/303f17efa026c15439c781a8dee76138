Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula claims Wilson Sossion will be his running mate in his 2022 presidency bid. Speaking in Busia on Thursday, the Ford Kenya party leaders said that the Knut Secretary General has shown interest in being his running mate. “I want to be the fifth president of Kenya and I will go everywhere to look for votes. Sossion wants to be my running mate and I urge him to field for votes from his community. Kenyan teachers will be my good will ambassadors,” he said.  Wetang’ula called on all communities in Kenya to join hands and support one other. “There is no alternative to peace in this country. We have experienced challenges in peace in 1993, 1997, 2007, 2017 and this should not occur again, we need to be together as one,” he said. The senator regretted that the handshake will not solve the problems bedeviling the nation, unless serious issues such as electoral injustice are addressed. “You will not address electoral injustice through a handshake but rather through reforms of the law and the constitution,” he said. Wetang’ula urged the people to stand with him in his quest for the presidency. “I want to form government with others or others to form government with Weta, either way I must lead my people to greater prosperity to run the country’s affairs in a better fashion,” he said.
