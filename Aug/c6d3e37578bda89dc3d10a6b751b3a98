 A 43-year-old Tanzanian woman might spend 30 years behind bars after pleading guilty to charges of human trafficking before a Milimani court. Kwandu Cheye was charged with transporting a seven-year-old disabled child to Kenya to use her for labour. She committed the offence between May and August. Members of the public spotted the minor begging in Shauri Moyo in Nairobi and reported to the police. Police took Cheye together with the minor to the Government Chemist for DNA testing. It was confirmed that the woman is not the boy's mother. Cheye admitted committing the offence before Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi. But Andayi declined to admit Cheye's plea of guilty because the offence is serious, and attracts a minimum of 30 years jail term. The magistrate explained the seriousness of the charges and warned her of the penalties. But Cheye maintained the guilty plea. Andayi directed the state to offer legal aid to Cheye as a vulnerable litigant. He told Cheye to fill a form and formally apply to be provided with legal assistance from the National Legal Aid Service Board. He released her on a Sh500,000 bond with two sureties, who must be Kenyans Read: Two Tanzanian child traffickers to spend 42 years in jail each Also read: Disabled persons smuggled from TZ to beg in Kiambu Click here for the latest political news
