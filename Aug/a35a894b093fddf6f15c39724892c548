Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya has urged county assemblies within the Lake Region Economic Bloc to swiftly pass bills to make the bloc operational. All the 14 county assemblies are expected to approve the LREB Bill 2018 to give t counties authority to carry on with the league’s programmes. Priority areas include food security, revival of the ailing sugar industry, conservation of forests, establishment of a regional bank to offer low-interest loans and promoting commerce and transport in Lake Victoria. Speaking at the county chambers when he signed the Billon Tuesday, Oparanya said it authorises the Kakamega government to legally participate in the programmes of the bloc. The bloc brings together 14 counties with a total population of 14 million people. They are Kericho, Nandi, Bomet, Kisii, Nyamira, Migori, Homa Bay, Siaya, Kisumu, Kakamega, Vihiga, Busia, Bungoma and Trans Nzoia. Oparanya said the desire to integrate the economies of the member counties is the motivation for the counties to come together. “The majority of our people are languishing in poverty due to decades of marginalisation and ineffective policies by the previous highly centralised regimes. Being the chair of the bloc and the first to enact the Bill, we have demonstrated that we lead by example,” he said.
