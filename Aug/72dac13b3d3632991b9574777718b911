The recovery of land parcels illegally occupied by non members of the giant Katelembo Athiani Muvuti Farming and Raching Co-operative Society in Machakos is 80 percent Complete. The society's Manager Sebastian Muli yesterday told the Star that a task force formed to Investigate the matter was already widing up the process. "We are now happy that a majority of the members who had issues have already been settled and big chunk of the land parcels that had disputes have already been recovered", he said. Muli said that the disputes were a post colonial problem orchestrated by some workers who worked for the white settler but refused to buy shares with the society when the settler was moving out. "We had some people who worked for the white settler but when the settler decided to sell the land and move out, they refused to buy shares with the society and instead started occupying plots allocated to members who did not stay around", he said. Alongside the recovery of the disputed plots, Muli said that the committee was also in the process of issuing title deeds to the members. He said that the title deeds were being issued for plots measuring half an acre and 2.04 acres. "Our society has 3,525 members and so far we have issued title deeds to about three quarter of this number. The only block remaining with a few members without title deeds is Central/Machakos town block 3", he said. Muli said they had a target of completing the issuance of title deeds by September or October this year. He said that once the two processes are full completed they will petition for the dissolution of the society. "Our society does not have any loans to pay and so after each member gets his/her plot we will have no need of a Society. We will call a general meeting from where members will now resolve to have the society liquidated", said Muli. The once troubled society is currently under the Chairmanship of Wilson Muema who took offer after the passing of the previous chairman Peter Kamba.
