Mombasa governor Hassan Joho is ready to have his relatives prosecuted if they are beneficiaries of the grabbed Kibarani dumpsite. Joho said the war on impunity started by his administration will spare no one and must succeed. Just like President Uhuru Kenyatta, Joho said he is willing to lose allies in the graft war. He aims to leave a legacy that will act as a launch pad for his 2022 presidential campaigns. Joho is serving his last term. The first one was dogged by corruption allegations he is trying to shake off. The public questioned the status of the dumpsite after structures started coming up. Developers said government officials issued title deeds and approved construction.

There was also a threat from Unesco to delist Mombasa as a tourism destination. On Thursday, General Tyres, one of developers accused of grabbing 0.4991 ha (1.2 acres) of Kibarani land, surrendered the title deed. But according to records, Halid Ahmed is listed as the owner of the land. Joho received the document at the Kenya School of Government On Friday. “Those people who possess land at Kibarani should relinquish their tittle deeds even if you are my kin,” he said. Appearing on behalf of the company on Thursday, Akra Mohamed, who handed in the document, said the firm was heeding a government call.
