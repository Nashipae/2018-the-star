Police are looking for a man who has been posting photographs of children on social media and claiming he has defiled them. Via Twitter on Sunday, the IG directed the DCIO to investigate the suspect who works at a security firm, according to his Facebook profile. The order by the IG followed public outcry and the sharing of the photo of one of the alleged victims. The man identifies himself as Bakibaki Hanga in the profile and says he studied criminology. One of his photos is of a form two girl and another of a younger one, whom he says he will invite to his house, buy her soda and then defile her. Hanga said in the message that he is not afraid of police, whom he referred to as dogs. If arrested, the suspect could be charged with violating Section 12 of the Sexual Offences Act, which notes a jail term of not less than five years or a fine of not less than Sh500,000. The law states that a person commits an offence is he/she manufactures or distributes any article that promote or ar intended to promote a sexual offence with a child. It is also illegal to supply or display to a child "any article which is intended to be used in the performance of a sexual act, with the intention of encouraging or enabling that child to perform such sexual act".
