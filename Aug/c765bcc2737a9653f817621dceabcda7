NASA co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka has told President Uhuru Kenyatta that he wants to get fully involved in the peace deal he signed with Raila Odinga. Kalonzo said following the handshake with Raila, other opposition leaders Moses Wetang’ula, Musalia Mudavadi and Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu should also be brought on board. The Wiper leader said he took a seat at the building bridges negotiating table so that his party and the Kamba community do not miss out on the likely gifts. "If Raila joined the table, should we miss out or should we be in it? The outcome is likely to see us [Kambas] deliver a President in future," Kalonzo said. He attended a funds drive at Gai Secondary School in Kyuso district, Mwingi North. Kalonzo declared he will not back Raila if he runs for President in 2022, saying he has played second fiddle long enough. He said he will be on the ballot paper.

He was with Ngilu, with whom he has forged a working relationship, and MPs Paul Nzengu (Mwingi North), Charles Nguna (Mwingi West), Thaddeus Zambia (Kilome) and his son, who is also EALA MP, Kennedy Musyoka. The MPs urged Kalonzo to go for the presidency. He hinted at a more structured deal with Uhuru, opposed to that with Raila, which he termed a ‘hard-shake’. The Nasa co-principal said he will transform the party into a formidable movement whose impact will be felt across the country. Ngilu said she will support Kalonzo in 2022. She urged him to focus on other regions and allow her to drum up support in Kitui for his bid. "We will put in place machinery at home to ensure the votes here are intact," the governor said.
