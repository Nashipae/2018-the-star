Handling of sugar at the Mombasa port is unhygienic as the equipment used to transport and scoop sugar are the same ones used on fertilisers, and cement, Nyeri woman representative Rahab Mukami has said. Mukami said the Trade committee, in which she is a member, observed this after the a visit to the port. Mukami, who was speaking to the media in Othaya on Saturday, blamed Kenya Bureau of Standards for sleeping on the job. She added that it was the responsibility of Kebs to ensure sugar in the shelves is good for human consumption.
