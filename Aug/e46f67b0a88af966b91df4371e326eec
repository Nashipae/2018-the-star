Livestock farmers and traders in Samburu county are incurring huge losses due to a shrinking market. They said middlemen no longer visit the county to buy their livestock. The middlemen were their link to lucrative markets in Nairobi and Nakuru. Lesomoja Benjamin walked more than 100km from Baragoi to Maralal town to look for a market. “I have trekked for four days to bring these cows here but I have not sold even a single cow. We are forced to try our luck at Lekuru or Rumuruti livestock markets, which are far away from here,” he said yesterday. Daudi Lemarsile complained that after having bought a bull in Baragoi at Sh50,000 and expecting to sell it at a profit, the highest offer he got at the Maralal livestock market was Sh30,000. However, the farmers and traders are hopeful that their problems will be solved after Governor Moses Lenolkulal signed the County Livestock Sale Yards Bill 2018 yesterday. The aim of the law is to improve livestock markets. “I am hopeful that the law will assist us and enable us to get a good profitable market for our animals outside the county,” another trader said. Lenolkulal also signed the County Trade Bill and the Spatial Planning Bill.
