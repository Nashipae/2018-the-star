The authority of Parliament as the paragon of virtue and guardian of public
interest is under severe test. The activities of the two houses, especially the
committees, are antithetical to Parliament’s motto – For the just governance of
men. The MP’s title Honourable should, surely, mean something. But, alas, their
conduct is increasingly anything but honourable.  From many claims of
impropriety to the grandstanding of the Majority leaders, Parliament has become
a crying shame. Its penchant for usurping the powers of other institutions needs to be
tamed. Immediately an incident is reported, MPs launch investigations and summon
concerned parties. Yet there are more competent bodies charged with
investigations. Parliament is not designed to undertake primary investigations
but direct the relevant bodies to do so and report back for direction. As we have seen in the parallel probe into sugar, land grabbing and
expenditure queries, Parliament is hopelessly incapable of carrying out any
serious investigations. Its adventurism is motivated by opportunities for self-enrichment
through sitting allowances, extortion and other schemes. Similarly worrying is the meddling in Parliament’s work by elements in the Executive
desirous of protecting tin gods in the Establishment. This streak is unethical
and inimical to the separation of powers. It should be reined in by constitutional
amendments to delineate the roles of different institutions once and for all.
