Machakos county commissioner Abdulahi Galgalo has warned security chiefs against laxity. He said on Wednesday that officers must maintain law and order, protect residents and investigate crimes. On Tuesday night thugs attacked more than five people at The Hague Pub in Masii shopping centre, Mwala subcounty. They suffered serious injuries and were admitted at Machakos Level 5 Hospital. On Wednesday morning, residents held protests against rising crime in Masii. Police fired teargas to disperse them after they barricaded roads and lit bonfires. The residents accused security officers of being asleep on the job and demanded action be taken before the situation spirals out of hand. Galgalo blamed the assaults on police inaction and ordered county police commander Samuel Mukindia to crack the whip. “Sorry for those who got injured in Masii. We won’t allow laxity. Some people did not do their job well. Heads must roll,” he said at a joint press briefing with Governor Alfred Mutua. Mutua urged police to weed out criminals so residents can go about their business without fear. “I’ve met with the county security committee and emphasised the need to rid Machakos of insecurity witnessed in the recent past. I urge residents to cooperate with the security organs to ensure peace and tranquility prevails,” he said. The county chief told residents to be vigilant and report suspected criminals so they can be arrested and prosecuteed. Galgalo said those who cannot discharge their duties will be shown the door. Everyone will carry his or her own cross, he said.
