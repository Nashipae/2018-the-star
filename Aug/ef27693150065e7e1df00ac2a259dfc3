Deputy
President William Ruto heads to Kisii today, in a visit seen as another attempt to
seek the community's support in 2022. The DP is
making his fifth trip to Kisii and Nyamira counties since last year’s elections. Ruto’s
latest visit was on Friday last week, when he attended the burial of former
Cabinet minister Henry Obwocha at Sironga in Nyamira county. He used the opportunity
to enumerate several projects initiated by the Jubilee government. Today, DP
will meet leaders at Deputy Governor Joash Maangi’s Riagongera home before
proceeding to Tendere, where he will hold a funds drive for Bomachoge
Borabu/Chache Boda Boda Sacco. Maangi confirmed
the DP’s visit saying, “The DP is an old friend. He will pass by my home for
breakfast with opinion leaders before heading to a funds drive at Tendere.” “Don’t read too much into the visit. There is
nothing wrong with visiting long time friend for a cup of tea,” Maangi said on the phone. Read: DP Ruto intensifies 2022 campaign in drives disguised as official duties Click here for
