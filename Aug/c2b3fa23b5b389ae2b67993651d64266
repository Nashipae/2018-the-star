Former world 400m hurdles champion Nicholas Bett will be laid to rest today at his family home in Simat village, Uasin Gishu County. It was sorrow and tears as his body left Eldoret Hospital Mortuary yesterday afternoon, heavily guarded by Kondele and Kisumu West police officers, where he served before moving to Lang’ata Police Station. The late National Police Service Corporal, who became the first Kenyan to win the 400m hurdles gold medal at 2015 World Championships in Beijing, China, died last week following a road accident at Cengalo area, along Kapsabet-Nakuru highway in Nandi County. As the hearse left the hospital, the procession brought Eldoret town to a standstill, as the police and athletes’ vehicles snaked through Uganda Road, turning to Oginga Odinga Street before connecting Eldoret-Kisumu road where they were met by athletes donning national team colours and waving the national flag. It was a long procession up to the new Rift Valley Textiles (Rivatex) company before vehicles sped off to Simat. Former world 3,000m steeplechase champion Milcah Chemos, former world javelin champion Julius Yego, former world 800m champions Janeth Jepkosgei and Eunice Sum, former world and Olympic champion Asbel Kiprop, former world 800m champion Kirwa Yego and road runner specialist Sally Kipyego were among the high profile Police runners who came to give their compatriot a heroic send-off. According to local organizing chairman Abraham Mutai, Athletics Kenya (AK) Central Rift chairman, top athletes across the world will be attending the burial ceremony. “We are expecting International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) and Confederation of Africa Athletics (CAA) officials tomorrow,” said Mutai. Area Member of Parliament, Oscar Sudi, revealed that Deputy President William Ruto will be among the dignitaries expected at the burial ceremony this morning.
