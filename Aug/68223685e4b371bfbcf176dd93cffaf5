Akothee has responded to haters who call her children ugly. In a video she posted yesterday, Akothee claimed to be the richest female artiste in Kenya, adding that those hating on her children cannot afford the lifestyle she gives them. “As you sit down to discuss that Akothee is one of the artistes with the most ugliest children with many husbands, please note! Don’t forget to give me credit that I am the richest female artiste in Kenya with the best body after popping five children. You can’t all have negative things, at least I have a positive thing. Forget about beauty, that one is upon the beholder’s eyes, depends on what you want to see. What I know is that... you will be living my life on data bundles.”
