Police in Webuye on Friday night gunned down three thugs who have been terrorising residents of Bungoma. Bungoma East DCI boss Paul MumoMumo said an AK 47 rifle, two magazines and 53 bullets were recovered. He said the thugs are believed to have been part of a gang that shot and injured an old man and his daughter three weeks ago in Matulo, Webuye West constituency. The two were attacked in their shop at night. They were rushed to Webuye Subcounty Hospital where they were operated on and bullets removed from their bodies. Bungoma East DCI boss Paul Mumo, who led the operation, said the thugs were killed after police trailed them. "Acting on a tip-off, officers laid an ambush. Police tried to stop the thugs on motorbikes, but they refused and fired at them. Police gunned them down," Mumo said. He said police are hunting for suspects who fled towards Kitale town. He said the gang had planned to attack residents of Chesamis. Mumo said one of the suspects identified as Ezekiel Omayi Ngome alias Zakayo Kibet has been on the police's "most wanted list". He said Ngome is a friend of Peter Kibet alias Cheparakach, who is in police custody over the Mt Elgon killings in Bungoma. Mumo said Zakayo escaped from a police van on his way from Kimilili court when he was being taken back to Bungoma Prisons in 2016. Mumo said the three suspects who escaped are armed and dangerous. He told residents to give police information that will lead to their arrests. "This three are believed to be part of a gang that has been harassing people in Bungoma, Malaba, Kitale and Eldoret. They can run but will not hide," he said The thugs also robbed a supermarket in Eldoret two weeks ago and killed three people. Kimilili ward MCA David Barasa praised the police for killing the thugs. He said residents have been living in fear. The bodies were taken to Webuye Subcounty Hospital morgue. Click here for the latest political news
