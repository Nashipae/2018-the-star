Unsafe crossings, failure to observe traffic rules and scarce footbridges are to blame for the increase of pedestrian deaths in Nairobi. According to the National Transport and Safety Authority’s latest statistics on road accidents, pedestrians have remained the most vulnerable road users with 687 having died countrywide since January. The statistics released early this week indicate that as of August 5, a total of 1,789 people had lost their lives compared to 1,708 who perished during the same period in 2017. The Northern Corridor and Nairobi County Route Hazard Mapping Report by NTSA stated major roads within the county lacked safe pedestrian crossings which resulted in pedestrians crossing at any point of the road, especially near roundabouts. Matatu Owners Association chairman Simon Kimutai yesterday said the lack of enough footbridges and ignorance of pedestrians in observing traffic rules can also be attributed to the rise pedestrian deaths within the city.
