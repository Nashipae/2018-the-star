Police in Makueni county are looking for a pastor alleged to have raped a 25-year-old woman who had sought a prayer intervention at his house. Police, in a report on the Wednesday 10pm incident, said the pastor, who is still at large, was reported to have committed the act at Katune village. The victim, a married mother of three, says she had attended the prayers with her
sister-in-law and her mother-in-law. The pastor, only identified as Pastor Mutua, lured them to one-on-one 'consultation'. She says that when her turn came, the pastor not only prayed but also touched her in an inappropriate manner before raping her in the pretext of exorcising demons. "When the session with the pastor ended, she walked outside and narrated her ordeal to the rest with a view of establishing whether they were taken through a similar process but they told her it was not so," the police report states. Together, they confronted the pastor but he refuted the allegations and fled on a motor cycle. The victim was escorted to Emali model clinic for initial medical check-up by the family members and later filed the complaint with the police. Officers from Emali police station visited the scene of the incident as investigations into the incident continue. Click here for the latest political news
