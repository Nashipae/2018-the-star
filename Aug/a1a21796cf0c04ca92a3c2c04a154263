A governor and two MPs were all smiles yesterday after the Court of Appeal in Nairobi said they were validly elected. The court dismissed petitions against Laikipia governor Ndiritu Muriithi, Gatundu North MP Wanjiku Kibe and her Mbeere counterpart Geoffrey Kingangi. Kilgoris constituency voters will, however, have a by-election after MP Gideon Konchella’s victory was nullified. Former Minister and MP Julius Sunkuli challenged Konchella’s election. In the Laikipia case, judges Asike Makhandia, Fatuma Sichale and Sankale ole Kantai rejected a claim that Ndiritu should have been barred from running because he ditched Jubilee Party a few days to the election. The judges said petitioner Sammy Waity should have used the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal or a judicial review application at the High Court to have the issue settled. “There was no merit in the case to warrant the reversal of the High Court decision,” the court said.
