Five ODM lawmakers have said they will push for the sacking of Treasury CS Henry Rotich and his EAC counterpart Adan Mohamed over last year’s duty-free sugar imports. Mohamed was the Trade CS at the time. They are Alego Usonga MP Samuel Atandi, Homa Bay Woman representative Gladys Wanga, Rosa Buyu (Kisumu), Catherine Wambilianga (Bungoma) and Mathare MP Anthony Oluoch. Atandi said legislators will not spare anyone mentioned in the parliamentary report. “There is no need for leaders with no regard for lives to be in office when their key role is service to the people,” he said at Nyanginja Primary School in Siaya on Saturday during a funds drive to improve the school’s infrastructure.
