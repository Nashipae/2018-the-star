The government will extend the mid term break to primary schools from next term, Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed has announced. Amina noted on Tuesday that all children must be given time to rest. Secondary school students enjoy a five-day mid term break but those in primary school study continuously. While noting that teachers also need time to re-energise, Amina advised them against teaching during the holidays. “When we announced the secondary school break, your officials came to us so we shall extend it to primary schools,” she told primary school heads attending a conference in Mombasa on Tuesday. “I’m sure you all support this."

Amina told the meeting of about 10,000 that teachers found working during the holidays will be punished. “You will face the full wrath of this ministry and Kenyans at large because this is something that we have all agreed on. Tuition has been banned during holidays,” she said. Primary schools heads welcomed the new government policy on mid term breaks for public primary schools. Enock Wamalwa from Webuye West said: “For a very long time our counterparts in secondary and boarding primary schools have been enjoying the half term break. We are also going to enjoy the same privilege." Hilda Wamalwa said the decision had been overdue. “We are happy that the CS has considered us,” she said. Christine Abura from Kakamega county said she was impressed by the announcement. “This is something that even parents will appreciate. Teachers will have time to rest and plan for the remainder of the term,” she said.
