Onform national team striker Mwanahalima Adam has opted out of an early deal to sign for Spanish side, Zaragoza after failing to agree on the term.
The Thika Queens’ forward had been approached to sign for the side for a period of 10 months but according to the team manager Fredrick Chege, the deal hit a snag after the player and the club failed to agree on terms.
Chege, however, noted that the latest development was a blessing in disguise. “Before a club signs a deal, they must first of all agree with the player but in this case, Adams and the club failed to agree on certain terms and there was little that could be done,” said Chege.
He added: “The mere fact that a Spanish club approached Adams means she is a good player. What I know is that she will soon land a good deal. We are glad we will still have her services in the second leg as we target to reclaim the trophy we last won in 2016.”
The official at the same time revealed that two of his team players, Faith Kwamboka and Christine Kitaru, have landed a five-year scholarship with Kansas University in the United States. Chege said the two will depart today for the USA.
He said: “Besides the sports, we also want these players to invest in their education and I’m glad the two will be studying their preferred courses at the University.”
Thika, who are the current league leaders, have at the same time signed two players ahead of the second leg. The two players are speedy forward Esse Akida from Spedag and midfielder Judith Musembe from Soccer Queens.
Chege said all this is meant to help his side recapture the trophy and at the same time post positive results.
He said: “They are good players and we are happy to have them. We can only hope for the best going forward. At the same time, we have loaned two players—Sarah Njeri and Esther Nyakanini —to Mombasa Olympic.”
