The University of Nairobi and private sector players have partnered to fight corruption. The initiative dubbed "Anti-corruption Enforcement in the Private Sector", was launched at the UoN on Friday. It brought together the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM) and scholars. They will come up with strategies to promote ethical and legal business in Kenya. This is a boost to President Uhuru Kenyatta's efforts to combat graft. KAM’s acting chief executive officer Tobias Alando said escalating corruption is a major concern for the private sector. “Corruption is one of the most significant constraints to private sector development. We need to strengthen institutions to enable them investigate corruption and prosecute perpetrators,” he said. UoN’s Deputy Vice Chancellor Julius Ogeng’o applauded the steadfast efforts of academia in formulating measures to tackle graft. “We recognise the role of academia in providing awareness and extensive research on the social and economic impact of corruption,” he said. KAM head of policy Job Wanjohi said Kenyans need to change the perception of success and operate within modest ways. He said Kenyans have overlooked honesty and have made corruption a tradition. “Corruption has become a culture. We need to look at our curriculum right from primary school and change perceptions,” he said. Lady Justice Hedwig Ong’udi said the fight against corruption is collective responsibility that needs the input of all players. Click here for the latest political news
