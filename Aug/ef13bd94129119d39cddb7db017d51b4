A workers' union has called off a strike at Kenyatta National Hospital after reaching a return-to-work formula. Kenya Union of Domestic, Hotels, Educational Institutions, Hospitals and Allied Workers (Kudheiha), which represents 4,700 workers, had called for industrial action over non-payment of members’ allowances by Kenyatta National Hospital. This was the recommendation by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission in 2005. Chief Shop steward Kennedy Meme told the Star on Monday that union officials signed an agreement that will see members resume duty immediately. “After lengthy negotiations with the management of KNH, we have signed a return-to-work formula . Our members are back to work,” Meme said. Under the terms of the agreement, workers will receive revised house allowance from the end of September 2018 . KNH chief executive Thomas Mutie signed the document, clearing the way for workers to resume duty, along with Director of Corporate Services Carylus Odiango, Deputy Human Resources Director Elphas Choge and Corporate Secretary Calvin Nyachoti. Kudheiha officials who signed the agreement are chairperson Pius Cheboi, Secretary General Albert Njeru and Chief Shop steward Kennedy Meme. Earlier today, police fired teargas to disperse KNH nurses who staged a strike in A push for health workers' service allowance. The health workers vowed not to continue with the strike despite pleas by Mutie. Mutie had a letter from the President's office explaining the increment in house allowances. But the striking nurses argued that the letter, that was read to them, did not address all their needs and issues to do with the welfare of health workers.
