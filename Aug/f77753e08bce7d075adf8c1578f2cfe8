One person died while 18 were seriously injured when a boiler exploded at Thika's Junglenut factory on Friday night. The macadamia factory is owned by Thika MP Patrick Wainaina. Joseph Murigi, its human resource manager, said an electric fault may have caused the blast. Kenya Power workers had been carrying out repairs when the explosion occurred. Murigi said more than 400 workers were inside the establishment at the time and that the 18 got injured as they scampered for safety. Residents who rushed to the scene after the loud noise said they found rescue operations going on. Thika Level 5 Hospital medical superintendent, Patrick Nyagah, said they received 16 women and two men. He said they were at different stages of diagnosis but that they were all stable. The body was taken to the mortuary at General Kago Hospital. Click here for the latest political news
