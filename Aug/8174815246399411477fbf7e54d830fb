Comedian Oga Obinna
has for the first time opened up about his baby mamas. The father of three
told Word Is that contrary to rumours, he is in good terms with them. "We've had our ups and downs, but the
minute you have a child with somebody, it is a bond that will last forever, even
when the mothers have gotten married to other men," he said. "The background
that I come from is tough, and I wouldn't want my children to go through the
same." The comedian and
events host said he knows some celebrities who have abandoned their
children to poverty and are enjoying the good life just to look good in the
public eye. "I know a lot
of people who are in the media and aren't taking care of their kids. The kids
are suffering and the dads are popping champagne," he said. "I know them and I know their
kids. I feel so bad about that and in my head I am like, why would you do that
to your children? I don't want to live in a good house or even wear good
clothes yet my children are suffering. "I would sacrifice and if it is my baby
mama, I will even kneel down even if I know she is the one who is wrong and even
sacrifice my ego just to see my children go to the best schools and even get
the best life they would want." So, when is the
wedding? "I'm not
planning to have any wedding, and the reason is I would like things to happen
when they will be fit to happen. If that will happen, let it happen on its own
course, but in my head now, I am not thinking of having any wedding soon." He said he enjoys being a father. "Being a dad
is amazing and very tough, because sometimes you don't know what to do to your
kids when they do wrong. Kids make you happy when you are home and sometimes
children believe their dad is their personal gods for whatever
reason." Obinna
will be headlining the Guiness FanZone event in Nakuru this coming weekend. He
will be performing alongside Naiboi, King Kaka, Khaligraph, Fena Gitu and Jua Cali. DJs on the decks will include Joe Mfalme and Chris Darlin.
