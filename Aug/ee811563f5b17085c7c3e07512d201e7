More than 20 Uasin Gishu residents die from drinking illicit brew every month, a county government report has found. It cites Huruma, Kamkunji and Langas estates among the areas with the highest consumption of illicit brew. Uasin Gishu governor Jackson Mandago said strict regulations may be introduced to fight illicit brews. “If possible, the Chiefs Act, which was abolished, should be reintroduced so that we give them more powers to deal with people who have refused to reform,” he said. Mandago spoke on Thursday during the graduation of 1,200 former brewers. They were trained on alternative income generating activities. Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo and West Pokot counties sponsored the  training conducted at Empowering Lives International Centre in Ilula. Mandago and his Elgeyo Marakwet counterpart Alex Tolgos attended the graduation and said alcoholism was a big problem. Mandago said, “It is encouraging when women decide to shun brewing. This means the source has been conquered. I have faith that this will bring about the change we have always wanted.” He said reintroducing the Chiefs Act would help fight alcoholism and alleviate poverty. “The youth have been given chances to study for free in technical colleges. It would be disturbing to find them still idling and engaging in alcoholism,” Mandago said. He said the county would hold more training programmes for the reformed women and youth at Chebororwa Agricultural Training Centre. They will be trained on farming.Tolgos said reforming women would have a positive impact on the society. “Alcohol has been affecting development, but with the move to reform the brewers, we have made strides in eliminating the problem,” he said. Tolgos also advised the women to form groups to benefit from government loans and tenders.
