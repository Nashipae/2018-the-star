President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to return to Mombasa next week for the 14th Kenya Primary School Heads Association conference.  Uhuru left Mombasa on Tuesday after spending two weeks in the coastal city amid speculation on an impending Cabinet reshuffle.  Speculations began after the President quietly retreated to Mombasa and held meetings with Opposition leader Raila Odinga, the team spearheading the Building Bridges Initiative, Mombasa governor Hassan Joho and select Cabinet Secretaries.  He left after opening the 10th Africa Confederation of Principals conference at Pride Inn Hotel.  "I would have loved to stay longer and listen to a few presentations, but I have to go back to Nairobi. I have been in Mombasa for two weeks and there has been too much speculation on why I am here," Uhuru said.  The Kepsha annual conference will be held at the Sheikh Zayeed Centre in Nyali.  This year’s theme is “Education and Skills Agenda Accelerating Progress Towards Vision 2030.”  Uhuru is also expected to officially open the Mombasa International Agricultural Show on the last week of August but it is not yet clear whether the President will be at the Coast for another two weeks.  Events scheduled show Uhuru will address the over 10,000 primary school heads who will be attending the conference.  The conference comes even as Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) has threatened to call for a nationwide strike if talks with the government are not fruitful  The talks will be held on August 21. The teachers grievances include a halt to the transfer of school heads, planned teacher performance and appraisal and development and lack of promotion for members.  On Monday, Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion told the Teachers Service Commission to prepare to concede to all the demands.
