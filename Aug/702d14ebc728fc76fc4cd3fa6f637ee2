Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok has nominated Erastus Ethekon as the first county attorney following the creation of the office in April. Nanok made the announcement on Tuesday when he also named Retired Captain Augustine Lokwang’ as the Senior Adviser for Security, Peace Building and Borderlines Initiatives. Security is one of Turkana's main concerns, especially considering its effects on the extraction of oil. On July 26, British firm Tullow Oil suspended operations in the county due to security issues. This was after protesters demanding more security in the area blocked trucks transporting crude oil to Lamu. The matter has been resolved.
