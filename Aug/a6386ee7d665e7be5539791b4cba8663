The closure of Malindi slaughterhouse a month ago due to an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever has hurt businesses. Hotels and butcheries have no meat and consumers have to buy in Kilifi or Mombasa. Over 3,000 people who depend on the slaughterhouse directly have been rendered jobless. Kilifi county government closed the facility following an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in Tana River county where most of the cows slaughtered in Malindi are bought. The people most affected by the closure are cattle sellers, workers at the slaughterhouse, butchery owners and hoteliers. A visit to the slaughterhouse yesterday found the normally busy area deserted, with only a few people around. Suppliers, brokers and workers asked the government to reopen the slaughterhouse to end their suffering. Osman Abdi, a cattle supplier, said they depend on the slaughterhouse for their daily bread and moeny to educate their children. “People have been rendered jobless. We want the slaughterhouse opened. If the outbreak was in Tana River county it’s now over,” he said. Deko Ali who has been operating at the slaughterhouse for 19 years said children have been sent out of school because of lack of fees. They used to slaughter over 40 cattle and a similar number of goats daily. Yunus Isaak said the government should be clear on the issue and tell them if the slaughterhouse was closed because it did not meet health requirements so that they can upgrade it. Omar Galole, a broker at the slaughterhouse, said he has incurred huge debts in the shops since he is unable to get money from his job.
