Siaya senator James Orengo wants the National Assembly Speaker to suspend committee meetings for two weeks to allow time to probe bribery claims. “Besides their oversight role, both houses have powers to summon and even impeach. That’s why we can’t allow honourable members to misbehave,” he said on Saturday. There have been claims some legislators were bribed to kill the sugar report that had recommended that Treasury CS Henry Rotich, his EAC counterpart Adan Mohamed and ex-Agriculture CS Willy Bett be held responsible for of contraband sugar. It is said other names of VIPs were deleted. It is said some lawmakers pocketed as little as Sh10,000 to defeat the report. The revelation caused a public outcry. On Saturday, Speaker Justin Muturi called on the EACC to investigate. Orengo said in Ugunja that leaders hell-bent on enriching themselves at the people’s expense must be punished. The Senate Minority leader said Parliament must uphold integrity. “When JM Kariuki was murdered in cold blood, Parliament stood firm with its report,” Orengo said. He was accompanied by Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo and Ugunja’s Opiyo Wandayi. Odhiambo condemned some of his colleagues for “stooping too low. It was sad to know that my colleagues could be compromised with cheap money like Sh10,000,” he said. Odhiambo told voters to be on the lookout so they don’t reelect bribe-takers in 2022. Wandayi urged the media to disclose the names of MPs captured taking bribes to avoid blanket condemnation. He said not all legislators are corrupt. “Provide names and photos of those who pocketed the cash,” the PAC chairperson said.
