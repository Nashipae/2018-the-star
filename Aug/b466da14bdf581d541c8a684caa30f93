Three Lamu fishermen went missing when their boat capsized in the Indian Ocean on Thursday afternoon. The three were reported missing on Friday as they did not return to their homes after the incident near Kiwayu island in Lamu East. Four fishers from Kizingitini village had been heading to the high seas in Kiwayu and Ndau, as they usually did, when their boat was overpowered by strong winds and tides. Omar Shali survived - he swam to safety and reported the accident, involving the boat christened Subira, to the Kiwayu chief. Shali identified his colleagues as Athman Ali, Lali Shali and Huri Kale. “The place where the boat capsized is very deep. The wind was so strong that the boat could not withstand it," he said. "I only recall falling into the water. Then I didn't see my friends. I swam for hours to the shore. I hope they are safe somewhere and that they will be found." Lamu county commissioner Joseph Kanyiri said a search was mounted but that turbulent tidal waves, a usual experience in Kiwayu and nearby areas, presented a challenge. “The area where the boat capsized has very rough tides that are giving the search team a hard time but hopefully, we shall find them alive,” Kanyiri said. He advised fishermen to stay in touch with their Beach Management Units while at sea for the sake of prompt interventions in case of danger. On June 1, two fishermen perished after their boat capsized at Manda-Maweni area around Lamu town. The county's worst incident took place on August 13, 2017 when ODM politician Shekue Kahala lost 12 family members - including his four young children, wife, sister, nieces and nephews - after their boat capsized at Manda Bruno area. He was the only survivor. On June 20 last year, 10 people died in a dhow accident at the Mkanda channel in Lamu East.
