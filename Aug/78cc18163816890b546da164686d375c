"Once the five arrive in the city, they will be taken to court." The suspects will be charged with abuse of office, conspiracy to defraud, fraudulent acquisition of public funds, unauthorised spending of public funds, and neglect of official duty. Mubea said only eight out of the 16 suspects have been arrested. A man-hunt is on for the other eight. "Our officers are on ground looking for the others," he said. The commissioner said NCPB has incurred a debt of Sh11.3 billion in the form of maize supplied to them. "Out of that only Sh7 billion has been paid, there is still a debt of 4.3 billion," he said. Mubea further said genuine farmers have not been paid by the cereals board. "We had alleged farmers who actually don’t have farms who are actually supplying to the cereals board and are been paid in record time," he said.
