Kikuyu musician Muigai wa Njoroge is not new to controversy. He has ruffled political feathers with the release of his music video Mbari ya Kimendero (The Greedy), which has gone viral. Muigai calls men in power "dinosaurs" and "corrupt leaders who are working day and night to make sure the water (services) will not reach Wanjiku". Some say he may be taking a jab at the current top office holders after a slew of corruption cases hit the headlines. The scathing political song highlights Kenya's poor leadership. "Do you have to be in government so you can be rich? Are we all supposed to vie for a sit so we can embezzle public funds and be rich? Know the purpose of being in those positions, otherwise I will sing again and again until we get the change we have always wanted," Muigai told Word Is. "I am not saying that they should use their salary to help the mwananchi, no, let them make use of the public funds in the right way so it gets to the intended person. "There is one MP who called me and told me that I have lied by saying they steal a lot. Akaniambia, 'Mimi nakulanga elfu kumi pekee' [He told me 'I only take Sh10,000]. He confessed they take bribes and that in Kenya we cannot survive without stealing." Muigai said the song has been well received. "...people needed to hear this but no one has the guts to speak out. At least I have done it." He said his family is supportive, especially his wife "though they fear I may be arrested. But I told them I have just highlighted their acts." He said no politician sponsored the song. "I have received threats because of a section of my songs, some telling me that I am not going far. But I don't care. No one will live forever." Muigai has also produced other scathing songs. In 2012, he together with Kamande wa Kioi and John Demathew were charged with propagating hate speech through their songs.
