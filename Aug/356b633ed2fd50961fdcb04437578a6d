Elsewhere, Kenya’s Titus Ekiru set won the Mexico City International Marathon in a new course record of 2:10:38 on Sunday. Ekiru smashed the previous course record of 2:11:12 and secured the second marathon victory of his career. Edwin Koech came home second in 2:12:35 with Matthew Kisorio completing a Kenyan clean sweep. In his fourth marathon since making his debut at the distance in 2016, Ekiru pocketed about Sh2.7 million for his effort. He became the third Kenyan in six years to win the race. “I enjoyed the course. The altitude of Mexico City (2,240m) is similar to Kenya so it did not affect me much,” said Ekiru, who has a PB of 2:07:43. “I am very happy to set a record and I realised at 20km that I could really break a new record.” Pamela Biwott was the highest placed Kenyan in the women’s category when she came home fifth in 2:41.09. Ethiopia made a clean sweep of the top four medium positions with Etaferahu Temesgen topping the event in 2:40:10 to take her first ever win over  the distance in her eighth marathon. The 26-year old, who boasts of  a 2:29:24 life-time best set in Ottawa in 2015, led Jimma (2:40:24), Tinbit Weldegebriel (2:40:27) and Biruktayit Degefa (2:40:45) home to cement Ethiopia’s dominance in the race.
