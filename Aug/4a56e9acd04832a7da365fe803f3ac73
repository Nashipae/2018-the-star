Police on Wednesday night arrested 45 suspects in Namanga town. The swoop came hours after Kajiado county commissioner David Kipkemei apologised to Namanga town rape victims. Operation Fagia was conducted  by a team of security agents and ambassadors of the Nyumba Kumi initiative. Those arrested are suspected of crimes including being in Kenya illegally, possession of uncustomed goods and having bhang. Kipkemei apologised to the victims, who included a 12-year-old girl and a 25-year-old woman. He  accused the police of laxity. A gang of four men raided Namanga town armed with a gun and pangas. They spent at least two hours in the three houses they broke into. Resident Ali Hassan said the suspects moved freely in the town on Tuesday night as they broke into houses without being spotted. There were no officers on patrol, he said. “How can the police explain this? They were nowhere to be seen as the thugs ruled the town. They walked free from midnight to 6am as officers slept in their homes.” Kipkemei said the Wednesday night operation was the beginning of more swoops to come. “I will not let any officer sleep until we bring to book all suspects who committed the heinous crime.” He went on, “We have increased surveillance in the town. We will work with ambassadors of Nyumba Kumi to improve security in Namanga town.” Kipkemei said the incident took place “because someone failed to provide security”. He added that action will be taken against officers from the local station. Kipkemei said there was a security lapse that made it possible for the gang to rule the town an entire night.“Where were the officers supposed to patrol the town as required? I will ensure those charged with providing security perform their duty.” Kajiado Central police chief James Kimani contradicted the residents when he said the thugs stole Sh1,500 shillings from the home they raped a woman. A victim recorded a statement with the police in Namanga town, saying she lost Sh11,500 and two phones.
