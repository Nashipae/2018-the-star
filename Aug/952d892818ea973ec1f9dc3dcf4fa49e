Tension is high in Mnagoni village in Kilifi after two brothers were stabbed and injured by herders. Jumaa Mwambogo and Ramadhan Shikari were attacked on Tuesday by three herders after they asked the herders whythey were grazing on their farm. “We had not gone to fight but we wanted to ask them to remove their animals from our farm because they were destroying our crops. They did not want to listen to us and that is when they removed their knives and started stabbing my brother. I moved to save him and in the process, they stabbed me in my hand. As I was still struggling with them, the third one came and hit me with a log on my back,” Shikari said.This comes a week after the lapse of a five-day ultimatum the community issued to the pastoralists to vacate the ranch following a fight for pasture and water. In the 1990s, several people were killed by Somali herders, including a senior chief in Bamba. Ganze police boss Patrick Ngeiywa confirmed the incident and said the brothers accused the pastoralists of trespass and destroying cowpeas and green grams, which are yet to be harvested. “Our officers are on the ground and the family has detained the livestock. My officers went there during the night and they could not establish the exact number of the cows but there is no vegetation that has been destroyed. The family is saying that the pastoralists strayed,”Ngeiywa said. They were treated at Bamba subcounty Hospital.
