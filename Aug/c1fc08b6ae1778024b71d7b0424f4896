The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission got a big win on Friday after the High Court ruled that its current composition with three commissioners is legal. Justice Wilfrida Okwany said the IEBC is properly properly constituted. The constitutionality of the commission was questioned after four commissioners resigned. Roselyn Akombe quit in October last year and was followed by vice chairperson Consolata Nkatha and commissioners Paul Kurgat and Margaret Mwachanya in April. That left chairman Wafula Chebukati and commissioners Abdi Guliye and Boya Molu at the electoral agency. Akombe said she had received death threats while the other three said their positions were no longer tenable.  A Baringo voter later moved to court seeking to remove Chebukati and the three commissioners and have the commission disbanded.  Isaiah Biwott said the commission was not properly constituted owing to the exit of the four of its members had paralysed its operations.  He asked the court to bar IEBC from conducting the elections saying it lacks the mandate to carry out its duties and functions.  Okwany said that issue of quorum should not lead to a declaration that the commission is improperly constitute. “It is noteworthy that the issue of the quorum of the commission only arises during the conduct of the business of the commission,” Okwany said.
