Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya has said he is disappointed with the rejection of sugar report by a joint parliamentary committee. He said the rejection of the report and claims of bribery is a clear indication that corruption is fighting back. The joint team comprising members from the agriculture and trade committees was chaired by Kanini Kega. “What happened in Parliament on Thursday is the clearest manifestation of the existence of sacred cows, which paints the House in bad light,” Oparanya said in a TV interview on Friday. He said the 14 governors from the Lake Region Economic Bloc have tabled recommendations to the President on what should be done to revive the ailing sugar sector in Western. MPs on Thursday shot down a report on importation of contaminated sugar. The report had indicted Treasury CS Henry Rotich and his East African Community counterpart Adan Mohammed for failing to regulate sugar importation. ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to form a commission of inquiry to investigate the sugar saga. In a statement on Friday, he said rejection of the report shows MPs are not prepared to perform their duty. Sugarcane farming supports more than 10 million people in Western region, both directly and indirectly.
