ODM plans to discipline six Nyamira MCAs who defied the party and voted to remove Deputy Speaker Duke Omoti. Party chairman n John Mbadi on Thursday wrote to the six, asking them to show cause why they should not be disciplined for defying party. The motion led to the removal of Omoti on Wednesday. The members are Majority leader Duke Masira, Abel Mose, Carolyn Mogere, Monicah Mwamba, Damaris Muoni and George Morara. Mose tabled the motion before the assembly floor. Some 27 MCAs supported the motion, while six voted against it. They six are supposed to respond in writing within seven days. During the debate, Omoti defended himself and accused the speaker of dictatorship. “My office has been having several challenges that I cannot mention before this house. I want to warn the incoming Deputy Speaker to be aware of the challenges he will face in that office and also be aware of the dictatorial aspect of our honorable speaker,” Omoti said during hearings. The MCAs accused Omoti of incompetence and abuse of his office. Ekerenyo Ward MCA Thadeus Nyabaro said Omoti tainted the speaker’s name.
