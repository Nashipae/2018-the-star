President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday asked the African Confederation of Principals to seek observer status at the African Union. Uhuru promised ACP president Thembekile Ndlovu and his deputy, Indimuli Kahi, that he will lobby other head of states to support them to get the position. “We were having discussions with the ACP president and her deputy president, and I was telling them that one of the recommendations is that as African Confederation of Principals, seek the observer status at the African Union,” Uhuru said. The President promised the over 1,200 delegates attending the 10th African Confederation of Principals at Pride Inn Paradise Hotel in Shanzu, Mombasa, he will fully support them. “I promise, if you do that, I will also use my position to lobby my colleague to ensure all African countries are associated with this confederation and, thereafter, create a platform in which you can engage the leaders of the African states,” Uhuru said. He also urged ACP to increase its membership across the continent. The four-day conference has attracted participants from Ghana, Rwanda, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Nigeria and South Africa. “Globalisation is a reality: The world is becoming more inter-connected. There is a need for African principals to partner with other states to help our children embrace subjects in the field of science and technology,” the President said. He said in Kenya has been efforts to change the curriculum to make it more suitable.
