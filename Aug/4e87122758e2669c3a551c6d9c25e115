Residents of Utange Gorofani on Thursday blocked the Bamburi-Utange road as they protested alleged grabbing of public land by a private developer. They lit bonfires near a petrol station, sparking fears of an explosion. Motorists were forced to use alternative routes as the demos lasted for about two hours. Residents claimed the developer had blocked an access road linking Utange and Kiembeni for more than four months. Bamburi ward rep Robert Nyoro and nominated MCA Milka Moraa said the road was graded using county funds. Moraa said the developer blocked the road because "it passed through his land". The MCA is among the people forced to go round the fenced area to access her house. Nyoro said the road was graded using county funds. The MCAs said the developer has hired Maasai morans to guard the fence. Resident Nyarike Abunga said it is unacceptable for the public to be denied use of the road. Police later dispersed the crowd.
