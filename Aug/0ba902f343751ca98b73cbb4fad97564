The Anti-Corruption Court yesterday issued warrants of arrest against four suspects linked with the loss of Sh468 million loss at the National Youth Service. Humphrey Odhiambo, Charles Makau, Patrick Obunya and Samuel Otieno are yet to take plea almost three months after the first batch of accused persons were arraigned.Another suspect Ezekiel Osoro, whose job was to inspect and clear goods at the NYS, presented himself before senior principal magistrate Lucas Onyina facing fraud counts. He denied the charges and was released on similar bail like his co-accused, who include former youth PS Lilian Omollo, former director general Richard Ndubai and more than 50 others. Omollo and her co-accused were charged on May 29. The magistrate directed the accused to go back to court on November 6 when the DPP will amend the charge sheets and consolidate three files. The NYS case initially had 10 files but has been divided into three clusters, the first to be heard on October 29. Click here for
