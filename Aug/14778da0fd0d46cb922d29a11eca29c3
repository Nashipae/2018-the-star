President Uhuru Kenyatta wants government officials who approved construction of buildings on riparian land arrested and prosecuted. Uhuru said the government will continue demolishing buildings until the desired outcome is achieved. The Head of State spoke when he presided over the inauguration of Prism Towers on Thursday. “We will continue demolishing properties constructed on riparian lands, equally punish officials who made approvals for those properties,” he said. “We shall go after all those who issued the illegal permits, be they County or National Government officials. All those who gave these permits will be prosecuted.” Uhuru said the government is doing everything to discourage corruption. “It is possible to do clean business in Kenya, this is what we want to encourage,” he said. The President's remarks come a day after the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) demolished the multi-billion shillings Southend Mall on Lang'ata Road for being on riparian reserve.
