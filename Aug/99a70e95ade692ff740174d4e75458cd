Kaya Tiwi’s hopes to recapture the East Africa Secondary School Games girls’ basketball title went up in smoke following a 69-67 defeat to St Mary’s Kitende of Uganda yesterday in Musenze, Rwanda. Kaya, under the stewardship of Phillip Onyango, won the title in 2016 in Eldoret. However, their quest to emulate that season were dealt a major blow as they failed to go past neighbours Uganda in the first semi-final and will now play home side and last year’s bronze medalists, St Bernadette in the third place play-off today. The finals will now pit Kitende against compatriots and defending champions Buddo Secondary School, who saw off hosts Bernadette 76-39 in the other semi-final Kaya Tiwi trailed 23-17 at the end of the first quarter, before recovering to outscore the Ugandans 17-15 at the end of the second quarter but were behind 38-34 at halftime. The Kenyans appeared to tire in the third quarter and Kitende, who won the title in 2015, led 16-14. The Kenyans would return stronger in the last quarter but their 19-15 success was not good enough to see them reach the final. Kaya’s Julia Akoth sunk in 18 points, while Kitende’s Valerie Namale was her team’s highest scorer with 10. In rugby sevens, Kenya’s Laiser Hill are a match away from winning their maiden regional crown. The Kenyan champions continued with their fine form after making it five wins on the trot in the round bin competition at Busogo University grounds. Laiser beat homeboys Aspeka 19-10 before crashing Mbarara 41-0 in their second clash of the day to remain unbeaten. They face off with last year’s silver medallists, Jinja Secondary School from Uganda, in their final match today. In the girls’ volleyball champions Kwanthanze, who held nerve to see of counterparts Cheptil 3-2 in the semi-final on Thursday, will renew rivalry against homeside GS Indagaburezi in the final today. Today’s clash will be a repeat of the 2015 final where the Kenyan side lost in Huye Rwanda and will be seeking revenge. The side coached by Justine Kigwari came from two sets down to conquer the Rift Valley outfit 19-25, 21-25, 25-16, 25-14, 15-13 in a five-set semi-final thriller. Indagaburezi reigned supreme against their compatriots IPRC Kigali 3-0 (25-15, 25-16 and 25-14).
