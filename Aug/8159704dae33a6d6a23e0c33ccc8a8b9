Nothing can be more bizarre than news that the three
IEBC commissioners who quit
in a huff four months ago have returned, ostensibly to resume duty. Paul Kurgat, Margaret Mwachanya and Consolata Nkatha resigned
on their own accord — whether on their own volition or on the prompting of
their godfathers. They have not been at work.  At the very least, that’s absconding from duty
or desertion from employment. Although the commissioners resigned in April, President
Uhuru Kenyatta has not acknowledged or uttered a word, which
would trigger their replacement. According to the Constitution, the commissioners are
supposed to tender their resignation to the President, who is required to declare
their vacancies within seven days for Parliament to commence the process of
recruitment. However, a legal lacuna exists at the moment. The panel that recruited the sitting commissioners having been
a one-off affair. Parliament is required to set the framework and criteria for recruitment
of new commissioners. But it has abdicated its duty, thanks to political
expediencies. Besides, the commissioners seem to have taken solace in the
High Court’s declaration that they had not followed the procedure for resigning
and therefore their action was null and void. But such wily and nefarious schemes set a bad precedent for the
conduct of public affairs and defeat the purpose of the Constitution. It also
amounts to gross abuse of office which is actionable.
