US President Donald Trump is expected to host President Uhuru Kenyatta at the White House on August 27. The two leaders will discuss ways of broadening their strategic partnership based on shared democratic values and mutual interests. A press statement from the White House notes that Kenya is a vital partner of the United States. It says that Trump and Uhuru's meeting will reaffirm the longstanding relationship between their countries, as a cornerstone of peace and stability in Africa and the broader Indo-Pacific region. The statement also indicates that the two leaders will explore ways to bolster trade and investment while strengthening security cooperation. Trump pledged to support Kenya's unity and peace initiative marked by the handshake by Uhuru and Opposition chief Raila Odinga. Raila, who is ODM leader and a principal of the NASA coalition, announced this after a meeting with ambassador Robert Godec. They discussed the national reconciliation initiative and how there can be no progress without justice. "The US has pledged to support us as we proceed with the task of righting the wrongs that have ailed us for far too long," Raila said in March. Trump weighed in on Kenya's political troubles after the government shut down TV stations over Raila's self-inauguration as the People's President on January 30. At that time, he asked the government to ensure media freedom and avoid restrictive and intimidating moves. Uhuru met with the US leader at the start of the G7 summit in Italy in May last year. The two were photographed shaking hands before the a performance by the La Scala Philharmonic Orchestra in the ancient Greek theatre as part of the G7 Summit.
