President Uhuru Kenyatta has told leaders to stop politicising his relationship with Opposition leader Raila Odinga. He termed the relationship with Raila as a "deeper understanding" meant to fulfil the dreams of Kenya's forefathers. "There comes a time when we should let go of petty politics. There is much deeper understanding between myself and my brother Raila Odinga," Uhuru said. He was speaking on Wednesday at Holy Family Minor Basilica during the 40th anniversary memorial service of the founding President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. "I have heard in the media of rumours about the formation of a political party. But do not misinterpret our understanding with politics," he said. "We should not allow politics to shed the blood of our people. We need to come together and have a common purpose." Raila said the handshake between him and Uhuru was meant to unite Kenyans and enhance development. "Jomo Kenyatta sacrificed for our country. That is why we want to achieve as a people. That is the meaning of our handshake so that we can cross River Jordan and enter Canaan," Raila said. Deputy President William Ruto, Mama Ngina Kenyatta, Cabinet secretaried, Kiambu governor Ferdinand Waititu and his Nairobi counterpart Mike Sonko attended the event. Others are Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, leaders of majority Aden Duale and Kipchumba Murkomen, MPs and other top government dignitaries.
