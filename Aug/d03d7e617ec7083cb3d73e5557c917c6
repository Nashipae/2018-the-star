Former Nominated Senator Joy Gwendo on Monday pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud following a plea bargain deal with the DPP. In the deal, the former legislator has agreed to pay a Kisumu sacco Sh1.7 million, the amount that is the genesis of the case. The politician pleaded guilty to a count of abuse of office and two others of issuing bad cheques before Anti-Corruption Court chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti. She admitted that she issued a cheque of Sh300,000 in favour of Kisumu East Cotton Growers Cooperative Society through CFC Stanbic Kivuliâ€™s development initiative's account yet she knew there were insufficient funds. Gwendo also admitted issuing another cheque on the same day worth Sh950,000. She faced a third count of abuse of office. On the abuse of office allegation, the former senator admitted that on October 23, 2016, at Chiga parish in Kisumu, she used her position as a state officer to confer herself Sh2,226,880, money which belonged to the sacco. More on this: Joy Gwendo charged with stealing Sh2.2m, released on Sh300,000 bail She will be sentenced on December 7 after returning the funds. Crime suspects who strike a deal to pay back their victims are normally shielded from harsh sentences. The court, however, retains the discretion to determine the sentence or penalty on the accused after agreeing to the Plea of Agreement. The politician, who was allowed by the court to settle the amount in four batches, admitted to committing the offence on December 5 at KICC. Following the agreement, the DPP agreed to withdraw two counts of forgery and stealing that the politician had faced. Click here for the latest political news
