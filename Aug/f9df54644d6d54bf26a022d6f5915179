KRA has seized 26 vape cartridges filled with cannabis oil and five one-gram sachets of hashish at the JKIA in Nairobi on Wednesday. Customs and Border Control Commissioner Julius Musyoki said
the items had been hidden in a package of vitamin tablets, sent through a
courier service provider and declared as candy. “The drugs were seized by KRA Customs Enforcement Officers
during a routine check by the K9 team at the Cargo Centre (KQ) Shed,” he said in a statement. The package was subjected to
scanning and intrusive verification. Musyoki said samples were taken to the customs
laboratory for qualitative spot tests that indicated the presence of narcotics. The shipment was later handed to the Anti-Narcotics
Unit for further investigations. Musyoki noted that the Customs and Border Control operations
had improved with the recruitment of eight additional K9
handlers and acquisition of five more police dogs. He said the dogs will cover cover baggage halls and
cargo sheds at the airport, Port of Mombasa and Inland Container Deport in
Embakasi. Twenty kgs of narcotic drugs believed to be heroin were intercepted at the airport in April. They had been concealed as Kericho Gold tea. Read: Police seize 20kg narcotics at JKIA disguised as Kericho Gold tea Click here for the latest political news
