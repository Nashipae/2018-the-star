Labour and Social Protection PS Nelson Marwa has dared cartels in child theft and trafficking saying he will not be cowed. Speaking during the closing of the International Child Protection conference at Daystar University on Friday, Marwa said President Uhuru Kenyatta and the First Lady Margaret take matters of children very serious and will support him. "If you come across any incident where child security is under threat, just call me directly on 0722824839," Marwa said. He said the number can be rang at any time. "But be brief so that you don't confuse me. You know my orientation with security. I will move with terrible speed and activate systems you have never seen in this world," he said. He called for solid evidence to ensure culprits are successfully prosecuted. He said as a country we have to move from a situation where we are told children cases can not be determine due to lack of evidence. He said many cases involving children have dragged due to this reason. He called on children officers to be in the fore front and appear in court whenever cases to do with children are being handled. "A mother goes to the hospital to deliver, only for a child trafficking cartel to wait for her at the gate and steal her baby. Is it fair? If you belong to that group I want to assure you there is no place for you in this country. As for the officers in the field, you have to take cases involving children as though they are your own, otherwise our effort will be fruitless," Marwa added. The PS said issues regarding children are all the same in Africa except the background and context is different. He promised the ministry will do everything it takes to implement recommendations arrived at during this conference. The conference which opened on Wednesday saw more than 462 representatives from more than 21 African countries participate. Click here for the latest political news
