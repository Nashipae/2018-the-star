IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati on Thursday failed to appear before the Justice and Legal Affairs committee. The MPs expected them to shed light on the three commissioners who sought to return to their offices last Friday. Baringo North MP William Cheptumo said they had summoned Chebukati, Commissioners Boya Molu, and Abdi Guliye.

Other issues that were to be discussed include the question of quorum, review of electoral laws ahead of 2022, and tension at the IEBC. The electoral agency is short of four commissioners. This followed the exit
of deputy vice chair Consolata Maina, Commissioners Margaret Mwachanya,
Paul Kurgat, and Roselyne Akombe. Maina and Mwachanya returned to their offices in the wake of the August 10 ruling which held that they did not follow due process while quitting. "We are not happy as a committee with the way Chebukati and his team have handled the summons," Cheptumo said. "They should have planned to be here as the issue of Rwanda does not concern us," the MP added. He said they are not taking the matter of IEBC chaos lightly and that they want the poll agency issues sorted to avert a repeat of the 2017 crisis. The chair has maintained that the High court, in an August 10 judgement on petition 212 of 2018, said the vacancies should be filled by new commissioners.
