After 11 months on the sidelines, Gor Mahia dependable right back Karim Nizigiyimana has been declared fully fit for competitive play. The Burundian suffered a career wrecking injury in September last year where he tore his Achilles and after months of  rehabilitation, he has been given the green light to return to action and could make his return against Bandari in Mombasa on August 7. Gor Mahia head coach Dylan Kerr confirmed the defender’s return. He, however, said that in his  absence, the trio of Innocent Wafula, Philemon Otieno and Wellington Ochieng had superbly proved equal to the task and against the odds, fitted in his shoes. With Karim and Ochieng available, Kerr hinted of relieving the versatile Otieno the defence duties and instead drag him back to his previous holding midfield role. “It’s great to have Karim back…. that adds competition to the right back position with Wellington and Wafula already doing good in the same position. We can now take Philemon back to his favourite position midfield position. His progress has been great since he resumed full training and he could be in action against Bandari,” Kerr told Gor’s official portal. The towering defender resumed training almost a month ago and has expressed his gratitude to his bosses, teammates and fans for their support during the injury spell. He pledged to come back strong when selected and remind the “Green Army” of what they have been missing. “My sincere word of appreciation goes to Gor Mahia as a whole. I thank the club, the chairman who supported me all through. I also thank my team mates for the big support they offered and l thank Gor Mahia fans also for their never ending support and faith in me. Thanks to all and I am back and ready to deliver,” he said.
