Nzoia Sugar coach Nicholas Muyoti faces yet another challenge in  winning his first  SportPesa Premier League match when his side comes up against Vihiga United at Sudi Stadium, Bungoma today. Nzoia have lately been perfecting in draws and an outright win will be a big sigh of relief for Muyoti, who has been under pressure to deliver his first win since taking the leadership mantle from assistant coach, Vincent Sifuma in late July. In his five matches in charge, the former Thika United coach has led the sugar millers to three draws, against Ulinzi Stars, Sofapaka and Wazito, before succumbing to Bandari and Zoo Kericho. The match promises to be a thriller as both teams are separated by just a point with Vihiga oozing in confidence following last weekend’s 1-0 win over Thika, which steered them two places above the red line. Away at Awendo Stadium, a visiting Bandari will be keen to consolidate their second spot when they battle a in-form Sony Sugar. The dockers are yet to fall under Bernard Mwalala and have defied odds to sit second with 51 points, 20 behind champions Gor Mahia and three ahead of third-placed AFC Leopards. On the other hand, Sony are enjoying their best form ever under Patrick Odhiambo where they began the second leg as relegation candidates but have risen to ninth with 27 points. Mathare United, who drew 1-1 with Zoo Kericho in their last outing will be hoping to bounce back to winning ways when they host Kakamega Homeboyz at Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos. Tomorrow, wounded  Chemelil Sugar and Posta Rangers will clash at Chemelil Sports Complex determined to redeem themselves from their midweek beatings. Chemelil fell 2-0 to Tusker while Rangers were downed 1-0 by Sofapaka.
