Kajiado County Commissioner David Kipkemei has blamed the police for laxity leading to the rape of two women Tuesday morning. Kipkemei said the incident could not have happened if police on patrol had not “slept on their job”. “This happened because someone failed to provide security and I promise the people of Namanga that action will be taken against the police officers from the local station,” Kipkemei said on Wednesday evening. The commissioner was reacting to Tuesday’s incident in Namanga border town where thugs raided several homes, defiling a minor and raping a 25-year-old woman. Kipkemei said there was “lapse” in security that allowed thugs to rule the town the entire night. “Where were the officers supposed to patrol the town as is required of them? I will personally look into that matter. I will ensure that those charged with providing security must do their job,” he said. The thugs, who residents claimed had one gun and machetes raided four homes and robbed them of cash and property. No arrest had been made, more than 24 hours after the incident happened.
