ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang’ula will market their Luhya unity agenda in Kakamega tomorrow. Mudavadi will be the chief guest at the homecoming of Lurambi MP Titus Khamala at Mwangaza Primary School. Wetang’ula, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa, Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya and former Kakamega senator Boni Khalwale have been invited. Earlier reports indicated Deputy President William Ruto could attend but Khamala said he had not invited him. “We have invited all senior Luhya leaders to attend but the DP is not on the card. “My party leader [Mudavadi] is the chief guest but the DP is free to drop in if he finds time because it is a public event. High- voltage Luhya politics will be played here,” Khamala said. The sugar importation probe is expected to dominate speeches.Khamala said the economy of the former Western province will feature prominently. Western MPs have condemned the rejection of a report on sugar import by a parliamentary committee.
