Two Meru families yesterday engaged in fistfights at the Nanyuki Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary over a man’s burial. Traders, passersby and mortuary attendants were treated to a rare drama after the men and women threw kicks and punches. This unfolded when the family of Jamleck Kimanthi’s wife got the burial permit and proceeded to have the body released to them. But before they could pass the mortuary gate, Kimanthi’s family demanded the burial permit. The widow’s aunt, Eunice Nkirote, allegedly disappeared with the permit and ID cards for Kimanthi and his wife, prompting them to give her a chase. Nkirote said the deceased had not paid bride price. Joseph Mwangi, Kimanthi’s brother, said, “Our concern is why they’re refusing to hand over the burial permit to us. Our brother had married from the family and not the other way round. They should give us the document.” They want Kimanthi buried in Maritati village, Buuri, but the in-laws have settled for Ngushishi village. Nanyuki police arrested members from both sides and detained them. The body was also taken back to the morgue. Laikipia East police boss Mutoro Kizito said the body will only be interred after the families agree. Click here for
