Dagane has accused some senior county staff of spending their working hours chasing tenders and contracts instead of delivering on their mandate. He said the county government staff should stick to their mandate and deliver to residents. Dagane said some staff are often absent from their work place and cannot not justify their salaries. “You were hired to deliver services to residents of Garissa and that is why you receive a salary every month,” Dagane said. The deputy governor spoke when he opened the Garissa county sensitisation meeting on performance contracting. He said they will soon catch up with staff who spend days chasing tenders.  “It is wrong for staff to abscond duty by claiming there was no work. You are expected to think outside the box and create work,” he said. The deputy governor said the government will push on with performance contracting by evaluating staff and determining their suitability. “It will no longer be business as usual because each and every staff must justify their existence. We have to deliver to our people,” Dagane said. County secretary Abdi Ali said all staff shall be evaluated based on their performance and those who fail the test will be weeded out. “We need to know the performance of each and every staff to determine whether they deserve to continue holding their positions,” he said. Area governor has in previous occasions said he will not entertain laziness among any of the county staff who sabotage his administration. The meeting was attended by county executives, chief officers, directors and subcounty administrators and was co-ordinated by Ahadi Kenya, UKAid and USAid. In March, Dagane pledged to sack all lazy and non-performing staff. “When you fail to deliver on your mandate as a chief officer or a county employee, it is the governor you will be failing. We have a five-year contract with the electorate and there is no shortcut in ensuring that we meet their demands,” he said.
