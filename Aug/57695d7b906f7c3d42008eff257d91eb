Several girls in Thagichu Mwingi North have been subjected to female genital mutilation, Kitui county woman representative Irene Kasalu has said. Kasalu on Monday said the practice is being done in top secret and wants police and local administration to be on the lookout and arrest those involved. “I am bitter that such a repugnant practice is taking place in this area of our county. It must be brought to a stop by all means,” she said. The MP also decried rampant cases of rape and defilement of young women in Kitui county. “Men who are found guilty should be arrested and charged,” said Miss Kasalu. Kasalu was accompanied by Senator Enoch Wambua and members of the Senate Committee on ICT on a fact-finding visit to Thagichu district following complaints that the area is not connected to mobile telephony service. The team was also accompanied by engineers from the Communication Authority of Kenya. Click here for the latest political news
