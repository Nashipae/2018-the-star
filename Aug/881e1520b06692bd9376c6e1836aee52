Kiganjo Mathari MCA Muthoni Kuruga yesterday threw a party for boda boda operators who passed a driving test. More than 1,000 chapatis were prepared for the 130 riders, who were also awarded driving licences. The party was at Kiganjo Catholic Hall, Nyeri town, and was attended by 250 riders. “Today we cooked...chapatis, rice, meat stew and tea and had other goodies,” Kuruga said. The MCA said she threw the party because it was a big sacrifice for the operators to leave their daily work and attend training sessions. Kuruga paid Sh800,000 to enrol the operators in driving school. “We have more than 300 riders in this ward and I want all of them to go to driving school, pass the test and acquire valid driving licences,” she said.
