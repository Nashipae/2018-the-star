IEBC has collected Sh7.7 million fines from 37 people who were found culpable during the 2017 General Election. Chairman Wafula Chebukati said the Electoral Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee prosecuted 71 cases during the election. The cases were broken down into:  Prosecuted and accused found culpable (31),  Defaulted the orders of the committee and were disqualified (2), Prosecuted accused found not culpable and dismissed for lack of merit (14). Fourteen were dismissed for want of prosecution and non-attendance, dismissed by order of High Court (3), withdrawn by the complainant (3). In four, the High Court issued an order of stay of judgement which challenged the committee to execute the judgement. Election officers who committed electoral offences faced Sh1 million fine, three years imprisonment or both under the election offences Act enacted by Parliament. The punitive laws are meant to ensure accountability among the staff of the commission in the conduct of today's general election. The commission warned that it will not shield officers who commit offences by tampering with the election from prosecution.
