Property estimated to be worth Sh15 million was destroyed in a fire at Tumaini town, Ol Kalou constituency on Sunday. Victims and residents say the fire, suspected to have started from one of the butcheries, broke out at about 3am. At least 15 shops were affected but no injuries were reported. "Everything was reduced to ashes. Nothing was salvaged from the shops," Samuel Gitari, a victim, said. Gitari said he lost household items as nothing was salvaged from his residential house which is next to affected shops. Ann Wanjema, who deals in new and mitumba clothes, said she lost over Sh4 million following the fire. "I don't know where to begin. I have been left with nothing yet I have children to cater for," she said. The victims blamed the Nyandarua county government for not responding to the fire in time. The firefighters arrived at three hours after the fire broke out, despite having been notified immediately. Youths from the nearby NYS Tumaini barracks saved day after they brought water. Mirangine deputy county commissioner Omar Ali visited the scene. He called for calm saying the police will conduct an investigation to establish the cause of the fire.
