NHIF has partnered with Former Parliamentarians Association to offer a platinum insurance cover. The association has 550 members. Fopa chairman Humphrey Njuguna said former legislators have not had access to good cover after leaving the august House. He spoke during the National Cohesion and Integration Conference at Safari Park Hotel on Wednesday. “Our focus is to attain universal health care for not only our members, but all Kenyans as one of the four pillars stipulated by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Our vision is to see this model replicated by different groups and associations,” Njuguna said. The cover includes Fopa members’ spouses and their children below 21 years or up to 25 years if still in school. The coverage will be from Sh300,000 annually for outpatient to Sh7.5 million for inpatient. See also: Kenyan MPs want five-star caterers, masseurs and new cars Click here for
