The Office of the Registrar of Political Parties has been plunged into crisis following the exit of former boss Lucy Ndung’u. She resigned after a seven-year stint as acting registrar following her appointment as a commissioner with the Ombudsman by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The Star has established the RPP is in disarray after Ndung’u’s exit. She was the de facto chief executive with authority to incur expenditure. The Political Parties Act says the registrar should be deputised by three assistant registrars but this has not been the case for seven years. Consequently, the most senior officers at the RPP are the assistant director of compliance Juliet Murimi and assistant director Human Resource management Dina Liech. “Things have grounded to a halt. None of the senior officers is an AIE holder and nobody can sign any gazette notices. Of the senior most officers, one was seconded from the ministry and the other is set to retire in two years,” a source told the Star. The registrar of political parties is an independent office with the powers to register, regulate, monitor, investigate and supervise parties. It also administers the political parties fund. Yesterday, Jane Njiru, the Political Parties Liaison Committee chairperson said they hope the Public Service Commission will start the process of replacing Ndung’u in seven days. “The law does not provide for the appointment of an acting registrar. It provides that the process of recruiting a new registrar will begin within seven days,”she said. Njiru said the committee is looking forward to implementing programmes without any hitches.
