Yesterday Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu was arrested on suspicion of receiving inducements. The Director of Criminal Investigation George Kinoti and the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji are obviously not intimidated by rank. They should be commended for their close and effective cooperation, so unlike that of their predecessors. President Uhuru Kenyatta also deserves credit for instigating the war on corruption and for ignoring calls from the political elite to rein it in. This year two governors, the executive of Kenya Power, the former Transport PS, the NLC chairman and the MD of Kenya Railways are among those arrested. Mwiluâ€™s arrest shows not only that the war on corruption is genuine but that it may go much further and transform Kenya. Yesterday Haji emphasised in his press conference that court officials need to do their jobs properly for this to happen. Too many fraudsters have escaped because the courts connived to set them free.  So let us hope that soon we will be commending the courts for their diligence in seeing that justice is done.
