Deputy President William Ruto has been accused of misusing his office to advance his 2022 political ambitions. East African Legislative Assembly MP Oburu Oginga said Ruto should be surcharged for using his position aâ€‹â€‹nd office to politick instead of initiating development projects. Addressing journalists in Bondo on Sunday, Oburu said Kenyans need a break from politics. He accused  Ruto of using government machinery and resources to traverse the country to sell his agenda. “Kenyans are â€‹â€‹not interested in who betrayed Ruto in 2007 at this time, but development, ” Oburu said. “Ruto is talking of being betrayed in 2007 and being supported in 2022 when he has never supported anyone if he is not benefiting.” Oburu said by the DP accusing ODM leader Raila Odinga of betrayal in 2007 is cheap politics. Prime Minister During the homecoming party of Lurambi MP Titus Khamala at the weekend, Ruto said Raila and ANC’s Musalia Mudavadi plotted to deny him the Prime Minister’s post in 2007. This was following the formation of a grand coalition government between ODM and PNU led by then President Mwai Kibaki. “We agreed in 2007 that Raila Odinga would become President, my brother Mudavadi was to be the Vice President and I was to be of Prime Minister,” Ruto said. “But because of what happened, we finally got the position of Prime Minister which was to be mine but went to Odinga while the slot of Deputy Prime Minister went to Mudavadi. I got nothing but was taken to the Hague.” Earlier, Ruto had called on Mudavadi to support his 2022 presidential bid. Ruto said his friendship with Mudavadi dates back to their days in ODM, saying it was time they joined forces again. He told Mudavadi to back him as he is “just a step away from the top seat”.
