Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu on Tuesday appeared at the Anti-Corruption Court Milimani and was released on Sh5 million personal bond. Judge Lawrence Mugambi said the order is temporary and is only meant to secure her court attendance tomorrow. Mwilu and her co-accused Stanley Muluva are expected to plead to corruption-related charges at 9 am after parties agreed it was past the gazetted time set for court hearings. According to the charge sheet, Mwilu will answer charges linked to the collapsed Imperial Bank where she allegedly received Sh12million. “Between August 15, 2013, and October 23, 2013, at Imperial Bank headquarters in Nairobi, being a person employed in the public service as a judge of the Court of Appeal used the said office to improperly confer a benefit to yourself of Sh12 million from the bank,” part of the charge sheet read. Mwilu was arrested on Tuesday afternoon at the Supreme Court. Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji said she abused office for personal gain and received a bribe. "Evidence shows she accepted a cash gift; undermining public confidence in the integrity of her office and failed to pay taxes," Haji said. Mwilu was represented by 16 lawyers led by James Orengo, John Khaminwa, Harun Ndubi, Julie Soweto, Nelson Havi, Peter Kaluma and Milly Odhiambo among others.
