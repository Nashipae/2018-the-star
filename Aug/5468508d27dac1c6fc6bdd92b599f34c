Former Kiambu roads executive John Mugwe was on Monday beaten up and ejected from county offices by goons he claimed were hired by Governor Ferdinand Waititu. The governor has denied the claims, saying Mugwe (pictured) was beaten by furious visitors for hijacking the queue. Mugwe who was sacked by Waititu two months ago had accompanied about ten traders to seek audience with the county boss over seized mobile phone containers. The containers belonged to a businesswoman in Ruiru. The phones have disappeared. A group of stout men drove in after Mugwe in three county vehicles and roughed up the former minister and his entourage. Waititu was not in office at the time. They were beaten and ejected from the county offices. Five people were rushed to Kiambu Hospital after sustaining injuries. They later reported the matter to Kiambu police station. “We did not go to fight the governor or intimidate him. We were shocked by the actions of the goons,” Mugwe said. Wambui Wagithurai said her container was returned without the mobile phones which she sells. “It is sad that I was slapped and left unconscious by goons when I followed up the matter,” she said. Speaking on the matter at a local radio station, Waititu said: “I did not send anyone to beat people but I understand that those at the reception got furious and beat up the former CEC for rudely bypassing them.”
