Kenya Prisons have warned their perennial rivals that it will not be a walk in the park as the second leg of the National League gets underway today in Thika. Prisons’ coach Maurice ‘Kawata’ Maina said the 1999 champions have high hopes of winning more bouts in Thika if their squad’s preparedness is anything to by. “We are tied of living in the shadows of Police and army boxers and will clearly employ match-winning strategies in Thika,” said Maina, a 1987 All Africa Games medallist. Prisons, who are lying third on the log with nine points behind Police’s ‘Chafua Chafua’ (21) and Kenya Defence Forces (10), will peg their hopes on flyweight Harrison Mathuku, light-welterweight Anthony Maina (formerly of Tommy Githurai), welterweight Ken Okello and lightweight Tonny Ngugi. “Mathuku has been in devastating form lately and will definitely be a thorn in the flesh of our adversaries. Other boxers are in good shape too,” said Maina at their Kaloleni Social Hall training venue. Prisons have since been depleted after losing four Kenyan internationals Bernard Ngumba, Aziz Ali, Rayton Okwiri and Daniel Shisia. Shisia and Ngumba have retired after attaining the maximum age of 40 as stipulated by the AIBA rules while Aziz and Okwiri have since furthered their careers by joining paid ranks. Police will field international Shaffi Bakari, who has since replaced Mungai at light-fly, heavy-weight Elly Ajowi, Ethan Maina at light-welter and Martin Oduor at bantamweight. Oduor replaced retired back-to-back Olympian Benson Gicharu, who will be in Chafua Chafua’s corner in Thika. The KDF battalion comprises of lightweight Nick Okoth, Isaac Meja (bantam) and Fredrick Onyango (heavy-weight). Okoth and Meja are students at Musa Benjamin’s St Teresa’s Undugu. The league program will throw off with the mandatory early morning medical check ups, mid-morning weigh-in sessions and preliminary bouts. Other teams taking part are Omar Kasongo Sports Academy, Kentrack and Mombasa.
