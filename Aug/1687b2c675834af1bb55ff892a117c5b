The United Kingdom and Kenya will sign a new agreement to repatriate proceeds of corruption and crime when Prime Minister Theresa May visits Nairobi. British High Commissioner to Kenya Nic Hailey made the announcement on Tuesday via Twitter. This follows a deal signed in April last year between Kenya and Switzerland to trace and recover stolen assets and funds stashed in Swiss accounts. Switzerland last year said it had frozen Sh200 million stashed in the country from the Anglo Leasing scandal. Then Attorney General Githu Muigai said the agreement would lead to theÂ recovery of billions of shillings allegedly hidden in Swiss accounts and prosecution of the individuals involved.

He said key areas of cooperation would include assets recovery and the repatriation of criminals and their proceeds. On July 9, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Swiss President Alain Berset oversaw the signing of a key agreement that clears the way for the recovery of assets acquired through corruption and crime in Kenya. The Framework for the Return of Assets from Corruption and Crime in Kenya is supported by the UK. Uhuru said the MoU was part of his resolve to fight corruption. It is alleged that funds from the Anglo Leasing and Goldenberg scandals are stashed in foreign countries. PM May is expected to land at the JKIA on Thursday. She arrived in Capetown on Tuesday and said she supported the land reforms by President Cyril Ramaphosa. May will also visit Nigeria as part of a three-day visit to Africa.
