A family in Baringo North is appealing to well-wishers for Sh1.2 million for a hospital bill and burial expenses of a former administrator who died after an attack by wild honey badgers. Simon Komen, 64, former Kapkoiwo sub-location assistant chief died at Eldoret hospital on August 16. “As a family, we are now struggling to fundraise Sh1.2 million to foot the pending medical bills and cater for the burial arrangements,” his elder son Shadrack Kiptoo told the Star on Tuesday. The man was attacked on July 22 after two honey badgers pounced on him at his home in Kibarkebo village. "I heard my sheep bleating at around 10 pm. It was dark in the night. I went outside with a spotlight and a panga. I saw two animals that looked like dogs trying to kill my sheep," Komen said before he died while receiving treatment. “We found him lying down and writhing with bloody deep cuts on both his hands and legs,” a neighbour said. He was rushed to Kipsaraman dispensary for first aid before being referred to Kabarnet county referral hospital. “I rushed from Eldoret town where I live, to pick my father and swiftly took him for specialized treatment at Eldoret hospital,” his son Kiptoo said. He was later admitted at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) where he succumbed eight days later. Saimo-Kipsaraman ward representative John Aengwo criticized the Kenya Wildlife Service for laxity. "Since the incident was reported to the KWS they have done nothing to mitigate the situation to date," he said. Senior Baringo KWS warden Dickson Too said investigations have been launched to ascertain the kind of animals which attacked the old man. Kiptoo said compensation will only be made once full evidence has been tabled.
