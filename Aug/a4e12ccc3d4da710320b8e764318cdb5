Zimbabwe police stormed the headquarters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in the capital Harare on Thursday and detained 16 people after sealing off the building earlier, a Reuters witness said. “Police came with a warrant of search and seizure they claimed there were certain computers and other subversive materials,” MDC lawyer Denford Halimani said. “They wanted to seize those things and also get people that were inside. Perhaps it was a scare tactic. There was nothing the police retrieved. They took away 16 people we are going to confirm if these people have been arrested.”
