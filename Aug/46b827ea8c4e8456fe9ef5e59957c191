Muhoroni MP Onyango
K’Oyoo has asked the government to
gazette sugar industry regulations to
stop cane poaching. K’Oyoo asked the Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri to
gazette regulations saying cane poaching and illegal sugar importation contributed
to woes faced in the sector. Cane poaching has been an issues and a thorn in
the flesh for years now with sugar millers in Western Kenya asking the national
government to revoke licenses of companies lacking cane, arguing that it will
deal with the vice. Kenya is divided into five sugar zones with
milers restricted to the area they can source cane from. However, the licensing
of new millers in some of the zones has resulted in constant wars due to cane
poaching. This has seen farmers in numerous occasion complained
that lack and absence of sugar regulations had led to cane poaching, high debt
portfolio and farmers’ arrears. However the Muhoroni MP noted that reinstating
of the suspended regulations will shield state-owned millers from cane poaching
in Western region. “I feel that posting of inept managers by the
government to run the factories has also contributed to the under performance of
most sugar industries in Nyanza and Western,”he said. K’Oyoo disclosed that he had fine tuned the  regulations after the Attorney General pointed
out some errors, and later forwarded them to the then CS Willy Bett, yet the
regulations have not been reinstated to date. He at the same time asked President Uhuru
Kenyatta to settle the various debts owed by sugar factories within the region
to allow them resume their operation. “Am urging the President  to grant funds to the local factories,
Muhoroni an Chemelil to enable them resume their operations that would see more
jobs created for the locals within the areas,”he added.
