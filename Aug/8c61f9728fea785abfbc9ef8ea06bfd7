Garissa Governor Ali Korane was on Monday night released from Kilimani police cell. He was interrogated over the shooting of the former Finance executive Idriss Mukhtar the entire day. The county chief was arrested on grounds he was linked to the August 23 incident at a shopping mall in Kileleshwa. Korane was among seven people probed on the case. Others are his bodyguard, the gunman,and a woman who hired the car used in trailing the target. The lot, alongside a boda boda rider, are still in custody. The governor was ordered to go back to the police on Wednesday for further grilling even as officers handling the case complained of intimidation and threats. Mukhtar is still fighting for his life in a city hospital. Police sources told the Star that the governor's cousin is the main suspect in the shooting, having allegedly planned the same. It emerged that there was a plot to eliminate Mukhtar and a city-based lawyer on suspicion they planned to challenge Korane’s academic qualifications. The revelation emerged Monday as police in Nairobi wrapped up investigations into the matter.
