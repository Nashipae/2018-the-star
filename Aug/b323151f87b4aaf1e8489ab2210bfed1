Road crashes have claimed more lives in 2018 compared to last year, the National Transport and Safety Authority said on Monday. A survey the NTSA carried out indicates that 81 more people had lost their lives by August 5, compared to the number at the same time in 2017. The data shows that by the said date, 1,789 people had died compared to 1,708 in the same period last year. However, unlike last year, the number of passengers who have died on roads has reduced drastically. Pedestrians remain the most vulnerable road users with 687 of them having died since January 2018. Nairobi county continues to lead in the number of road crashes with private and commercial vehicles being most involved. Last week, 273 black spots across the country were identified by NTSA, 199 of them being in the Northern Corridor and 74 in the capital. The authority has marked Outering Road as the city’s most dangerous highway. Waiyaki Way, Mombasa Road and the Eastern and Northern by-passes follow closely. The total number of deaths countrywide was 2,919 in 2017 and 2,965 in 2016.
