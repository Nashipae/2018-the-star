Mombasa governor Hassan Joho has asked leaders to help the government to repossess grabbed land. Joho said every Kenyan has a right to protect public land from grabbers. “This should be for the whole country. We must find ways to address our past mistakes,' Joho said. Joho said leaders across the country should support President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga in their resolve to end corruption and impunity. “People should undergo lifestyle audit, if you own an aeroplane, how did you acquire it? period. There is no person who cannot account for his wealth and if the property belongs to mwananchi it should go back to mwananchi,” he said. Joho was speaking at Kenyatta stadium in Maralal town Samburu Central sub-county where he led residents in a funds drive for constructing a mosque. The governor was accompanied by seven MPs from Coast and Western Kenya. The MPs commended President Uhuru and Nasa leader Raila Odinga for putting aside their political differences for the benefit of the country.
