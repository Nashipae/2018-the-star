STARRING: Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Angela Bassett, Michelle Monaghan, Alec Baldwin BASED ON: Mission: Impossible by Bruce Geller RELEASE DATE: July 27  Tom Cruise is back at it again, with the sixth franchise of his Mission Impossible series; a whopping 22 years after the release of the first. Over the years, the films in the franchise have become less about their exciting plots and more about Cruise’s daredevil stunts. I mean, the man made it in the news during the shooting of the previous film, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation ( 2015 ), after paparazzi managed to snap pictures of him hanging off the side of a flying plane. At this point, we think that there is no stunt that can be too much for this 56-year-old adrenaline junkie, who insists on doing all his stunts. Two years after capturing Solomon Lane, Ethan Hunt discovers that the remainder of Solomon’s Syndicate has formed a new terrorist group called The Apostles. The Apostles are intent on buying three plutonium cores and destroying The Vatican, Jerusalem and Mecca. Hunt is forced to make morally taxing decisions of whether to save many lives or release one dangerous criminal. Since Hunt is known for going rogue on more than one occasion, CIA director Erica Sloane brings in a trained operative to shadow Hunt during his mission. The film is a two-hour action-packed escapade that stops only after we’ve completely exhausted our adrenaline rush. And whilst the storyline surely seems to have us lost on different occasions, our attention is steered by incredible stunts that have taken over the film. With the introduction of Superman’s Henry Cavill into the cast, nothing is impossible in this film. The film sticks to its true purpose, portraying Cruise as the death-defying daredevil, whose incredible real-life stunts are all we care about.  Star Rating: 4/5
