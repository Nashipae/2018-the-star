Popular gospel rapper Eko Dydda's two sons, ‘Keep It Real’, six, and ‘I'm Blessed’, four, have already done five songs. 'I'm Blessed' is already working on a new solo song. Eko Dydda told Word Is, "He
is done with his first single, which will be released in August after he comes from from a tour we are having with other gospel
artistes." So, how is it raising his kids? "It
is amazing. I feel like they are my brothers and not
just my kids because they are very sharp, and I thank God for them and I
always feel like they are buddies," he said. "They are also performing so well when it comes to education to an extent I feel challenged." Asked to describe their father, 'Keep it Real' said: "He is a great dad because he has helped us in music and even protects us. He also buys us gifts if we behave well. I loves Maths and Science." By any chance, if they grow up and decide to change their career, the dad says he will support them. "Growing
up was different and I know that if I was given an opportunity to choose
what I wanted, maybe I would be very different," Dydda said. "If it reaches a time and
they say they want to do something else apart from music, I won't deny
them that chance. Instead I will fully support them." In future, the two want to be artistes like their father, as well as footballers.
