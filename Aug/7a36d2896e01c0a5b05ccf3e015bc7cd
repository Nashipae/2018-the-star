President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday deployed Coast security bosses to work on a truce between primary school headteachers and their association chairman Shem Ndolo. County regional coordinator Bernard Leparmarai said the President was "saddened" by events at the Kenya Primary School Heads Association (Kepsha) conference on Monday morning. The meeting degenerated to chaos following a disagreement over a Sh500 monthly union fee.

The chaos saw Ndolo kicked out of the conference for failing to account for the fee paid to Kepsha. The teachers were angered further when he termed their complaints "nonsense". Leparmarai said the chaos prompted the President to send the security team to bring sanity to the conference. "Whatever happened was uncalled for. Tomorrow, we expect the Head of State. He has honoured your invitation. Therefore, we expect you to respect him," he told the school heads. "We might have differences but we do not expect you to wash your dirty linen when the President is here. Any unruly act, like what was witnessed in the morning, will be met with the full force of the law." He was accompanied by Mombasa county commissioner Evans Achoki, Mombasa county police commander Johnstone Ipara, Director General at the Ministry of Education Elyas Abdi and other senior government officials. Abdi said: "We cannot allow what was witnessed in the morning to happen again." Kepsha Secretary General David Mavuta said the national government took over the programme after the unfortunate incident. "This is a presidential function," he told the delegates. Following the security heads' intervention, the delegates let Ndolo address them. "I apologise for any utterances that angered the participants," he said before closing the session.
