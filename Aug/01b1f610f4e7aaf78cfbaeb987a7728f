ODM leader Raila Odinga and Deputy President William Ruto on Friday shared a platform "but there was no exchange of nasty politics." The two met at the burial of Privatisation Commission chairman Henry Obwocha who passed away on August 3 after collapsing at his home. The late Obwocha was a long-serving MP for West Mugirango constituency. Raila, in his address to the mourners, explained the meaning of the handshake saying it was for the betterment of the country. "We decided to go to Canaan but found crocodiles as we approached Jordan river. That is why we decided to build bridges and embraced the handshake," he said. He added that the biggest enemy in the country is corruption saying the vice should be dealt with regardless of the positions held by suspects. "Even if it is your mother who is corrupt, make sure you deal with her, not forgetting your neighbour or child." "Corruption is corruption. It has no relative or close friend because it buries the whole country," the NASA leader said. For his part, Ruto said it was time for all the leaders to work for Kenyans despite their political parties now that the country is united by the handshake. "It is time that all of us focus our attention towards paying the debt of development to Kenyans as we promised them," he said. "Let us leave out issues of political parties and concentrate on development," the DP added. Chief Justice David Maraga, Governors Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega), James Ongwae (Kisii), and John Nyagarama (Nyamira) as well as Interior CS Fred Matiang'i were present.
