Counterfeit and substandard goods worth more than Sh7.5 billion have been seized since the start of a crackdown by a multiagency task force. According to Trade principal secretary Chris Kiptoo, traders are now reporting better returns for genuine business and increased marketshare after multiagency teams began work to rid the country of illicit goods. Among goods that have so far been seized are motor vehicle spares, cigarettes, fuel and petroleum products,cables, alcohol, and foodstuff. The forum on the third day of Kenya trade week heard that the government is moving fast to seal borders which have been listed as weak entry and exit points that have allowed entry of harmful cargo inspite of heavily manned roadblocks. He said the challenges faced so far include the rise of impostors, lack of compliance by stakeholders and delays in getting out results from lab tests as staff are overwhelmed with work requests. Kiptoo recommended the strengthening of a sustained law enforcement among the agencies,and increased public education to improve awareness about contraband and substandard goods.
