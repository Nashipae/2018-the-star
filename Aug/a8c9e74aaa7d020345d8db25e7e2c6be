Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong'o has dismissed claims that President Uhuru Kenyatta will visit the county on Thursday. Through his communication office on Tuesday, Nyong'o asked residents to treat the reports as false. “The preparation of Kisumu's Universal Health Coverage registration activation has been surrounded by continuous rumours circulating in the media, to the effect that [the President] will be gracing the occasion,' communication director Aloice Ager said in a statement. Ager said the office of the governor had not been informed of this development asked resident to disregard the "rumour". Nyong'o's statement contradicts that of Deputy Governor Mathews Owili, who said last month that Uhuru will preside over the event. Owili said Uhuru would preside over the free healthcare programme rollout, which is expected to benefit 1.2 million residents. He said they were mapping facilities and checking whether they had equipment and enough staff ahead of the function. The UHC programme is part of the government’s agenda for health under the Big Four. Kisumu is one of the counties selected for the pilot of the UHC that will see residents access the NHIF super cover for comprehensive integrated health services.
