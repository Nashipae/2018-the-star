 Farmers risk missing fertiliser for the short rain season that starts in October if government will not have paid transporters Sh1.1 billion. Transportation of this yearâ€™s long rains harvest will also be hindered if the servicemen are not paid. The transporters said the money is for services rendered to the National Cereals and Produce Board. Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa yesterday confirmed payment of Sh1.4 billion to maize farmers but said transporters will have to wait a little longer.
