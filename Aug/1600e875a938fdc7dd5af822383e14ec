Lamu MPs have denied reports linking them to bribery claims to shoot down the sugar report in Parliament. Lamu East MP Athman Shariff and his Lamu West counterpart Stanley Muthama are also demanding an apology from a local daily that included the two among the published names of MPs who allegedly received bribes, as less as Sh10,000, to reject the report. “I wasn’t even in the House.I was in Mombasa. How could I have been present to receive the bribe and at the same time be elsewhere? This is character assassination. I demand an apology from that daily or else I’ll sue for defamation,” Shariff said. Muthama said the allegations are propaganda and said he wasn’t aware neither did he participate in the alleged bribery.
