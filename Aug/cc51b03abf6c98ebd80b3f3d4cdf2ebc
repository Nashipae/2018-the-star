Occupants of Airgate Mall, formerly known as Taj, have until August 30 to vacate the premises ahead of its demolition. MA Nyakiongora, chairman of the multi-sectoral committee on unsafe structures, said on Thursday that the illegal building will be pulled down. "It has encroached on the road reserve and way-leave hindering the construction of Outering Road," he said in a notice seen by the Star. Airgate owners were asked to "remove the building" before this date. "Upon expiry of the notice, the illegal development will be demolished at the owners' risk and cost." The government has been demolishing buildings in a bid to save riparian and public land in Nairobi. Those torn down so far include Southend Mall and Ukay Centre. Parts of Oshwal Centre were also demolished. About 4,000 buildings are earmarked for demolition in an operation to clear illegal structures from river banks in Nairobi. The operation is being led by the Nairobi Regeneration team, which was appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta last December to perform duties including cleaning and reclaiming Nairobi River. The scenic river's path has been invaded by dumping and unscrupulous developers. In May, the team identified over 600 pollution points along the stream and acknowledged the urgency of the clean-up.
