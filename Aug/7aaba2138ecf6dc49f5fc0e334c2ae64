The government has unveiled plans to relocate the Meru sewage treatment plant from Gakoromone market in North Imenti. The Sh1 billion project is to allow the expansion of the market and enable traders to sell their commodities in a hygienic environment. Water Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui said the project will be funded by African Development Bank. "The new sewerage plant will cover Kemu, Makutano shopping center, and Meru town," he said during a site tour on Friday. The current sewerage system was built in 1978 and was to cover 20,000 people residing in Meru town. "The population has grown hence the need for the expansion," Chelugui said adding that the project will start in two months as tendering has already begun. He said Maua town will also be allocated Sh2 billion for sewerage and water piping. "The water supply in Meru town will also be increased through Kithino dam," Chelugui said. Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi said the market will be upgraded through the construction of cabros and installation of street lights. "We want the traders to be comfortable when going about their businesses. We will also work with the county commissioner to ensure there is enough security," Kiraitu said. Gender and Youth CS Margaret Kobia, Central Imenti MP Moses Kirima, Meru deputy governor Titus Ntochiu, and nominated MP Halima Mucheke were present. Click here for the latest political news
