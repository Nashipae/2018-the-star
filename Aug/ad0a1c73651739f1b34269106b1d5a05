Former Gor Mahia defender Godfrey Walusimbi has expressed his joy after sealing a move to Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs. The 29-year-old Ugandan left-back penned a three-year deal until June 2021. “I’ve always known that Kaizer Chiefs is a great football club,” said the Ugandan international. He told the club’s official website: “Chiefs play for honours and that’s a positive mindset that every player dreams of. Just like every footballer, I always want to move one step further in my career and I think my move to Chiefs is one such step.” Walusimbi is a fully-fledged Ugandan national team player and has even received a call up from the country’s FA ahead of the forthcoming Fifa international break. He has played for several clubs including Sports Club Villa in Uganda and CS Don Bosco of DR Congo. “I have already adapted at Chiefs,” said Walusimbi. “It is easier to adapt in a professional environment. I look forward to working hard and contribute to the team.” Kaizer Chiefs’ Football Manager Bobby Motaung welcomed Walusimbi and shared his views about ‘Wazza’ as the Ugandan is affectionately known. “It has been an engaging process to finalise this move,” said Motaung. “At the end we are happy the process has been completed, and the player is available to play. We wish him all of the best with us.” Walusimbi is second high profile player to leave Gor Mahia after Rwandan international Meddie Kagere left for Simba in the Tanzania Premier League.
