ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna has dismissed Luhya unity calls as a sham. He said some leaders championing for unity were only pushing their selfish interests. Speaking during at a breakfast show in one of the radio stations, Sifuna said "Luhyas have never been split". “We have always been one. Those calling for unity are seeking political relevance,” he said. He accused the leaders of failing to articulate the issues affecting the region. Sifuna cited the contraband sugar report that was shot down in Parliament. He said only a few MPs from the region were present to discuss the problems afflicting sugarcane farmers from Western Kenya. “Only a handful of MPs were present. If we are serious about unity, we should have shown it in the House. Leaders from Western who are more than 40 should have made their voices heard,” he said. Sifuna said some leaders are more interested in congregating at funerals to hoodwink people about unity yet they do not mean it. He laughed off the attempt by some leaders to run for the Presidency. He said they lacked the capacity to mount a serious campaign. Sifuna said leaders should stop seeking publicity. “We need to be honest with ourselves, we are not ready to produce a President. People are only seeking political mileage," he said.
