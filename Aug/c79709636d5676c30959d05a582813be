President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a message of condolence to the families of eight pupils who died in a road accident last night. The learners from St Gabriel Primary School in Mwingi were travelling from Mombasa where they had gone for a study tour. Their bus was involved in a head-on collision with a lorry at Kanginga bridge on the Thika-Garissa Road at about 11pm on Saturday. Uhuru, in his message to the affected parents and guardians, said it was unfortunate that the lives of innocent pupils "who are the future of this nation were lost." "It is indeed sad and unfortunate that we lost those we look forward to secure the future of our great nation," Uhuru said on Sunday. The eight students were among 44 passengers who were in the bus at the time of the accident. They were with their teachers. The President wished a quick recovery those who have been admitted to various hospitals. Of the injured, 32 students were admitted in Mwingi Level Four Hospital, six of them in critical condition while 26 were stable. Six students, who had travelled with the others for the study tour, escaped narrowly had just been dropped home.
