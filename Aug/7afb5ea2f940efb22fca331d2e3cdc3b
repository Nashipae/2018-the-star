Kitui governor Charity Ngilu has appealed to professionals to back her development agenda. She attributed her landslide poll victory to their unparalleled moral, material and intellectual support. “Even when we had run short of cash for tea, we met to strategise how to beat our competitors. I now wish to walk with you in achieving my agenda for Kitui. Be part of the journey,” Ngilu said on Friday. She met 1,000 professionals at a Nairobi hotel. Ngilu said Kitui voters are very unforgiving to failed leaders. She wants the professionals to oversight implementation of her five-pillar pre-election manifesto. The five pillars are food and water security, quality healthcare, wealth creation, education, and youth and women empowerment. “Don’t watch passively when things go astray. Speak out so mistakes can be corrected to the wishes of the voters. Don’t wait for me to face the wrath of the electorate in 2022,” Ngilu said. The county chief said the county has made great strides during the one year she has been in office. She cited food security, where her ndengu (green gram) revolution resulted in bumper harvests. Farmers are grappling with lack of market because of the glut. The county has increased water supply by distributing 1,500 tanks for rain harvesting. “We’ve trained 500 youths to maintain boreholes so they resolve small issues whenever there is a breakdown,” Ngilu said. The county has opened 82 health facilities. Some 260 facilities have been equipped and stocked with medicines. Last week, Ngilu launched a health insurance scheme that targets all residents.
