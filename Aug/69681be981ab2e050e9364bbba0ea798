Three MPs have threatened to cross over to Uganda to join street demonstrations for the release of Kyaddondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine. MPs Babu Owino (Embakasi East), Jared Okelo (Nyando) and Gideon Keter (nominated) gave the Ugandan authorities one week to release Bobi, whose detention and torture has led to street protests. Speaking under the Kenya Young Parliamentary Association, the lawmakers said whatever affects any of their colleagues in the region equally affects them. Bobi was arrested on August 13 and initially charged with treason. The charges were later reduced to illegal possession of firearms and ammunition at a military court in Gulu, northern Uganda. Okelo said, “By next week if Bobi Wine will not have been set free, we will send a powerful delegation to Uganda to push for his immediate release.” “An injustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere. We will not keep quiet while one of us is subjected to inhumane treatment across the border.” KYPA secretary general Babu Owino said they will stand with the youthful Ugandan lawmaker, whom he said is suffering for standing for the truth. The Embakasi East lawmaker demanded the closure of the Ugandan embassy until Bobi is set free. “We will stage a revolutionary demonstration in Uganda in a week’s time. We will not allow Ugandan authorities to ‘kill’ the future of the youth. I have been arrested before and tortured, I don’t fear arrest.” More: Bobi Wine escapes on boda boda after slamming age-limit scrap Click here for the latest political news
