Taita Taveta county will not honour pending bills amounting to Sh541 million owed to contractors and suppliers, Governor Granton Samboja said yesterday. Samboja said many of the county’s pending bills are fictitious and conduits to siphon public funds. The governor appeared before the Senate’s County Public Accounts and Investment committee chaired by Homa Bay senator Moses Kajwang’. Samboja took over from former Governor John Mruttu who lost in the last election. The governor said of the Sh843 million pending bills as at June 2017, only bills worth Sh21.5 million are genuine. Samboja said his administration can only honour bills amounting Sh271 million under certain set and agreed conditions. The remaining Sh541 million, he said, were not backed by any documents. “I appointed a pending bills committee to interrogate all the bills before payments are made to ensure my government does not pay for projects, which are incomplete or do not exist,” Samboja said. He said a discussion was held with some contractors and a number of them have gone back to site to complete the projects to the satisfaction of the administration. Samboja was responding to audit queries flagged by Auditor General Edward Ouko on the county’s expenditure in 2014-15. He appealed to senators to help Taita Taveta compel the Kenya Wildlife Service to remit a percentage of funds generated from the Tsavo National parks. The governor said despite the parks occupying 63 per cent of the county, they do not receive a penny from the collections. “More than 63 per cent of the land in Taita Taveta is under KWS, which is in charge of the parks. We have even met Tourism CS Najib Balala to push for the same,” Samboja said. Narok senator Ledama ole Kina told the governor to first push for the conversion of the parks to national reserves and invokes Section 5 of the Constitution, which allow the county to get share of the revenue.
