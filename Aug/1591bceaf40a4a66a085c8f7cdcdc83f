Kakamega Homeboyz attacking midfielder Noah Wafula has moved to Ugandan Premier League champions Vipers SC in search of greener pastures. The 28-year-old pacy forward has signed a three-year agreement, which will keep him in Uganda until the end of 2020/21 season. Homeboyz team manager, Boniface Imbenzi, confirmed the move, saying that they will miss his services. He said the former AFC Leopards and Tusker player requested for the termination of his contract, which they obliged. “When a player finds a greener pasture elsewhere, we need to respect his decision and also assist him in any way possible to make things easy and help him settle fast. That has remained our policy as a club,” he noted. “Since his signing early this year alongside Allan Wanga and James Situma, he remained one of our best and most committed players to the club. He has not only scored and created chances but has also been of great value to the club,” he added. “We want to wish him all the best as we believe with his work rate and great focus, he has the potential to go places,” said Imbenzi. He also disclosed that the doors for Wafula in Homeboyz are not closed and that the club will still welcomes him back any time he feels like returning. Wafula started his career at Finlays Horticulture of Naivasha in 2011 before joining AFC Leopards in 2013. He moved to Tusker at the start of 2016 season from where Kakamega Homeboyz snatched him in January this year. Imbenzi, however, said the team is still very strong with players like Moses Mudavadi, Ali Ahmed Bhai and George Mandela providing options. His exit comes at a time when the Paul Nkata-led team is experiencing hard times with key players still nursing injuries. They play Vihiga United in a local derby at Mumias Complex on Sunday.
