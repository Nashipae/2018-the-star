Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo is well known for her aggressiveness, especially when dealing with issues affecting mwananchi. She says this has always been her nature since she was a kid, which, coupled with her curiosity, got her kicked out of class numerous times. Speaking to Radio Jambo's Annitah Raey, the fiery legislator opened up about her high school days, when, despite showing leadership qualities at a young age, her inquisitive nature would land her in trouble with her teachers. "Recently, I was talking to the teachers and I told them I do not take everything anyone tells me as gospel truth. I must ask questions! During my chemistry class we were told to conduct tests using chemicals which would turn the litmus paper red," Odhiambo said. "The teacher wanted me to accept the reaction then go home but I wanted to know why. Every time I asked questions they thought I was stubborn but I was curious and I was kicked out of the class. So teachers need to learn [how to deal] with assertive kids." Odhiambo advised teachers to always pay special attention to the so-called problematic kids, as some may have personal issues while others give them problems because that's their nature. "Such kids are assertive. These are the people that you need to tap that resource and discover future pastors, because pastors are assertive and when you learn about personalities you will understand that someone capable of being a pastor is equally able to become a politician or a marketer. It means that you have a strong mentality," she added.
