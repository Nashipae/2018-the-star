Senate County Public Accounts and Investments Committee chairman Moses Kajwang’ yesterday said his team will not provide information on members said to have solicited Sh100 million in the Ruaraka land probe.  On Monday, a Senate panel summoned four senators over allegations they tried to extort Sh100 million to influence the report. They are Kajwang’, Mithika Linturi, Kimani Wamatangi and Millicent Omanga.  The Homa Bay senator yesterday said it is up to businessman Francis Mburu, the accuser, to write to the Powers and Privileges committee.  Kajwang’ said the committee has powers to investigate any matter on its own motion or emanating from a complaint.  He said his committee will push on to ensure the investigative report is adopted.
