A GSU senior superintendent is today expected to produce the names of officers he was in charge of during last year’s election chaos in Kisumu.
Blame game among top police officers has marred the inquest into the death of Baby Samantha Pendo, who was allegedly clobbered by officers at her Nyalenda home.
Kisumu resident magistrate Beryl Omollo ordered Titus Mutune to produce names of officers manning the area during the chaos.
Mutune is a GSU officer based at the Ruaraka headquarters in Nairobi.
Three GSU platoons were deployed in Kisumu, with two stationed at Kondele and Nyalenda to quell protests.
“He [Mutune] is also to produce an inventory of the armoury and equipment carried by the GSU officers to Kisumu from the headquarters and the arms movement book during August 6-18,” Omollo said.
The order followed an application by prosecutor Mokaya Nyakundi. He said the documents will help establish what transpired.
GSU officers from platoon one, which was deployed in Nyalenda, have denied responsibility for Baby Pendo’s death.
Chief inspector John Masha said they were in the area for two weeks but did not advance to the estates. He dismissed claims by the child’s parents that officers who clobbered her were from the GSU.
