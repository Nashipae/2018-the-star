The Kenya Revenue Authority on Thursday intercepted 980 grams of heroin worth Sh2.9 million at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. KRA said the narcotics were found by the K9 unit at a DHL yard after enforcement officers on a routine check found a suspicious package that wasÂ scanned at the customs laboratory. The authority's Commissioner, Customs and Border Control said prohibited drugs are being smuggled into the country from Mbarara, Uganda, concealed in African crafts (scrolls). The heroin was destined for Delta State in Nigeria. In a statement to newsrooms, the taxman said the package was handed over to the Anti-Narcotic Police Unit for further investigations. The interception came days after the KRA found several packages of narcotics concealed as vitamin tablets at JKIA. "The narcotics had also been sent as a parcel using an international courier service provider," part of the statement reads. "This points to a possible change of tact by drug traffickers who now seem to smuggle prohibited substances in concealment via courier service providers as opposed to making deliveries in person," it read.
