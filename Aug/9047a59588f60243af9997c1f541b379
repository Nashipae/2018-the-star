The Mombasa government has begun compiling a list of alleged grabbers of Kabarani dumpsite. Two companies Multiple Hauliers and Makupa Transit Ltd have claimed they have genuine land documents. On Monday, President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered the National Land Commission to revoke titles for the controversial land. The Head of State directed that the 80-acre dumpsite be decommissioned and the land be used for recreational facilities to reposition Mombasa as a top tourism destination.
