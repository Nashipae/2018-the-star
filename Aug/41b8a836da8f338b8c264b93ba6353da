Thomas Frieden, a former
director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), was arrested in New York City on Friday on charges of
sexual abuse, forcible touching and harassment of a woman last
year, the New York Police Department said. Frieden, who also once served as New York City's health
commissioner, turned himself into a Brooklyn police station on
Friday morning, Arlene Muniz, a police spokeswoman, said. A 55-year-old woman filed a complaint against Frieden in
July, accusing him of grabbing her buttocks against her will
last October at his apartment in Brooklyn Heights, Muniz said. Frieden, 57, had a prominent role in helping respond to the
outbreaks of Ebola in West Africa in 2014 and Zika fever that
began in Brazil in 2015. As New York's health commissioner from 2002 to 2009, he
oversaw efforts to ban smoking in public places. In 2009,
President Barack Obama appointed him to head the CDC, the
country's main public health agency. He stepped down in 2017. Frieden remained in custody on Friday, Muniz said. It was not immediately clear if he was represented by a
lawyer. He was due to make an initial appearance in Brooklyn's
criminal court later on Friday, the district attorney's office
said. Frieden graduated from Columbia University's medical school
in 1986. After leaving government last year, Frieden became the
president of Resolve to Save Lives, an effort by the non-profit
health organization Vital Strategies to improve public health
systems around the world that is funded by Bloomberg
Philanthropies, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the Bill &
Melinda Gates Foundation. Vital Strategies did not immediately respond to a request
for comment on Friday. Click here for the latest political news
