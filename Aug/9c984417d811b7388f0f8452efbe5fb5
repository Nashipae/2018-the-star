Nyamira MCAs have urged Governor John Nyagarama to solve county problems, especially concerning payment of medics and staff. Speaking in Nyamira town on Sunday, the MCAs said the county is in a “mess”. Nominated MCA Fred Mosiori said, “It is not our wish as the assembly to continue watching as our people die in hospitals because of poor services and that our county employees lament every day over unpaid salaries.” He urged the governor and executive to discuss the state of the county. Bomwagamo MCA Charles Barongo said the executive should explain where it gets funds from “to travel to Kisii town every evening, yet our people are dying day in day out”. He said, “We shall march to their offices and lock them out if they shall not bring a solution to the crisis.” Esise MCA Joseph Nyarang’o said the assembly will call on residents to march to the Executive offices to demand an explanation over the state of the county. Ekerenyo MCA Thaddeus Nyabaro said the county is in a mess. The county communications team was unavailable for comment.
