A Kitui MCA on Tuesday pledged to table a motion for stringent penalties for traffic offenders in the county. Reckless drivers would be trailed and flagged down by county enforcement officers, Migwani MCA Philip Nguli said. He proposed hefty fines to be imposed on such errant road users to deter them. Yesterday, Nguli said he would move a private motion to seek stiff penalties and the monitoring of road users to curtail accidents. He said he was optimistic that his colleagues would back the proposed law. “We will not have laws that will be parallel to the existing traffic statutes but the regulation that will emanate from my motion will be meant to strengthen the enforcement the traffic rules. We want to work with traffic police to stop deaths on our roads,” the MCA said. “I have realised that we need to have our domesticated traffic rules and regulations in order to stop increasing road carnage. The number of deaths on our roads is increasing astronomically. As leaders, we must come up with a law to check this menace,” Nguli said. He spoke to reporters in Kitui in the wake of an accident (pictured) in which 10 St Gabriel’s Boarding Primary School pupils died on the Thika-Garissa highway just two kilometers from Mwingi town where the school is located. The children were coming from an educational tour of Mombasa.
