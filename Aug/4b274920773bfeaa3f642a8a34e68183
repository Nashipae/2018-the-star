The High court in Narok has upheld the election of Olpusimoru MCA Kikaet Ole Kuyo of ODM. Judge Justice Justus Bonwonga on Wednesday said the county lawmaker was duly elected in the August 2017 vote. Narok senior principal magistrate Tito Gesora had nullified the elections accusing the IEBC of failing to conduct free and fair elections. However, Justice Bonwonga dismissed the finding noting that the trial court failed to consider all the evidence from the witnesses. He further held that the trial court dismissed some evidence without giving reasons. The high court also found that all the agents had signed Forms 34A and that no one was locked out as earlier found by the trial court. Former Narok Majority leader Wilson Masikonde, who lost to Kuyo, had moved to court accusing his successor of using witchcraft. His argument was that the charms were to influence voter turnout on August 8, 2017.

The trial court had instructed IEBC to pay Masikonde Sh1 million and another Sh750,000 to Ole Kuyo. Judge Bonwonga, however, said the awarded cost is oppressive and therefore, ruled it out. He instead instructed Masikonde to meet Sh120,000 costs to be shared equally between Ole Kuyo and IEBC. Kuyo thanked his supporters for the patience and the peace they maintained in the year-long suit. Click here for the latest political news
