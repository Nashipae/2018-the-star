In an effort to open up the Songa by Safaricom platform to all music lovers in Kenya and reach a wider demographic, the app has launched a more affordable subscription plan through the new gold package, which effectively reduces the cost of subscription to Sh5 a day or Sh30 a week or Sh100 a month. For the pocket-friendly price, the everyday Kenyan will be able to access over 2 million tracks on the platform, download the tracks and playlists into the app and stream or listen to music without using their phone data. Songa Music GM Chinasa Udeala told Word Is, “Songa is different from all other apps in the Kenyan music space, simply because we recognise that music is an emotional product. Having this at the top of the mind, we understand that every Kenyan has his or her own local music hero or heroes.” Adding, “In keeping with this mindset, Songa has not only opened up its platform by way of a more affordable of 5 bob a day but has also developed activities and initiatives aimed at championing, promoting and supporting local Kenyan artists. These activities you will see put into action in the next few weeks.” To get the app dial *812# or download it from the google app store.
