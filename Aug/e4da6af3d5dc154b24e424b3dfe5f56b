Football fans across the UK are being encouraged to donate their old football kits to underprivileged grassroots teams across Africa as part of the ‘Kits For Africa’ campaign by SportPesa. Fans of SportPesa partners Everton, Southampton and Hull City will join players and members of the public in donating their kits throughout the season in collections held at their respective grounds. This season’s campaign kicks off at Goodison Park on August 18 as Everton take on Southampton in the second weekend of the Premier League fixtures. Collection bins will be sign-posted around the stadium for fans’ kit donations. Fans can also donate their kit at the home of Everton during game against Huddersfield Town on September 1, West Ham United on September 16 and Fulham on September 29. The campaign launched two years ago and has been a huge success with almost 30,000 kits collected last season alone and passed onto football-loving communities in Africa. This season once all kits have been collected from the participating clubs, they will be given to grassroots teams across Africa. SportPesa has a continued commitment to building and developing grassroots football in the countries where it operates and, since the company’s inception in 2014, it have quickly established itself as a community focused organisation. The Kits For Africa campaign is part of this pledge to transform lives in Africa.
