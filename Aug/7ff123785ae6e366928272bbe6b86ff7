DPP Nordin Haji has directed the DCI to arrest five Nairobi county assembly officials and a businessman over a questionable Sh997,926 tender for supply of books. They are Clerk Jacob Ngwele, Adah Onyango (deputy clerk), Philomena Nzuki (principal accountant), James Kaguma (senior procurement officer), and Fredrick Mwangi (senior finance and planning officer). Also to be arrested in Raphael Maluki, proprietor of Primara Ventures, the firm said to have been paid the cash for the books which were not delivered. The said books were to be procured for the County Assembly resource centre in the 2016/2017 financial year. "The investigations established that the said tender was never advertised and the quotations used during the process were irregularly prepared by the procurement offices," Haji said in a statement on Friday. Haji said investigators on June 29 established that no books were ever supplied and the money was, therefore, irregularly paid. "DCI submitted the inquiry file recommending that the six suspects be charged with various economic crimes," he said. The Director of Criminal Investigations has been investigating multiple cases of financial malpractice at the Nairobi assembly.
