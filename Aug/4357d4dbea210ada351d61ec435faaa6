Nasa top lawyer James Orengo has been ordered to pay his former clerk Sh600,000 for unlawful sacking. Gilbert Ogango accused the Siaya senator of frustrating him and refusing to pay him for 17 months work at his law firm. Orengo (pictured) denied employing him as a clerk or owing him money. However, Justice Onesmus Makau said Ogango proved he worked for the politician from 2008 until February 2016, when he quit because his pay had been delayed for too long. The judge awarded the former worker Sh20,000, which was his monthly salary, in lieu and a further Sh240,000 for unfair loss of employment. For the 17 months he was not paid, the clerk was given Sh340,000. The judge declined to compensate him for house allowance for lack of evidence. The court dismissed his claim for severance. He sought 15 days for each of seven years he worked. Makau said the termination was not the result of redundancy. Ogango said he had to persevere for nearly two years working at JAB Orengo Advocates, as the senior counsel kept promising he would be paid once the harsh economic times are over. He told court he was employed as a clerk at the firm through an oral contract in 2008. They agreed he would earn a Sh20,000 salary. Trouble began in September 2014 when the firm failed to pay him, although at first he did not take it seriously because sometimes his salary would be delayed. When the situation did not change, Ogango, in February 2016, opted to end his contract and sought his terminal dues — he got none. “But by looking at the change in the law firm, the harsh economic times have since passed and changed for the better, but he still refuses to pay me,” he said in an affidavit.
