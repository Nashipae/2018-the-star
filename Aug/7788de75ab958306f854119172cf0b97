The Chief Registrar of Judiciary Anne Amadi has written to the DCI over forgery of Chief Justice David Maraga's signature by fraudsters. Amadi has asked Nairobi Central DCIO Samuel Kobina to expedite investigations saying the judiciary lodged a similar complaint four months ago. This followed a letter purporting to be from CJ Maraga which was widely shared online. The fake letter quoted Maraga as declaring a go slow for judges and magistrates over budget cuts. It emerged a day after the JSC complained of being starved of cash by the Treasury.

"We hope you will expedite your investigations in order to bring the culprits to book in the shortest time possible." The latest fake letter bears Maraga's forged signature and is written under the letterheads that Amadi says is created by mischievous authors. Click here for the latest political news
