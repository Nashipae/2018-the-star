The secretariat has developed a raft of questions on graft to help gather views from participants. The objective, it says, is to create a “platform from which the voice of the Kenyan on corruption is heard without interpretation or interruption and to galvanise the support of the citizens to the ongoing war against corruption.” The 14-member task force, appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga as a result of their March 9 unity deal, is chaired by ambassador Martin Kimani and lawyer Paul Mwangi. Last month, Raila said the task force had identified corruption as the biggest challenge threatening the unity of the country.
