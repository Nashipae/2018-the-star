Education CS Amina Mohamed has raised the alarm over students changing their end-term exam results in cyber cafes. In a statement on Wednesday, Amina asked parents to confirm scores with schools. The fraud is hatched by poor-performing students and executed in cyber cafes with the help of technology. "Parents are urged to be vigilant and confirm with their respective schools the authenticity of their children’s scores in cases if they suspect foul play," she said. Amina said schools should devise ways to ensure that details in students’ report forms are beyond any form of security breach. "Some learners are tampering with their report forms when they feel the scores do not reflect their “correct” individual performances," she said. "Schools should explore the use of bulk Short Text Messages to transmit results to parents and guardians." Amina said schools will resume for third term on August 27. She said action will be taken against institutions that open before the stipulated date. She also warned schools planning holiday tuition for learners. "The management of all schools are advised against holding any holiday tuition...appropriate disciplinary and criminal proceedings will be taken against schools, and teachers who contravene this," she said.
