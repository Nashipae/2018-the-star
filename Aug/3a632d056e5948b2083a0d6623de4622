The first bodyguard of first President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta has asked the government to increase the elderly kitty. James Gatharia, alias Kamanda, said most of them fought for independence.Kamanda also asked President Uhuru Kenyatta not to relent in taking tough action against corrupt officials and leaders. The 91-year-old said each person aged above 70 receives Sh2,000 through Inua Jamii programme, but the amount is hardly enough. He said since the money is given after two months, the kitty should be added so the elderly can benefit from their fight for freedom. Click here for
