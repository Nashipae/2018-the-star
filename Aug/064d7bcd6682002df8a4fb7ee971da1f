Uasin Gishu governor Jackson Mandago has asked the government to bring back the Chiefs Act to give local administrators powers to discipline lawbreakers. The county chief said the Act will empower chiefs to fight alcoholism and discipline idlers. "It is disturbing that there are many idle youths yet they have been given chances to study for free in technical colleges," he said. The governor spoke on Thursday during the graduation of 1,200 reformed brewers held at Iten Grounds, Elgeyo Marakwet county. The Chiefs Act was created by the colonial government in the 1920s to give the local government administrative powers. It was effected on March 24, 1937. The Act, which was repealed, empowered chiefs to arrest, compel attendance before the courts, fine suspects and maintain cells or other places of confinement. The punishment for disobeying a chief included fines, month-long jail sentences or community service. The Act empowered Chiefs to regulate land uses and execute compulsory labour. "I have faith that this will bring about the change that we have always thought of in efforts to maintain public order," Mandago said. The county government of Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo, and West Pokot sponsored the women for a training for them shun alcohol brewing. Elgeyo's Alex Tolgos advised the women to form groups so as to benefit from several government opportunities including loans and tenders. "When a mother changes for the better, the society will yield to the change. This will lead to a good society," he said. Click here for the latest political news
