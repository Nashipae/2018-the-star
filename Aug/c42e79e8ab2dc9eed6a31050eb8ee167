The Nairobi county assembly is ready to approve a deputy governor if the nominated candidate meets the required qualifications. “Once the governor settles on who he will nominate, the name will be brought to the assembly and the members will decide whether to  pass the name,” Majority Chief Whip Chege Mwaura said. Polycarp Igathe resigned as deputy governor in January, saying he failed to earn Sonko’s trust. Through his Twitter handle, Igathe said he wishes to resign to avoid “abusing or betraying my oath of office to Kenyans, Nairobians and my family”, In March, the Supreme Court, in an advisory ruling, said governors are free to pick fresh nominees within 14 days to replace their deputies who resign, are impeached or die in office. Mwaura said the assembly does not have a preferred candidate. On Wednesday, Sonko shortlisted four women who could be nominated as his deputy. They are former Starehe MP Bishop Margaret Wanjiru, Nairobi businesswoman Agnes Kagure, former Nairobi woman representative aspirant and lawyer Karen Nyamu and lawyer Jane Weru. The Majority chief whip said integrity and competence are key qualities The Kenya Young Members of County Assembly chairperson June Ndegwa, who is also a nominated MCA, praised Sonko for wanting a woman deputy. “All of the nominees have potential and whoever is picked should understand how our governor works and be ready to deliver,” she said. Kariokor MCA Millicent Mugadi said all the four women are competent. “Nairobi needs a woman who can represent the people’s interests, have good public relations and above all, bea hard worker.” Political analyst Wahome Thuku said appointment of a deputy governor is long overdue. Thuku said a deputy should have the ability to step in to lead in Sonko’s absence.
