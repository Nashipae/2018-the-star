Wajir residents held demonstrations yesterday to protest against corruption allegations levelled against their Woman Representative, Fatuma Gedi. The residents, who included elders, women and youth, said they could not remain silent as her name was tarnished by false allegations. Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa singled out Gedi as one of the legislators who bribed colleagues to shoot down the sugar report by a joint parliamentary committee. Barasa claimed Gedi was protecting East African Community CS Adan Mohamed who was indicted for failure to ensure compliance with standards in the importation of allegedly contaminated sugar. He was trade minister at the time. Trader Mariam Mohamed said Gedi could not “stoop so low to bribe the MPs with a mere Sh10,000. “We read malice in whole story that is full of half-truths. Why is it only the Kimilili MP is shouting that Gedi tried bribing him?” Mohamed asked. Another resident, Edith Musyoka, urged National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi to show leadership by ordering examination of CCTV footage to expose what exactly transpired. “As residents, we are left confused amidst all these accusations and counter-accusations by our MPs. The more they accuse each other the worse they make matters. They should just shut up and behave like honourable members.” On Sunday, Gedi admitted lobbying members to defeat the sugar report but denied she gave out any money. Some MPs have said they were offered bribes to kill the report.
