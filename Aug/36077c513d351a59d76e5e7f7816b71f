Chandarana Food-plus supermarket managers failed to appear before the National Integration Commission as summoned on Friday. The managers were called to appear before the commission at 10am for probe into the racist promotion email it sent to its staff recently. They failed to show up, and after a long wait stretching almost two hours, Chairman Francis Ole Kaparo called off the meeting. He told journalists two summons had been sent to the managers who confirmed that they had received the same and would honour them. "The commission only wanted to know what exactly the message meant by the racial connotation," the Cohesion boss said. "We shall, however, still review the said statement because it is obnoxious for any person in business to engage oneself in acts construed to be racist." "...Kenya is not the right place for that," Kaparo said adding that the commission is disappointed that even foreigners can discriminate Kenyans. He said the managers will, however, be given chance to defend themselves before any action is taken.

"We would like to give you free vouchers to winner/raffles/best performer/runners-up candidate in upcoming events. As we are now focusing on white people to 'attract our supermarkets' sic," the email read in part. The management, however, apologised saying the 'error was done by a newly recruited staff in the marketing department'.
