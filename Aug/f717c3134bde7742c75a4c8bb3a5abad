Cotu has said it will fight tooth and nail to block implementation of the proposed 16 per cent VAT on petroleum products. Deputy secretary general Benson Okwaro yesterday described the proposed levy as punitive, adding that its implementation will have adverse effects on ordinary Kenyans who are already heavily taxed. Okwaro said imposing the tax will increase the cost of living as the prices of basic services and commodities will automatically shoot up. “Cotu is consulting with other like-minded Kenyans and associations with a view of stopping this punitive move on fuel by the government and such actions will include strike actions by workers,” he said. Okwaro said Cotu is partnering with civil society, Kenya Association of Manufacturers and transport sector players to ensure the proposed levy is not implemented. “We have called for a meeting of all stakeholders next week with the sole aim of stopping this government from imposing this punitive tax on Kenyans. We will do whatever it takes...” he said. Treasury CS Henry Rotich had announced during the reading of the 2018-19 Budget statement in Parliament in June that the 16 VAT on petroleum products would be implemented starting September 1. This means about Sh17 will be added for every litre of any petroleum product – kerosene, diesel and petrol. The government deferred the tax in the last two financial years following an outcry from the public. “Any attempt to increase the tax will translate into an automatic rise in the cost of living and strain the operation and growth of businesses in the country. This will lead to layoffs as employers will be striving to keep their businesses afloat,” Okwaro said. “It is the duty of the government to protect and cushion every Kenyan against any harsh economic realities, but it is disturbing their cries are unheard.”
