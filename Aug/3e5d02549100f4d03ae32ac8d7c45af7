Five Kisii politicians have pledged their support for Deputy President William Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid. They are deputy governor Joash Maangi and MPs Richard Onyonka (Kitutu Chache South), Alfah Miruka (Bomachoge Chache), Zadoc Ogutu (Bomachoge Borabu) and Silvanus Osoro (South Mugirango). They said Ruto has what it takes to be the President. The five spoke on Thursday at Tendere Stadium, where Ruto presided over a fundraiser for boda boda operators from Bomachoge. “We want to assure you of our support as leaders from this region in your bid to realising your presidential bid in 2022,” Maangi said. “We are here today as leaders from various parties to build bridges because without unity, this country will not move anywhere.” He said Kisii has developed greatly under President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto’s leadership. “You have been given a baton and it is now for you to focus on winning the race when the right time comes,” Maangi said. Onyonka said blame game will only derail the country’s progress. “When we visited you at your Sugoi home some people called us names, I do not know what they will say after this,” he said. Ruto announced that the national government will help Miruka build a medical training college in his constituency. “I am telling Miruka, even though he is new, to set aside Sh20 million towards the construction of the MTC from CDF and the government will chip in with Sh30 million,” Ruto said, amid cheers from the crowd. Last month President Kenyatta gave a directive freezing all new government projects until the ongoing ones are completed. He said this will stop waste of resources and the habit of government agencies abandoning incomplete projects before jumping onto others.
