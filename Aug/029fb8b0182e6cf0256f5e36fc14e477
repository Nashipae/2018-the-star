While Bobby Valentino won the crowd during the Terminal Music Concert, our own Habida was left licking her wounds after
being booed for her poor performance. The
event, which her husband had greatly played a big part in organising, turned out to be her worst nightmare, after being humiliated by the same
people she initially taunted for not supporting their own. From
the choice of clothing by her backup singers, who looked like they were
literally going for a dip in the swimming pool, to her vocals, Habida was
bound to fail. After enduring 40 minutes of her performance, the
audience started chanting, 'Nooo! Booo! Booo! We want Keri!' But
the humiliated damsel put on a brave face and finished her performance.
