High Commissioner to the UK nominee Manoa Esipisu yesterday dismissed accusations that he intimidated and solicited money from parastatal heads to finance State House functions. Belgut MP Nelson Koech asked Esipisu to explain why he was soliciting money to fund live coverage during President Obama and the Pope’s visits, yet the events had been budgeted for. The former State House spokesperson told the Defence and Foreign Relations committee that the events were organised by an inter-ministerial committee. "The money I have is in the form of assets. Very few people have such cash in their accounts. Without blowing my own trumpet, I’ve been engaged in many charities," Esipisu said. South Mugirango MP Sylvanus Osoro had asked why “with Sh100 million net worth” he had not contributed to charity. If approved, Esipisu will head Kenya’s mission in the UK. Meanwhile, former Kasipul Kabondo MP Paddy Ahenda, the Qatar envoy nominee, left MPs in stitches, saying he could give them an ICT lecture even though he doesn’t have any certificate in IT. Ahenda, whose only academic qualification is a Form 4 certificate, maintained that he was competent to run the mission because of his vast experience as a sales manager. "If I have to write everything about my experience, I’ll write a whole book. I’ve worked with Lorno where I was incharge of automation. I was the first person to bring a fax machine in Kenya. I’ve been a sale manager with Johnson and BML Kenya," he said. Click here for the latest political news
