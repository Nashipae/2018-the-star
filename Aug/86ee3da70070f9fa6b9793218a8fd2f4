The Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital has paid out Sh500 million to suppliers in the last six months. This was after streamlining all tendering and procurement procedures to eliminate graft and delays. Chief executive Wilson Aruasa met with suppliers and said there will be strict adherence to the law in procurement, tendering and pay procedures. The suppliers have expressed satisfaction with procedures at the hospital since Aruasa took over as CEO a year ago. He said the MTRH advertised for a two-year contract for suppliers, but the period is coming to an end. The hospital has tendered for the contracts for 2018-20. He said MTRH tenders are awarded fairly. Aruasa said MTRH has reserved 40 per cent of the tenders for youth, women and people living with disability. “MTRH is also alive to the concept of Buy Kenya-Build Kenya in relation to local content,” he said.
