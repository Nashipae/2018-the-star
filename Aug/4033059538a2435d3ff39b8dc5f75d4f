DJ Mo has enjoyed immense financial success, a solid marriage and a wonderful daughter. We recently interviewed the widely admired DJ. We asked whether he and Size 8 were considering having more kids. “Growing the family we leave that to God, but we wouldn’t mind another one.” DJ Mo is trying to build a strong social media presence through which he can mentor the youth. “I have many people I’m mentoring. Keep it always on my social media [pages] for more info”. Will he ever consider joining politics. “Yes, to just help the youth.” DJ Mo recently tried to help out a new entrant in the pizza market by trying to gobble up their largest pizza on offer.
