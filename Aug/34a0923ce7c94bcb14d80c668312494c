Police found two pistols and several bullets when they raided a house at Kihoto estate in Naivasha on Tuesday. The APs arrested two people said they believe were behind a spate of robberies in the area on the shores of Lake Naivasha, where tens of flower farm workers live. They also found sachets of a white powder suspected to be cocaine or heroin and a rocket hand-fired illuminating device. The officers acted on a tip by residents, Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said. Waweru, who addressed reporters flanked by area AP boss John Munya, said they launched a search for a suspect who fled from the scene. He added: “The illuminating device is mainly found in police or military installations and is used during night operations. We want to establish where and how they obtained it." He said the powder will be taken to the government chemist for testing and the suspects arraigned once investigations are completed. Click here for the latest political news
