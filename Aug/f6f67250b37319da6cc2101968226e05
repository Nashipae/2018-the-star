 The NSE20 Index rallied +31.02 points to close at 3321.06. Equity Turnover clocked 477.239m and would have been higher if buyers could find the supply. Williamson Tea firmed Sh4 to close at 174.00 and has had quite a run since announcing its financial year earnings and a handsome Sh20 final dividend. Its sister Co. Kapchorua Tea also followed in its slipstream and rallied +3.42% to close at 90.50. Safaricom rallied +1.7699% to close at 28.75 and traded 6.592m shares in a belated celebration around the return of its CEO Bob Collymore Esquire. KCB Group spiked +2.05% higher to close at 49.75 on heavy volume action of 3.492m shares. Housing Finance rose +1.265% to close at 8.00 and traded 1.753m shares.

Ab Inbev announced plans in March to invest $100 million in a new $1 million hectolitre per year brewery in Tanzania, where beer volumes jumped by a fifth last year [Reuters]. This spike in beer consumption in Magafuli's Tanzania was confirmed in the financial year results released by EABL where Tanzania was an outlier where Tanzania accelerated +41% outperforming Kenya +1% and Uganda. EABL closed unchanged at 223.00 and traded 1,100 shares with buyers showing for 126 time the volume traded. KenGen [which I had mentioned yesterday was egregiously oversold] rallied +6.45% to close at 6.60 and the next pit-stop is 7.00.
