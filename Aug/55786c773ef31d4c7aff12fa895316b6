Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya has said the Tuesday meeting between former Prime Minister Raila Odinga and a section of Luhya leaders had no hidden agenda. He urged leaders to stop reading too much into the meeting. The meeting in Nairobi was seen as part of Raila’s strategy to reclaim his Western support. ODM, ANC and Jubilee MPs attended. Oparanya said the participants wished to know how the Building Bridges Initiative would help the Luhya nation secure state jobs. “We sought to know what the handshake portends for us,” he said. Oparanya said the meeting also gave the leaders an opportunity to prepare a brief to President Uhuru Kenyatta ahead of the Mashujaa Day celebrations to be hosted in Kakamega. Raila is said to have offered to lead a delegation by Western leaders to State House. ANC secretary general Barrack Muluka said the meeting had sinister motives against his party leader, Musalia Mudavadi, as he was kept in the dark about it and its agenda. Muluka said the meeting was a plot by Raila to sideline Mudavadi, and termed it “a desperate attempt by Raila to hold onto the vote-rich Western bloc”. “The leaders who missed the meeting should not create unnecessary issues about it because it is not possible for everybody to be present at any given place at once. It is not possible for all of us to die on the same day,” Oparanya said. Last week, Raila said he is still in politics but did not expressly declare whether he will run for President in 2022 or not. ODM leaders are pushing him to vie for the fifth time in 2022. Oparanya said Western leaders have a right to ask Raila what the handshake has for Luhyas.
