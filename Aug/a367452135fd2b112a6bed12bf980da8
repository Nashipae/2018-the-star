Matuu OCS James Nyakanji has been recalled to Machakos county headquarters a day after residents protested against him. Yatta deputy county commissioner Edwin Chavari said on Tuesday that the OCS was moved ahead of re-deployment to another station. Nyakanji had served only two days at the station since his return, after a transfer, for a promotion. He previously served at the station as a crime buster. In the demonstrations on Monday, hundreds of  people blocked the busy Nairobi – Garissa Highway for nearly three hours and marched to Matuu police station to eject Myakanji from office. MCAs Judas Ndawa (Matuu), Joshua Mule (Ndalani), Nicholas Muia (Katangi) and Carol Musembi (nominated) took part in the protests. Ndawa led the ward representatives and residents in raising allegations related to performance against the officer. They had given a 24-hour ultimatum for Nyakanji's removal.
