Mandera governor Ali Roba has urged women to apply for jobs and advance their careers. He said on Saturday the county provides equal opportunities and will not allow gender-based discrimination. “Gone are the days when we used to view women as inferior. Time and again, they have proved that given a chance they can perform much better. I’ll be at the forefront making sure this happens,” Roba said after witnessing the swearing in of four chief officers. “You were absorbed to these positions due to our confidence in your abilities to deliver in your respective portfolios. Your security of tenure is contingent on your abilities to meet the expectation of the Mandera public.” The new officers are Shamsa Mohamud (livestock and fisheries), Vainusa Yussuf (ICT and e-Governance), Jawahira Hussein (cooperative development) and Farhiya Ali (youth affairs). Mohamud said they will perform to the best of their abilities “to act as good examples to our young daughters and society at large”. She spoke on behalf of her colleagues. Assembly speaker Mohamed Adan said gender equity plays a crucial role in development. He urged women not to fear applying for top positions. Those who meet the qualifications stand high chances of getting jobs, he said. Last week, senior resident magistrate Peter Areri led the swearing in of the executives. Roba urged residents to hold all the executives to account. He said every official will have a set of expectations and objectives to meet. The governor said he will fill the remaining chief officer slots and submit them for approval, subject to the outcome of a pending court case.
