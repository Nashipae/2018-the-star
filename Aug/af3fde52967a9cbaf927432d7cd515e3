Glowing tributes continue to flow for former UN secretary
general Kofi Annan who passed away on Saturday. The Ghanaian native and Nobel
Peace Prize laureate has been eulogised as one of Africa’s foremost statesmen. By virtue of having been only the second
African secretary general, no one can begrudge him the honour and achievement. Africa has rarely sat on the pinnacle of global power and
diplomacy and Annan’s tenure will be subject of analysis by political scientists and
historians for a long time. Critics have already written him off as a pliable
puppet of the super powers and the Security Council; a helpless bystander in
the face of major civil conflicts, who did little to reform the UN and
protect the sovereignty of the underdogs. During Annan’s tenure, the world watched the most
devastating war in recent history— against Iraq — on the pretext of destroying non-existent
chemical weapons. Many wars also raged across eastern Europe, Africa and the East. It
is also under Annan as undersecretary general for peace-keeping that the Rwanda
genocide happened. These wars scarred Annan’s otherwise sterling achievements, which include
mediation and development initiatives in several parts of the world over his 60 year-plus
diplomatic career. Kenya will remain indebted to him for leading the efforts
that averted an imminent civil war in the wake of the 2007 elections debacle. While skeptics
will dismiss him, Annan's legacy must be understood within its right context.
