Martha Karua’s appeal against the election of Kirinyaga governor Anne Waiguru will be heard on October 1. The Court of Appeal yesterday ruled that it was premature to make a determination on Karua’s application on whether she should give more evidence. Karua wants the court to allow her to bring more evidence.  Waiguru and IEBC have opposed the application. Judges Roselyne Nambuye, Hannah Okwengu and Ratembo Kairu said they will proceed with the hearing before making further directions. Parties were asked to make their submissions.
