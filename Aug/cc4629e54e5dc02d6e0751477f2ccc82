Garissa MCAs on Friday criticised outgoing Northeastern regional commissioner Mohamud Saleh for allegedly making negative remarks on the disputed boundary between the county and Wajir. Minority leader Mohamed Ali and Majority’s Mahat Osman accused Saleh of instructing the county commissioner to forcibly evict people in the disputed areas including Baraki ward and Aqal-Arr area. “Saleh has no mandate to do inter-county boundary demarcations,” Goriale MCA Abdirahman Mohamed said in a statement read on behalf of his colleagues. But Saleh, who was two weeks ago appointed as director of reforms in the Interior ministry, denied making negative comments. “I would be the last person to incite communities against each other knowing very well how emotive boundery issues are in this region. While in Wajir, I did not at all mention any specific place to define the borders. All I did was to talk about areas that have had long-standing border issues across the region in the three counties of Mandera, Wajir and Garissa,” he said. Several people across Northeastern have lost their lives due to boundary disputes and calls for the government to set the demarcation have been met with resistance by politicians. The ward reps said according to the Constitution, boundaries of a county may be altered by a resolution recommended by an independent commission set up for that purpose. “We reiterate and boldly state the fact that Northeastern region and Garissa in particular cannot afford to be shackled by violence in all forms. We will equally not accept government officers to incite people to violence,” Abdirahman said. They called on the Interior ministry to ensure all citizens are allowed to freely exercise their constitutional rights including freedom to live anywhere in the country. Saleh allegedly said the national government will revert to the old boundaries of three constituencies within Wajir to end disputes and bloodshed.
