The Kenya Bureau of Standards has directed the revocation of imports registered under Route B to allow for fresh vetting of their verification procedures. The standards regulator has also warned product verification agents against allowing importation of substandard and counterfeit goods. In a letter seen by the Star on Wednesday, Kebs managing director Charles Ongwae said the revocation follows efforts to tame importation of counterfeits. He said Pre-Export Verification of Conformity (PVOC) registered products under route B and those licensed under route C will be subjected to mandatory physical inspection every time they are exported to Kenya. The routes are the levels of verification of products. Route A is applicable to any good and any trader, Route B â€“ for frequent
traders of goods that have been registered by Bureau Veritas, while
Route C is for manufacturers who had their goods licensed for Kenya. "There shall be no less container load (LCL) consignments. All consignments certified under route A to be subjected to mandatory testing and container sealing," Ongwae said. The Kebs boss said the PVOC agents should at no time allow substandard products to be certified under them. Ongwae said they have instructed the agents to ensure products that do not meet standards or approved specifications are rejected at the country of origin.
