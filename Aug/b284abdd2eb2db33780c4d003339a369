The driver of Kitui deputy governor was found drunk at a Mombasa pub after reports emerged he had gone missing since Thursday. Kitui county police commander Anthony Kamitu yesterday said Deputy Governor Wathe Nzau had reported to the Mwingi police that Anthony Kang’oti could not be traced. His mobile phone was switched off. Kang’oti had dropped his boss at St Joseph’s Seminary, Kitui, during a funeral service for 10 St Gabriel’s Boarding Primary School pupils who died in a road accident. He never returned to pick him up. Kamitu said that through coordinated police efforts, they traced the car to Kiembeni where Kang’oti was found intoxicated. “Kang’oti was arrested and locked up at Kiembeni police station awaiting escort to Mwingi police station. He will be charged with misuse of a government vehicle,” he said. The car was parked outside a bar. Kisauni police boss Sangura Musee said members of the public informed his officers of the abandoned car. “It had been parked there for three days,” he said. Nzau said he had no idea why Kang’oti left for Mombasa without informing him. “I don’t know what got into his head, but the police are handling the matter,” he said.
