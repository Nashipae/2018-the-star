Police in Bungoma are searching for six suspects who gang raped a bar attendant in Bumula, Bungoma, on Tuesday. The thugs struck at about 1am in the pretext of looking for accommodation. When the 23-year-old bar worker opened the door of the popular joint near Mateka shopping centre, they pounced on her. She told journalists her attackers forcibly carried her to a sugarcane plantation and raped her in turns. The thugs threatened to shoot the girl if she screamed. The bar owner, who fled during the commotion, told the press that one man knocked at the rooms where we were sleeping saying they are customers looking for rooms. "When we opened the door, the gunman ordered us to lie down on the floor. They were in police uniform," she said. The woman said neighbours alerted officers at Mateka AP Post after they sounded an alarm. "This is the second attack at the premises. Gangsters raped another bar attendant in April last year after demanding money." Area chief Julius Nyongesa said the thieves stole an unknown amount of money and a mobile phone. Bumula boda boda association chairman Johnson Ikanda and Brian Masika, a member of the security team, condemned the incident. They want the national government to give the APs in the area a vehicle so that they can swiftly respond to such distress calls. Click here for the latest political news
