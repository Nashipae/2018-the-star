Governor Mike Sonko on Tuesday served Subaru Motors with a notice to vacate a piece of land along James Gichuru Rd with immediate effect. The county boss said the Lavington parcel was allocated to Nairobi City Council by President Jomo Kenyatta for construction of a public library. In a statement, Sonko said that much as the proprietor is his friend, he is "sorry for him as they (with President Uhuru Kenyatta) shall not mix friendship with the big fight". This was in reference to the president's fresh impetus in the fight against corruption and impunity. A number of businesses have been affected in the efforts to reclaim riparian reserves and grabbed public land. Among them is Southend Mall, Ukay Centre, parts of Oshwal Centre among other small business establishments across the city. Sonko said the county is moving on a high gear after successfully reverting the Gigiri fire station plot back to public use last week. He said records from the Lands ministry and the City Council of Nairobi showed that the said plot on LR. NO. 3734/843 was reserved for construction of a public library. "The land where Subaru Motors stands was allocated to the City Council of Nairobi on March 1, 1972." "This was for a lease period of 99 years for use and construction of a public library," Sonko said. He further asserted that the land was transferred to an entity - Riverbank Limited, which is associated with a former senior staff of the Nairobi city council. Lease papers of the said parcel have conditions which restrained the city council from subdividing, selling, transferring, or subletting the land. "This clearly elaborates that the last transfer entry on the title that the land was transferred to Riverbank Limited was illegal, null, and void."
