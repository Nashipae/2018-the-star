Multi-award winning mental health advocate Sitawa Wafula has switched gears to become an online radio host. Sitawa is best known for running a Google award-winning blog that provided people in Africa with mental health information and support. She also set up Kenyaâ€™s first mental health support line, which provided more than 11,000 Kenyans with information and linkages to support groups, psychologists and psychiatrists in its first year. Her latest project, a two-hour-weekly radio show called My Mind My Funk Radio, is a spin-off from her blog, which she ran for eight years. She used her personal experience, living with epilepsy and bipolar, to bring mental health conversations to the forefront in Africa. After she recovered, Sitawa stopped running the blog. Her guests on the radio show include people living with mental health conditions, caregivers, service providers as well as people who do not fall in any of the above groups but are keen about self care. The live show airs every Wednesday 11-1p EAT onrasioasylum.com.
