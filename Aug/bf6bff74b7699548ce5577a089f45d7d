Public Service CS Margaret Kobia has urged PSs to uphold integrity in their departments. The CS cited former Youth Affairs PS Lillian Omollo, who is among those charged in the Sh9 billion NYS scandal. Omollo has been replaced by Francis Owino. “We don’t want to judge anybody, but when something goes wrong in your department you will be held accountable,” Kobia said. The Public Service ministry came up with the Rapid Results Initiative on May 3 to upscale implementation of priority programmes in 100 days and improve attainment of the Big Four agenda. “Former PS Omollo was the one who championed the launch of the RRI and had so much passion in it, but when questions were raised about finances in her department, she had to be accountable.” The CS attended the RRI end-term review celebrations at the Kenya School of Government on Friday. The programme focussed on youth and women empowerment, Huduma Kenya, Human Resource management, gender policy, National Youth Service, administration support and communication and visibility. “The NYS had a target to plant three million trees and this was achieved. Another target was to plant one million food trees to address food security and that was achieved within the 100 days,” she said. Click here for the latest political news
