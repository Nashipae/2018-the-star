Parents are to blame for unrest in schools, Fardousa Osman has said.
The wife of Garissa governor Ali Korane yesterday said parents have abdicated their roles and burden teachers.
At least 152 students have been charged with causing unrest and burning property in more than 70 schools — none from Northeastern.
Osman said children with proper upbringing have no reason to be unruly because they have better understanding of situations. She spoke at Hyuga Girls’ Primary School where she donated sanitary pads.
“As a mother, I’m disturbed by the current wave of school fires. This is pure madness. It has to stop. I’m deeply disheartened. Schools go up in flames almost daily,” she said.
“We can talk from sunrise to sunset, but the bottom line is how well parents bring up their children It will make a difference. If parents instil discipline in our children, other things will automatically fall into place.”
Osman praised Northeastern students for restraining themselves. She said students who destroy schools end up destroying their future.
“They not only hurt their parents who pay for the destruction but also their own future. Rebuilding a razed infrastructure is expensive. Why subject parents to psychological torture?” Osman asked.
She launched a three-year essential drugs and supplies programme to promote menstrual hygiene.
“Many girls drop out of school because they can’t afford sanitary pads, the initiative will go a long way in retaining girls in school,” she said.
Teachers and parents will be trained to implement the project.
