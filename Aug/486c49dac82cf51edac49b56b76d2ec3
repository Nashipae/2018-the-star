A Senate watchdog committee yesterday turned away Garissa Governor Ali Korane after the county boss appeared before it without the requisite papers. Korane was to be questioned by the County Public Accounts and Investment Committee over 2014-15 audit queries raised by Auditor General Edward Ouko. CPAIC session chairman Ledama Olekina (Narok) ended the session prematurely after it became apparent the governor had not served the office of the Auditor General with the documents as required. “Now that you do not have the crucial documents asked by the Auditor General, we will be forced to adjourn the sitting and a new date will be communicated when you will answer to the five audit queries raised,” he said. The governor told the committee his administration has had difficulties retrieving documents from the former office which he accused of not keeping records of their activities and expenditure. chartered flight At one point, the first-time governor asked the committee to consider inviting his predecessor Nathif Jama to shed light on the issues raised in the Ouko’s report. “We faced numerous challenges in getting documents to answer to these queries,” Korane told CPAIC. He said some of the documents were still being withheld by investigators from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. EACC has been investigating some of the suspicious deals the county entered into during the last regime. Isiolo senator Fatuma Dullo said EACC should only pick photocopies of the documents and not original documents from the counties. “We need to address this matter with EACC,” she said. Ouko had questioned why the county single-sourced a chartered aircraft to ferry the governor and other leaders from Nairobi to six Garissa subcounties and back to the city. Ouko said despite the county paying Sh1,578,100 for the service, there was no programme to support and confirm the governor’s visit to the subcounties.
