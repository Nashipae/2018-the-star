Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua met in public on Saturday, days after the Wiper leader pledged to support Jubilee agenda. Mutua and Kalonzo have agreed to meet next week in what seems to be signs of thawing of political rivalry between the two leaders. The governor, who is Maendeleo Chap Chap leader, said they enjoyed moments of laughter as they discussed life and "agreed to call each other to share a cup of tea". The two met at Karen Community Church in Nairobi where they attended the wedding of Robert Kivutha, son of Makueni Governor and wiper party chairman Kivutha Kibwana. Last week, Mutua invited Kalonzo to work with him to accelerate development for the common interest of the people of Machakos. Mutua said that since they are both supporting President Uhuru Kenyatta's Big Four agenda and fight against corruption, it was only logical that they join forces for the sake of posterity. Their signs of warming up to each other started after the Wiper leader publicly endorsed Uhuru's administration and declared support for the handshake with ODM's Raila Odinga. The decision was reached during the party's National Executive Council meeting at the Wiper headquarters on July 28. "It is now the decision of the NEC/PG of the Wiper to directly work with
President Uhuru in his effort to transform Kenya. Our members of
parliament should stand guided by this resolution," the party
resolution read in part. The two leaders have been reading from different scripts over the running of Machakos county, a situation that was amplified during the August 2017 poll. The row was escalated in the wake of former Kathiani MP Wavinya Ndeti's claim to the governor seat. The Wiper candidate's case is pending at the Supreme Court.
