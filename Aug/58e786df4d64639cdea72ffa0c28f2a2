Zimbabwean pugilist Monalisa Sibanda will be seeking to end her winless jinx against Kenyan boxers as she battles Everline ‘Lioness’ Odero for the vacant Women’s International Boxing Association (WIBA) World Super Lightweight title at the Treasure Gardens in Nairobi today. Odero is the third Kenyan Sibanda will be fighting in her career after falling in the previous two. In November 2005, Sibanda suffered her first loss to World Boxing Council (WBC) Super bantamweight Fatuma Zarika following a second round TKO in a non-title fight in Nairobi. On February 4  2006 at Nyayo Stadium, Sibanda was outpointed by former World International Boxing Federation (WIBF) Middleweight champion Conjestina ‘Hands of Stone’ Achieng in a hard-fought six-round bout. “God has restored my strength. I am stronger and better than I have been before. My goal is to become a world champion and I am promising Zimbabwe that I will bring a world title here,” said Sibanda. Promoter Caleb Kuya of Osaga Promotions said he chose to give Sibanda her last chance for a title fight on Kenyan soil having succumbed in her last two. “If she loses that will be the end of the story as I will not want it top look like I am always bringing punching bag for Kenyans to punch and abandon. Preparations for the fight are in final stages and I urge fans to turn up in large numbers to watch and cheer the boxers of their choice,” said the former boxer.
