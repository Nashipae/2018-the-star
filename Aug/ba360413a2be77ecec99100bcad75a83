Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has planned an address to Kenyans living in the United States on the handshake and 2022 politics. The legislator, through the Moses Kuria Foundation, will hold the interactive session at Boston, Massachusetts. He says the September 1 talk will focus on the journey of his life, the handshake, 2022 and beyond; as well as Big Four. President Uhuru Kenyatta set manufacturing, universal healthcare, affordable housing, and food security as the four pillars of development that he would use to seal his legacy. The meeting will also duel on issues of the Coffee Bill, 2018 and how Kenyans in the diaspora can help in marketing the country's produce. Kuria is also expected to address issues on Kenya's current political situation. This comes at a time speculation of a Jubilee split is rife. The party has denied the existence of any rift within its top echelons. The legislator is also due to address Kenyans living in the USA on the need for a diaspora social responsibility strategy. He will share insights on how DSR can be explored as a new alternative to corporate social responsibility. Kuria's tour will follow barely days after Uhuru's Monday meeting with US President Donald Trump. Foreign Affairs CS Monica Juma on Thursday led an advance team in preparation for the summit.
