DPP Noordin Haji has directed Director of Criminal Investigations to immediately commence investigations on officers involved in approval of building in riparian land. His order comes just hours after President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered those found culpable for allocating riparian and public utility land to private developers to be prosecuted. “I have directed the Director of Criminal Investigations to immediately commence comprehensive investigations to establish the circumstances, the procedures and the persons who irregularly and /or illegally issued the approval for the constructions of any buildings and /or structure on riparian land,” Haji said in a statement on Thursday.
