Donald Trump has revoked the
security clearance of ex-CIA chief John Brennan, denying the US
president's critic of any access to sensitive information. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders announced the decision by reading a statement from Trump. The statement cited Brennan's "erratic conduct and behaviour". Brennan described Trump's performance after July's summit with
Russian President Vladimir Putin as being "nothing short of treasonous". On
Wednesday, Brennan tweeted at the president: "It's astounding how
often you fail to live up to minimum standards of decency, civility,
& probity. Seems like you will never understand what it means to be
president, nor what it takes to be a good, decent, & honest person.
So disheartening, so dangerous for our Nation." Trump is also
reviewing access to classified information for former FBI director James
Comey, who he fired last year, and former director of national
intelligence James Clapper, among others. Click here for the latest political news
