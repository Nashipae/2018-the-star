Republican US Senator John
McCain has chosen to discontinue medical treatment for an
aggressive form of brain cancer, his family said in a statement
on Friday, a year after the Vietnam War hero announced his
prognosis. "John has surpassed expectations for his survival," the
family said, adding that the disease's progression and McCain's
age, 81, have led him to stop treatment for the "aggressive
glioblastoma." "With his usual strength of will, he has now chosen to
discontinue medical treatment," the family said. McCain, who represented Arizona in the Senate and House of
Representatives for 35 years, had said the cancer was discovered
in July 2017 and he has not been at the US Capitol this year. He also had surgery for an intestinal infection in April. McCain has had a reputation for speaking his mind, which led
to a running feud with President Donald Trump that grew heated
in 2015 when McCain said Trump's candidacy had "fired up the
crazies." Trump retorted that the senator was "not a war hero" and
cited McCain's 5-1/2 years as a prisoner of the North Vietnamese
by saying: "I like people who weren't captured." Also read: White House official mocked 'dying' Senator McCain - US media Click here for the latest political news
