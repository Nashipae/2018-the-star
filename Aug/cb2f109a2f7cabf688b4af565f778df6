DPP Noordin Haji has ordered the prosecution of Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe over the irregular purchase of maize by Cereals Board officials. The matter has been under investigation in the wake of farmers' complaints of non-payment of Sh1.9 billion for produce delivered to the National Cereals and Produce Board depots. An internal ministry report had
smoked out 18 unscrupulous traders, suspected to have links with powerful
people who benefited from the payout. The report laid bare the rot at the NCPB, exposing how well-connected cartels are
minting billions at the expense of farmers. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri earlier said he had kicked
off a grand house cleaning at the Board. More on this: Inside story of the NCPB maize scam Click here for the latest politicalÂ news
