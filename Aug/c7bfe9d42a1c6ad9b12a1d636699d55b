The DCI and DPP
have powers to investigate and prosecute. Judicial officers —
magistrates and judges — are no exception. However, there's a precedent. Unless it's a crime of a personal
nature causing bodily harm or anything requiring immediate
police action — as for GBM Kariuki — all other cases have
been handled through the Judicial Service Commission. The case of DCJ Nancy Baraza, which was essentially a criminal
complaint, was not pursued through the DCI. The JSC itself picked it, reviewed it and recommended formation of a tribunal. This was
also the case for Justices Joseph Mutava and Philip Tunoi. This was a big
surprise because of the manner in which DCJ Philomena Mwilu
was raised in the Daily Nation for the last three days. The reports
tended to indicate the DCI was investigating a very serious
crime of abuse of office, corruption and tax evasion. However, the charge is a clear case of commercial transaction between
a judge and a bank. Therefore, it's baffling why the DCI decided to take
such a serious case that had the effect of demeaning the DCJ's office. It was neither a serious nor a criminal matter. From what we've reviewed, this is clearly a civil dispute between
Imperial Bank, which is under receivership, and the judge. Further, the properties she is claimed to have purchased without paying stamp duty
were all acquired before she became DCJ. By the time she was being
vetted, she received clearances from KRA, EACC and
the DCI. I highly doubt they lacked capacity to unearth these alleged crimes. Or does it mean the crimes were not there, and have
just been created? Graft must be fought
to extinction. But you cannot fight impunity with impunity. At
this rate, independent institutions will be misused. Here it appears the DCI and the DPP have been working in cahoots. Yet, one is suppose to investigate and
the other look at the investigations and make an independent decision.
When they work together, where is the objectivity? The lawyer spoke to the Star
