KeNHA has reappointed Peter Mundinia as the Director General for a second 3-year term effective August 2018. In a statement on Monday, chairman Erastus Mwongera said Mundinia has been instrumental in implementation of the board's policies. He said the Kenya National Highways Authority boss has also been at the forefront in ensuring that all projects are implemented as planned. Mundinia has been at the helm of KeNHA since August 2015. He is a member of the Kenya Institute of Management. "He has superintended over implementation of a new organisational structure aimed at improving the Authority’s effectiveness and efficiency." "This has been a key focus area for the board following the re-categorisation of KeNHA by the government from Public Service category 3A to Category 7A1," he said. Mwongera praised the director for his accomplishments in completion of key roads among them Dongo Kundu bypass in Mombasa. He was hailed for the works on Voi – Mwatete and Mwatete – Taveta Road corridor, the Merille River- Marsabit- Moyale road, Webuye – Kitale road, Sotik – Ndanai – Gorgor road, and Masara – Suna – Kehancha road.
