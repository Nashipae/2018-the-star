Some Bungoma MCAs have threatened to impeach Governor Wycliffe Wangamati (pictured) for alleged abuse of office. MCAs Ali Mutoka (Maraka), Stephen Wamalwa (Soysambu/Mitua) and Kimaeti Ward MCA Jack Wambulwa also accused Wangamati of slashing their ward development fund from Sh17 million to Sh4 million. Mutoka accused the governor of high-handedness and of making decisions without consultations. “We have a governor who is la aw unto himself and never follows the law at all. As an oversight house the earlier we make things right the better,” he said at the assembly yesterday. Mutoka said no flagship project had yet taken off. He cited an airstrip and an industrial park promised by Wangamati and for which the assembly set aside money. “We passed the budget as a house but we’re surprised the governor goes around to change projects and allocations of money without bringing it back to the house for amendment as stipulated by law,” he said. The MCA said the governor preferred to work alone and to bypass the assembly, which plays the oversight and legislative roles. His sentiments were echoed by Soysambu/Mitua Ward MCA Wamalwa. “Devolution came so that it can equalise areas that were lagging behind. I’m willing to go home but Wangamati should go first,” Wamalwa said. He said that if the governor won’t change his working relationship with MCAs, he will be the first governor to be impeached. “He is too proud and is always ignoring the assembly. He individually makes decisions which will haunt him inthe future. We don’t want to fall victim to his underhand mechanisms, the best way is to impeach him,” Wamalwa said. He said leaders should fulfill all campaign promises. “It is only Bungoma that has not initiated a single project since the second assembly started,” he said.
