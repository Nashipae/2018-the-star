Siaya senator James Orengo wants audit committee meetings in Parliament suspended until claims of MPs' bribery in the sugar report are addressed. He asked National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi to put the meetings on hold for two weeks until members come clean on the allegations. Orengo said some MPs were mentioned adversely after the report was shot down in the House. He spoke in Ugunja of Saturday. The Senate Leader of Minority said Parliament's work will be in vain if the committees do not do their work diligently and transparently. Orengo said it is the duty of lawmakers to ensure public resources are well managed. "Apart from the oversight role, the Senate and Parliament have powers to summon and impeach. That is the reason we cannot allow honorable members to misbehave," Orengo said.

"When former Nyandarua North MP JM Kariuki was murdered in cold blood, Parliament stood firm on its report," Orengo said. The senator was accompanied by Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo and Ugunja Opiyo Wandayi. Odhiambo distanced himself from the bribery allegations. He condemned colleagues for "stooping too low and being compromised". He claimed some MPs were "bought" cheaply for as little as Sh10,000 to frustrate the report. "It was a sad day for me when I learnt that some of my colleagues can be compromised with Sh10,000," Odhiambo said. He told voters to kick out such leaders in the 2022 election. Wandayi said he will not allow Parliament to be tainted by few individuals. He said he will be the last person to be associated with a corrupt Parliament. "I want the media to highlight the names of rogue MPs who were captured taking bribes to avoid dumping all MPs in a pit of corruption," Wandayi said.
