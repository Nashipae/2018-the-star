Raila Odinga's daughter Rosemary celebrated her 41st birthday last weekend. Rosemary, the secondborn child of Raila and Ida Odinga, has been lying low after undergoing a successful surgery to remove a brain tumor earlier this year in South Africa. The lavish one of a kind party held at Deep Riding School in Spring Valley. Rosemary's two daughters, parents, sister Winnie, nephew–the late Fidel Odinga's son–were present. Other notable figures included businessmen Mike Njeru and Kevin Obia, and radio king Shaffie Weru. In her speech, Ida said she was home alone when the time came for her to give birth to Rosemary. "My water broke and Raila was not home. He was at Nyayo National Stadium watching a Gor Mahia match," she said. The Odingas are ardent Gor Mahia supporters and the late Fidel would never miss a match. Raila attended three functions on Saturday, among them Mama Oliech's funeral in Ratta, Seme subcounty, Kisumu county. The former Prime Minister described her as an industrious woman, "Mary was a dedicated and hardworking woman. She was one of my advisers,"  he said before leaving for Kisii county. At his daughter's birthday, Raila said: "Even if I die today, I know I am well represented." Rosemary was all jovial as she cracked jokes at her birthday dinner. There were 41 cupcakes and a Channel inscribed designer cake. "I'm proud and happy for the far I've come. It's a blessing to see the family has grown to be big," she said
