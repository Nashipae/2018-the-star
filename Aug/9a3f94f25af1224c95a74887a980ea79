A family in Kisumu is searching for body parts of their daughter whose remains were found in a sugarcane plantation on Monday. Melsa Akinyi, 13, was reported missing two weeks ago. She was a Standard Seven pupil at Obwolo Primary School in Kajulu, Kisumu East. She was last seen on July 29 after leaving the Kisumu ASK Show at Mamboleo Grounds. Her uncle Dalmas Agutu said Akinyi left the showground to visit her aunt who lives at Kenya Sugar Research Foundation (KSRF) quarters in Kibos. Although the watchman confirmed seeing her, her uncle said she never reached her aunt’s house. "The security guard talked to Akinyi, but it later emerged she never reached her aunt's house," Agutu said. Akinyi’s aunt Auko Rabugi said when she noticed the girl was taking too long, she went to inquire from the watchman if he had seen her. The watchman, only identified as Ondagwa, said he had seen the girl entering the KSRF compound. Rabugi said she reported about the missing girl at the chief’s office in Miwani. She said the girl did not reach her house. "The watchman told me he directed her to where I live, but I did not see her." Rabugi told the Star on the phone that Ondagwa discovered the body parts after fruitless efforts to trace the girl. The girls uncle said residents reported a stench coming from a nearby sugarcane plantation. "The hands and legs are missing. We are shocked by the gruesome murder of our daughter. It appears the killers took away some body parts," Agutu said. The girl's mother, Millicent Abok, wants the watchman questioned by police. Akinyi said the girl was going to help her aunt to harvest maize before she was killed. The family has reported the matter at Nyangeta AP Post in Kibos. It has appealed for help to find the missing parts. The body was taken to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary. Click here for the latest political news
