Teachers have threatened to go on strike after September if the unfriendly policies will not have been reviewed. Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion said it is regrettable to see the Teachers Service Commission imposing failed guidelines on teachers and expect them to keep quiet. He said their planned strike has not been withdrawn, but just put on hold until September 30. Sossion said their meeting with TSC on Thursday didn’t yield fruit but “for the love of students”, they are giving TSC one month to review their policies before they swing into action. He spoke to teachers in Bondo on Friday. Sossion said the one month window is to allow TSC to review the issue of delocalisation, Teacher Performance Appraisal and Development and promotion based on skills of service. “The move to abolish promotion based on the skills of service will not be entertained as it is grossly illegal,” he said. Sossion insisted that teachers with higher qualifications will be promoted as it is their intellectual rights. He warned the TSC against putting the “bad policy” in place without consulting teachers. “We are going to ensure all teachers’ problems end by September or we blow the whistle for the mother of all strikes,” Sossion said. He said they will not negotiate with TSC on delocalisation as its the President’s directive to return all affected teachers to their families.
