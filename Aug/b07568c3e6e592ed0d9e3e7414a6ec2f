The Nairobi government on Monday received 25 medics from the US who will work in city hospitals for two weeks. The team that includes 10 specialists from Hope International Organisation in New York will be based at Pumwani, Mama Lucy, Mbagathi and Mutuini hospitals. Acting county Health executive Veska Kangogo said the county government is revamping city hospitals to meet international standards. She said the visiting doctors will officer cancer treatment, paediatric and cardiology services. Head of the delegation Amy Korir said the team is ready to help county staff deliver services. Oncologist specialised in breast surgery Ogoti Kalu said they are looking forward to offering their expertise. "We are eager to help the communication and healthcare professionals here with our knowledge and skills for the time we will be here," Kalu said. Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union Nairobi branch secretary general Thuranira Kuagiria welcomed the doctors. "The doctors will help in training local medics for the short period they will be in the county. We can all learn something from each other," Thuranira said. At the same time, Kagongo said the county is expected to flag off its first consignment of drugs from the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority today. "The government has been having negotiations with Kemsa on how to clear a Sh285 million debt," Kagongo said. She said they have agreed on a payment plan.
