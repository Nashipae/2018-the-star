Minority leader John Mbadi has said he is ready to be investigated over bribery claims surrounding the contraband sugar report. He said he was not influenced by bribes to vote against the report by the joint parliamentary committee that investigated the sugar importation scandal. “I got irritated from the moment the committee started receiving witnesses to give an account in the sugar investigations and when the full report was tabled I saw it was a mockery to Kenyans,” Mbadi said. Speaking to the Star on Tuesday, Mbadi reiterated that the report was not conclusive as it lacked the names of sugar barons involved in the illicit trade and failed to answer critical questions that Kenyans wanted.

The Suba South MP blamed the committee for doing shoddy investigations to protect sugar barons who were involved in the scam. Mbadi insisted that he will still oppose the sugar report if it is brought to the floor of the House for the second time in the same manner. He said that the report should not be politicized after it failed to meet the expectations of Parliament. Bribery claims had rocked Parliament over the shooting down of a joint committee report on bad sugar, with a number of MPs distancing themselves from such accusations. Some legislators led by Suna East MP Peter Masara had called on the Director of Public Prosecutions to investigate all MPs over the issue.
