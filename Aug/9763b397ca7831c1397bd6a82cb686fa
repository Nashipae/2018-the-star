President Uhuru Kenyatta reaffirmed his commitment yesterday to fighting corruption, warning he was ready to lose his friends in the anti-graft war. The President said he had already lost many friends over the last few weeks but pledged government will not relent until the battle to rid Kenya of corruption and impunity is won. This statement by the head of state will go a long way in energising the battle against greed and dishonesty. Kenya has been experiencing organised, grand-scale and syndicated corruption at the expense of taxpayers. Although the country has strong laws, their application has been selective, tending to net the small fish, those who are often less influential and have no political connections. What is refreshing is that the agencies involved in the fight have recently made high-profile arrests and arraigned people who were powerful and heretofore untouchable. The decision by the President to openly back anti-graft agencies is welcome and should be supported by all. The public needs to be reminded that since corruption affects everyone, fighting it is a national issue. Ending corruption is both a moral imperative and a practical move to make democracy and the economy work better.
