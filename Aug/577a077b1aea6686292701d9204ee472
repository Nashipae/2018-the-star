Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has appealed to the private sector to work with the Nairobi county government in the beautification project. He said works towards making the capital city cleaner and beautiful as per international standards is not a preserve of the county government. Sonko made the call during an inspection of the beautification along Mombasa road on Saturday. The governor also welcomed the private sector to work with his administration in the monthly clean-ups. "Iâ€™m appealing to members of the private sector in Nairobi to come on board and join us in the campaign to ensure the city is cleaner and safer." "We want to make Nairobi the green city under the sun," the governor said after planting a tree near the Nyayo Stadium roundabout. Sonko also asked private developers who have encroached public land in the city to vacate and pave way for construction and expansion of roads. "We are working with all state agencies to ensure our roads are fixed. Let those who have occupied public land to leave and create space for the works." He also promised that the garbage menace in Nairobi will soon come to an end once his administration completes the Dandora dumpsite recycling plant. The tender for the construction of the waste to energy plant is set to be awarded in November. The Governor further stated that plans are on to construct link roads in Nairobi, starting with one connecting Westlands to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. "The Westlands-JKIA link road will help. My administration and the national government are working together to ensure the project succeeds." The governor was accompanied by the Sikh community chairman Gurdeep Singh of Siri Gurdwara Ramgarhia who backed the plans to develop Nairobi. "We are very proud of you Governor. You have fought corruption very nicely without factoring tribe, colour or religion," he said.
