The Public Service ministry has accused the disciplined forces of not properly following President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive to hire a proportion of NYS servicemen and women during their annual recruitment. In February, Uhuru said he would require a compliance update from all the forces following the directive.

Shebesh said the disciplined forces have been sourcing for servicemen and women who had already left NYS. “When the disciplined forces want recruits, they do engage us but not on our trained servicemen and women. They look for recruits who have already left the service and therefore, the youth component is lost,” Shebesh said. This is after committee chairman and Bura MP Ali Wario asked the CAS to shed light on the progress of implementation of the directive. “What is the essence of having a presidential directive? There is no way a presidential directive will fail to be implemented. Otherwise what is the work of the Cabinet?” queried Wario. Shebesh said, “We do have the capacity to do recruitment and present the best servicemen and women to the forces. But as long as it is within their purview to recruit, we cannot dictate”. Also see: President Uhuru orders increase of NYS recruits as over 10,000 graduate Click here for the latest political news
