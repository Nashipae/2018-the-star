National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has rejected the nomination of former Senator Halima Mohammed to the Salaries and Remuneration Commission. The matter was raised by Funyula MP Wilberforce Oundo on whether the nominee met the 10-year-experience threshold required by law. Section 5 of the SRC Act requires commissioners to have at least 10 years experience. The CV presented before Parliament shows Mohammed was born in 1988 and graduated in 2011. “If she graduated in 2011, does she meet the requirements of 10 years’ experience? We should not make a decision which can be challenged,” Oundo said. National Assembly Committee on Finance and National Planning chairman Charles Limo fumbled with the document as the Speaker demanded to know the page that documented her alleged experience. Limo said she was a former student leader and worked with Red Cross in 2007. Read:SRC nominees hint at reviewing MPs’ salary  Click here for the latest political news
