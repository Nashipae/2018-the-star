ODM has aksed President Uhuru Kenyatta to petition Parliament to create a law on lifestyle audit. Party secretary for political affairs Opiyo Wandayi yesterday said there is need for a legislation to boost Uhuru’s directive on lifestyle audit. The Ugunja MP who also chairs the National Assembly Public Accounts Committee said the directive lacks an official roadmap for implementation. “Let him [Uhuru] activate the AG’s office to move with speed and furnish Parliament with the requisite proposals for Parliament to do its part,” Wandayi said. He said the audit should be conducted secretly but in a transparent manner. Wandayi asked the President to come out and openly brief the nation on the audit process. “We are just hearing rumours that the audit is happening on the background secretly. The forces that have been benefiting from corruption and impunity are so strong and entrenched that if given a small window will scuttle the entire project on the fight against corruption,” he said. “The President must save us from this anxiety. We haven’t seen any official roadmap towards implementing the noble directive on lifestyle audit of public and state officers.” Uhuru said he would be the first to be audited followed by Deputy President William Ruto. Ruto said all public servants must submit themselves for the audit “when the time comes.” “William Ruto will be among the first to submit himself for that exercise,” Ruto said in Mombasa recently.  Governors and Cabinet Secretaries will be the next in line for the vetting. Opposition chief Raila Odinga has supported the lifestyle audit order. Wandayi said the audit order should be implemented. He said the audit will save the country from thieves.
