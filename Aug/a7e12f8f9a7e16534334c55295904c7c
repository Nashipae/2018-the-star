The public health department has shut down toilets at one of the Elgeyo Marakwet County buildings that houses more than 120 employees. Shockingly, the building houses offices of the health executive and other officials including the Chief Officer and Director. Public health officer Mathew Kore said the toilets are in pathetic condition and could cause diseases. Kore said the public service and administration had been asked to comply with requisite health standards but failed to act. The toilets also serve hundreds of residents who throng the offices daily for services. “We took the move to close the toilets to protect the staff from poor hygienic conditions. As county workers, we have to lead by example,” Kore said. He said employees and the public will have to seek alternative sanitary facilities in Iten until the public administration department complies with public health standards. A notice placed on a door of one of the closed toilets read, “following inspection and notices served on this building, the public health officer has found out that the toilets being used are very dirty hence the office has decided to close all the toilets until further notice.” Kore gave the county administration 14 days to clean the toilets, failure to which, he said he will seek a court order to close down the building.
