The Committee on Members Services in the National Assembly has recommended a substantial upgrade in terms and conditions for MPs. There has been controversy over 'blind masseurs' in the parliamentary gym but many other suggestions will be far more costly. In particular the MPs want their salaries increased to match Cabinet secretaries and judges. They want their Sh5 million car grant increased so they can buy big 4WD vehicles. And they want their Sh 20 million mortgage increased plus a housing allowance to cover the interest. Our MPs are already among the highest paid in the world. Most countries just give their MPs a housing allowance to pay rent in the capital city and transport allowance to get to the capital city. MPs justify their claims saying that they face a lot of financial demands from their constituents. But do they share the mortgage or the car with the wananchi? No! There is a terrible cash squeeze in the economy because government is not paying its debts. The wananchi are suffering. The MPs should drop these outrageous claims which demonstrate a deep lack of respect for the people who voted them into office.
