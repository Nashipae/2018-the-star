Relegation-threatened Wazito chief executive officer, Luthers Mokua, believes the entry of a new sponsor will help turn around their fortunes in the Kenyan Premier League. The league debutants were bailed out of their financial struggles by Sumac Micro finance Bank, who came on board as their shirt sponsors for an undisclosed amount. Wazito sit second from bottom with 23 points from 26 matches and risk dropping back to the National Super League. But Mokua believes the availability of funds will motivate the players to fight for their top flight status. The dry coffers at the University of Nairobi-affiliated club have been blamed for the poor run of results as well as the departure of senior players in search of greener pastures. Towering forward Pistone Mutamba opened the exit gate as he decamped to Sofapaka while former AFC Leopards midfielder Harun Nyakha and Joe Waithira were shopped by Nakumatt. Before the season began, the club was dealt a major blow as dependable centre half, Dennis Gicheru and midfielder Zachary Gathu surprisingly crossed over to National Super League outfit KCB. Mokua revealed that his office will clear the unpaid salaries and allowances. “We are happy to have a sponsor. We have really struggled and the players have been hit most. It is my hope that we will remain in the league and hopefully do better next season,” said Mokua. “We should not be written off yet since we stand a chance of finishing in the top 10. The sponsor is aware that we have debts but our first priority is to clear the dues owed by the players.” As a way of mobilising funds after promotion, the club began the season by acquiring the services of a new patron, Sammy Itemere, who replaced Solomon Alubala but could not attract a sponsor inside six months. Consequently, the club has struggled in the 26 matches played so far, having won just six matches, drawn five and lost 15.
