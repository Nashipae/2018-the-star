Suspended Kirinyaga Transport executive Peter Karagumi has sued Governor Anne Waiguru (pictured) and the county government for wrongful dismissal. Karugami was suspended for one month over alleged incompetence. In the suit filed at the Employment and Labour Relations Court in Nyeri, Karugami accuses Waiguru of coercing him to sign a resignation letter in order to be suspended. He said his suspension was politically motivated, malicious and with a touch of impropriety and impunity. Karagumi signed the document on April 19, during a cabinet meeting. Waiguru suspended Karagumi on June 28. “I’m apprehensive the governor will arbitrarily and maliciously use the purported resignation letter to terminate my contract,” he said. Karagumi said the suspension was vague and does not raise any matter that would warrant summary actions without a hearing. He wants the court to declare the suspension null, void, unfair and irregular. The case will be mentioned on October 9
