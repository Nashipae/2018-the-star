DPP Noordin Haji has directed the anti-graft agency and Director of Criminal Investigation George Kinoti to start investigations on alleged loss of Sh36 million at the Judiciary. In a statement on Tuesday, Haji said he has held discussions with chief justice David Maraga and agreed that the investigations should get underway immediately. This follows claims by a whistleblower based on the July 2018 Internal Audit Report from Milimani Law Courts. The report covers financial periods from January 2016 to December 2017. The DPP asked the investigating agencies to be filling progress report of the probe after every 21 days till the process if over. In June, the DPP said corrupt judges are hampering an anti-graft drive in Kenya, undermining President Uhuru Kenyatta's attempt to restore public trust in the government, national security and the economy.
