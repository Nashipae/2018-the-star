Emurua Dikirr MP Johanna Ng’eno on Saturday bid farewell to bachelorhood after he married the love of his life Nayianoi Ntutu at a colourful ceremony that was attended by top leaders including DP William Ruto. The bride, a lawyer by profession, comes from the famous Ntutu political family. “I’m now happy because I know you will now be calm, things will be ok” Ruto said while congratulating the 44-year old MP. The wedding ceremony was held at the Emurua Dikirr Primary school in Narok County. The ceremony was a mix-up of Maasai and Kipsigis cultures, symbolic of Ngeno's political leadership as a Kipsigis MP representing a constituency in Maasai land. Ruto asked him to join hands with those who competed against him at the polls and work together for the good of the constituency. Click here for the latest political news
