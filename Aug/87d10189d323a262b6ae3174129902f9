Emurua Dikirr MP Johana Ng’eno has been asked to bury the hatchet with his opponents and work together for the sake of service delivery. Deputy President William Ruto, who joined hundreds of residents in Transmara on Saturday to witness Ng’eno’s wedding, said this is time to get down to work and deliver on pledges. “You know who escaped defeat narrowly but that is not an issue now. What is important is for you to sit down with your former competitors and work together to deliver to the people,” he said. Ng’eno ran on a Kanu ticket and defeated David Keter of Jubilee who was fronted by Ruto. Ruto and Ng’eno have had frosty relations until recently.
