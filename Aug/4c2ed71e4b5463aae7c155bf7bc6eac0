The High Court in Meru has declined to grant orders sought by seven residents because it does not have jurisdiction to hear employment and labour disputes. The seven petitioners filed a petition on July 31, seeking conservatory orders barring the County Public Service Board from conducting interviews for shortlisted candidates over alleged illegalities. Judge Ann Ong’injo on Friday ordered the petitioners to be escorted to the Employment and Labour Relations Court in Nairobi. “This petition obviously relates to employment and should be tried by the special court,” Justice Ong’injo ruled. The Meru CPSB on Wednesday prayed to the court to strike it out with costs arguing that the High Court has no jurisdiction to handle and determine the petition. The seven petitioners who have sued the Meru County Public Service Board are Wilfred Murithi, Douglas Mbae, Christopher Mwiti, Patrick Kirigia, Martin Mwenda, Francis Curukia and Adam Yassin. They want interviews slated for Monday stopped due to alleged illegalities in shortlisting process. The CPSB, through lawyer Kaburu Mwirigi, argued that to save time and agony of the over 8,000 shortlisted candidates, the seven petitioners are valid to be joined in the interviews. But petitioners’ lawyer Kiogora Mugambi said the matter is of public interest, not just the petitioners.
