City Hall is rehabilitating and constructing more fire stations in the subcounties to improve response time to fire outbreaks and other disasters. Disaster management and coordination chief officer Anne Mwenda said the county government is also training residents, especially those in the informal settlements, on basic fire fighting techniques. “We have seen the governor repossessing some grabbed county land and turning them to fire stations. The aim is to ensure we have as many fire stations as possible to increase response [to disaster],” she said. Early this month, Sonko repossessed public land that had been grabbed in Gigiri and ordered the plot be used as a fire station. City Hall is also building a fire station on Kangundo Road. There are also plans to build other stations in Kasarani and Dagoretti. Currently, the county has two fire stations – Tom Mboya in the CBD and Industrial area. Mwenda spoke when she distributed blankets and food to 920 residents of Deep Sea slums whose homes were burnt down last Saturday
