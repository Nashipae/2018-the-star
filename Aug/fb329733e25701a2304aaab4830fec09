The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission will on Monday start investigating claims of corruption at the Environment ministry.  The agency's CEO Halakhe Waqo on Friday said those found culpable will be prosecuted.  The move follows complains from the ministry asking the anti-graft agency to look into public procurement, bribery, fraudulent acquisition of property and conflict of interest among others.  “We need to conserve the environment," Waqo said.  He asked workers at the ministry not to call for the commission's disbandment when the investigative report is unveiled.  He said the probe will improve performance and efficiency.  He called on the employees to cooperate with EACC detectives once the probe starts. "It is my expectations that our team will be fully supported with requisite documents, access to working areas and staff will be on-hand for interviews as programmed," Waqo said. The CEO said Kenyans should support the agency because its work is to combat corruption. “People often panic when they see EACC because they fear taking responsibility. They should work and stop fearing,” he said.  Commission vice chairperson Sophia Lepuchirit said the probe will be conducted following an invitation by CS Keriako Tobiko.  She said Tobiko acknowledged the possibility of existence of inefficiencies and weaknesses in their systems, policies, procedures and practices.  "The negative impact of corruption has not only been detrimental to social and economic development but has also been linked to environmental degradation resulting to devastating ecological and human disasters," Lepuchirit said.
