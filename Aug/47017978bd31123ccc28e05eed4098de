A Kenya Police chopper crash-landed inside Boni Forest at around 12.30 pm on Wednesday. The incident took place at the forest's Galgal area during routine patrols. Mechanical problems forced the pilot to land. A senior police official who did not want to be named said the aircraft had been heading towards Holugho border. "The pilot had to force landing to avert danger. It wasn't shot down as is being claimed," he said. He added that the soldiers who were on board were all safe. He did not specify their number.
