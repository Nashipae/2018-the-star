Six Egyptians hawking household goods in Embu were rounded-up yesterday morning and arraigned on suspicion of preparing to commit a crime.  They had rented a house at Gakwegori village from where they sold assorted household items to residents.  In court, DCI officers sought consent to hold the suspects for two days to conclude investigations.  Police said the Egyptians were up to no good in Embu and were in the country without relevant documents. They were also accused of doing business without a permit.  Most of the Egyptians could not understand English.  They opposed the application through one of them who said they had all the relevant documents to enable them be in Kenya and do business.  The court declined the DCI application and ordered that the suspects be held at Embu police station for a night.  They will be taken to court today to present their documents.
