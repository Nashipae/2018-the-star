The ICT ministry plans to launch a pool for ideas and innovations from Kenyans to be used for better government service delivery. Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru said the platform known as “white box” will provide lawyers, academicians, innovators and other intellectuals a forum to share ideas that would be re-evaluated to provide solutions for different agencies. “Many Kenyans have no idea what the Big Four agenda is all about. It’s about expanding their business, providing opportunities for everyone and reducing dependency. The ICT is at the centre of all this,” Mucheru said at the Africa Annual Customer Experience Conference 2018 in Nairobi. Kenya ranks fourth in Africa and 78 globally in the latest report by Global Innovation Index. The report also points at its strengths in innovation linkages and exports of creative services, such as research and development and workforce efficiency. Mucheru said the ministry will soon launch a biometric registration solution for national identity cards. “The system, will have identification taken from every Kenyan at young age to enjoy healthcare services from any facility. Kenyans will not have to be 18 years to get an ID Card to be registered to the National Health Identification Fund,” Mucheru said. The NHIF had approximately 6.8million members as at 2016/2017 financial year, reaching a national coverage of about 25 million people, including contributors’ dependents. The biometric will also map farmers to link them to market information. He said, with a changing world and increased access to information citizens now understand the need for improved channels and products.
