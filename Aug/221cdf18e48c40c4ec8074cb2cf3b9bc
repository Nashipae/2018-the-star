Mombasa Jubilee chairman Matano Chengo has said it was wrong for President Uhuru Kenyatta to not acknowledge key women who have done extraordinary service to this country from the Coast region. "My party leader, who is also the President of the country, is being misled by people around him," Chengo said. He said the Jubilee administration is shooting itself on the foot by marginalizing the region further. "They honoured women who have done great things for the country but they did not award any woman from the Coast," Chengo told the Star on Saturday. President Uhuru on Thursday honoured women who have made a significant impact in the country's political, social and economic fronts.

Others were Phoebe Asiyo, Beth Mugo, Dr Julia Ojiambo, Justice Joyce Aluoch, Zipporah Kittony, Prof Wanjiku Kabira, Eddah Gachugia, among others. On Saturday, Chengo said the list should have included women from the Coast saying they have also contributed immensely in shaping the country. He said women like former Senator Emma Mbura, Naomi Cidi, Farida Rashid have fought to shape the country in many ways but have largely remained unrecognized. Posthumously Giriama heroine Mekatilili wa Menza should also be honoured for her role in freedom fighting, he said. "Despite the handshake in place, we see Coast being left out in many things and it makes our work as Jubilee leaders in the region difficult," said the chair. He noted that cabinet appointments from the region have been scarce. "We had only one CS, who was later stripped of his post and demoted to an ambassador," said Chengo.
