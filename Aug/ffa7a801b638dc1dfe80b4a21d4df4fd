Chaos erupted at Tononoka in Mombasa on Monday when inspectorate officers descended on kiosks selling miraa. At least 10 shops were demolished and three vendors arrested,Â officers saying the structures were illegal. "They are supposed to trade at Kongowea market, not here, " one said. Traders, however, cited foul play, claiming they pay the county Sh30 daily in rates. "Why are they flushing us out in this manner? Don't we deserve to earn a living?" Kaloki Musyoki said. At the market, a lorry of miraa is charged Sh7,000. Muguka, a type of miraa, is the most preferred among youth owing to its affordability. The county assembly is considering banning the sale of the commodity, claiming it reduces sex drive and makes men impotent. The assembly also cites insecurity. Last week, the Mombasa Health committee tabled a report detailing the harmful effects of muguka, including causing cancer and impotence. The motion is the brainchild of nominated MCA Fatma Kushe. In Kilifi, a lobby has asked the county assembly to ban the sale and chewing of muguka.
