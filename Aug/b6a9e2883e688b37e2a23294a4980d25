Three Rift Valley MPs have joined calls demanding the government releases Sh3.5 billion owed to farmers for maize delivered to the National Cereals and Produce Board. Maize farmers are also demanding an independent audit of the NCPB to establish its status, including the amount of maize the agency is holding in its depots. Moiben MP Sila Tiren who led the farmers at a meeting in Eldoret on Monday asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene. The farmers have not been paid for maize delivered in December. MPs Oscar Sudi (Kapseret) and William Chepkut (Ainabkoi) said the farmers have suffered for too long. The farmers asked Uhuru to ensure they are paid in two weeks time. They threatened to hold protests if they would not have been paid at the end of 14 days. The farmers have also forwarded a new petition to Parliament urging MPs to push for the payment. “The farmers are desperate and the measures they will take will not be pleasing. We urge President Kenyatta to intervene so that farmers are paid,” Tiren said. The MP said the delay in paying the farmers was threatening food security, one of Uhuru’s Big Four agenda. Kenya Farmers Association director Kipkorir Menjo said the government of frustrating farmers. The meeting was also attended by Kenya National Farmers Union chairman Musa Barno. Tiren called for hastened investigations into the troubles at NCPB. He asked EACC to question former NCPB boss Newton Terer who quit abruptly in February. “He should be asked to explain what problem caused him to resign,” Tiren said.
