A vocal senator implicated in the Ruaraka land bribery claims was yesterday seen checking out of the JKIA, a few days when he is due to appear before the powers and privileges committee probing the claims. The senator, who has denied soliciting for Sh100 million from businessman Francis Mburu, checked out to an Arabian country in Africa but his mission is not well clear. Could the lawmaker be planning to snub the committee’s sittings set for Thursday this week or the summons was just a coincidence? Our mole at the airport told Corridors of Power that the senator appeared in a hurry as be checked out. ******** A lawmaker, who owns a chain of carwash and carpet cleaning businesses within Nairobi city and its outskirts is a man under siege. The MP has put up most of his businesses along either road reserves or riparian land targeted by the government in the ongoing demolitions. Fearing for the worst, the legislator has allegedly been making frantic efforts to meet Nairobi governor Mike Sonko but to no avail. Governor Sonko’s admission to secretly taping private conversations, as part of his strategy to fighting graft, the MP fears calling the county boss to seek protection as he would be busted. It is rumoured that a member of the Nairobi regeneration committee has been making unprofessional contacts with the lawmaker with a few to linking hi up with the governor. Whether, the dirty tricks to bypass the law would work for the MP, is a matter that is closely monitored. ************ Last week, Corridors told you of a former MP who plotted and successfully hived off public land in Sunton Mwiki area and set up a secondary school as a cover up. In the last few days, a Nairobi lawmaker allied to the ruling Jubilee Party appears to be following in the footsteps of the ex-MP. The lawmaker has come up with a number of projects with most of them touching on Public land. In the recent audacious act, the lawmaker has fenced off some public land in Mwiki meant for public utilities. Surprisingly, a pastor allied to the MP has erected a church in what could be one of the most daring land grabbing moves in the capital city in recent days. Where the National Land Commission and the county government are when a lawmaker decides at will to hive off public land in favour of a private enterprise is perplexing. ************ A county commissioner from Rift Valley must wake up and address himself to the plight facing residents. The county boss, known for dishing out contracts to his friends and a section of family members, is now under siege after a lobby group vowed to move to court to challenge a result award of a contract to his acquaintance. It must be noted that the county boss was pushed out of his most recent posting after residents staged vigorous demonstrations demanding his exit. Unfortunately, during public barazas where he encourage locals to apply for tenders, the commissioner often brags how he is learned and how he can’t miss a job even if he is hounded out of office. Are this traits of a civil servant determined in serving people or a savage? Click here for the latest political news
