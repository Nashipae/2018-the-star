Kisii is facing an acute shortage of fish. Agriculture executive Ezman Onsarigo yesterday said last year farmers produced 17,000kg against the 300,000kg annual demand. The county has had to import fish from neighbouring countries. Onsarigo said demand for white meat is high. The county has set aside Sh3 million to start a fingerling multiplication centre in Bomwanda, Bonchari constituency. He urged farmers to take up fish farming because there is a ready market not only in Kisii, but outside the county. On the stalled modern fish market in Kisii town, Onsarigo said the contractor has been slow. Operational Onsarigo said the county is searching for a new contractor to complete the Sh 15 million projects to enable fish traders store their fish. “We have already spent Sh10 million in the project. In order to make it fully operational, the county government has allocated another Sh5 million to put up cooling rooms,” he said. “I urge our people to embrace fish farming for the sake of food and economic sustainability. The demand for fish has outstriped supply.” Onsarigo said the venture requires a small area and polythene paper for to start farming. “It does not require acres of land to engage in fish farming. Farmers can use piped water to fill temporal ponds which can rear up 2,000 fish,” he said. Technical management The county government, Onsarigo said, will support farmers engaging in the venture to increase the yield. He said commercial fish farming has several challenges including financial and technical management.
