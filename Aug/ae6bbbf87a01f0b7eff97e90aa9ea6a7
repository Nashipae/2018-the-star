Gor Mahia inched closer to a record extending 17th SportPesa Premier League title after they saw off Kakamega Homeboyz 3-1 yesterday at Moi Stadium, Kisumu. Innocent Wafula and Burundian forward Francis Mustapha put Gor in the driving seat with goals in the 30th and 34th minute as the champions went into the break with a healthy lead. Homeboyz, however, ensured the game had a nervy ending as they halved the deficit with a free kick from Baron Oketch that proved too much for Shaban Odhonji 20 minutes from time. Substitute Kevin Omondi, however, made sure the runaway league leaders took all three points with a tidy finish on the stroke of full-time. K’Ogalo now have 62 points from 25 matches—14 more than second placed Bandari. Dylan Kerr’s men now need only three more wins from their remaining nine matches to retain their trophy. The victory was not the only bright spot for K’Ogalo as their Burundian right back Karim Nizigiyimana came through unscathed in his first start for the club in almost a year after recovering from an Achilles injury. Though his side have a mountain to climb in the onerous task of trying to leapfrog Gor, Bandari coach Bernard Mwalala maintained they will not slacken in their pursuit of the champions. Speaking after he masterminded the dockers’ fourth win on the bounce in besting Tusker 1-0— a week after ending league leaders unbeaten run, Mwalala revealed that a top two finish is their target. “We will take every game as it comes and fight until the end. We know winning the league will be tough as the gap between us and Gor is big but until they win, it we will try our best to catch up with them,” Mwalala said. Bandari have 48 points, three more than AFC Leopards, who are also hitting form at the right time. Sofapaka who fell to a surprise loss to Vihiga United are down to fourth with 43 points.
