Police in Eldoret have arrested four more suspects linked to cybercrime and SIM swap fraud. Officers from the DCI in Nairobi backed by other teams raided two houses at Elgon View and Pioneer where they recovered 20,000 SIM cards, 300 mobile phones and two laptops. Uasin Gishu County Commander Augustine Thumbi said the suspects include two men and two women. The suspects have been living in the rented houses where they kept German Shepherd dogs for security. 'We had to use our German Shepherd dogs to access the houses where the suspects were hiding," Thumbi said. He said the suspects were linked to another group in Nairobi and other parts of the country. Thumbi said the suspects had been using data from mobile phone companies, the electoral agency and the department registration of persons to get details which they use to commit crimes. They will be investigated for robberies in banks, M-Pesa shops and other institutions countrywide. The SIM cards recovered were for local mobile phone companies. Thumbi said the suspects, who will be taken to Nairobi, have been engaging in the illegal registration of university students.
