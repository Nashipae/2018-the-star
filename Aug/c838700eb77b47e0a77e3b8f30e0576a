Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi has criticised the ongoing war on corruption, claiming it is targeting Deputy President William Ruto and his allies in connection with the 2022 elections. He said Ruto was being branded a corrupt leader because of his interest in 2022, yet "he has been supporting other politicians in the past". Sudi spoke in Eldoret on Monday. "Ruto has suddenly become very corrupt because itâ€™s his turn, yet when he has been supporting other leaders in the past, he was a very clean and good person," he said. Sudi criticised those demanding that Weston Hotel, linked to the DP, should be demolished for allegedly being on public land. "They should know that we will also table evidence and lists of senior people living on prime public land," Sudi said.
