Police in Kibwezi Makueni on Thursday arrested three boys suspected to have been sleeping with a secondary school student who had gone missing from home since Monday. According to Kibwezi OCPD Ben Changulo, one of the suspects was found with the girl in a lodging at Kinyambu Market following a tip-off from members of the public. When the 17-year-old girl was pressed, she named the other two who slept with her in the same lodge. The four recorded statements at Kibwezi Police Station before they were taken to the sub-county hospital for medical tests. "The one found with the girl is a form three student at Prof. Kaloki Secondary School and the girl is a form two student in the same school," said Changulo during an interview. Kibwezi sub-county director of Education Kennedy Machora said attributed the incident to negligence by parents. "It pains when we see a student, whose fee has been paid by the government engaging in such embarrassing acts," said Machora. Police in the Mtito Andei are also holding a 43-year old man for impregnating a 12-year old girl. He will be arraigned in court on Friday. Click here for the latest political news
