The 23-year-old man who bragged of sexual encounters with minors on Facebook was Tuesday charged with child sex tourism. William Hanga was charged with "publishing information that is intended to promote or facilitate conduct that would constitute a sexual offence against a child". The Wells Fargo employee denied the charges before Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi. Hanga allegedly published his picture in a compromising position with a minor, whom he claimed was a form two female student. The other picture was of a minor estimated to be between five and six years of age. The photos are captioned with stomach-churning details of how he lured his victims into his trap and what he did to them. The suspect posted the pictures under username Sam Dali and posted them on Kilimani Mums and Dads Censured Kenya. He boasted he was unreachable by police in his facebook posts. Hanga was arrested by the DCI's Serious Crime Unit in Mpeketoni, Lamu County on August 23. He was freed on a surety bond of Sh300, 000 with a surety of similar amount. The magistrate warned Hanga that the charges he is facing are serious as they attracted a penalty of minimum 10 years imprisonment. He directed him to formally write to the court indicating the inability to hire a lawyer so that the court can issue orders for the state to provide him with one.
