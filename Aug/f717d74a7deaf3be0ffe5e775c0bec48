DCI George Kinoti has warned the public about criminals using the IEBC register, which is available online, to register SIM cards which are then used to commit crimes. Kinoti spoke on Friday during a mobile money fraud risk engagement forum by Safaricom and the banking industry. He asked the public to avail information that would help identify the criminals across the country. "The fight against cyber crime is facing a number of challenges because criminals have come up with sophisticated avenues to defraud innocent Kenyans," he said. He noted, however, that the fight against SIM swap fraud was on course. Several suspects have been arrested over the SIM card crimes. The latest case was of two men and two women from Eldoret. Officers from the DCI in Nairobi, backed by other teams, raided two houses at Elgon View and Pioneer where they recovered 20,000 SIM cards, 300 mobile phones and two laptops. Safaricom has advised its subscribers to protect their personal data and avoid sharing PIN numbers and passwords.
