At least 360 families in Elgeyo Marakwet are targeted as the Kenya Population-Based HIV Impact AssessmentÂ survey begins in the county. County Kenya National Bureau of Statistics officer Luka Kangogo said research assistants will cover 12 clusters in Elgeyo Marakwet. "We expect to test members of all households in the 12 selected clusters in a period of between five to six months," Kangogo said. Elgeyo Marakwet was reported to have an HIV prevalence rate of 2.1 per cent in a previous survey done in 2012. Sexually transmitted diseases including Hepatitis B and syphilis will also be tested.

"We are having discussions with health officials to ensure many people are tested. This is important because the report will help us plan," Tolgos said. Tolgos said HIV prevalence in the county could be higher than what was reported in 2012. He said people fear being tested owing to stigmatisation. The survey that targets 20,000 selected households countrywide was officially launched in Nairobi on June 5. During the launch, Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki said the survey will provide data on counties' HIV status, unlike the 2012 survey which was region-based. The ministry will spend between Sh1.5 billion to Sh2 billion for the drive. A report on the data is expected in three months. Click here for the latest political news
