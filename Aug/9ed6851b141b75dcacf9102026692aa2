Freedom fighters could soon heave a sigh of relief following plans by the Dedan Kimathi Foundation to allocate them land. More than 8,000 freedom fighters will benefit from the land settlement programme at Rimuruti in Laikipia county. The programme is being spearheaded by Mau Mau ware veteran Dedan Kimathi’s last born daughter Wanjugu Kimathi. Wanjugu said she has identified a 40,000 acres piece of land on which the freedom fighters will be settled. The land is costing Sh2.1 billion and the foundation will implement the settlement in phases to give it time to raise the entire amount. The first phase of the programme will see about 3,000 war veterans settled on12,000 acres of the land in a few months time. The beneficiaries are required to register with Sh 5000 which will go towards purchasing the land, she said. “The foundation is holding talks with the government and other well-wishers to help clear the balance,” Wanjugu added. Speaking while meeting Mau Mau veterans at Mumbi grounds in Murang’a town on Saturday, Wanjugu noted that about 430 of the beneficiaries who suffered in the hands of the colonialists and sustained serious physical injuries will not be required to contribute. Wanjugu noted that she was prompted to start the project after years of taking care of her elderly mother. She pointed out that even though numerous attempts have been made to help the Mau Mau veterans, only a few of them have benefitted. “Most of these people are destitute and do not have a place that they can call home,” she said. According to her, the foundation has put in place stringent accountability measures to ensure money collected from registration is not lost. “Registrations fees can only be paid direct into our accounts through a bank. We are also working with a team of auditors to help keep our accounts in check,” she said. Read:Kimemia to employ Dedan Kimathi’s widow as adviser Click here for the latest political news
