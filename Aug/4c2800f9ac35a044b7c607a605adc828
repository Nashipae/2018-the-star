The government is going to extend the mid-term break to primary schools beginning next term, Education CSAmina Mohamed has announced. During the opening the 14th Kenya Primary School Heads Association Annual Conference yesterday at Sheikh Zayed Hall in Mombasa, Mohammed said children must be given time to rest. She said as a government policy, secondary school children have been enjoying a five-day mid-term break every term. However, primary school teachers have been teaching continuously without a break. “When we announced the five-day half-term for secondary school, you association officials came to us and we shall now extend this to primary schools,” Mohamed said. She said teachers also need the half-term period to refresh. Mohamed warned tutors against teaching during school holidays. She said those found teaching after schools have closed will face the music. “You will face the full wrath of this Ministry and Kenyans at large because this is something that we have all agreed - that tuition has been banned during holidays,” Mohamed said. Primary school heads welcomed the new policy on mid-term. Enock Wamalwa from Webuye West said, “For a very long time, our counterparts in secondary schools and boarding primary schools have been enjoying half-term. We are now also going to enjoy the same privilege.” Hilda Wamalwa said it was long overdue. “We are happy the CS has now considered us in public primary schools,” she said. Christine Abura from Kakamega county said she was impressed by the announcement.
