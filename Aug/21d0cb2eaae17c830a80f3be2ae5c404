A women’s group has started a project to equip all level 4 hospitals with screening machines to detect cancer early.Under the Adopt A Hospital initiative, Veronica Kihang’o said all citizens should participate as “everyone is a victim of cancer in one way or another.” She said the cost of traveling to seek medication has impoverished many. “Others have sold property to foot the bills,” Kihang’o said. The hospitals will be equipped with the machines depending on need basis.She spoke in Gilgil town on Saturday at the launch of the walk. The main objective is to bring screening machines closer to the public.“Some facilities only have X-ray machines while others don’t have anything. We are sure very few of them have critical equipment like MRI and CT scans,” Kihang’o said.She has lost four family members to cancer. Kihang’o added that early screening is fruitless if hospitals are not properly equipped.“We cannot sit and wait for the government to do everything for us. We urge corporates to come on board and help purchase these equipment,” Kihang’o said.Initiative member Catherine Njeri said the five-day walk will end at Nyayo Stadium in Nairobi.“Most of our hospitals do not have the machines while those that have them are old or have broken down,” Njeri said.
