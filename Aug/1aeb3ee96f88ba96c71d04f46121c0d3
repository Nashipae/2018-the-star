Murang’a Catholic Bishop James Wainaina has called on stakeholders in the education sector to embrace dialogue to avert a strike by the Kenya Union of Teachers. The bishop has said the strike, planned to kick off on September 1, will disrupt learning just days to the national examinations. Wainaina urged both the government and the teachers’ union to soften their stances for an amicable solution. Teachers are protesting mass transfers and performance appraisals.

Last week, Kuppet resolved to negotiate with the Teachers Service Commission to avoid disruption of school activities during the last term of the year, saying the issues can be solved without industrial action. Kenya Primary School Headteachers Association has also opposed the strike and called for dialogue with TSC. Wainaina, who spoke at Mumbi Catholic church yesterday, said Catholic bishops have discussed at length the call for strike and appealed to the teachers to drop it. “The strike will affect KCPE and KCSE preparations and affect the performance of students. It would be immoral for teachers to go ahead with the strike and ignore dialogue,” the bishop said. More: Principals differ with Sossion on strike plan, root for dialogue with TSC Click here for
