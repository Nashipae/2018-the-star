Safaricom has opposed an application seeking to set aside orders barring the government from spying on phone communication. The High Court had ruled that the plan would be against the Constitution, but the the Communications Authority of Kenya appealed. In a sworn document, Safaricom, through senior manager Daniel Ndaba, says none of the orders being sought by the CA can be enforced. “Granting the order would be equal to granting the appeal. CA will proceed to instal the Device Management System, yet the appeal will be pending hearing and determination,” the affidavit says. The CA seeks to use the DMS to counter fake phones and communication devices by ensuring only genuine ones access services from licensed mobile phone services operators. This comes in the wake of proliferation of counterfeit devices, theft of phones and illegal diversion and termination of calls. The CA claims it risks losing more than Sh40 million if the appellate court fails to suspend a decision by the High Court that halted the government’s espionage plan. CA lawyer Wambua Kilonzo wants a decision by High Court judge John Mativo suspended. It barred the CA from installing the controversial communication monitoring DMS. He says if the agreement it had with Broadband Communications is not upheld, it would lose more than Sh40.3 million or be liable to pay up  to Sh209 million — the contract price for installing the DMS. Appeal court judges Mohamed Warsame, Patrick Kiage and Agnes Murgor said they will hear the main appeal on a priority basis.
