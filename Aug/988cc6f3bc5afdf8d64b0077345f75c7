Residents of Gilgil yesterday accused the Nakuru government of being biased in opening up health centres in the constituency. They said the region has been neglected, forcing them to travel long distances in search of medical services. This emerged during a free medical camp organised by MP Martha Wangari and Lions SightFirst Eye Hospital. The MP said health is critical for a country to develop, adding that she will partner with the county government to open up more health centres in rural areas. The MP said she is working with NHIF to ensure all those above 60 years are covered. “This is part of the President’s Big Four agenda. We  will work with stakeholders to ensure universal health cover for all is achieved.” Mercy Kemunto from the hospital said the high number of residents suffering from eye complications is alarming. She termed cataract as the main disease they most people suffer from. Kemunto attributed the rise to lack of proper medical attention. Langa Langa area has no proper health facility, with residents having to walk for long distances to access services.
