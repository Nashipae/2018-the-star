The Teachers Service Commission is not a rogue institution, commissioner Saadia Abdi has said. She was responding to Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion, who on Tuesday said the TSC’s policies harrass teachers. “The independence of TSC is not the independence of an individual. Since 2015, we have seen more than 82 circulars that are very difficult to implement,” he said. Abdi on Wednesday said, “TSC operates on an open-door policy ... we have done everything possible to ensure our employees are happy.” She is representing TSC chairperson Lydia Nzomo at the 14th Kenya Primary School Heads Association conference in Mombasa. Abdi added that the policies Sossion is complaining about are in line with education development. “Policies are made to regulate, improve and set standards for the future,” Abdi said. She said the TSC seeks feedback from employees and encourages dialogue. “We negotiate as much as possible and serve in the best interest of the child,” Abdi said. Read: Support teachers instead of politicising transfers, TSC boss tells MPs The TSC and Knut are expected to meet on August 21 over mass transfer of school heads in the delocalisation programme, teacher performance appraisals and promotions. The Knut secretary general warned that if the talks fail, teachers will strike from September 1. Both primary and secondary heads are against the strike call. Sossion on Tuesday warned Kepsha chairman Shem Ndolo and Kenya Secondary School Association chairman Indimuli Kahi against meddling in the labour affairs. He said the circulars issued by the TSC must be recalled. Circular Seven issued in May abolished schemes of work. “The issue of abolishment of the scheme of service is going to withdraw Sh5 billion teachers’ benefits every year. That is a big blow,” Sossion said. Click here for the latest political news
