Nairobi Central police boss Alphonse Ngundo is among 500 cops in the ranks of the inspector and chief inspector who have been transferred. Ngundo (pictured) has served as OCS at the station for four years. He has been moved to Ongata Rongai police headquarters as staff officer in charge of personnel. He was handed the transfer letter last Thursday. Ngundoâ€™s previous station has been taken over by chief inspector Simon Kerich. He had been in charge of crime at Kamukunji police station. The transfers are mainly of heads of police stations, their deputies and those in charge of crime. Ngundo yesterday praised the move by his bosses. He said the changes are normal and aimed at boosting operations and improving services in all the counties. He thanked his former colleagues for maintaining discipline and supporting each other. He said he managed to reduce robbery, mugging and burglaries in the CBD. Ngundo also commended members of the public for cooperating with the police in proving information on crimes and suspects. He said he is committed to improving security in his new area.
