Kaloleni ward has set up a team to steer development and decision-making at the grassroots. It comprises its MCA (president), Kilifi senator, eight secretaries in charge of various dockets, chief officers and committee members. On Thursday, MCA Yasin Mohamed said he came up with the idea after realising residents did not reap the fruits of devolution because decisions were being made by a few committee members who ignored their views. He said they have created a people-driven cabinet that will focus on the four pillars of development in line with Vision 2030. Thee dockets created are Education and ICT, Finance, Agriculture, Water and irrigation, Health and Sanitation, Sports Gender, Youth and Culture, Roads Transport and Public Works, Land, Energy, Environment and Mining, and Trade, Tourism and Cooperative Development. “This day marks an important milestone to the wananchi. In the entire ward, we have 28 villages. They have been included in our system. We have 28 development committees of eight members each. They have an overseer [Senator],” he said. Committee members were elected by more than 250 delegates selected from villages. Kilifi deputy governor Gideon Saburi attended the launch. He thanked the MCA for the initiative and promised him county support. Saburi urged other counties to adopt the idea.
