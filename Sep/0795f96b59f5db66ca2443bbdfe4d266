Public Service Vehicles in Kwale county will increase fares in two days following the introduction of a 16 per cent tax on petroleum products. Kwale Matatu Association chairman Joseph Wambua yesterday said there will be a Sh30 increase in the original price. “The fares will increase depending on distance covered,” he said. Kwale to Likoni ferry fare will increase to Sh130 from Sh100. For Lunga Lunga and Mwangulu areas, the increase will range between Sh50 and Sh70. “We won’t be getting anything tangible if we add Sh20 only,” Wambua said. The original bus fare from Likoni ferry to Lunga Lunga and Mwangulu was Sh300 and Sh350, respectively. Wambua said they will publish notices to the Kwale county government and various bus stops to notify customers on the new fares. He warned matatu operators against taking advantage of the hike and con customers. “If our employees take advantage they will be punished.” The 16 per cent VAT plan has seen the sale of petrol in Kwale increase to Sh120 from the original Sh90. Commuters plying the Kwale-Likoni route have expressed concerns on the fare hike. “Now that fare from Kwale to Likoni ranges from Sh120 to Sh150 we will be forced to rent out where we work,” said Ali Mwalimu, whose family is in Likoni but works in Kwale. Wambua said he is disappointed by the move to tax petroleum products as his family and friends use public means of transport. MPs will today hold a Kamukunji to discuss the way forward over the fuel tax which they claimed is hurting ordinary Kenyans. Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter said 150 MPs from across the political divide have confirmed attending the informal sitting. Accompanied by Tindi Muale (Butere), Caleb Amisi (Saboti) and Godfrey Osotsi (nominated), the legislators said they will do everything to ensure the government’s decision to tax fuel products is rescinded.
