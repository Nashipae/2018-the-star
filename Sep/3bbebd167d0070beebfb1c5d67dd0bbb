National assembly majority leader Aden Duale has hit out at Amani National Congress party leader Musalia Mudavadi accusing him of overseeing the finance ministry during the Golden-berg. Mudavadi was quoted in the media linking the 16 per cent Value Added Tax (VAT) on petroleum products to "rampant corruption in the energy industry". Mudavadi said after taking into consideration the cost of fuel, pipeline and storage, a litre of petrol should go for shs 72.61. “We have time and again cautioned against uncontrolled borrowing. Chickens have come home to roost and the government does not know where to turn or what to do," Mudavadi said. speaking at a function in Garissa town on Friday, Duae said that the ANC party leader has no moral authority to lecture the Jubilee government on how to run state affairs. “It is when Mudavadi was the minister of the helm of the finance minister that the Goldenberg scandal took place. This is the biggest scandal in the ministry’s history to be recorded,” Duale said. “It is also during his term as minister for local government ministry that the Langata cemetery scam happened. Mudavadi should be the last person to lecture us (Jubilee) on how to run the state affairs,” he added. Duale who is the Garissa Township MP said that it was unfortunate to see leaders with questionable character trying to lecture Jubilee on how to run the government. He described Mudavadi as a tribal party leader whose party has no national outlook as compared to Jubilee which has over 175 MPs compared to his 5 legislators all from one community.
