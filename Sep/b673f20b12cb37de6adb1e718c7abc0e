The Kenya-based Horn of Africa Development Initiative (HODI) has won Fifa's Diversity Award for 2018. HODI was given the award on Sunday in London "for their work empowering adolescent girls through football." Fifa's Diversity Award "recognises an outstanding organisation striving for diversity and anti-discrimination." "This award is an important recognition and puts the wind behind our sails," said HODI's Noor Abdulkadir. "It
means the work we are doing is important and it gives a lot of
confidence to young women in northern Kenya that we are on the right
track. "And that FIFA and the whole football community is behind us," Fifa also praised HODI for using "the power of football to combat social barriers while fostering safety." The initiative works closely with schools and supports adolescent girls in breaking the silence on issues that affect them. It also shares information on life skills and creating a safe space for them to learn and play football. The
organisation's flagship programme Shoot to Score helps to prevent young
children from being forced into ethnic rivalry and conflict, providing
safe spaces for learning a culture of non-violence through football. Burundi's
