The office of the DPP has blamed the labour ministry for increased cases of child trafficking and exploitation. Everlyne Achieng, a Prosecution Counsel from the DPP office said the ministry does not have an accurate data on the cases that require prosecution. "Lack of this data from the ministry of labour has posed a hindrance for the prosecution of child trafficking-related cases," she said. Achieng also said the DPP's office lacks funds in the execution of their work. "Some of the children affected are traumatized, we must seek a counsel to help them and this requires money,'' she said. She was speaking during the launch of child trafficking project on the elimination of child labour and violence against children in Kenya.Â The event is organized by the coalition in violence against women.
