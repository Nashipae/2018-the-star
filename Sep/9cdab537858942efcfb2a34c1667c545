Maldives opposition leader Ibrahim
Mohamed Solih has won the island nation's presidential election,
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Twitter on Monday. The ministry cited provisional figures from the country's
Elections Commission showing Solih winning by a margin of 16.7
percent over incumbent Abdulla Yameen in Sunday's election. "Voting proceeded smoothly and peacefully, with no reported
incidents," the foreign ministry said. "No major issues were reported in the vote counting process
as well as with the voters list, which will affect the results." Yameen has faced criticism for jailing opponents in
Maldives, popular with tourists and a key state in the battle
for influence between India and China in south Asia. Voter turnout was 89.2 percent, the Elections Commission
said, adding the official results would be released by Sept. 30. Solih, known popularly as Ibu, claimed victory and called on
Yameen to concede. "The message is loud and clear. The people of Maldives want
change, peace and justice," Solih told reporters in the capital
Male. "I would like to call on President Yameen to accept the will
of the people and begin a smooth transition of power as per the
constitution," he said. Ibrahim Shihab, a spokesman for the President's Office,
declined to comment on the election result when contacted by
Reuters. Mohamed Shainee, the minister of fisheries in Yameen's
government, said on Twitter it was "the beginning of a new
chapter" for the country. "Forgive our wrongdoings, give strength to our leaders to
resist the temptation to disbelieve," he said. The Hindu, an Indian newspaper, quoted Maldives' ambassador
to India as saying Ibu would assume power on November 17 after
Yameen's five-year term ended. Also read: Opposition leader Solih tells supporters he won Maldives election Click here for the latest political news
