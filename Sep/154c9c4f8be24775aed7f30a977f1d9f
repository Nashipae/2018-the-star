Heavy traffic built up on Thika Superhighway on Tuesday on both sides of the stretch between Githurai and Kasarani. Protesting residents barricaded the road using bonfires amid reports they were unhappy about an open dam in the area. "Githurai residents blocking Thika road on both sides demanding the retrieval of a vehicle that drove into the dam there. Word has it that there are passengers still inside. Major traffic snarl up caused," twitter user SG254 tweeted. Ma3route, a web platform that helps citizens to share and access information about traffic situation in the city, advised motorists to use alternative routes. "Thika super highway totally blocked by rowdy youths. Use bypass to town," it said in a tweet. "Avoid Githurai-Kasarani route. Githurai residents demonstrating," Ma3route added.
