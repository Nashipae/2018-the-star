After guiding St. Anthony Boys’ High school hockey titles both at the national and East Africa level, coach Kevin Lugalia believes they can only get better. Lugalia guided the Kitale-based outfit to a double feat, bagging the national Term One games title and went ahead to reclaim East Africa accolades in Musanze, Rwanda last month. “My talent as a hockey player and coach grew bigger when I arrived at St Anthony’s Kitale. I continue to juggle between teach and coaching hence so far so good. I have managed to do this effectively over the years and the results are there for everyone to see and I believe we can only get better,” said the former Maridadi Secondary School coach, who teaches English at St. Anthony’s Lugalia, who draws his inspiration from his mentor and Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) vice president, Michael Malungu said his dream is to see the players who pass through his hands prosper. “Most of the boys who have passed through my hands have received scholarships to prestigious local universities among them United States International University Africa and Strathmore not only for the purpose of athletics to learn but to build on their talent.” Lugalia also handled national under 18 boys team that represented Kenya at the Youth Olympic qualifiers held in Algeria last July, where the team finished third behind Zambia and the overall winners South Africa. At the same time, the tactician guided the Under-18 boys national hockey team to bronze at the 2014 Olympic qualifiers held in Lusaka, Zambia. Lugalia was also part of the technical bench for the Under-18 girls’ national team that represented Kenya at the Youth Olympic qualifiers held in South Africa in 2010.
