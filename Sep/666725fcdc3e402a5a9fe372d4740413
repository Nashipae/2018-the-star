Ziwani MCA Millicent Wambui said she is due “any time now”. Her friends rallied together and threw her a surprise baby shower over the weekend. “The sex of the baby is a surprise,” she told Word Is. “Being pregnant, everybody gives you advice left, right and centre, like don’t eat junk. But my craving was KFC chips and chicken, that was my weakness. And it did not help that It was right next to my workplace. It was the biggest temptation.” She continued, “The best advice was that I should sleep as much as I can. I have been working so much to a point where my doctor had to have me on a very short leash to ensure I have enough rest. Another thing is, my workmates have been so understanding with my mood swings, Jesus! I even get surprised how quick I flip over a small issue.” Millicent retold a funny anecdote about her pregnancy. “The first time I felt my baby kick, I started crying because I didn’t know what was happening with me. I rushed to hospital for checkup. The doctor started laughing and informed me that it’s the baby kicks!” As for what projects the MCA is pursuing, she cited a community project that involves “building a FIFA standard stadium in the constituency”. “We are about to do the ground breaking in a week’s time. As for now the contractor is winding up with the Dandora Stadium,” she said.
