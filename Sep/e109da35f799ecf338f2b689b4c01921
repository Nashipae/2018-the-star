The clash pitting Gor Mahia and Zoo Kericho set for today at Kericho Green Stadium has been postponed to October 16. The change of date has been necessitated by the unavailability of six Gor Mahia players who are part of the 36-man Harambee Stars provisional squad set to play Ghana on Saturday at Moi Stadium, Kasarani in a 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. K’Ogalo were set to honour the catch up match today but their six senior players joined the rest of the local-based players at the residential camp at the Kenya School of Monetary Studies to leave them depleted. The six include goalkeeper Boniface Oluoch, dependable defenders Joash Onyango and Philemon Otieno, midfielders Francis Kahata, Samuel Onyango and George ‘BlackBerry’ Odhiambo. The club’s team manager Jolawi Obondo welcomed the move noting it will relieve the players off the fatigue suffered from last month’s domestic and continental assignments. He said: “We baldly needed a break to rest after the tedious August roster. At least the players can rest for sometime before embarking on serious preparation for the remaining six league matches. We wish our players in the national team and the entire team the best of luck.” Obondo said the club intends to winning the remaining league matches and begin preparations for the Caf Champions League set to kick off in December. K’ogalo will return to the lucrative continental tournament by virtue of being the local league champions while the winner of the SportPesa Shield Cup will earn a ticket to the Caf Confederation Cup. “We want to win the remaining matches and finish the season well. We also want early preparations for the Champions League,” said Obondo.
