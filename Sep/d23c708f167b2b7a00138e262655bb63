Nasa leader Raila Odinga has said Kenya is not relenting on the war against corruption. Addressing residents at Siaya governor Cornell Rasanga’s home on Saturday, he asked those mentioned in graft not to panic if they are not corrupt. Raila said the war on corruption will be very painful, but the government must fight it to save citizens. He said the graft punch will move closer to “everyone’s relatives and even friends” but the government will ensure there is no victimisation. Raila insisted that it will not matter how close one is to those in power if found capable of corrupt dealings, because they will have to face the law. The Nasa leader reminded residents that top on the Building Bridges initiative’s agenda is the war on corruption. "As leaders, we will not interfere with the war on corruption but to only ensure there is no victimisation by doing it in a free and fair manner," he said. The former Prime Minister urged the authorities charged with fighting corruption to gather watertight evidence. "It will be easy for DPP, DCI and EACC if they have enough evidence against corruption suspects before starting prosecution. This way, those affected will not feel victimised," Raila added. He urged the Judiciary to be free and fair, and rely on evidence for conviction. The Nasa leader said together with President Uhuru Kenyatta, they will capitalise on the handshake to make Kenya a better place. Raila said in the last one week, many things have been said about the war against corruption but they will ensure fairness. He said the dream of a better country, just like he had promised to deliver residents to Canaan, will only be realised if corruption is conquered. "I know I told my people that we must reach Canaan, but on our way, we found a river that we are constructing a bridge and we must realise our Canaan dream," Raila said.
