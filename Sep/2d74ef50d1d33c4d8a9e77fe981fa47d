Vikings quest to register their maiden win in the 2018 Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) women’s Premier League suffered another blow as they were stung 7-0 by Strathmore University Scorpions yesterday at City Park. Frustrations at the Clyde Mmbaha-coached Vikings camp scaled once again as the loss saw them stretch their win-less run to nine matches and inched them closer to relegation to the less prestigious women’s Super League. The largely youthful Vikings squad struggled to match the prowess of the second-placed Scorpions who enjoyed possession throughout the game and made several invasions into their area in what seemed like a training session. Kenyan international Gilly Okumu led the onslaught, netting five times to aid her side steer their gatherings to 21 points besides cutting the gap between them and leaders Telkom to six points. Okumu broke the deadlock barely two minutes into the game, weaving past defenders to sound the board through a field goal. Three minutes later, Diana Awino doubled the scores from a short corner before Okumu completed her brace and her side’s third in the 24th minute. The latter extended her rich goal scoring form with a second half hat-trick in the 34th and 40th and 59th minute. Denise Bila was also on target in the 54th minute. Scorpions head coach Meshack Senge said the win had revived their hopes to catch up with Telkom. “I told the girls to express themselves and they superbly did it. I highlighted areas to improve prior to the game and I am pleased they played according to my instructions. We are still in the race to win the league since we have lost once and it means if we beat Telkom and win our matches in hand, we will be at par.” Mmbaha on his side, conceded defeat. “We were no match to them and I can say the result was expected. I am in the process of re-building a new squad after losing all my players last season and I am sure we will be better in the forthcoming season.” Click here for the latest political news
