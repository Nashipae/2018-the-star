From my end I think I will leave it at that,” Siso told the Star. “I don’t think when such a thing happens it is not out of the normal. The President can wish to consult anybody and Kalonzo has been Vice President for a long time, he is a senior citizen and if President deem fit to have him in his delegation why not?” Chinese President Xi Jinping esterday offered another $60 billion in financing for Africa and wrote off some debt for poorer African nations, while warning against funds going toward “vanity projects”. Speaking at the opening of a major summit with African leaders, Xi promised development that people on the continent could see and touch, but that would also be green and sustainable. China has denied engaging in “debt trap” diplomacy, and Xi’s offer of more money comes after a pledge of another $60 billion at the previous summit in South Africa three years ago.
