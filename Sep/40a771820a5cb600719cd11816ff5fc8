The construction of Avic Tower along Waiyaki Way in Nairobi was stopped for contravening urban planning regulations. According to Nairobi County Urban Planning Department, the building had contravened construction regulations and security guidelines. Urban Planning Chief Officer Justus Kathenge said this on Tuesday during a consultative meeting with Avic International representatives at City Hall. Speaking during the meeting, Kathenge said security agencies have raised issues with the construction of the 30 storey tower which is still under construction. “Avic International should adhere to all the rules and regulations before the suspension of the construction is lifted. But location and height of the building is also an issue,” said Kathenge while addressing representatives from Avic International. The meeting was attended by Avic International officials led by Lin Zhao Avic and David Zheng, the company’s architects Julius Kibwege and Jonah Ngatia among others. Last month, Governor Sonko suspended the construction of Avic Tower for contravening building regulations. During the suspension, 15 workers on site were arrested including 10 Chinese nationals. The workers were charged with erecting the building without approved plans, contrary to Section 30(2) of the Physical Planning Act. According to the Nairobi regeneration team, more than 5,000 structures and approximately 4,000 buildings and facilities across the city will be demolished in the exercise.
