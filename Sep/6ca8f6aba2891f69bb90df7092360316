Conditions at the Pumwani Maternity Hospital are not conducive for mothers and their babies, a report says. The preliminary report on the investigations launched by Health CS Sicily Kariuki shows there is poor hygiene and that infection prevention measures are not adhered to. The situation was compounded by the breakdown of an incinerator more than five months ago. The report says seven of the babies were still births and three were macerated [died on uterus]. The others died as a result of “different complications.” The hospital has inadequate equipment and an acute shortage of nurses, doctors and other specialists.“At the time of inspection, essential equipment such as incubators were inadequate. The team found 14 incubators but four were non-functional, nine resuscitators but two were non- functional,” the report says. “It was further observed that patients for elective caesarian section shared beds. Available information indicated some of the admitted patients laboured while on the benches due to shortage of the beds.” The report was compiled by a joint medical regulatory bodies team. The team conducted the probe following the discovery of 12 bodies stashed in boxes. The discovery was made by Governor Mike Sonko on Monday. The team comprised members of the Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Board, Nursing Council of Kenya, Clinical Officers Council, the Public Health Officers Council and Pharmacy and Poisons Board.
