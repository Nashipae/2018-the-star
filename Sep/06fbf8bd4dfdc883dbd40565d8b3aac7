It might be too late in the day but like a sinking and,Thika United are clutching at straws as they seek to stay alive in the SportPesa Premier League. Three days ago, the basement club caused the biggest upset of the season, beating champions in waiting Gor Mahia to keep their survival hopes just about alive. With eight points separating them with the final safety slot, they will need to replicate that monumental performance when they entertain Tusker. With 12 points maximum available, Joseph Ruto’s charges fate might be out of their hands but they will have to do their best to have a shot at survival. The win over Gor has injected optimism in the side and no doubt brought fans back to Thika sub county stadium to help them towards what would be the greatest ever escape in the country’s top flight history. The brewers are still smarting from an exit from the Shield and coach Robert Matano will have without a doubt told his players that they are fighting for their future in Ruaraka as he starts plotting about next season. Failure to win today will mean Thika’s decade and a half presence in the top tier league might end this weekend. Still in with a chance of replicating last season’s second place finish in the SportPesa Premier League, former champions Sofapaka dare not put the hand breaks on despite their attention now largely occupied with the looming Shield semi-final. As they prepare for Kakamega Homeboyz’s visit to Narok, they will be without defender George Maelo who was sent off during their league match against Posta Rangers, where Sofapaka emerged 1-0 winners. In that clash, Maelo turned from hero to villain after he scored the decisive goal before being sent off, but eventually the maximum points were kept safe by John Baraza’s charges.
