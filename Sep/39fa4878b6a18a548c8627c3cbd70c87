Thirty-nine health facilities in Kitui South received Sh8 million equipment to help reduce child and maternal mortality. The Catholic Medical Mission Board, an NGO, on Wednesday handed over a truckload of medical equipment to county health officers at the Kitui County Referral Hospital. The equipment was presented by the NGO official, Jesse Kihuha. Kihuha said the equipment would go a long way in improving maternal and child health. It will also supplement Kitui Governor Charity Ngiluâ€™s quality health care agenda, he added. The equipment includes delivery beds, delivery sets, autoclave machines, baby weighing and adult weighing scales, BP measuring equipment, oxygen concentrators, neo-natal resuscitation kits, blood sugar machines and thermometers. The official said Kitui South facilities were chosen because of high child and maternal deaths. He said in some parts, the nearest health facility is 19 kilometres away. The acting director Joanes Arango said the organisation had also supported building health facilities in Kitui South.
