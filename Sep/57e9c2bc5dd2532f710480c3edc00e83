Two police officers have been nabbed and three others are being sought for defrauding a Malian after arresting him in Nairobi. Bathily Abdoulaye reported that four officers from Nairobi Area command came to his Kilimani residence and arrested him. He said the police ransacked his house and left with valuable items, DCI boss George Kinoti said on Wednesday. The officers took $8,000 (Sh806,480), Sh83,000, three Rolex watches each valued at $15,000 and his passport. Abdoulaye alleged the officers also transferred Sh30,000 from his mobile phone number to another. The foreigner was then escorted to Central police station and was later released without being officially booked. Thereafter, the same officers allegedly demanded an additional $8,000 (Sh806,480) which prompted him to report the matter. Kinoti said Flying Squad officers laid an ambush at Yaya Centre where the money was supposed to be delivered. They arrested Moses Njogu Njagi and Kelvin Ndosi. The passport of the complainant was recovered from the arrested officers. "The Flying Squad is still looking for the other rogue officers including one driver attached to the County Criminal Investigations Officer, Nairobi Area," Kinoti said. A healthy working relationship between Kinoti and DPP Noordin Haji is said to be the force behind the new anti-corruption purge. Unlike their predecessors, Ndegwa Muhoro and Keriako Tobiko, who literally could not see eye to eye, the new pair has a good working relationship. Haji and Kinoti have become the new champions of the anti-corruption war. Less than six months after taking office, the duo has gone after big names in the NYS and Kenya Power scandals. Top officials in government, who in the past seemed untouchable, have been arrested and charged.
