Equity Bank men’s volleyball team right attacker Moses Omondi is in Japan for a three months trial with Iota Miyoshi Weisse Adler. This means the dependable player will be unavailable for his side during the Kenya Volleyball Federation national league seventh leg at the Wote grounds in Makueni County on Friday. The bankers are making their debut in the league and hope to grab an early play-off slot if they win one of the their two ties against KPA and KDF. Omondi won the KVF best attacker accolades while at Cooperative Bank before the outfit folded up early this year, forcing him to jump ship to Equity. He left the country last week for the Japanese V League side. Team manager Nicholas Bitok, said: “He is a good player and we will miss his services but as a team, we wish him well and all the best. However, there is no cause for alarm as we have equally good players who have stepped in his position. They include Martin Kiptoo, Kennedy Toek and Rodgers Chipchit.” He added: “Japan is a good place for players to harness their talent and I am glad he has the chance to showcase what he has and hope that he gets the nod.” The bankers are second on the league standing with 27 points from nine matches ahead of their day’s opponents,KDF have 25 points from 11 matches while KPA have 24 points from nine. Former champions Kenya Prisons lead the table standings with 28 points while GSU are third 26 points. Ahead of the two ties, Bitok said there is a lot to play for.
