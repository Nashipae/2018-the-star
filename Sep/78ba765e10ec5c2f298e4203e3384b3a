Motorists and boda boda operators in Kisumu and Homa Bay have said they will increase fares to adjust to the high fuel prices. Those who spoke to the Star yesterday said they have no option but to pass the cost to commuters. Maxwel Otieno, a motobike rider in Kisumu, said boda boda operators will charge customers at least Sh20 more. Taxi driver Julius Aura said high fuel prices will hurt residents as they will pay more for transport. Homa Bay county boda boda forum, chairman Ken Dede said fuel is already expensive and the additional tax will make theirÂ work difficult. Some Homa Bay matatu operators going to Migori, Kisumu and Kisii have increased fares by at least Sh50.
