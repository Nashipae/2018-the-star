The row over high taxation and its impact on the cost of living is an eye opener to a far deeper conversation the country needs to have. While opinion differs on whether the level of taxation in Kenya is acceptable compared to other countries, there is no doubt that the country’s governance budget is way out of hand. The tussle over VAT on petroleum products should be a precursor to a more detailed audit of our public expenditure. Nearly five years ago, the government commissioned a task force to audit the cost of implementing the Constitution. But its findings seem to have been shelved quietly. Analysts have issued copious warnings about the danger of Kenya’s rising debt, which Treasury insists is still manageable and below the red line. But it is becoming ever clearer that there will be no end to the borrowing spree and punitive taxation measures, until we undertake a pragmatic review of the cost of implementing our celebrated 2010 Constitution. The many layers of representation and administrative structures have doubled our recurrent expenditure and are frittering away much-needed resources. Why, for example, do we need over 550 Members of Parliament? Are some constitutional commissions necessary? What should be their membership? Should we have 47 counties? All these positions and administrative structures come at a heavy cost. They are an unnecessary burden to mwananchi and the bane of our development.
