Hundreds of students were stranded in Athi River town, Machakos on Wednesday after a college they were to join failed to accommodate them. The affected are from Mombasa, Busia, Taita Taveta, Bungoma, Kakamega, Siaya, Kisumu, Kericho, Bomet, among other counties. The group said they applied for courses at the school from their homes on the premise
that they would be sponsored by an NGO trading as Rural Aid Kenya. They claimed that most of the courses they applied for are not offered
at the institution adding that those who lured them to apply for the
same had gone underground. "This college is bogus, we have been conned. It has no facilities, most courses we applied for are not offered here," an affected student said. They applied for courses in plant operations, education, electrical
engineering, information technology, catering, plumbing, building and
construction. Others sought to study mass communication and journalism, social work and community development, among others. Some of the learners said their parents sold land and cattle to raise school fees among other levies. Most of them said they paid between Sh10,000 and Sh21,000 while others paid as low as Sh1,000 in school fee. "We have suffered here since we got admitted at the institution. There is no food, water, accommodation and bathrooms," another one said. But Sunrise College director Michael Mutuku rubbished the claims
saying the students were lying. He said their operations were on as
usual. "The students were not stranded but were waiting for the
college bust to take them to our Kinanie's campus," Mutuku told the Star
on the phone. Mutuku said all the courses listed above are offered in the institution. Click here for the latest political news
