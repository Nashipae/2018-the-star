The government in July issued an alert over an outbreak of coffee disease. The bacterial blight disease outbreak could cause 100 per cent damage to the coffee crop, according to Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation. Kalro director general Eliud Kireger said there has been an increased occurrence of the disease in high altitude areas, mainly in the Rift Valley, due to the rainy season. “The coffee disease was common in Solai in Nakuru county and Mt Elgon in Trans Nzoia county. But it has now spread to Kisii, Kiambu, Nandi, Nyeri and Muranga counties, hence the disease's common name 'Solai/Elgon die back',” he said. Dr Elijah Gichuru, Coffee Research Institute director, said the crop is further struggling with high incidences of frost. This leads to massive drop of the beans, and thus will eventually affect the annual yield. VULNERABLE AREAS The disease is common in high altitude areas, characterised by low temperatures, freezing winds, high daily temperatures and hailstorms. It is mainly spread through plant surface water, splash erosion, farm machinery and tools, and human body. The Kalro director told farmers to use good agricultural practices to prevent infection of coffee trees. “We urge farmers to use integrated management through prevention, containment and control. Protection entails application of practices that prevent the infection of coffee trees by pathogens,” Kireger said. "This prevention is through creating conditions that are not favorable for existence of the pathogens. Containment is the process of avoiding plant-to-plant and farm-to-farm spread of infection, while control aims at stopping an existing infection."
