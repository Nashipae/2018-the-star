It was double delight for Homeboyz RFC as they bagged the national Sevens title after winning the Christie Sevens leg, beating Quins 24-19 in sudden death yesterday. Their closest rivals Mwamba’s hopes of winning the title went up in smoke after losing to South Africa outfit, Blue Bull Tuks 10-5 in the Main Cup quarters. Homeboyz, who clichéd the Prinsloo, Sepetuka and Kabeberi titles fell behind with skipper Leonard Mugaisi sent to the sin bin. The hosts took advantage with Cyprian Kuto crossing the whitewash with Ugandan import, Aaron Ofoywoth converting for a 7-0 lead. Jeff Oluoch opened the scores for the deejays with Johnstone Olindi converting to tie the score at 7-7. Solomon Okia touched down for Quins with a well taken try with Ofoywoth converting for a 14-7 lead at the interval. On resumption, Oluoch crossed the line with Olindi adding the extras to tie the game at 14-14. Ofoyworth, who was having a sensational game then scored Quins third try at the corner for a 19-14 lead. Quins were then dealt a major blow when Okia was sent to the bin. Olindi scored for the deejays to tie the match at 19-19. Tension mounted in the closing minutes with each team throwing everything into attack. The match then went into sudden death where Mugaisi atoned for his earlier error to score the winner. Homeboyz had thrashed Strathmore Leos 41-5 while Quins beat Blue Bulls Tuks 14-7.
