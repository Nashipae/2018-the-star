Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji yesterday promised the nation that no one will be spared if they are found to have played a role in the murder of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno. The pronouncement by the DPP coincided with the revelation by Sharon’s family that it has been threatened and the lives of some of its members are in danger. These threats must not be taken lightly. Extra security should be provided swiftly not only to this family but also to all other persons considered to have vital information to the investigators. Among those who should be provided with ample security is the Nation journalist, Douglas Oduor, who was abducted alongside Sharon but who managed to escape. She is said to have confided in him. Various theories have been advanced involving Sharon’s gruesome murder. It is essential that the DPP speed up investigations and bring those culpable to book. In the interest of justice for the family, the suspects and the country at large, procedures such as carrying out DNA tests and getting the results should be expedited. No one involved should be spared, irrespective of his or her status.
