Failure by the Kenya Seed Company to pay irrigation farmers in Bura for the maize they delivered last season has forced some of them to lease out their farms while others are trying their hand in rice farming. Close to 2,700 farmers who lease out their farms at Sh3,000 for one and half acres are now casual labourers on their farms. Bura Irrigation Scheme is one of the largest in the country, with 3,500 acres. It was started in 1978 for maize growing but with time green grams, cowpeas, cotton, watermelons and onions were introduced. But mismanagement by the National Irrigation Board has caused farmers suffering. Financial institutions owe the farmers Sh35 million while Agricultural Finance Corporation has not paid them Sh58 million for the last three seasons. Kenya Seed Company rejected farmersâ€™ maize seeds downgrading them to commercial, where they are paid Sh35 a kilo instead of Sh62. A veteran farmer John Macharia accused Kenya Seed of supplying them with inappropriate seeds. He urged the government to intervene by insuring farmers to cushion them against hard times. Many farmers are unable to pay school fees.
