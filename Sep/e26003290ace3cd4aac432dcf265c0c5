Nairobi governor Mike Sonko on Thursday told a court he does not give bribes. He was testifying against two County Workers Union officials who are facing graft charges at the Anti-Corruption Court. Sonko said he never gave money to the suspects when they had threatened to demonstrate against his administration over delayed salaries. Appearing before trial magistrate Douglas Ogoti, Sonko said Nairobi City branch secretary general Benson Oriaro and assistant treasurer John Muriuki, were demanding a Sh1 million bribe, but later reduced the amount to Sh200,000. The governor said he records any person who has an intention of either asking for a bribe or offering him one. Sonko also said he uses people, whom he trusts, to set traps for individuals who ask for bribes from him. The governor denied offering a Sh200,000 bribe to the union officials who are accused of demanding cash to call off a strike over unpaid salaries last year. Oriaro is accused that on October 16, 2017, being an employee of Nairobi county, he requested Sh200,000 from Joab Odhiambo claiming he would influence the union to engage in a scheduled parade to City Hall to demand their delayed September 2017 salary. Witness Job Ogolla told the magistrate that the accused and his deputy John Benard Murioki received Sh50,000. They were nabbed by officers from the EACC and recorded statements before being taken to court. The witness produced money that was recovered from the suspects plus a recorded discussion. The duo, according to the prosecution, committed the offence on October 16 and 17, 2017. The suspects denied the charges. They are out on a Sh200,000 bail or an alternative bond of Sh500,000. They report to the EACC every Friday. Click here for the latest political news
