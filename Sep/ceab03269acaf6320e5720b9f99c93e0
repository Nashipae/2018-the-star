Learning conditions in the 225 public early childhood education centres in the city will improve after Governor Mike Sonko announced a raft of initiatives. Besides the free milk that each of the 17, 000 pupils will get, each school will get at least two more teachers and four security guards by the end of the year. “The county public board has started hiring 520 teachers to be posted in all county ECDE centres,” Sonko said. The county sought the services of a private security firm to ensure every school gets four guards – two working during the day and two at night – to safeguard the children. Sonko said he embarked on reclaiming all grabbed school land and warned grabbers. He said the county is improving infrastructure – building and renovating classrooms, and buying desks – to increase enrollment to at least 23,000 by January. The governor said plans are underway to improve transition from ECDE to primary school. Sonko spoke at Martin Luther Primary School when he launched the free school milk programme for the 17,000 ECDE pupils. Click here for the latest political news
