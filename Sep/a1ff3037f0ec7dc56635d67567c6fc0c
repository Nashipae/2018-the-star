The High Court has declined to stop the Kenya Judicial Staff Association from conducting fresh regional elections slated for today. Chairperson of KJSA North Eastern Region Abdikadir Osman had filed a case claiming the elections are illegal, wrongful and unlawful. Osman said he was validly elected as regional chair, North Eastern region, in elections conducted by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission on April 7 this year. Later, the association nullified the election through its national executive council. On August 27, the association issued a notice directing that fresh elections be held on September 14. Osman claims it was unjust for the association’s national executive council disputes resolution committee to nullify the election without first serving him with the grounds of the cancellation. He was also never granted granting adequate opportunity to defend himself, he said. “My opponent Darro Ahmed filed a notice to appeal the outcome but I was never served. I am also yet to see the petition forming the premise upon which the said committee made a finding on the election process conducted on April,” read part of his documents. But in a brief ruling, Justice Wilfrida Okwany said she was not satisfied with the argument to stop the election. “Even though Osman claims he came to know about the nullification on August 28, I am still not satisfied with that the reason given by Osman for his delay in filing the petition,” she said. The association also said the petition was not in good faith considering that the elections are scheduled for today and that resources and preparations have been put in place for the same.
