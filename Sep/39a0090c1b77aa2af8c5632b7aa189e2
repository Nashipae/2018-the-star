US President Donald Trump will
fail in his confrontation with Iran, just like Iraq's Saddam
Hussein, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday,
referring to the war between the two Middle Eastern powers and
vowing that Tehran will not abandon its missiles. Tensions have ramped up between Iran and the United States
after Trump withdrew from a landmark multilateral nuclear deal
in May and reimposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic last
month. As Rouhani spoke, Iran began displaying its naval power in
the Gulf during annual parades in the capital Tehran and the
port of Bandar Abbas on the Gulf marking the start of the
country’s 1980-88 war with Iraq. Iran has suggested in recent weeks that it could take
military action in the Gulf to block other countries’ oil
exports in retaliation for U.S. sanctions intended to halt its
sales of crude. Washington maintains a fleet in the Gulf that protects oil
shipping routes. "The same will happen to Trump. America will suffer the same
fate as Saddam Hussein," Rouhani said in a speech carried live
by state television. "Iran will not abandon its defensive weapons ... including
its missiles that make America so angry," Rouhani said. State media said about 600 vessels took part in the Gulf
naval drill on Saturday, a day after Iran held aerial exercises
in the waterway, vowing that a "pounding reply" awaited the
country's enemies. Click here for the latest political news
