The power couple Size 8 and DJ Mo once almost ended their marriage after having a misunderstanding. Speaking on NTV’s Wicked Edition, Size 8 said she once walked out on her husband. “There is this day I packed my bags and left (my matrimonial home). I was angry and went on to make an emotional decision, which I later realised was wrong. I thought about it and decided to come back, even though there was embarrassment written all over my face at the time,” she said. DJ Mo also admitted to walking out of their home on a few occasions. “There is this time we argued and I just left the house and started driving, before turning back at Limuru. Looking back I had thought of driving to America through Uganda.”
