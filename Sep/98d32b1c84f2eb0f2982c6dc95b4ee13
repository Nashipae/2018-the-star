Reducing fuel levy to eight per cent is not a solution to the high cost of living, Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has said. He differed with President Uhuru Kenyatta over the reduction of the 16 per cent VAT on fuel, saying he should have done away with the Finance Bill. Odhiambo on Saturday said Uhuru should have listened to Kenyans’ pleas and scrap the bill, than reduce the levy by half. The MP said what Uhuru did cannot be considered a reprieve in the hard economic times. The President on Friday proposed the reduction of the fuel levy from 16 to eight per cent and sent the Finance Bill to Parliament for amendment. But Odhiambo said there is nothing to celebrate about the eight per cent. He added that Uhuru should keep his campaign promise of improving Kenyans’ lives. “What the President has done is nothing close to improving the living standards as he promised.” The MP said if Uhuru had citizens’ interests at heart, he would rethink the fuel levy. He asked fellow legislators to vote against the bill as they did previously, to suspend implementation until 2020. “There is nothing good about the bill, even if the President tries to send it back to Parliament for review as many times as he wishes,” Odhiambo said. The legislator said for the country to realise any economic development, Uhuru must do away with heavy project spending such as the SGR. “The standard gauge railway from Nakuru, Naivasha, Machakos and Kisumu should be stopped to save the funds.” Odhiambo added that projects like wind power and the Nairobi-Mombasa highway should be shelved. He said what derails the country’s economy is the huge loans and mismanagement of funds on heavy projects that have no instant profit.
