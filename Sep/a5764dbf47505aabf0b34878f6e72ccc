The trial of a man accused of defiling his eight-year-old cousin has been adjourned for the third time after the defence lawyer failed to appear in court. Human rights groups have complained about the delays through adjournments. They want the case expedited. It had also been adjourned on May 31 and July 5. The court was told the defence was not ready to proceed. On Thursday, another lawyer held brief for the accused’s lawyer. The case was pushed to November 15 when the last defence witness is expected to take the stand. The defence has four witnesses. All prosecution witnesses have testified. Dr Susan Njuguna from the Nyeri General Hospital told the court that medical examination had proved the girl was assaulted. The 30-year-old man is out on bond. He is said to have defiled the Standard 1 cousin on June 24, 2014, in Nyeri county. On Thursday, he appeared before Nyeri senior principal magistrate Phillip Mutua. In court documents, the child said her cousin lured her to his shop and abused her. He told her to tell others that a tree branch had fallen on her private parts — only if asked, she said. She said the accused told her he would kill her father if she disclosed what took place.
