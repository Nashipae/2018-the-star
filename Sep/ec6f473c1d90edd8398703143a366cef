The government will continue to evict families living in gazetted forests across the country, Environment and Forestry CS Keriako Tobiko has said. Tobiko said such families will not be compensated. “We have heard cries of compensation for families that had encroached on gazetted land and this shall not happen. The government shall instead confiscate that land,” he said. He accused some government officers of colluding with communities to issue title deeds warning that such documents will be revoked. The CS was speaking in Great Rift Valley Lodge in Naivasha after opening a two day Forest Carbon Partnership Facility REDD+ workshop sponsored by the UNDP. During the meeting, Tobiko said the government was committed to attaining the 10 per cent forest cover by 2022. Currently stands at 7.2 per cent. He noted that of the 47 counties, only 20 had signed the Transition Implementation Plan (TIP) since 2013 a move that had affected negatively environmental projects. “Sadly none of the counties has started to implement the plan despite the constitution devolving environmental functions that involves forest conservation,” he said.
