National Assembly Minority leader John Mbadi has dared MPs to remove him from the position following his stand on Finance Bill, 2018. Mbadi and his Majority counterpart Aden Duale led MPs in walking out of the chamber to deny the House a quorum to reject the Bill. The Bill, which has been signed into law, was finally adopted despite shouts and fights among lawmakers. Among the contents of the Bill is the introduction of the eight per cent tax on petroleum products, down from the original 16 per cent. Opposition MPs shouted Mbadi down as he supported the bill, with most of them asking him to quit. Speaking during a fundraiser at Nyandiwa Catholic Church in his Suba South constituency on Sunday, Mbadi defended his stand. He said the tax will allow the state to raise enough revenue for development. He said Sh1.9 trillion revenue raised per year was not enough. The lawmaker said the country was unable to manage its budgetary costs and pay its debts. "I’m an accountant by profession and I understand budget estimates. I don’t fear punishment from any quarter. Mbadi said. "Kenya had to restructure its ways of getting funds for local expenditure and paying debts." Click here for the latest political news
