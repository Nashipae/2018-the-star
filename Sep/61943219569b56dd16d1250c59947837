Two suspects were on Wednesday charged with the attempted murder of former Garissa CEC Idriss Mukhtar. Mohamud Aden and Juliet Njoki were also charged with conspiracy to kill lawyer Charles Kanjama. The suspects were accused of attempting to murder Mukhtar on August 19 and plotting to kill Kanjama between July 1 and September 27. They denied the charges before Nairobi chief magistrate Francis Andayi. Assistant DPP Solomon Njeru is seeking the detention of the suspects during their trial. Andayi will rule on bond terms later today. Another suspect in the case, David Mwai, who confessed to the police of the murder plot, died in a Parklands police cell. He is said to have told the police how he was contracted to kill Mukhtar as he left a mosque in Kileleshwa. A report by police chiefs said the man committed suicide, but the circumstances are unclear. A source said the suspect hanged himself with his pullover. The prime suspect was buried at his grandmother’s home in Ngamini, Nakuru county, on September 7. Mwai's burial ceremony that took less than two hours was attended by not more than 200 people. His friends kept off the funeral save for a few who accompanied family members.
