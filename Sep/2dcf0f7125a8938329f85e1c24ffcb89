Experienced Kenyan International Jacqueline Mwangi has been nominated to the International Hockey Federation (IHF) Athletes Committee. The forward is among nominees appointed to various IHF commissions based on skills and experience. The nominees list features especially players who have featured in the Olympic, World Championship, World Cup and continental events. An excited Mwangi, who turns up for league champions Telkom, welcomed her nomination. “It is a good gesture not only from Kenya Hockey Union, who seconded me but also IHF for considering my nomination. “I am humbled. My wish has always been to mould and give opportunities to those who have talent but I don’t have the resources,” said Mwangi, who was voted top scorer with 27 points last year. KHU secretary general, Wycliffe Ongori, said they forwarded two names Mwangi’s and Zack Aura to IHF for consideration because of their zeal, discipline and commitment to the well being of the sport. “Truth be told, Aura and Mwangi have featured for the national teams religiously and served their respective clubs the best way they know how. As a union, we have not seen them entangled in any indiscipline cases. With those attributes, we believe they will make good leaders,” said Ongori. The duties of athletes committee among others will be to act as a liaison between the IHF and the athletes and make sure the latter have a voice in the IHF decision making process.
