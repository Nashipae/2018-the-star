National champions General Service Unit men’s volleyball team stand in coach Danson Tali is counting on his recent international exploits when he guides the team to the Kenya Volleyball Federation national league seventh leg at the Wote grounds in Makueni County next week. Tali guided GSU to the title during the East and Central Africa Police Games in Tanzania and believes this can form a crucial yardstick as they seek to retain the national championship back at home. Tali is holding brief for Gideon Tarus, who is away in training. The unbeaten champions, third on the table with 26 points, take on Kahawa and Kiambu County teams on September 21. Former champions Kenya Prisons and league debutants Equity Bank occupy the first and second positions with 28 and 27 points respectively. Tali observed they will be seeking to keep their unbeaten record. “I am happy we won the regional Police games and we intend to extend the good performance locally as we chase a national play-off slot,” said Tali. Team manager Nicholas Kimeli revealed that the team will miss the services of influential trio of Alex Kariuki, Bonffetry Wekesa and Luke Makuto, who are also in training. However, the official remained optimistic they will be available for selection during the play-offs scheduled for the Moi Stadium, Kasarani. “They are key players in the team and as much as we are missing their services, the current players in their respective positions have risen to the occasion,” said Kimeli. “We missed the first and second legs in Bungoma and Kitui and therefore next week’s matches are crucial as we seek to return to the top of the standings.”
