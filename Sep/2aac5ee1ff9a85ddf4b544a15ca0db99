Nation Media Group has said the abduction of journalist Barrack Odour on Monday night in Homa Bay was an attempted murder. Rongo University student Otieno, who was with the Nation writer was killed. Odour escaped by jumping from a speeding car. In a statement on Wednesday, NMG sent a message of condolence to Otieno's family. The media house asked the police to conduct swift investigations. NMG said the harassment of journalists has become rampant. The firm said this hampers the independence of the media. Meanwhile, the Kenya Editors’ Guild has demanded quick investigations into the student's killing and the attempt on Oduor’s life. The Guild condemned the emerging trend of attacks and intimidation of journalists. “We demand that those who sanctioned the crimes against Sharon and Barrack be equally pursued and arrested,” chairman Churchill Otieno said. The Guild said the safety of journalists is key for an effective and independent media. Otieno said attacking journalists is unconstitutional and unacceptable. “We reiterate that journalists’ work is protected under the Constitution. Anyone with grievances should use legal ways of seeking redress,” Otieno said.
