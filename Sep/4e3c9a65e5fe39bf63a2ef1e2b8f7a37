Parklands MCA Highrdge Jayendra Malde, who was last month arrested for attempting to solicit money from a businessman, has blamed former Embakasi South MP Ishrad Sumra for his woes. Malde was arrested by the anti-corruption detectives for allegedly demanding a Sh5. 7 million bribe from Rahim Chatur, the owner of Concord Hotel in Westlands. The money was allegedly to be shared among the 19 members of the Labour committee so that they could convince Governor Mike Sonko not to demolish the hotel, said to be standing on a wetland. Malde has denied demanding the cash and claims Sumra, in collaboration with his political rivals, were behind his arrest. He questioned the timing of the arrest and sudden appearance of the former MP on the site of the incident. The ward representative was however released without being charged. “Despite the purported arrest, I have never been charged in court for the said crime and I want to call on the EACC to compel the MP to record statement, “ he said in Nairobi yesterday.
