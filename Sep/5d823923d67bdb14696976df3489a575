County governments and the private sector have been urged to invest in infrastructure and equipment at TVETs to enable them handle the increasing number of learners. Vocational and Technical Training PS Kevit Desai said they should complement the existing support by the national government. He spoke during the fourth graduation ceremony of Mathenge Technical Training Institute in Othaya, Nyeri, on Friday. Enrolment in TVETs is on the rise and there is need for more hostels and infrastructure. The growth has been attributed to the introduction of capitation programme meant to reduce the fees burden on parents. Learners at the institutions will be getting Sh30,000 bursary each and Higher Education Loans Board loans. “The youth have began to understand the real context of TVET, its flexibility and its dedicated purpose towards creating self-employment and gainful employment,” Desai said. He said this has created a lot of excitement with most TVET institutions recording a 30 per cent increase in enrolment. Enrolment at Mathenge technical Training Institute, he said, has double in the last two years. The country needs at least 10 per cent of its population to be enrolled in TVETs to make a significant transformation in economic and social development, Desai said. He said TVET students are the bedrock for industry and agriculture. Click here for the latest political news
