MCAs in Kitui on Wednesday demanded an apology from Governor Charity Ngilu for cancelling a retreat in Mombasa. They asked speaker George Ndotto to formally write to the governor. However, they did not specify the action they will take should Ngilu not comply. The bonding retreat was planned for September 4-8 but was called off. Ngilu changed the venue to Mwingi. In her campaign manifesto, Ngilu advocated for "buy Kitui build Kitui." Majority leader Peter Kilonzo moved a motion to discuss the failed retreat and the call for an apology. All MCAs supported the motion. Kilonzo said a letter dated August 30 by county secretary Alex Kimanzi invited MCAs to Mombasa for the forum. On September 5, MCAs travelled to Mombasa, however, another letter at 1:25 pm indicated the meeting had been rescheduled.
