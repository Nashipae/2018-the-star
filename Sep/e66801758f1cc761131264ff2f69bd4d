Authorities in Kuria East, Migori county are looking for a man who speared his six months pregnant wife to death on Friday. Pinto Boroi Mwita, 35, of Biasumu village fled after killing Rael Boke in a disagreement over the unborn child's paternity. Area chief Mark Obosi said neighbours were woken up to the woman's distress wails from the house. "Upon rushing there, they found the woman in a pool of blood. The husband had escaped," Obosi said. He said the man had doubted if the pregnancy was his having been away in Tanzania for several months. The man worked as a casual labourer in the neighbouring country, the chief said. Joram Chacha, a neighbour, said the man, upon returning home, demanded to know who the child's father was. "The wife insisted the child belonged to Mwita. The matter brought issues among the couples for some time before the latest incident." Some of the irked residents have mounted a search for the man and have vowed to lynch him as well. There are reports the suspect fled to Tanzania. His father Mwita Boroi said even though the couple had matrimonial problems, he could not believe the son would resort to the act. "We have intervened in their disputes as a family on several occasions but it appeared that my son was not satisfied." "I never imagined he could resort to murder. I was shocked when I went to their house and found my daughter-in-law lying in a pool of blood," Boroi said. Kuria East OCPD Ahmed Abdikadir said the police have launched a manhunt for the suspect. The woman's body is taken to Migori Referral Hospital in wait for postmortem to determine the cause of her death. Click here for the latest political news
