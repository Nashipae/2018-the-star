A herder escaped death when bandits raided and stole 100 goats in Chemoe, Baringo North, on Saturday. Thirty-year-old Elijah Aengwo was tortured and left for dead. He is recovering at Marigat Subcounty Hospital. The police reservist was grazing his goats at midday when five attackers ambushed him at Wanap. He was alone. “I didn’t carry my gun that day. I was only armed with a bow and arrows. They tied me up, then ordered me to keep silent as I led them towards Tiaty,” he said from his hospital bed. He said he was tortured along the way. “After piercing my ribs with sharp objects and heaping stones on my head at around 11pm, they stripped me naked and left me for dead at Kiboluk in Kositei, Tiaty,” Aengwo said. He regained consciousness yesterday morning and struggled to find his way home before he was admitted to the health facility. Residents have appealed to the government to improve security. Richard Chepchomei said they have lost many livestock to frequent attacks. He urged the authorities to arrest and punish the criminals. Chepchomei called for deployment of additional police officers to patrol the region, especially along the borders between two communities. Tuluk assistant chief Moses Kaptum said the attack came barely five months after other bandits killed herder Reuben Rutto and stolen 50 cows from Ngaratuko. Click here for the latest political news
