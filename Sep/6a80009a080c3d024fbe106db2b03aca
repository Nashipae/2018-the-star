Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter has warned of a brewing revolution resulting from the “collapse of the economy”. He said yesterday that Kenya is bankrupt, citing the Sh6 trillion debt. Keter said graft cartels have seized most sectors of the economy. He accused those in charge of the economy of living in denial and plunging Kenya deep into a crisis. Keter said the government lies that it has put in place austerity measures to fix the problem, yet goes ahead to announce it will buy new police uniforms. “The tragedy is that the drivers of our economy are still in denial. To make it worse, they are taking us into a ditch at a very supersonic speed,” Keter said in a statement. He thanked MPs who opposed the eight per cent tax on fuel. “I sincerely thank all the members who supported us through the parliamentary process of trying to reject the presidential VAT proposal in the form of a memorandum. They stood with Kenyans.” See: [AUDIO] Alfred Keter vows to campaign against looters, graft lords Keter accused “cartels in the House” of hijacking procedures to push the bill through. The lawmaker assured, however, that all is not lost. Keter asked MPs to stick together and save the country from going to the dogs. What happened in Parliament is history and the MPs who stood with Kenyans must now lead the “boiling revolution” from the front, Keter said. “The worst of such a revolution is that if you don’t change it, it’ll change you,” he said. The MP said the war on impunity witnessed in the House must be won and those masquerading to be House leaders purged.
