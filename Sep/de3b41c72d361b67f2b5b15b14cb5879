A homes developer has refuted claims by a member of the Kenyatta family that they are misleading potential buyers about a 20-acre piece of land in Juja, Kiambu. Catherine Kihanya, President Kenyatta’s niece, was quoted by a section of the media last Tuesday alleging the piece of land in Juja constituency belongs to the family and no sale agreement had been reached between Banda Homes and the family. Kihanya accused the developer of misleading buyers and cautioned potential buyers to conduct due diligence before purchasing the property. But Banda Homes director Paul Nderitu rubbished Kihanya’s claims as malicious. He told the clients that they bought the land from one Kamau Ngengi, a cousin to Kihanya, after the court ruled that the land be subdivided between Kihanya’s mother and her sister Beth Ngonyo who is Ngengi’s mother. “The land was divided between the two sisters through a court order after a lengthy court dispute and all that remains is issuance of the title deed. We fail to understand what Kihanya is after and we entered agreement with the seller with full knowledge,” Nderitu said. Nderitu spoke at New Rain Hotel after a tour of Acacia, Oakland, and Parkview Gatundu estates during the Banda family day. He urged financiers and policy makers to consider off-plan financing for housing to enable low income earners own homes. “We would like the President and policy makers to make easy and affordable conditions for which someone can own a home,” Nderitu said. Banda Homes has built over 1,000 houses in Nairobi and Kiambu and is expanding to other counties.
