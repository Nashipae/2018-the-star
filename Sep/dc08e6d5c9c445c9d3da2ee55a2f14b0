September's inflation grew to 11-month high of 5.7 per cent, signaling
tougher economic days ahead for Kenya as the effects of VAT on petroleum products begin to manifest. The cost of living is expected to rise in the coming months as
the spiral effect of high fuel prices extends to other sectors of the economy. Expect manufacturers toÂ  pass the increased cost of operation to consumers. To add salt to injury, new and additional taxes like the National Housing Development Fund, higher mobile
and cash transfer levies are expected to cut into the income of most families. Sadly,
the net effect of the high tax regime could be loss of jobs. Although Central Bank governor Patrick Njoroge recently
assured the country that the government will everything to keep inflation below 7.5 per cent, past experience
shows that such measures are not felt down at the bottom of economic
pyramid. Kenyans should be alert to the reality of tough economic times ahead and adopt simple cost cutting measures
that will enable them weather the storm. Those with land should grow vegetables and other food instead
of buying from the market. They should also minimize wastage. Reducing
bulbs and switching off non-essential electrical appliances will help cut down the bills of consumables like power. Bottom line is, you may not control the high
cost of living but you can weather its storm.
