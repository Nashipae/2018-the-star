An uneasy calm has returned to Nessuit area in Njoro subcounty, Nakuru, after the government arrested 12 people in connection with clashes and imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew. At least 100 families were rendered homeless after their houses were torched in what was termed as retaliatory attacks by warring communities. The violence started last Wednesday. Six were people killed and 12 others injured after they were shot with arrows. Two communities clashed over occupation of land on the edges of Mau Forest following government evictions. The government targets to remove more than 40,000 settlers living in the forest to restore the water tower. Those arrested include a deputy county assembly speaker, a former MCA aspirant, a primary school head teacher and two assistant chiefs. Rift Valley regional coordinator Mwongo Chimwanga declared a curfew on Friday evening. He announced schools will be reopened today. “There will be no camps and residents are urged to return home as security personnel have been deployed in the area. There will be a crackdown on people from other regions who are said to be causing the violence,” Chimwanga said. Police are investigating claims of incitement by local leaders. “Any leader found to have incited the communities into violence will not be spared,” the administrator said. Nakuru governor Lee Kinyanjui asked the two communities involved in the conflict to each nominate five representatives who will work with the government on peace and reconciliation in the area. The clashes in Nakuru came in the wake of a similar conflict in Narok county.
