More police officers mentioned in the Alexander Monson inquest may face murder charges. The DPP said they were reviewing files and more officers will soon be charged over the Briton’s death. Senior state counsel Yamina Jami said they expect to charge more people in line with the inquest ruling of senior principal magistrate Richard Odenyo. Jami said the inquest outcome indicated the number of officers implicated was not limited to four officers, who have since been charged with murder. Monson died in May 2012 while in Diani police station in Kwale county. He developed breathing problems. Naftali Chege, Ismael Baraka, John Pamba and retired officer Charles Munyiri were charged with murdering Monson. They allegedly committed the crime at Diani police in Msambweni subcounty, Kwale. The four denied the charges and were released on Sh500,000 bond with a one surety of similar amount. In their bond application, the accused had said they were law- abiding citizens who were unlikely to abscond. The state further said the officers, who have taken a plea, are mentally fit to stand trial after they were cleared by the psychiatrist. Jami further applied for the court to order the deputy registrar to furnish the prosecution with a certified copy of the entire inquest file, which the prosecution said they will be relying on in the trial. He said the statements and documents they intend to use were adduced before the court during the inquest proceedings. Defense lawyer Pascal Nabwana asked the court to order a second mental assessment for Pamba. Nabwana said Pamba had shown signs of mental instability. Judge Erick Ogola ordered the state to serve all parties with the statements and exhibits they intended to use during trial. The hearing starts on January 21 next year. Police had denied Monson was fatally injured while in their custody but Monson’s parents insisted he had been murdered.
