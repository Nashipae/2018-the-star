One of Ugandan singer Radio Mowzey’s widows has shared an emotional message about him. Jennifer Robinson and Radio were blessed with a child, and she is yet to come to terms with his death.She has been sharing photos of her late baby daddy, revealing how she misses him. In her latest post, Jennifer reminisced the great moments she spent with Radio: “For years we hid from cameras, attention, and gossip, then when you died I was forced to face my fears and face them without you. I realised that even in the worst days of my life, I never lost myself, and that means I never lost what you loved about me. After facing that, I can face anything.”
