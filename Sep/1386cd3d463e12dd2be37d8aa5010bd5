Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o is recovering after he underwent surgery on his left arm at  Aga Khan Hospital on Thursday night. Nyong'o fractured his arm on Tuesday after he slipped and fell on a pavement in Nyeri. In a statement to the media, his press team said the governor was in excruciating pain after the accident. X-ray results revealed a fracture of the Humerus bone. Nyong'o was in Nyeri to attend the 2nd National Universal Health Conference. The conference brought together stakeholders to share and learn about innovative and transformative solutions to halt and reverse the rising and worrying trends in Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). On January 17, 2018, Nyongo was in the USA for a hipbone surgery at the University of California Hospital in San Francisco. This followed an advice from an orthopaedic surgeon at the Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi in February 2017. Click here for the latest political news
