Our fishermen were on Wednesday evening rescued from Lake Victoria after their boat got stuck in water hyacinth for three days. Samuel Otieno, 31, Raphael Otiu, 36, Kennedy Oluoch, 27, and Shadrack Ogutu, 28, were stuck with their boat in the water weed near Ngegu beach in Homa Bay town constituency. The fishermen went on a fishing expedition on Monday morning. They were rescued with a motorboat from the Kenya Maritime Authority. The fishermen were weak and tired after suffering mosquito bites and cold weather. “We suffered a lot,” Otiu said. The boat and fishing gear remained in the lake. Homa Bay county director of disaster management Eliud Onyango and Homa Bay East MCA Juma Awuor urged fishermen to avoid fishing neaar the hyacinth. “Let’s go for alternative sources of income to avoid disaster,” Onyango said. Awuor urged the fishermen to put on life saving jackets when going into the Lake. “All fishermen should acquire life saving jackets during fishing to enhance their safety in water,” Awuor said.
