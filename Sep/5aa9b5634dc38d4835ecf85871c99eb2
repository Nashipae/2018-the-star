ACK Archbishop Jackson Sapit has asked the President to heighten security in Narok and its environs to end the ongoing intercommunity killings. He said the situation could get out of hand if the Presdient does not intervene. Sapit said there is lack of tolerance among some communities. He spoke in Siaya at Simenya ACK on Wednesday. Sapit said law enforcers should get to the root of the matter and ensure they apply the law without favour. “I want to plead with the President to prevail upon his law enforcers not to be biased while dealing with the situation,” he said. Sapit said everyone has the right to live anywhere they want. “You cannot choose your neighbour and that is why I am asking the fighting communities in Narok to embrace each other and live in harmony,” the Archbishop said. Sapit said fighting and killing is never the solution to problems. He warned that any life lost due to a human being is a sin. Sapit also urged the communities not to hide perpetrators. “That way, the perpetrators will be brought to book and save the community from killings,” he said. The violence in Narok South constituency left five people dead.
