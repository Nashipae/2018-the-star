Newcomer Sharon Chepchumba is under pressure to impress as she makes her debut at the FIVB volleyball World Championship set for later this month in Tokyo, Japan. Chepchumba, who is part of the 14-member squad currently in residential training at Kasarani Indoor Arena, made it to the travelling squad with regular Evelyn Makuto being overlooked for the September 29 to October 20 event. The left attacker said she is glad to have made the cut but was quick to note that there is a lot of expectations from fans, technical bench and country at large for her to deliver. The hard-hitting player, who draws her inspiration from Jane Wacu and Triza Atuka, said she will give her best when she is given a starting role. “I’m ready for the challenge ahead. I know it is my first time to play for the national team and there is a lot of expectations and pressure at the same time,” said Chepchumba, a former Kwanthanze Secondary School player. She added: “When you have people around you pushing and reminding you of why you made it to the last 14, then you have no choice but to prove to them that they made the right choice. I hope to learn, gather experience and exposure that comes with playing at such a stage.” Chepchumba will, however, jostle for a starting line-up against experience trio and regulars captain Mercy Moim, Noel Murambi and Leonida Kasaya. Team manager David Kilundo described Chepchumba as a force to reckon with. Kilundo said: “There are two players who are making their debut to the national team—Chepchumba and centre blocker Lorine Chebet. These players punched above their weight in raining and it didn’t come as a surprise when they made it to the final team.” He added: “We are keen on transitioning and having the two players in the team confirms as much. The players cleared school last year and here they are muscling for slots in the team. I believe they are up to the task and they can only get better.”
