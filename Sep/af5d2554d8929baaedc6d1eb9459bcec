Two people were on Sunday shot dead by suspected Pokot bandits in Kapedo. Turkana county police boss Ronald Opili said on the phone that the two were a driver and a contractor who was supplying food to schools. Two passengers were also injured. "The suspected armed Pokot bandits ambushed the vehicle travelling to Lokori from Kapedo and killed the driver and a contractor. They were ferrying foodstuff to schools in Turkana East," Opili said. He said officers have launched a manhunt to arrest the perpetrators. In July, Turkana residents blocked trucks from transporting oil from the Ngamia 8 in Lokichar to Mombasa. They held protests over insecurity and the community's share of proceeds from the oil.
