Kenya Simbas’ assistant coach Murray Roulston is back in the country after resigning in July.
Roulston had quit citing lack of payment and other unfulfilled promises from the Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) but returned and held his first training session with the Simbas on Monday at the RFUEA grounds.
Sources close to the New Zealand coach, hinted that Roulston has already been paid and will be keen to ensure Simbas qualify for the World Cup next year in Japan.
Roulston is highly rated by the Kenya Simbas players for introducing an attacking game and has put emphasis on strength and conditioning.
Roulston’s return will be a big boost to the team as they step up preparations for their repechage in November in France. The team has been training four times a week since returning to training early this month.
Speaking yesterday, forwards’ coach Dominique Habimana was happy with the four build-up matches planned for next month. “It’s important we play build up matches to gauge our preparedness and the level of physicality and intensity ahead of the qualifiers,” he said.
The Simbas are due to face British Army on October 17, Namibia on October 21 and Loftus 200, a semi-professional side from South Africa’s Blue Bulls October 28.
Habimana said the squad has been undergoing intense strength and conditioning and will embark on tactical drill this the weekend at the RFUEA ground. “The boys are in good shape and we will now focus on the technical aspects of where we need to improve as a team and look at our weaknesses in the last two matches,” added Habimana.
KRU acting chief executive officer, Sylvia Kamau, said the government is funding the budget for the repechage which is around Sh46 million. “The money will cater for the coaches’ salaries, players allowances and accommodate during the Namibia and Romania build-up matches,” added Kamau.
