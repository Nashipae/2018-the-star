The owner of a matatu from Nawasuku Sacco that rammed into a police car on Sunday along Moi Avenue has been given one week to produce the driver or face prosecution. The driver was captured on camera driving recklessly and dangerously, endangering the lives of other motorists and pedestrians. Nairobi Central police boss Robinson Thuku said the owner of the matatu – KCM 261S – is responsible for employing the driver and he should find and surrender him. “We have given the owner seven days to produce the driver or face persecution,” he told the Star on Wednesday. Thuku said the matatu is still being detained at the police station. On Wednesday three drivers – Joseph Kariuki of KCH 016T, John Mwaura of KCL 8095 and Victor Wanjau of KCR 169C – were charged with recklessness and negligence.
