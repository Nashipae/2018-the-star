Agriculture also accounts for 65 per cent
of Kenya’s export earnings, while also being the main driver of the
non-agricultural economy, including manufacturing, transportation, energy,
healthcare, tourism, entertainment, and construction. The implication is that any change in the
sector has significant effects on the economy. A rise in performance leads to a
better economy, while a dip equally has a direct impact on the country’s
poverty dynamics. So vital is agriculture in the development of Kenya that in
crafting his legacy plan, President Uhuru Kenyatta has identified two pillars
of the Big Four whose realisation is majorly dependent on agriculture. With Kenya being a land of diverse
climatic zones, we are blessed with different agro-economic zones, with the
sugar belt being one of the major ones. The sugar belt traverses at least 18
counties spread across the former Nyanza, Western and Rift Valley provinces and
for decades during its heydays, it was the economic bulwark of the region. It
directly supported over six million Kenyans and contributed massively into the
national government purse. This sector not only supported farmers but
also provided direct income to factory workers, transporters and alongside the
paper industry, it was the nucleus that supported the economies of the towns
spread across the region. In the midst of this prosperity, livelihoods were
good if not enviable. From the good earnings, farmers were able to improve the
quality of sugar production and enhance yields to factories. They could meet
their basic needs and those of their dependents with relative ease. Sadly, however, over the past few decades,
the sector has experienced a decline with the sugar farming particularly
bearing the brunt of this dip. The once thriving sugar factories are now shells
of their former selves and many are faced with threats of closure.
Disillusioned sugar farmers are now resorting to alternative farm use methods,
with many of them no longer seeing any meaningful benefit in farming. The
economies of the sugar belt are now crippled with poverty and despondency being
the order of the day. Several factors can be attributed to this
decline but the foremost reason is the poor sugar governance frameworks, the
disenfranchisement of the farmers and the flooding of the Kenyan market with
imported sugar. With the biggest casualties of this decline being the state-run
factories, which have been driven to their knees, there has been a notable rise
of private sugar milling industries that have however complicated things and
compounded the suffering of the farmers. This is mainly due to rogue business
practices by these industries, which have taken advantage of the weak sugar
laws to flout rules including environmental regulations and fair trade
practices. The concept of sustainable economic
development calls for development processes that not only take care of economic
factors but also consider social and ecological concerns. The basic principle
of sustainable development is that development should not only address the
needs of the present but also protect those of future generations by taking
everyone on board, ensuring good governance and conserving the environment. The sugar sector suffers from the lack of
sustainable economic thinking and this partly explains why it is on decline. In
Busia county for example, evidence has emerged of a private sugar industry that
is operating without complying with environmental regulations and drains waste
into rivers. This leads to contamination, endangering human lives, while also
threatening the fish industry, which is the alternative economic mainstay in
the sugar belt. This is alongside delays in remitting payments due to farmers,
thus creating urgency of implementing laws to ensure compliance and protection
of farmers. With national attention now focusing on
the need to urgently fix the ailing sector, policy efforts must also address
the operation of private industries, which in trying to fill the gap left by
the state-run companies must be compelled to operate within the law, conserve
the environment and respect the farmers, who are the primary players in the industry.  ThKenya boasts of the most diversified
economy in the East and Central Africa, with agriculture as ‘backbone of the
economy’ remaining the biggest contributor. The Food and Agriculture
Organization notes that agriculture contributes 26 per cent to Kenya’s gross
domestic product, and employs over 40 per cent of the Kenyan population, over
70 per cent of that being in the rural areas. Agriculture also accounts for 65 per cent
of Kenya’s export earnings, while also being the main driver of the
non-agricultural economy, including manufacturing, transportation, energy,
healthcare, tourism, entertainment, and construction. The implication is that any change in the
