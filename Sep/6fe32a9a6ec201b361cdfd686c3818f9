Baringo women and youth have been urged to abandon backward culture and own their own livestock to create wealth.Woman Representative Gladwel Cheruiyot on Saturday said wealth creation must not be left for men alone. In December, the county will hold the famous Kimalel Goat Auction held annually in Marigat, Baringo South. “For a very long time, the goat auction has been regarded a preserve business for men. It is high time women and youth know it is a free market for all,” Cheruiyot said duringa youth and women empowerment training at the Kenya School of Government in Kabarnet town. Last year, Sh25 million was raised during the auction. DP William Ruto sold 2,080 goats in record 15 minutes. The DP and President Uhuru Kenyatta paid Sh12 million for 1,000 goats — each selling for Sh12,000. Cheruiyot urged individuals or groups of youth and women to present their goats to the market and sell during the auction. She wants at least 30 per cent reserved
for women and the youth. “Nowadays even a man can sell vegetables in the market.There’s nothing wrong with that,” the lawmaker said.
