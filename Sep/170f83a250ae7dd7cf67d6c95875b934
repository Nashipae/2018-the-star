Residents of Nalondo shopping centre in Kabuchai, Bungoma, have decried rising insecurity in the area in the past two months. They took to the street on Tuesday and engaged the police in running battles. The protesters who blocked and lit tyres on the Sikata-Kimilili Road lit tyres blamed the police for laxity. Officers from Nalondo police post shot in the air to disperse the furious protesters. They were demanded that Governor Wycliffe Wangamati tours the area and addresses the issue. At the weekend, armed thugs broke into two shops and a church where they stole items of unknown value. Resident Simiyu Mutaki told journalists there is an increase in crime. He said thugs strike in the wee hours of the night. They steal from shops, homes, and drive away animals. Mutaki said there is laxity by law enforcers because a police post is a few meters behind the shopping centre. "We have a feeling criminals are liaising with police to terrorise residents," he said. Mutaki appealed to Bungoma county commissioner James Kiandaa to transfer all officers at Nalondo station who have overstayed. Shopkeeper Augustine Wanyama said when thugs attack residents the police are slow to respond. "We are living in fear. Crime is high especially during the weekend. We want security improved," he said. Bungoma deputy governor Charles Ngome went to the area and appealed for calm. He said lazy cops who have overstayed will be moved to other stations. Click here the latest political news
