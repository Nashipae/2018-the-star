Some 18,000 ownership documents of members of the troubled Embakasi Ranching Company are clean. The Lands ministry finished verification of the documents yesterday following a two-day extension. The exercise was to run from August 30 to September 3 as ordered by Lands CS Faridah Karoney. On May 30 President Uhuru Kenyatta directed the ministry and ranchâ€™s management to ensure all the shareholders get their title deeds in three months. The company has been held hostage by cartels, including influential and wealthy politicians who evict genuine landowners and allocating the parcels to tycoons. The ownership of 15,000 plots is in contention due to multiple registrations. About 35,000 plots are at the centre of the ownership controversy.
