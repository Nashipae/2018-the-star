The government has allayed fears of increased electricity costs owing to the 16% fuel tax that took effect last Saturday. Energy Principal Secretary Joseph Njoroge told a Senate committee on Wednesday the government will start harnessing wind power at Suswa - Loyangalani in the next 10 days. "Even though there is VAT on fuels, the silver cloud is the wind which will help the situation," said Njoroge. The PS also noted that more than 3.4 million Kenya Power subscribers will spend a maximum of Sh180 per month in the new tariffs. Each unit will cost Sh17.59 in the new tariff. "If you consume around one unit, you will pay only Sh17.59," Njoroge said. The PS had appeared before the Senate Energy Committee chaired by Nyeri senator Ephraim Maina.
