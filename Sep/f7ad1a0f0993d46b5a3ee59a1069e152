There was drama at the China Global Television Network Africa headquarters in Nairobi when police raided the station and rounded off foreign staff. Plainclothes officers stormed the offices around 1 pm on Wednesday in an operation believed to be targeting illegal immigrants without work permits. The company said police arrested 13 workers, eight are from CGTN. They were, however, released after verification of their documents. "They all have legal documents and have been released," read a statement. A police officer, not authorised to speak to media, confirmed the incident. He said they were working with officers from the Immigration Department. He said they have released the staff from the media house since they all had proper documents. A video captured the officers harassing the staff and demanding work permits. One Chinese woman accused an officer of assaulting her. "Why would he hit a woman," she's heard lamenting in the video.
