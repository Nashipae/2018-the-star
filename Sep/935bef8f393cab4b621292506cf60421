Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri has told traders to sell a 2kg packet of maize flour at Sh75. He said the price of maize has gone down and that of flour should drop as well. Kiunjuri spoke on Saturday at Gitoro Showground, Imenti North constituency, during the 5th Annual Farmers' Field Day. "The price of maize dictates the price of flour. Traders who sell flour for more than Sh75 are corrupt, they are not different from people implicated in graft," the CS said. Kiunjuri said traders are using inflation as an excuse to steal from Kenyans. At the sameÂ time, he warned unscrupulous traders who make low quality feeds for animals that their days are numbered. "We can't allow people to make money by risking the lives of Kenyans," Kiunjuri said. Kiunjuri praised farmers for their improved attendance of this year's field day. At least 20,000 farmers attended the event this year compared to 16,000 last year. The CS said the government will continue supporting Meru dairy farmers who have been given the highest number of milk coolers. "We have given out 16 milk coolers to farmers and will add six more. We will bring grass that will be planted on 100 acres," Kiunjuri said. Click here for the latest political stories
