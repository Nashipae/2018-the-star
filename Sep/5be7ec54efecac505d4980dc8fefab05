Machakos governor Alfred Mutua has ordered 30 county employees sent on compulsory leave over alleged corruption to present themselves for a lifestyle audit. The officers, suspended for three months last Friday, have been directed to present their documents, in person, to adviser on anti-corruption matters Hyslop Ipu at his county headquarters office today. They were working in Mavoko sub county in the lands registry, revenue collection and enforcement departments. The officers should avail several documents, including their IDs and those of their spouses. They should also present a copy of their Pin certificate and that of their spouses. The suspended officers must also provide their bank details, a list of all their assets and those of their partners. Other requirements include a list of the businesses they operate and their spouses, plus copies of their wealth declaration forms — current and previous for the last five years. Suspending the officers on Friday, Mutua also urged developers whose development plan approvals are irregular to regularise them. “This includes those who have constructed or are constructing without building plan approvals. This ‘no penalty window’ will expire on September 30,” he said. Mutua warned that non-compliance will result in, among other actions, demolition of buildings and criminal charges being instituted against offenders. “Special desks for compliance will be open from September 10 [today] in all county building approval offices,” he said. The governor said in Mavoko subcounty, a new team will be in place from today to continue with all approval work.
