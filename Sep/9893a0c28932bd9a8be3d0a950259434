Suspended IEBC CEO Ezra Chiloba has defended his PA who was arrested for allegedly sneaking out procurement files from the commission's offices. Abednego Ominde and finance director Agatha Wahome were arrested at the Anniversary Towers basement parking on grounds they were sneaking out 14 files. But Chiloba said the officers were preparing the documents ahead of his return from his five-month suspension which ends this Friday. "I am made to understand that the officer was going to run copies of the relevant documents in preparation for my return to work on September 14, 2018," Chiloba said in a statement. He said Chairman Wafula Chebukati wrote to him on August 31 on two audit reports and a show cause letter he was to respond to within seven days. Chiloba was sent home to allow the completion of the audit on procurements in relation to the 2017 General Election. "I personally requested copies of the relevant documents to be ready on my return to work," he said adding that the officers should not be victimised for doing their job. However, in his response, Chebukati said the CEO remains on
suspension until the issues raised in his show cause letter are
addressed. "The August 29 show cause letter to Chiloba extended
suspension until finalisation of the disciplinary proceedings. The
allegation of resuming office is misleading," the chair said on Twitter. The CEO said he requested for the files so as to respond adequately to the audit queries since he was the accounting officer during the said expenditure period. "This is not unusual and therefore the officers should not be victimized for doing what they are supposed to do in good faith." "I believe that after the 2017 elections and the challenges experienced, it is important for the country to focus on major issues that stabilise and sustain our electoral process," Chiloba said.
