European Union trade chief
Cecilia Malmstrom met her US counterpart for the first time on
Monday since President Donald Trump dropped his threat to impose
tariffs on EU cars, saying they had discussed how to achieve
concrete results soon. Malmstrom hosted United States Trade Representative Robert
Lighthizer in Brussels on Monday. The two are set to meet again
at the end of September. Malmstrom, who is the European Trade Commissioner, described
the meeting as a first opportunity to follow through on an
agreement between Trump and European Commission President
Jean-Claude Juncker two months ago. Lighthizer's office described the talks as constructive,
adding that experts would meet in October to identify tariff and
non-tariff barriers that could be cut, with the trade chiefs
following that up in November to finalise certain results. "Specifically, we hope for an early harvest in the area of
technical barriers to trade," the US Trade Representative's
office statement said. Trump agreed with Juncker in July to refrain from imposing
tariffs on EU cars while the two sides launched discussions to
remove tariffs on non-auto industrial products. A working group, headed by the two trade chiefs, has also
been charged with finding ways to cut tariffs, boost US
liquefied natural gas exports and to reform the World Trade
Organisation. "We discussed how to move forward and identify priorities on
both sides and how to achieve concrete results in the short to
medium term," Malmstrom wrote. "Lots of work remains this
autumn, our services will be in close contact in the coming
weeks." Malmstrom said last month that the easing of trade tensions
between the two partners had not put to rest "profound
disagreements" on trade policy. She also said then that the EU would be willing to reduce
its car tariffs to zero if the United States did the same. Trump rejected the idea as "not good enough", adding that EU
consumers simply tended to buy European rather than American
cars.
