Deputy President William Ruto on Friday told his critics to stop panicking about the 2022 presidential race, saying it is too early. The DP wondered why some people were complaining while others were criticising his efforts, yet the time for politics is still far. Ruto, who was on his second day of his five-day tour of the Coast region, led a delegation of MPs, woman reps and senators from the region to open key development projects. He told off those who are complaining about his presidential ambitions and told them to wait for the right time. “People should stop panicking; politics is not ready. Time for politics is not yet; we are developing schools, electricity, issuing tittle deeds, time for politics is not yet, relax,” he said. Ruto said he has agreed to form a union with Coast leaders geared at ending political, regional and ethnic differences in the region that have for long been an opposition stronghold. Once political rivals agreed to work together with those who were elected in ODM during the 2017 campaigns. In Malindi constituency, Kilifi county, the DP commissioned a Sh2.3 billion bridge at Baricho and a 12km road. Later, he commissioned Shomani Girls High School initiated by Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa.
