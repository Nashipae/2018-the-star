Telkom women’s hockey team are keen to reclaim the 2018 African Cup Clubs Championship set for December 17-24 in Abuja, Nigeria. The 20-time national champions relinquished their title to stubborn Ghana Revenue Authority after succumbing to a 1-0 defeat early this year in Accra. Telkom coach Jos Openda admitted that poor delivery of short corners cost them the African title in the last event and they are now working on this to sharpen their attacking department “ Truth be told, we were heart broken when we lost to Ghana Revenue Authority early this year and we are not ready to lose again especially now that the event will be staged in West Africa again. We are exhausting every department but we are keen on conversations,” said Openda. He added: “We have upped our training at the City Park Stadium and we now practice fours days in a week thus —Tuesday, Thursday, Friday (evening) and Sunday (morning). All this is a prove that we will be going all the way to reclaim the title. I am working with upcoming players who are proving to be a force to reckon with and who knows two or three of them might just make their debut at the club championship.” At the same time, the tactician said they are also focusing on the local national league to ensure they defend it a record 21 times. “Telkom remain unbeaten in the last eight matches and we want to guard the record going forward. We welcome the stiff competition from our opponents in the league as that will make it more interesting and tough,” noted Openda. He revealed that the outfit will be fielding a team in the second tier next season. “We will be having two teams come next year. The senior team that will continue participating in Premier League and the junior who will play in the Super League. The junior side will at the same time act as the feeder programme,” he added.
