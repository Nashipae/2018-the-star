Two Nyeri journalists were on Monday detained at Mukurweini police station for about an hour while pursuing a story. The two went to cover a story of a man arrested for wearing a T-shirt with an anti-DP William Ruto slogan. Lydiah Nyawira of Standard and Irene Mugo of Nation were arrested as they interviewed the man's kin. Albert Nderitu, 21, a student of Mukurweini TTI was arrested on Sunday after he attended an event in which the DP was the chief guest. The T-shirt with "Kieleweke/Big4First" inscriptions saw him earn some time in the police cell before his release on Monday. Nderitu was arrested shortly after Ruto arrived for the church fundraiser at Gikondi. No charges were preferred against him. According to Irene, they were interviewing the man's kin when police arrested them claiming they had not sought their permission. "Police ordered us to surrender all our equipment and delete everything that we had recorded during the interview," she said. "They wanted to lock us up in the police cells but we obliged to their order and deleted the interview hence secured our release." Click here for the latest political news
