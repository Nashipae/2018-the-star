An 11-year-old girl drowned on Friday after she fell in a river she was sent by her school headteacher to fetch water from. According to family members, the errand was as a result of the child's failure to carry water from home when she went back to school for afternoon lessons. The headteacher of Lailuba Primary school located in Buuri location, Muthaara Ward of Tigania East sent her and other pupils to river Bwethumara, one kilometre away from the school. The child's uncle, Kubai Mamira told the Star his niece slid accidentallyÂ and drowned into the river. He said efforts by her colleagues to save her from drowning were futile. They screamed for help but it was too late. Mamira called on governor Kiraitu Murungi and MP Gichunge Kabeabea to fill tanks located in different schools in the region. "She was in class two. She is my younger brother's daughter. I can't set blame on teachers. The children are used to go and fetch water there. There is a 10,000 tank in the School which were brought by former governor Peter Munya. They are empty. " Mamira said. Deputy head teacher, Martha Turibu told the Star, the children only come with water when required to do so after going for lunch for watering the classes due to dust.
