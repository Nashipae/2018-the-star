King of the jungle or not, one sheepish lion got more than he bargained for after a proud lioness gave him a good telling off following a mating session. Photographs show the lioness roaring at her male counterpart who looks shocked by her displeasure. The dramatic images, captured by Shayne McGuire during a visit to the Massai Mara in Kenya, show the lion cowering in fear of the lioness. Caught off guard, he stares at her sheepishly before returning back to his usual self and yelling back. This is not the first time a lion has been on the receiving end of a furious lioness. In January, George Hart captured an angry lioness roaring into the face of the lion in the Central Serengeti, Tanzania during his first ever African safari. The lion was spotted cowering away in fear and covering his face with his paw during the fierce lovers' tiff. In July, game reserve manager, Giuseppe D'amico, spotted an enraged lioness slapping her partner across the face on the green plains of Tanzania in the Ndutu area. The fighting pair were also seen baring their teeth at each other during the domestic dispute.
