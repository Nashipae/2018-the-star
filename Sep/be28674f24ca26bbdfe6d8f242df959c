Chemelil Sugar invited more relegation pressure on themselves after falling 1-0 to a visiting Posta Rangers side at the Chemelil Complex yesterday. Prior to the match, both teams were seeking to redeem themselves from midweek losses where the hosts succumbed 2-0 to Tusker while Rangers were humbled 1-0 by Sofapaka. The millers failed to capitalise on home advantage and were in turn punished by Calvin Odongoâ€™s first half freekick which proved the difference between the two sides at the final whistle. Chemelil were stable in the first leg where they finished ninth but have paid heavily for letting go their senior players who mostly decamped to the neighbouring Sony Sugar in June and have found themselves battling relegation alongside Wazito and Thika United. A change of guard at the helm, where former Kenyan international Francis Baraza took over from assistant coach Charles Odera, has done little to end the skid and now the club faces uncertainty in remaining in the top flight as they sit 16th with 28 points. With the bottom two sides set for automatic relegation to the National Super League, a third from bottom finish by Chemelil will still see them battle to keep their top flight status in a SPL/FKF playoff against the team which will finish third in the NSL. On the other hand, the win for Rangers saw them end their two-game winless run. The mailmen scaled two places high to sit 10th with 37 points.
