Police raided a home a Naivasha estate said to be the main distribution point of bhang in the lakeside town. Officers drawn from all contingents raided Kayole estate along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway following a tip-off from wananchi of a woman selling bhang in large quantities. The officers recovered 11 sacks of the drug worth Sh3.5 million that had been packaged, ready for the market. During the raid, the suspect is said to have escaped through the back door. The officers have launched a manhunt. Naivasha deputy OCPD John Kwasasaid cases of bhang use had been on the rise, with many suspects already arrested. He said they were informed of a woman selling the drug in large quantities and decided to raid the homestead. Kwasa said the woman is believed to be distributing the drugs to various towns, including Gilgil, Mai Mahiu and adjacent areas. Addressing the press at Naivasha police station, Kwasa termed the discovery a major win in the war on drugs and alcohol abuse. “We understand she operates within some parts of Naivasha, Kiambu and Nairobi, but we are tracking her down,” he said. Kwasa described the woman as an accomplished peddler who for years had thrived on engaging in the outlawed business. He said police were also looking for her accomplices who assisted her in ferrying the drug to other major towns. “It’s a cartel that we are keen on dismantling and bringing to book,” he said.
