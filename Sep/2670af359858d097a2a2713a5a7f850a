Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati has moved to quell tension with his MCA's after they threatened to impeach him. On Thursday, Wangamati met the assembly members and both parties signed a MoU on how to run the county affairs. The MCA's have been accusing the governor of incompetence, abuse of office and high handedness. “Today we had a very fruitful discussion with the ward representatives and I think we have ironed out some thorny issues for the sake of moving the county forward,” Mangamati said. On Wednesday, the MCAs mobilised residents and held demonstrations in Bungoma town. They also collected signatures to impeach the governor with 52 members supporting the plan.

Other grievances by the MCAs against the governor were that some of his CECs are incompetent and sleeping on their job. “We are telling you to tame your staff, they have failed the integrity test expected of public officers, they do nothing apart from abusing people on social media,” an MCA from Kabuchai said. The two sides agreed that projects of the 2017/2018 financial year that had been awarded should commence immediately apart from those with procurement queries. Majority and Minority leaders confirmed that they had agreed with the Governor on a range of issues which they believe will be sorted within two weeks.
