Poor households will feel the pinch of higher Kerosene prices following a Sh10 increase per litre as new levy takes effect. Yesterday, President Uhuru Kenyatta signed into law the Finance Bill 2018 that will see Value Added Tax on petroleum products increase by eight per cent. In a move to implement the new law, Energy Regulatory Commission announced that Super petrol and Diesel prices in Nairobi will decrease by Sh8.80 and Sh7.35 respectively, while that of Kerosene will go up by Sh10.71. This will see Kerosene retail at Sh108.41 in Nairobi , Sh110.09 in Eldoret and Sh105.78 in Mombasa, up from Sh97.70 , Sh99.5 and Sh94.90 respectively until October 14. The higher kerosene tax will hit hard poor homes that rely on it to power cooking stoves and lantern lamps . Going by latest Kenya National Bureau of Statistics 2015/2016 Household Survey, at least 1.67 million households use Kerosene as a main source of cooking fuel. A further 1.79 million households rely on it as a main source of lighting. An analysis of data from ERC shows that an Sh18 anti-adulteration levy on Kerosene is the main contributor of the high cost. The excise duty on Kerosene is Sh10.31, import declaration fee is Sh1.09 while Sh5.72 is VAT. Total taxes and levies on Kerosene amount to Sh36.61 which is 34 per cent of the new cost. The high anti-adulteration levy explains government's plan to match the cost of Kerosene to that of Diesel in fight against fuel adulteration. “The difference in the rates applicable to these two petroleum products has led to adulteration of the fuel products resulting in loss of excise duty revenue to the Exchequer,” Treasury CS Henry Rotich said in his 2018/2019 budget speech. He proposed harmonization of the excise duty applicable on illuminating kerosene to Sh10,305 per 1,000 litre in order to reduce the incidences of adulteration of fuel. Data from Petroleum Institute of East Africa shows that upto 75 per cent of the 33 million litres of kerosene reported to be consumed monthly is used to contaminate diesel and petrol. “This means the Kenya Revenue Authority loses Sh34 billion from tax evasion on a monthly basis,” PIEA said in a June statement. While the poor household suffer the most, motorist will get reprieve from the high cost of fuel as Super petrol has decreased from Sh125.59 to Sh116.79 in Nairobi. Diesel has also go down from Sh 115.47 to Sh108.12. In Mombasa, Super Petrol Prices have reduced from Sh122.76 to Sh114.15, diesel has been cut by Sh9.97 to Sh105.50, while diesel cost has reduced to Sh105.78 from Sh112.65.
