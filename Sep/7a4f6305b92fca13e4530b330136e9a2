Read: How I was hired to kill Idriss Mukhtar - David Mwai Aden, a businessman, in a certificate of urgency filed by lawyer Cliff Ombeta, says during the time he has been in police custody he has been ferried to various places by detectives. In process he has been beaten, tortured and treated in an inhumane, degrading and cruel manner in an attempt to make him sign a confession, he says. “The applicant is now in urgent need of medical attention because the aforementioned torture has [led] to swelling of his private parts and chest,” reads his affidavit. But the DCI, through sergeant Peter Kanagi, who is one of the investigators, denied torturing Aden. They say Aden’s family and advocates did not complaint of any torture to the OCS Gigiri police station when they visited him in the cells. “The applicant’s allegations of torture and inhumane treatment is an afterthought geared to subvert the course of justice being in mind the victim of the investigations is in critical condition fighting for his life,” Kanagi says. Justice Jessie Lessit directed the suspects lawyer’s to serve the Director of Public Prosecutions with their application for bail pending hearing on September 11.
