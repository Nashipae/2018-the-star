Hapless Swamibapa once again crumbled when the situation demanded for their batsmen to turn up at Peponi School on Sunday. A poor start against a clinical bowling line-up cost the top of the bill match against Stray Lions in the absence of their most prolific batsman—Alex Obanda. Winning the toss, Stray Lions posted 232 before riding to a 91 runs win after bowling out Swamibapa for 141 with 65 balls to spare. Things were going Stray Lions way early in the match when openers the posted 101 for 2 in 25 overs.

This came up after they had lost Sandip Kunchikor on 40 off 41 balls with the board on 53 from 11.4 overs. Shem Ngoche and Abhijit Velma then showcased a cameo innings by clubbing 35 and 32 not out respectively as the hosts registered a score of 232 for 8. Emmanuel Bundi was the pick of Swamibapa bowlers with 3 for 47 from nine overs which included top scorer Vadada in the 43rd over. Naman Patel was the most expensive bowler as he allowed 36 runs in five overs for one wicket. In reply, Swamibapa were two down for 18 after Naman Patel and Gurdeep Singh returned to the pavilion for a duck and 11 respectively to Nikhil Date. The two fell inside the first five overs before bowler turned batsman James Ngoche and Deepak Pal tried to salvage some pride for the visiting team with a third wicket stand of 39 in 9.4 overs. Following the exit of Pal on 26, Ngoche and skipper Maurice Ouma could only get the scores to 74. However, Ouma left the crease scoring 10 runs as he got out, facing Kunchikor.
