The management style of Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko is becoming unacceptably chaotic. On Monday he sacked the superintendent and the Pumwani Hospital board because 11 dead babies were kept in a bag because there is no mortuary. But the county controls the hospital so it is the governor's fault if facilities were inadequate. These haphazard publicity stunts are typical of Sonko's management style. He needs to become more mature. He has suspended many top county officials and their replacements are still acting. Yet the County Public Service Board should be the one sacking staff. The governor is only entitled to replace his 12 county executives, and indeed, many have been suspended or sacked. There is still no deputy governor because Sonko has only proposed preposterous names to fill the vacancy. Finally, the seat of Nairobi government is now in Machakos, the governor's home town, where most official meetings take place. Nairobi is the capital of Kenya and represents more than 50 per cent of the economy. It deserves better than this.
