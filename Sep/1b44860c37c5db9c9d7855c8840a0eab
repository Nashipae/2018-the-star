President Uhuru Kenyatta will host a Jubilee Parliamentary Group meeting on Tuesday morning at State House over the fuel tax row. The President will be seeking to mobilise the MPs to support his proposed 8 per cent tax on petroleum products from the current 16 per cent. “Mheshimiwa please note that we will hold a Parliamentary Group Meeting on Tuesday, September 18, 2018, at State House Nairobi at 8:00 am sharp,” an invitation text by Majority leader Aden Duale read. Uhuru wants Jubilee MPs to capitalise on three special sittings on Tuesday and Thursday to pass his proposal so that he can sign the bill into law before he jets out of the country on Friday to attend the UN General Assembly in New York. MPs were recalled from recess for the special sitting. National Assembly Minority leader John Mbadi has downplayed the 50 per cent cut in fuel VAT, saying it is "still disastrous to the ordinary Kenyan". The Suba South MP said they have also called for a NASA Parliamentary Group meeting on Tuesday to deliberate on the same. “It will be a tough session at State House but we believe the MPs will understand the economic challenges the country is facing at hand to endorse Uhuru’s proposal,” a Jubilee top official said.
