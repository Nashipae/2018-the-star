Mandera county is committed to providing a conducive environment for residents, Trade executive Abdiaziz Sheikh has said. Speaking during the opening  ceremony of the renovated Rhamu market on Saturday, Abdaziz, said the county is committed to empowering small-scale traders. The market closed in 2013 following clan skirmishes. The residents have on many occasions requested the county to renovate the market. Abdiaziz said the local economy could only be grown by residents themselves, adding the county will continue empowering the youth, women’s groups and people living with disabilities to enable them do businesses. He said 45 new stalls have  been constructed and 58 renovated, which he said will be reallocated to the previous occupants. Abdiaziz thanked the security apparatus for working round the clock to ensure security is enhanced across the county, which is prone to attacks. Clan clashes that occurred two years ago led to many deaths and property was destroyed. The Shabaab menace has remained a thorn in the flesh of residents. “There is no meaningful development that can be achieved in an insecure environment. We are calling on all to ensure that we work with the security apparatus in place to keep the militants away,” Abdiaziz said. Mohamed Abdi, a resident and businessman, thanked the county for responding to their needs. Governor Ali Roba is expected to attend the grand reopening of the market in Rhamu town later this month.
