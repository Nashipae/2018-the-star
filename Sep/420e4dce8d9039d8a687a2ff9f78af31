Tourism and wildlife CS Najib Balala has promised to help women in Samburu county with marketing their Ushanga products. Balala also pledged to help the self-help groups to undergo further training on producing the producst. "The products bring income in our country as well as generate foreign revenue. We need to transform it to another level," he said. Balala spoke on Sunday after he flagged off a camel race in Samburu county. The CS said the training will help the women to produce high quality products to make them marketable to foreign markets. "We want all Kenyans to be represented everywhere. That is very important," Balala said. He revealed that a place has been allocated for the women at the Bomas of Kenya where they can showcase their products to local and international tourists. Balala said that with value addition in the processing of the products, Kenya's tourism epicenter will shift from the predominant tourism ecosystem of the coastal region to other other areas. "The future of tourism will not only be in Mombasa or the Mara but also in the northern part of Kenya." Balala encouraged communities in the northern region to maintain peace if his vision was to become true. "If there is no peace, then there is no tourism in Samburu. Security is the first thing that will encourage our tourism. Throw the box and think otherwise and tell us what is going to happen in the next years because an event like this is supposed to be an international event," Balala said.
