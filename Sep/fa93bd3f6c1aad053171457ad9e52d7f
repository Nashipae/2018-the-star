It’s been a brutal bear market for crypto. Since peaking in early January, the entire space has lost around $640 billion. Every time there’s been a brief rally it’s been followed up by relentless selling. [Bloomberg] According to OnChainFX, a site that tracks cryptocurrencies, only one coin has seen major gains over the last 30 days, and it happens to be the one that’s the biggest joke of all: Dogecoin. The coin, which was introduced in 2013 as a play on the once popular Doge meme, has surged over 160 percent in about a month. The price of oil continues to press higher with WTI Crude trading just beneath $70.00 a barrel. Emerging and Frontier Markets have of course been getting creamed for a few weeks now.

I am of the view in this new less benign environment it is in fact imperative to keep the facility in place. The Bear is clawing the Equity markets now.
