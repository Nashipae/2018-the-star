Nairobi nominated MCA Mary Njambi, who was left with watery eyes after a confrontation with Nairobi speaker Beatrice Elachi, has said her vision for 2022 is clear. Speaking to Word Is, the Makadara-based legislator said she is not bothered by the newly acquired fame, and is in fact eyeing Nairobi woman representative Esther Passaris’ seat. Njambi was at the heart of efforts to evict Elachi. In a now viral video, she is heard accusing Elachi of pepper-spraying her and her colleagues after they stormed her office on September 10. “How can you be a speaker na unawekea MCA wako mapiripiri kwa macho... Si hiyo ni kirimino (How can you be a speaker and spray pepper in your MCA’s eyes. Isn’t that criminal)?” she asks. But Njambi denies any wrongdoing in the incident, saying she was the victim. “Navile mnanichapa nyinyi watu wa media, badala nyinyi mnitetee na mliona vile nilipigwa na pilipili, nyinyi mnaona nikama mimi nilikosea,” she said. “I did not expect it to go viral but I actually do not care that much. None of my family members has asked about the video but for those who have watched it, they laughed and moved on.” Njambi, a single mother of two, said she helps clean the city and ensures schoolchildren do not miss school for lack of fees or uniform. “I am a hard worker and it’s clearly illustrated by the fact that I have been nominated twice,” she said. “Honestly, I think I will be vying for the woman representative seat come 2022. I have been in the forefront of fighting for women and the youth. One thing, I am a mobiliser who oversees the ‘Ng’arisha Jiji’ initiative. Another thing I pride myself in is that I ensure children don’t miss school by using my own money and also sourcing for bursaries and scholarships.”
