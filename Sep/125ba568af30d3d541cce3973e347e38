The culture in which we operate determines our creativity. The customs, beliefs and attitudes of our family, community or nation influence our ability to generate new ideas. Given the importance of creativity for driving innovation in corporations and economy, understanding the culture-creativity relationship is essential. In the cultures where people are used to ideas deviating from the norm, individuals or groups are more capable of generating unconventional solutions. Creativity in such societies epitomises success and dynamism. There is greater intellectual independence, openness and freedom. In contrast, in the cultures that put emphasis on people fitting well in the social structures, maintaining status quo and conforming to collective norms, people’s creativity is limited. There is an emphasis on tradition, conservatism and hierarchy. A work environment is rigid and bureaucratic. Creativity is viewed negatively as ‘idleness’, ‘luxury’, or even a ‘destruction’. A recent large-scale cross-cultural study involving 36 cultures discovered that people living in Europe and America are generally more “open to new experience”, the trait that has been repeatedly evidenced to creativity, than those living in Asia and Africa (Allik and McCrae, 2004 )[1]. “People from European and American cultures appear to be outgoing, open to new experience and antagonistic, whereas people from Asian and African cultures are introverted, traditional and compliant. There is a trend for Euro-American cultures to be higher in postmaterialistic values, such as self-actualisation. They are also generally wealthier, the quality of life is higher and people are more satisfied with their lives.” No matter how creative people are, they will not accomplish a breakthrough unless their culture supports their creative potential. Culture shapes creativity. But the opposite is also true: creativity shapes culture. Creative individuals who break the clutches of tradition change values and attitudes. New solutions can bring new problems, which can unnerve and unsettle, but evolution cannot be ignored. If in the past societies could survive for hundreds of years mostly unchanged, today, because of the technological advances, no culture can exist in isolation or turn to ‘simpler times’. Cultures that wish to survive and progress should encourage as much creativity as possible and increase the number of creative people. Instead of overemphasising the training of basic skills, education systems need to focus on developing creativity: fostering “flexibility, openness for the new, the ability to adapt, to see new ways of doing things, and the courage to face the unexpected” (Cropley, 2001m )[2], as well as teaching the creativity ethics to ensure that idea-generation goes hand in hand with a sense of the public good. Art-based programmes should be introduced across educational fields, as they play a central role in stimulating creativity (EU, 2009 )[3]. The process of generating unique ideas needs to be experienced from the early years. Children who are encouraged to be creative grow imaginative and effective. If children are made to follow stereotypes, they gather information by imitating others rather than relying on their own explorations, and lack the effective capacity to solve problems and tolerate people’s differences. Creativity does not exist in a vacuum. It is a product of the interaction of individuals and their culture. Every culture has a wealth of potentially creative people and ideas that need to be harnessed to deliver better ways of living and working. The creativity-culture dynamics lie at the heart of the development of new economic and social paradigms. “The culture we create will determine our fate.” (Csikszentmihaly, 1997 )[4]  Alla Tkachuk is the founder of MASK, mobileartschoolinkenya.org  __________________________________ [1] Allik J., McCrae R., Toward A Geography of Personality Traits, Journal of Cross-Cultural Phycology, Vol. 35, 2004 [2] Cropley A.
