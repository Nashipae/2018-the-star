Two suspects in the kidnapping and killing of Githongo law court magistrate Caroline Kemei's daughter have been detained for ten days. Former Prisons warder Benson Marangu and Francis Otundo will remain in police custody after the court granted the prosecution ten days for further investigations. Meru chief magistrate Hannah Ndung'u ordered the accused to be detained as per the request by the Director of Public Prosecution. "Due to the nature or complex and public interest of this matter, I grant the DCI ten days to complete investigations," the magistrate ordered. The decision was taken in light of the submission by State counsel Harrison Kiarie. The suspects were represented by lawyer Eliud Mutuma. DPP argued that they needed to have results from the postrmortem on Maribel Kapolon saying the information will be of help to the case. The autopsy on the 9-year-old girl's body which was found at Gitoro forest on Sunday, September 16 was to be conducted on Thursday. She will be buried on September 22 at Kipkaren in Turbo, Uasin Gishu county. Read: Ex-prison officer arrested over death of magistrate's daughter Click here for the latest political news
