Marijuana is ruining the lives of young people in Embu and its use is causing rape, murders and incest, Woman Representative Jane Wanjuki said yesterday. She opposed proposals by Kibra MP Ken Okoth to have marijuana legalised, saying that would open the floodgates for social ills across the country. Her remarks come days after Gender, Children and Social Services executive Joan Mwende warned that drug abuse has been on the rise among primary and secondary schoolchildren. Mwende said many children smoke marijuana and chew miraa leaves, and Mbeere subcounty is worst hit. Wanjuki said marijuana is addictive and Okoth’s bill must be blocked if Kenya is to protect its future generations. “I’m surprised an honourable MP of Okoth’s status can come up with such a bill,” she said, adding she will vote against it when tabled in Parliament. Okoth has proposed creation of a body to regulate growth, sale and use of marijuana to ensure it is not misused.  He says it will have medical and financial significance to Kenyans and contribute to economic growth. But Wanjuki said there is no way anybody who values humanity can support the bill. Legislators have a moral duty to protect youths and children, she said.
