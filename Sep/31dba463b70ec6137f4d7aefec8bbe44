Nairobi county speaker Beatrice Elachi was on Thursday reinstated by the High Court just hours after MCA's impeached herÂ citing "gross misconduct". Elachi speedily moved to court and obtained an order to reverse the impeachment. Labour Relations Court judge Maureen Onyango ordered Elachi to continue with her duties pending the hearing of her case on September 11. "A conservatory order is hereby issued prohibiting the respondents, their members or any person acting on their behalf or direction from removing the petitioner as Nairobi City County Speaker, appointing a new nominee, for approval by the Nairobi City Assembly of appointment to the office of the Speaker of Nairobi County Assembly pending the inter partes application hearing," the court said. Earlier, the MCAs unanimously teamed up to impeach the Speaker whom they accused of abuse of office, violating the Constitution and sabotaging assembly operations. Some 103 Ward reps supported her removal, two opposed while two others abstained from voting. Another two members were absent in the House during the vote. "Her actions and omissions have caused embarrassment and brought the office of the speaker into disrepute, this assembly resolves to sanction," the mover of the motion Waithaka MCA Antony Kiragu said. The Court also barred the Nairobi county public service board and the county assembly who are listed as the respondents from interfering with Elachi's execution of her duties. It directed Elachi to file her petition on or before Friday. Read: Why Nairobi Speaker Beatrice Elachi has been impeached Click here for the latest political news
