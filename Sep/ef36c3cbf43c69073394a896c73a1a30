Former Mumias Sugar Company management will next week appear before a parliamentary team to shed light on the collapse of the miller. National Assembly’s Committee on Implementation vice chairman Godfrey Osotsi said the team will revisit the collapse of Mumias and other local millers whose problems could be traced to the acts of omission and commission of former managers. The committee is chaired by Narok North Moitalel ole Kenta. Among those to appear before the committee include former Nairobi governor Evans Kidero, who served as the managing director for several years, before joining politics. The committee will also invite KPMG, the audit firm whose report implicated Kidero, his successor Peter Kebati, former business development manager Peter Hongo, former commercial director Paul Murgor among other top officials in the Mumias woes. “We will meet the board of Mumias over the fishy deals that led to the collapse of the mill,” Osotsi said.

On Friday, Mumias Sugar Company’s problems deepened after its managers were served with a notice from auctioneers demanding Sh13.4 million awarded by a court in Kisumu to a former employee – Pamela Lutta. Lutta had gone to court over wrongful dismissal. She served as director of marketing and corporate affairs before rising to head commercial sales in 2014.
