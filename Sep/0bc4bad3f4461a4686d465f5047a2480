Chief Justice David Maraga has lauded President Uhuru Kenyatta for reviewing the judiciary's budget. Maraga on Monday said while the Judiciary strives to maintain its independence, it is ready to partner with the other investigative agencies to clear a backlog of corruption cases. He spoke in Kahawa during the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of a criminal court. The CJ said following the President's resolve to crack the whip on graft, cases are increasing daily. On Friday last week, Uhuru proposed additional funding for the judiciary, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the office of the Director of Public Prosecution. He spoke during the State of the Nation address. The Head of State said this will expedite graft cases.

However, Maraga said they cannot be blamed because they face logistical problems of transporting the suspects to courts. He said the Kahawa court will be a major milestone in easing congestion in other courts and prosecuting of criminal cases in Kiambu and other areas. Maraga said in the near future, all minor cases will be decriminalised and suspects will do community service.
