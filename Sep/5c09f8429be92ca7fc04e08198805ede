Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to adequately equip agencies fighting corruption. He said the momentum in the anti-graft war is impressive but must be escalated on all fronts. Mudavadi spoke to KTN on Thursday. The Amani leader said that for the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, Directorate of Criminal Investigations, the police and the Judiciary to work well, they need to be motivated. "These institutions are overstretched. It is strenuous for one officer to handle six cases at a time," he said. Mudavadi said Parliament erred in the 2018/19 budget allocation by denying the institutions adequate resources. The agencies are unlikely to deliver if unless they get a supplementary budget. At the same time, Mudavadi said the opposition needs to find its footing and hold the Executive accountable. "The opposition in a necessity in any democracy and Kenyans must make it work," he said. "Our NASA legislators should not feel ashamed to be in the opposition. Let us be firm, serious and take care of Kenyan interests." Mudavadi said Kenyans should change their perception of the opposition being violent and thriving in hooliganism.
