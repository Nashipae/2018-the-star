Public Health England is urging people over 30 to take an online test to find out their heart age, which indicates if they are at increased risk of suffering a heart attack or a stroke. They predict about 80% of heart attacks and strokes in people under 75 could be prevented if heart health was improved. Unhealthy lifestyles put four in five adults at risk of early death, they estimate. People should quit smoking, eat a healthy diet and get enough exercise. The test is not diagnostic - it will not tell you whether you are going to have a heart attack - but it can be a wake-up call to make healthy changes. David Green, who is 59, took the test. "The worst moment was being told my heart is 10 years older than me and that my life expectancy was shortened," he told the BBC. "That took some digesting for sure, but I flipped it to a positive statement to do something to reverse that scenario." Click here for the latest political news
