Dadaab MP Mohammed Dahiye has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to order opening the Kenya-Somalia border. The country is losing billions of shillings in revenue to unscrupulous traders who sneak in goods through illegal entry points, Dahiye said. In the face of the current financial crisis in the country, opening the three border points of Mandera, Liboi and Kiunga will bring in good revenue for the President’s Big Four agenda, the legislator said. Dahiye spoke in Garissa where he opened a new hotel. He said it is an open secret that all the goods sold in  Garissa, Wajir and Mandera counties come from Somalia.
