Land grabbers in Baringo Central Sub-county have been put on notice. Area MP Joshua Kandie said some people were still occupying their ancestral lands although they had been compensated by the government. "It is surprising to note some people who were then given huge acreage of fertile land to settle in parts of Trans-Nzoia-Kitale and Mochongoi many years back are yet to leave," Kandie said. He said the stubborn individuals have derailed and slowed development projects like construction of schools, dispensaries and drilling of water boreholes. The MP was addressing public while officially opening a new class constructed through CDF at Kaplop primary school in Sacho ward on Thursday. The legislature also commissioned new classrooms in Timboiwo, Kabirmoi, Sossion, Bokorin and Kaptalam primary schools. He was accompanied by area education officer Benjamin Kipkulei. Similar grabbing cases are reported in Baringo North, South, Mogotio, Tiaty and Eldama-Ravine Sub-counties. Click here for the latest political news
