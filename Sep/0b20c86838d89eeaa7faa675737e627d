Poverty in Kisii county stands at 51 per cent, eight points higher than the national figure of 43 per cent, deputy governor Joash Maangi said. The government is working to reduce the number of poor people by supporting income-generating activities like agriculture, Maangi said. The sector employs 80 per cent of residents, and that is why the government allocates it more funds. Maangi spoke on Tuesday during the opening of a meeting on the national agricultural and rural inclusion growth project by the World Bank. The workshop is being attended by World Bank representatives, technical experts and officials from 11 counties. Maangi said excessive land subdivision in the county limits agricultural activities. Kisii county has a population density of 950 inhabitants per square kilometer, which the deputy governor said is above the UN definition of a metropolitan area ( 650 inhabitants per square km). “Under the leadership of governor James Ongwae, the county is coming up with a programme to modernise agriculture,” Maangi said. The county, he said, produces 8.7 tonnes of tomatoes annually, but production is reduced by diseases. Mangi said middlemen have been exploiting banana farmers by buying the produce at throwaway prices and selling at far higher rates in other towns and cities. He said that there is no reason why the county cannot perform well in agriculture because it receives abundant rains. He said that the county intends to support the dairy sector to increase milk production. The county requires 222.5 million litres of milk annually but last year only managed 166 million litres, about 56 million litres less, the deputy governor said.
