A DNA test ordered by a Mwingi court has confirmed that a pastor accused of defiling a 17-year-old girl in a church impregnated the victim. The test results showed that Steve Masila impregnated the Standard Seven pupil, who hails from Nguutani ward, on August 12, 2017. Mwingi senior resident magistrate Grace Kirugumi on Tuesday granted the suspect a Sh200,000 bond with a surety of the same amount. The Arising Christian Ministries pastor appeared before the magistrate at the Mwingi law court for the release of the DNA result. Masila is accused of defiling the minor as she was mopping the church in preparation for a Sunday's service on the fateful Saturday. The court had heard that Masila, after committing the offence, threatened the minor not to disclose the matter to anyone. The minor opened up to her mother with information that it was the pastor who had defiled and impregnated her. Masila upon being asked he started threatening the mother that they will all die and the kid will also die since they are accusing a man of God. The pastor has denied the charges and was remanded at Waita GK prison until he settles the bond. The hearing will be on September 18. Click here for the latest political news
