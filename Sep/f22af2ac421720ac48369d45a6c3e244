Mama Diamond’s latest photo has fans thinking she could be heavily pregnant with her third child. Mama Dangote already has Diamond Platnumz and Esma Khan, who are in their late 20s. She has been dating Rally Jones, who is her son’s agemate. In an interview, she said she was ready to give birth one more time but with her new bae, not with Baba Diamond. “Nimeolewa… Ana udongo gani? Angekua mdogo singeona. Ni mkubwa,” she said. Adding: “Hahaa. Diamond atapata mdogo wake…basi subirieni mdogo wake wa mwisho. (Diamond will get a baby sibling, just wait for the last born).” Speculation is rife that she has finally showcased her baby bump, and the couple seem to be very happy for the as-yet unborn bundle of joy.
