Singer and songwriter Victoria Kimani has landed a major endorsement deal with Maybelline New York, the world’s leading cosmetic brand. This comes after Victoria’s contract as a signed artiste with Chocolate City ended. In an interview with Kiss FM, she explained, “You know like every contract has an expiry date. The contract was over and to be honest with you, most of the time I was on the label, I felt like an independent artiste anyway. I did most things by myself. So it was just time for me to step out on my own and do my own thing and not have to split money with anybody.” Now months later, the sensational Afropop singer is excited to announce the lucrative partnership deal with the global cosmetic giant. The songstress joins the likes of Jourdan Dunn and Gigi Hadid in landing a Maybelline deal, but is the first African artiste to collaborate with the brand, setting a new precedent for African artistes in both the music and business world. Talk about Black Girl Magic! Victoria Kimani says: “I am very excited to partner with Maybelline NY, especially here in Kenya, Africa, only because of my love for Maybelline products but for what Maybelline stands for. The brand has always shared my personal view and philosophy as pertains to my goals to ‘Make it happen’”. Maybelline NY, which has a strong presence in Kenya, is owned by French multinational L’Oréal.
