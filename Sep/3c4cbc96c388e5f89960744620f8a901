A Star journalist has launched a door-to-door screening of cardiac diseases in Vihiga ahead of the launch of a cardiac centre. Joseph Jamenya raised Sh3 million worth of equipment through the JJ Heart Run from Vihiga to Nairobi for establishment of a cardiac centre in the county. He ran for 35 days — March 4 to April 9. The screening is a precursor to the official launch of the cardiac centre at Vihiga County General Hospital by the county government. It will be the first cardiac centre in the region — Kakamega, Vihiga, Busia and Bungoma. Early results have revealed that many residents, particularly the youth, suffer from high-blood pressure unknowingly. Jamenya was inspired after his father Laban succumbed to a heart complication in 2016 and a month later his mother was diagnosed with a heart ailment. "I’m happy that my dream of having a cardiac centre in Vihiga is soon coming to pass," he said. Governor Wilber Ottichilo said the national government had agreed to spend Sh40 million on the centre. "We’ll allocate one whole wing of the ongoing doctors’ plaza to the cardiac centre. We hope this year’s World Heart Day national celebrations will be held here," he said. "I thank Jamenya for taking it upon himself to push for establishment of the cardiac centre and letting our people know the need of early diagnostic of heart ailments." Currently, patients with heart complications are either referred to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret or Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital in Kisumu. The screening also precedes this year’s World Heart Day celebrations set for September 29. Vihiga was allocated a cardiac specialist from among the 100 Cuban doctors.
