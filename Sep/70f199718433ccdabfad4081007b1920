Two police officers were among nine suspects arrested in connection with a robbery in Molo's Olenguruone, Nakuru county. They are Felix Korir and Isaiah Murithi, attached to APS Kamara and Molo divisional headquarters respectively. The Tuesday arrests followed after investigators found a Jericho pistol magazine belonging to one of the nabbed officers. The magazine, loaded with 15 rounds, was found at the scene of robbery on Monday night. Police believe it was used when a gang on September 14 raided a private home in Olenguruone and escaped with property and money. Checks have since confirmed the bullets matched the ones assigned to one of the arrested officers. Detectives from the Nakuru DCI office have launched a hunt forÂ  more suspects.
