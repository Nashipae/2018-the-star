Kirinyaga government will not pay pending Sh290 million bills inherited from the previous administration, Governor Anne Waiguru has said. She wants a special audit done by the Auditor General since most of the bills lack supporting documents. Waiguru spoke at Roswam Hotel on Tuesday after a meeting with officials from the Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation. "If we pay the bills the anti-corruption agency and the Director of Public Prosecutions will come for us. We will only pay genuine claims," Waiguru said. She said during the transition from her predecessor Joseph Ndathi somen cheeky individuals colluded with rogue county staffs to sneak in claims for work not done. "We know their schemes. They will not get a penny,'' Waiguru said.

"In some cases, you find incomplete dispensaries within 3km distance. One wonders even if you complete the dispensaries where will you get the staff and equipment for the facilities?" she asked. But reacting to the allegations on phone on Wednesday, Ndathi said as far as he is concerned he never left behind uncleared bills. He said the county had Sh360 million in the revenue account to pay for incomplete projects. "I never carried any documents from that office when I handed over. Waiguru should stop lying," Ndathi said. He told her to consult accounting officers is she has questions since he is not one. Ndathi also rubbished claims about projects that are not viable. The former governor said he followed the Constitution and said the public was involved before any project was initiated. He wondered why she was bringing up the matter a year after taking over office. Waiguru should be honest and take responsibility. The audit will vindicate me," Ndathi said.
