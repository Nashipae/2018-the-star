Five people died in Kibra following a fire which razed a makeshift house in Silanga, Highrise ward on Friday night. Kilimani OCPD Michael Muchiri said the affected structure had 43 small rooms, all of which were occupied by tenants. He said the fire is suspected to have been caused by an unattended charcoal stove in one of the houses. "Investigations have been launched to establish the cause of the fire," he said. He said the police cannot account for the exact number of the people in the house as the landlord did not have the correct data. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko also visited the scene where he applauded the quick response from the county fire department. The firefighters, according to the residents, arrived in 20minutes hence contained the flames before they could spread to other areas. Sonko has given the landlords until Sunday to demolish their buildings on road reserves in the area. He said the structures built on road reserves pose difficulties in accessing the slum areas in the event of a disaster. Houses have been built haphazardly, leaving little or no room for vehicles to manoeuvre. He ordered landlords to pave way for construction of a road in the area which will assist during fire outbreaks. The road to be constructed will affect a number of houses, which may need to be pulled down. He assured locals the government is working on a lasting solution to perennial fire outbreaks in the city's informal settlements. MCAs Kennedy Oyugi (Nyayo Highrise) and Lawrence Otieno (Sarang'ombe) were present. Oyugi said those building storey houses in Nairobi should be compelled provide at least five exit routes in case of emergencies. Otieno, whose 15 houses were destroyed by fire three days ago, thanked Sonko over his swift action in responding to the incident. "It is time we left politics aside and worked as a team," the MCA said. Click here for the latest political news
