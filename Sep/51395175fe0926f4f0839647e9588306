MPs are threatening to boycott a meeting with President Uhuru Kenyatta this morning. Kenya is in a debt crisis yet MPs are trying to block extra taxes or budget cuts. They are being very irresponsible as they are partly to blame for the present mess as they pass the Treasury budget every year. The MPs also set a very bad example to the nation by unilaterally increasing their own remuneration. This undermined the Salaries and Remuneration Commission. Government workers went on strike to get paid more and the public sector wage bill soared. MPs are now overpaid. Their expenses are excessive. For instance, Parliament gets Sh9 billion a year for travel and allowances compared to Sh5 billion for the whole Executive. The MPs are in a fury because Uhuru has threatened to halve the CDF, which costs Sh50 billion a year, to save money. The MPs must show greater maturity. They must realise that the country is in a financial crisis which requires extra taxes or budget cuts, or both. They should listen to what the President has to say.
