Jubilee legislators will hold a Parliamentary Group meeting to resolve the fuel price crisis. The politicians will consult the executive to lessen the burden on Kenyans without compromising the development agenda. They spoke yesterday at Gikondi Catholic in Nyeri during prayers attended by Deputy President William Ruto. Leaders present were MPs Kanini Kega (Kieni), Anthony Kiai (Mukurweini), Kimani Ichung’wa (Kikuyu), Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira), James Gichuhi (Tetu), Moses Kuria (Gatundu South), Gideon Keter (nominated), Alice Wahome (Kandara), Japheth Mutai (Bureti), Woman Representative Rahab Mukami (Nyeri), Senators Ephraim Maina (Nyeri) and Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet). They appealed to other leaders to stop politicising the new taxes, adding that Kenyans are more interested in solutions, not populist politics. Murkomen said the 16 per cent levy on fuel can “easily be solved by legislatures because the country’s budget is our responsibility”. “If there is a problem we can avert as leaders, let us not burden the public with it. Instead, let us sit down and agree on the way forward,” said the Senate Majority leader. Ichungwa dismissed opposition leader Raila Odinga’s calls for a conference and barazas to discuss ways to manage the new tax and the country’s debts. The Kikuyu MP said the 16 per cent tax on fuel and Kenya’s external debt will be handled by legislatures in Parliamentary Groups and relevant House Committees.
