Pokot South MP David Pkosing has called on the national government to establish a joint Anti-Stock Theft Police Unit along the volatile West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet counties border to curb cattle theft and banditry. He urged Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet and President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene and ensure security in the region. “The national police reservists from the two counties should work as a team to promote peace in the region. We have given the IG two weeks to solve the insecurity problem in the area,” Psoking said. Last year, more than 10 people were gunned down and about 250 houses burnt by bandits from the neighbouring community, leaving more than 2,000 people displaced. The MP said the community has donated land for the camp to be set up in the Lelan and Kapushen areas, and urged the government to ensure the post is built as soon as possible. He observed that having the camp in the area will help bring down cattle rustling and insecurity that has been prevalent along the border. Pkosing also said the government should help return stolen livestock. “The security team should be proactive in pursuing raiders and bring back the stolen livestock,” he said.
