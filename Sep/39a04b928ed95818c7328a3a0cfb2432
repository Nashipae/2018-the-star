Baringo governor Stanley Kiptis yesterday
blamed the now-defunct Transition Authority for doing
shoddy work during the transition period, which he said
has resulted in financial problems in his county. Kiptis told the County Public Accounts and Investment
Committee that the TA did not give them complete
inventory of assets and liabilities. This, Kiptis told the
committee chaired by Senator Moses Kajwangâ€™, has
resulted in poor collection of revenues from land rates. He
was answering audit queries by the Auditor General. Click here for the latest political news
