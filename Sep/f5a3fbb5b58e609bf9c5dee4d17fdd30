The government has urged elders from Northeastern to provide information to security agencies to prevent terrorist attacks. Regional commissioner Mohamed Birik (pictured|) yesterday said elders play a crucial role in security. He spoke to the press in Garissa after meeting elders from the county. “I want to underscore the important role the elders play. They are people we cannot do without, especially if we have to ensure that our security is enhanced,” Birik said. Last Tuesday, residents in Liboi and Ijara towns reported two suspicious individuals to the authorities. A Kenyan from Gatundu, Kiambu county, and a foreigner of European origin were nabbed by the police. They are being interrogated. The foreigner was arrested in Ijara as he sought to board a matatu to Holugho town, 100km away. Police recovered foreign currency bills amounting to about Sh3.4 million, night vision binoculars and mapping gadgets among other equipment. Birik said elders have reliable network of getting information from people who trust them. “I urge them to share such information with our security agencies. I want to assure them that the same will be treated with utmost confidentiality,” he said. Birik took over from Mohamed Saleh. He comes into office at a time when insecurity in Northeastern is still a major problem, particularly attacks by al Shabaab militants. He asked members of the public to volunteer information about any suspicious persons in their midst.
