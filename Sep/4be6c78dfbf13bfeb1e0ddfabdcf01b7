Nairobi Central OCPD Robinson Thuku was on Friday ordered to record Central Police station OCS Simon Kerich's statement over assault claims by a suspect. Chief magistrate Francis Andayi directed Thuku to hand over the statement to Capitol Hill police station boss Caroline Kipruto. Kipruto is investigating claims by suspect Caroline Nthumbi who has alleged to have been assaulted while in custody at the Central Police station.

She sought to have the statement recorded by a senior officer. Thuku has until September 5, when the matter will be mentioned, to comply with order requiring him to receive Kipruto's report of investigations on Nthumbi's claims. Nthumbi's lawyer Kirathe Wandugi said a medical report from Mbagathi Level 4 hospital indicated she was tortured but Andayi declined to receive the report until police conclude the investigation. The suspect is facing charges of obtaining Sh9 million by false pretence, claims which she has denied. Nthumbi claimed to have been assaulted by police officers while in custody, on August 7 when she appeared in court to plead to the charges. She raised fears of returning to the station prompting Andayi to remand her at Capitol Hill police station which is investigating her claims. Click here for the latest political news
