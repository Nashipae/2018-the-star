The High Court in Nyahururu yesterday overturned the nullification of the nomination of four MCAs to the Nyandarua county assembly. The nomination of Wanjiku Muhoho, Geoffrey Ngaruiya, Margaret Ireri and Joseph Kariuki was nullified in February by chief magistrate Judith Wanjala. Their nomination had been challenged by people with disability representative Monicah Gathoni and youth leader Solomon Kuria. Justice Roselyn Wendo faulted Wanjala for entertaining the case, saying the matter ought to have been heard by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission’s dispute resolution committee. The four had been nominated to represent marginalised people.They challenged the magistrate’s decision at the High Court. Yesterday, Wendo ruled the magistrate had no mandate to hear the dispute. “There is a dispute and resolution committee in the IEBC which was mandated to deal with such complaints. The petitioners should have filed the complaint within seven days as per the Election Act. This court should have in the first place not listened to the matter and that is why I have overturned the ruling,” Wendo said. The petitioners said they were not aware of the existence of the IEBC committee. Wendo said ignorance was not a defence. The MCAs welcomed the ruling saying had finally prevailed. “We were fairly nominated by the Jubilee Party,” Muhoho said. Kariuki who represent youths said he will concentrate in championing their agenda in the assembly now that the matter had been settled. But the petitioners, through lawyer Kariuki Njiri, have said they will challenge the ruling at the Court of Appeal. In her ruling, Wanjala said Gathoni and Kuria be given slots when the party comes up with a fresh list of nominees for the marginalised category. “The court finds that the nomination was unconstitutional, unlawful, and hence invalid and is therefore nullified,” Wanjala said. The magistrate held that it was the IEBC and Jubilee Party that failed to follow the law.
