The 16 per cent VAT on fuel will raise September inflation by one to two per cent, Treasury has said. Speaking while appearing before the Senate Energy Committee, Chief Administration Secretary Nelson Ngaruiya said while the government acknowledge the toll the new tax has on Kenyans, it has an obligation to collect Sh35 billion from the tax every month to seal a budget deficit. He, however, said that Treasury is in consultation with Parliament and other relevant players to find an alternative, which includes slashing development budget.
