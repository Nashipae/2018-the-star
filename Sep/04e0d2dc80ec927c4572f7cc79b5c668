Detectives have arrested Migori governor Okoth Obado's bodyguard outside the Milimani law court. Citizen TV showed detectives putting handcuffs on John Chacha after taking away his gun. Chacha is to be taken to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations offices for questioning. He was arrested when Obado was already in court to face charges of aiding, abetting, and financing the murder of Rongo university student Sharon Otieno. Obado arrived in court on Monday after spending three nights at the Gigiri police cells. There was no VIP treatment for the embattled governor while in custody. His three nights behind bars were humbling.
