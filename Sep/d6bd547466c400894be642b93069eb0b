Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji has formed a task force to develop minimum standards for charging suspects. The team will also come up with alternatives to prosecute suspects as well as develop guidelines on the review of prosecutorial decisions. "The task force shall prepare and submit its report to the Director of Public Prosecutions together with its recommendations within thirty 30 days from the date of its appointment," Haji said in a August 7 gazette notice published on Friday. The formation of the task force comes at a time a section of opinion leaders are vouching for alternative dispute resolution to cases. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka on Friday said court processes have often times aggravated issues instead of providing solutions to them. He spoke in Nairobi at the end of a training on mediation by the Dispute and Conflict Resolution International chaired by Justice Lee Muthoga. "Mediation is something most Kenyans have not understood to resolve disputes. Many disputes causing differences among Kenyans can be addressed easily through mediation," Kalonzo said. He said apart from taking shorter time, mediation is a less costly avenue to resolve cases. "Litigation is not only lengthy and expensive but it also does not produce sustainable peace," he said.
