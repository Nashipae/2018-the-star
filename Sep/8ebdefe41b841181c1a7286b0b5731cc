Kenya Revenue Authority is pursuing Sh50 million from four companies involved in tax evasion. KRA’s prosecutor Irene Muthee successfully sought to have the companies’ directors summoned before court after they failed to turn up to be charged. They are Bhupen Gala, Ahmmed Osman, Simion Mokaya and Esther Mwambi. Muthee said the four, being directors of the companies, did not comply with the law by failing to pay tax on different days between 2011 and 2018, thereby denying the country revenue. Gala, a director of Kentsa Metal and Hardware Limited, is accused of defaulting on payment of VAT and domestic tax amounting to Sh26,621,293. Mokaya and Mwambi are the directors of Botana Kenya and Kihunya Construction companies accused of failing to remit Sh 20 million in VAT and domestic tax between 2011 and 2013. They are also accused of making an incorrect statement thereby affecting the payment of Sh5,128,263 in revenue. Osman, the director of Global Africa Auto Tyres and Accessories Limited is facing charges of concealing imported goods, thereby denying the country revenue. Muthee said Osman did not pay tax for 725 motor vehicle tyres. He was required to pay revenue of Sh784,838 via a declared customs entry. She sought court orders on the four to attend for plea taking. “I urge this court to issue summons to the accused persons who had been informed about the charges filed against them and have declined to appear in court to face justice,” Muthee told the court. Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi directed the traders to appear in court on September 27 to answer to charges of defaulting in tax remission.
