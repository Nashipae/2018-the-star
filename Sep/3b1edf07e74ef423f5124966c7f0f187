The second phase of the standard gauge railway has stalled in Kajiado for more than two months after landowners protested against delayed payments. The China Communications Construction Company is waiting for the National Land Commission to clear with landowners so they can resume. A source within the firm yesterday told the Star that major construction works stopped on July 18 in Empaash, Tuala, Oloosirkon, Milimani, Rankau, Kandisi, Merisho, Nkoroi, Kangawa, Oloolua, Ngong, Kimuka and Suswa. Only works on slope protection are ongoing, he said. Landowners had ceded their parcels to the contractor under an “early entry agreement”. This was after they struck a deal with the NLC. NLC acting chairperson Abigael Mukolwe yesterday said the first tranche of Sh1.38 billion was being processed.
