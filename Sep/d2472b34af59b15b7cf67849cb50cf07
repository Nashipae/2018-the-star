Divers in Cheploch on Wednesday recovered the missing body of a 17-year-old boy who drowned at Kimao dam, Baringo South. The four-day search ended after the body of the Petkawanin primary school pupil, Titus Kiprono, was retrieved from the deepest point. Kimalel senior chief Andrew Rumenya said, “We thank the seven-member team of Cheploch divers who jumped in and out, combing everywhere until they found the body.” He said Kiprono’s body was stuck in debris at the bottom of the dam. The body was taken to Baringo Referral Hospital mortuary. Rumenya said Kiprono accompanied his three friends who went fishing and started swimming on Sunday afternoon. The emergency response team from the police and Red Cross were present. Rumenya warned parents to keep children away from the open dams, especially during weekends. The majority who visit come from Sesya, Kituro, Marigat and Timboiwo villages. The chief appealed to the county government to allocate funds to fence off the dam to prevent deaths. Diver Philip Kemboi said, “It was such a tedious exercise locating the body. At some point I almost suffocated in the 70ft waters .” The divers are aged 18 to 26. They are from Baringo, Uasin Gishu and Elgeyo Marakwet. When they are not retrieving bodies they entertain tourists at Cheploch Gorge. Residents urged the county government to hire the divers on contract so they can be on standby to avert such deaths. Baringo governor Stanley Kiptis regretted the incident and sent a condolence message to the family and the school.
