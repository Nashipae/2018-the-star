Migori governor Okoth Obado was on Thursday denied bail and will be remanded at the Industrial Area Prison until October 8 when the court will hear afresh his bail application. "At this juncture, I'm disallowing the application and he will appear with the others on October 8,"  High Court Judge Jessie Lessit said. She concurred with the prosecution that the suspect has a likelihood to tamper with the evidence, endanger national security. "The nature of the case has been changing, more suspects are being charged," she said. Senior investigation officer Clement Mwangi said there is a high likelihood of Obado interfering with or intimidating prosecution witnesses if released on bail. But Obado's lawyer Cliff Ombeta said Article 49 is clear that any accused person brought to the court shall be entitled to bail. Earlier on, Justice Lessit ordered the prosecution to consolidate all the cases surrounding the murder of Sharon.
