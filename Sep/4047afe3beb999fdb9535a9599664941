Kenya Alcohol Control and Policy Alliance now says that any level of alcohol consumption is harmful. Kapa said approximately 2.8 million people die globally every year due to noncommunicable diseases. Philip Nyakundi, the Kapa chairperson, yesterday said youths between 15 to 24 years worldwide die from alcohol consumption and disability. According to a WHO survey in 2015, “13 per cent of Kenyans consume alcohol daily and 12.7 per cent are heavy episodic drinkers who consume six or more drinks in one sitting,” Nyakundi said. He said a further survey done by Nacada in 2012 found that 13 per cent of Kenyans who drink alcohol developed dependency. Alcohol is among the four major modifiable risk factors to NCDs as it causes seven types of cancer which include mouth, throat, food pipe, voice box, breast cancer, bowel and liver cancer. He called on the government to amend the aspects of the Alcohol Drinks Control Act 2010 to help reduce the impact of unregulated promotion on children.
