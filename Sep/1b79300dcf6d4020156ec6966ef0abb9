MPs will on Tuesday hold a Kamukunji to discuss the way forward on the fuel tax saying it is hurting ordinary Kenyans. The 16% tax was imposed effective September 1. Bus fares to various places  were hiked a day after its implementation. Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter said 150 MPs from across the political divide have confirmed attending the informal sitting. Accompanied by Tindi Muale (Butere), Caleb Amisi (Saboti), and Godfrey Osotsi (nominated), the legislators said they will do everything possible to ensure the government's decision to tax fuel products is rescinded. This came after two lawmakers wrote to both National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale and his Minority counterpart John Mbadi to reconvene the House to discuss the matter which has generated public outrage.
