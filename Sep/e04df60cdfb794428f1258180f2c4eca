The 1994 WRC Safari Rally winner, Ian Duncan, will be the star attraction as over 25 drivers head to Laikipia County for the Nanyuki Rally on Saturday. The six-time Kenyan champion is making a comeback months after tackling the 2018 season-opening rally in his crowd pulling Nissan pickup. Onkar Rai, who won the 2018 Nakuru rally, will also be among top drivers expected in his Kabras Sugar Racing Skoda Fabia R5 machine. Rai will be joined by his younger brother, Tejvir Rai, as well as teammates — former Kenya National Rally Championship winners Baldev Chager and Carl Tundo — in the one-day competition. Scrutineering, stewards’ meeting and publication of start order will take place on Friday at Cedar Mall, Nanyuki. After the start at Cedar Mall, the cars will head for Loldaiga and finish at Batian View on the foothills of Mount Kenya. Drivers will be fighting for points in the various categories. Cementers Racing Team ace Ramesh Vishram, who has previously won the Classic Car championship will also be making a comeback in his traditional Ford Escort Mark2 hoping to shake off the cobwebs. Also making a comeback after a long break are the Halais, Mahesh and Ketan in Subaru. Ramesh will be navigated by Riyaz Ismail, who also participates in the Tanzania Rally Championship series. Newly crowned back-to-back African Rally Champion Manvir Baryan, who skipped Mombasa, is back in action after winning last weekend’s Oryx Rally of Tanzania. The entry list of 28 cars includes Two-Wheel Drive contenders Daren Miranda and Sarit Shah. The category will, however, miss Hamra Anwar, who has since upgraded from the ex-Dennis Mwenda Toyota Sprinter to Imran Khan’s Subaru Impreza N10.
