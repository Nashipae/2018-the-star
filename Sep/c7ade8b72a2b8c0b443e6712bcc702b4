Traces of drugs found in the body of a Malindi businessman recovered from a swimming pool in a Watamu resort were antieplieptic medication. Dan Gikonyo yesterday said Jimmy Jagatram, who is believed to have been murdered by his wife, was under medication to control convulsions. He testified in a case in which Amina Shiraz has been charged with killing her husband in July 2015, at Medina Palms Resort, Watamu. Jagatram was found dead under unclear circumstances. Gikonyo dismissed claims Jagatram must have suffered a seizure in the swimming pool. Traces of Barbiturate was found in his urine. Gikonyo said his South African doctor friends prescribed the drugs after Jagatram sought further medication. He had been sick for two months, was hospitalised three times and was in critical condition during one of the occasions. The hearing continues today. Click here for the latest political news
