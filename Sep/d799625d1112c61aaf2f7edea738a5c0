The prime suspect in the attempted murder of former Garissa finance executive Idriss Mukhtar was buried at his grandmother’s home in Ngamini, Nakuru county. David Mwai's burial ceremony took less than two hours and was attended by not more than 200 people. His friends kept off the funeral save for a few who accompanied family members. Mwai, 27, is said to have pulled the trigger on Mukhtar who is still admitted to hospital. He died last Friday at the Parklands police station cells where he is said to have committed suicide. A postmortem revealed he died of strangulation. Before his death, the alleged assassin confessed to police that the initial plan was to kidnap and poison Idriss Mukhtar but he took too long and instead was ordered to shoot to kill. Very little about him is known among residents of Ngamini village. Speaking at the burial, Waseges MCA Daniel Kiriethe said detectives should unearth the mystery surrounding the death of Mwai. The MCA said the whereabouts of Mwai's wife is still unknown after they were arrested together. Mwai’s Uncle James Wambugu said that they do not have any information regarding the whereabouts of Mwai’s wife adding that her children are small to comprehend anything at the moment.
