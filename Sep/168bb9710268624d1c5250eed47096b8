Chaos marred the Kisumu county assembly session on Wednesday following a plan to impeach Speaker Onyango Oloo. Trouble started when Nominated MCA Caleb Omoro brought a motion for his removal. MCAs were to discuss the conduct of the Speaker. When Omoro stood to move the motion, Oloo left the seat and MCA Roy Sambu "took over as Speaker". Members opposed to the motion termed it illegal since proper procedure was not followed. Oloo's allies engaged Omoro is a heated exchanged. The Sergeant-at-arms intervened when they nearly came to blows. Market/Milimani MCA Seth Ochieng were involved in a scuffle with Omoro. He accused him of causing confusion in the assembly. At one point, an MCA grabbed the microphone from Sambu "for failing to give directions". Kolwa East MCA Steve Owiti said the impeachment motion was never brought before the House business committee for deliberation. "We cannot allow an illegality," Owiti said. He said there was no signed petition by members seeking Oloo's removal. A majority of the MCAs opposed the motion. They accused Omoro of plotting Oloo's ejection. They said it is a diversionary tactic for the replacement of two members of the County Assembly Public Service Board Agness Nyagoya and George Abaja. Nyagoya and Abaja were to replaced with Majority leader Kenneth Onyango and Majority Whip Gard Olima. Owiti claimed the ODM Party supports the changes. "The party is fully aware of the removal of Nyagoya and Abaja. It is not something unprocedural," he said. Some 32 MCAs signed a petition for the replacement of the officials.
