Twenty-nine Homa Bay ODM ward representatives may face disciplinary action for violating the party Constitution. The MCAs participated in the removal of assembly majority leader Richard Ogindo, his deputy Ruth Ombura, majority whip Sophy Koweje and her deputy Esther Dualo. In a letter from party secretary general Edwin Sifuna dated September 17, the MCAs have seven days to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against them. “My office is in receipt of reports that in defiance of the party regarding the matter of leadership in the assembly, you went ahead to congregate and purport to effect changes to the assembly leadership,” it reads. Sifuna warned the MCAs that the party will initiate disciplinary proceedings without further reference. After the removal of the four, Walter Were was elected the majority leader, Julius Nyambok his deputy, Dan Were the majority whip and Mary Ojala the deputy majority whip. The election was, declared null and void by party executive director Oduor Ong’wen. The MCAs accused Ogindo of poor leadership, misusing assembly funds, divisive politics and lack of respect for other elected leaders, including the MCAs. He was also blamed for the EACC probe in the assembly. The move to change the assembly leadership is seen as an attempt by some elected leader to control the house and aim for the county’s top leadership. Early this month, Ogindo dismissed the removals and said he and his deputy were still in office. He called the removal process “unprocedural and unacceptable”. “I want to apologise for where I might have gone wrong. I want to appeal to the other faction to tone down and work together to spur county’s development,” Ogingo said. Ogindo, who is said to be targeting the Ndhiwa MP seat in 2022, has been at cross purposes with the sitting MP Martin Owino over development issues.
