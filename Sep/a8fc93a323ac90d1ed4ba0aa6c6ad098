The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has written to the Nairobi assembly clerk for information on MCAs' foreign and local travel. The agency wrote to the city assembly seeking the documents which form part of the probe into financial impropriety at the August House. Acting clerk Nancy Mutai acknowledged receiving the letter from the commission on Monday. The anti-corruption agency wants a list of all local and foreign trips made by MCAs in the financial years ending 2017, 2018 and 2019. The required details include the countries, specific conference facilities, and payments made to particular MCAs and county staff for the trips. Humphrey Mahiva, EACC deputy director for investigations, also requested for certified copies of the approved budget and procurement plan for said financial years. Also demanded is a list of all pre-qualified suppliers and contractors. Mutai was also asked to hand in a contract between Kensum Enterprise and City Hall for the renovation of the chambers as well as payment documents on the same. On Thursday last week, 12 MCAs moved to court to challenge summons issued against by the commission over chaos during the attempted ejection of speaker Beatrice Elachi. They are Anthony Karanja, Peter Imwatok, Elias Okumu, Ibrahim Hassan, Leah Supuka, Peter Wahinya and Sudan Kavaya. Others are Laura Mwololo, Mary Njambi, Nancy Muthami, Doris Ngoyo, and Ruth Maingi. The MCAs impeached Elachi on September 5 citing "gross misconduct". However, hours later, the speaker was reinstated by the court.
