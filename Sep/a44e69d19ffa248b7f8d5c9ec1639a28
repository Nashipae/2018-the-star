Despite being an unused in the Harambee Stars contests against Ghana and Malawi, centre half Joseph Okumu has expressed his delight to have been called up by head coach Sebastien Migne in the recently concluded Fifa international week. The fast-rising defender, 22, who plies his trade in the United States with Real Monarchs said the call up was enough inspiration for him to break into the national team first eleven in the near future regardless of the opposition from seasoned defenders. In the two matches which Stars played during the Fifa week, the hard man found it tough to dispense either of the centre half duo of Musa Mohammed and Joash Onyango and when a substitute at the heart of the defence was required, Migne preferred former Tusker defender, David Ochieng. However, Okumu believes the wait will soon be over should the coach give him a chance to prove himself. The former Chemelil Sugar player won the confidence of Migne in June during the Hero Intercontinental Cup held in India and made it to the bench when Kenya overcame Malawi 1-0 a week ago in an international friendly but was unavailable for the Ghana tie. He promised to live up to Migne’s expectations and force his way into the starting team despite the competition in his preferred centre half roles. “I am happy the coach recognised my qualities and called me to the national team for the second time since his appointment. Although I did not play in the two matches, the call up was enough to me and showed that he (Migne) believes in my abilities. We have quality centre halves in the team who are more experienced than me and have several caps but I believe I will break into the team.” He added: “I am not under pressure to prove that I am better than those ahead of me but I am confident if given the chance, I will seize it and give him selection headache.”
