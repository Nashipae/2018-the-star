The Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital yesterday dismissed claims attributed to the NLC that 200 acres allocated to it for construction of a Sh28 billion facility has been revoked. CEO Wilson Aruasa (pictured) said the title for the Kiplombe parcel is intact and construction of the 2,000-bed capacity facility will begin soon. He said in Eldoret town that the claim was a rumour. “Members of the public have no cause to worry,” Aruasa said. An online story had alluded that the National Land Commission returned the parcel to the Kenya Prison Service. According to the story, the NLC notice claimed the the hospital land was part of 150 public plots allocated to influential individuals and institutions. It said the cancellation followed investigations and public hearings carried out by the commission between January 30 and February 3 last year. Click here for the latest political news
