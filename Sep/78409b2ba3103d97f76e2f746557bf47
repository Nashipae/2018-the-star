Ulinzi Stars’ ace Elvis Nandwa has played down his prospects of clinching the ‘Golden Boot’ despite enjoying undoubtedlythe best season of his career. The midfielder added another star to his rising profile with two goals as Ulinzi beat Gor Mahia 2-0 on Wednesday. The two goals took his league tally for the season to 11 in the league and 12 in all competitions, having scored once in the SportPesa Shield, marking a massive improvement for the lad, who managed just two goals all season in 2017. His goals place him well as a prospect for the top scorer’s accolade as well as Midfielder of the Year at the end of the season but Nandwa opted to stay modest and just keep working for the team. “I will give my best and see where we get. Regarding Golden Boot and Best Midfielder’s award at the end of the season, I think it is achievable but the most important thing now is to stay focused on the team goals. I want to do all I can to lift the team, bring in crosses, provide assists and anything else to lift the team,” he said. The former Mathare United man, who is among a quintet of players still capable of upstaging former Nzoia United striker Elvis Rupia, termed the victory over the champions as an important. “It was a good game and an important win for us. We tried our best to stick to the instructions the coach gave us and though we may have gotten it wrong in some instances, I think in the end it worked well and we have three points. We had good crosses in today and from those, we got our goals,” he added.
