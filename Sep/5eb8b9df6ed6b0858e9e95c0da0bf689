Four houses were on Thursday night torched at Lwanda village in Kabondo Kasipul after the death of a 65-year-old granny over a land row. Angry residents burnt the houses of a man suspected to be in connection with the killing of Mary Pete. Mary's body was found dumped near her home on Thursday morning by a primary school pupil who alerted the locals. A physical look at the body showed signs that Mary was strangled to death before her body was dumped. Area chief Samuel Okoko said the woman's family members last saw her on Wednesday evening.
