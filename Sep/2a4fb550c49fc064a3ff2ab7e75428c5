Nairobi governor Mike Sonko on Friday appointed Leboo Moritant the Deputy County Secretary. Director of communications Elkana Jacob said in a statement the appointment takes effect immediately. According to Jacob, Moritant's appointment does not require the county assembly's approval or vetting by the appointments committee. Until his appointment, he was the ChiefÂ Officer in charge of Public Service Management. He has also previously served as acting County Secretary from 2017 until mid-2018. Moritant will deputise Peter Kariuki, who is currently on suspension. The County secretary is among four top county officials who were suspended by Sonko on September 18 for what he termed as insubordination over the Pumwani Maternity Hospital infant deaths' saga. They contradicted Sonko over his decision to suspend top managers at the facility over alleged negligence after 11 infants were found in polythene bags.
