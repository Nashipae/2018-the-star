Stanbic Bank national Sevens Circuit enters the second last round this weekend as top teams head to Kisumu for the Silverstone Dala Sevens tomorrow at the ASK Mamboleo Show ground. Runaway leaders Menengai Cream Homeboyz need a top three finish in both the Kisumu show and Christie Sevens at RFUEA grounds in Nairobi next weekend to win the overall title. If the Deejays finish top three in the two rounds, they will garner unassailable 115 points. Homeboyz, coached by Paul Murunga, lead the circuit with 81 points, 11 clear of second placed Mwamba with KCB, who were semi-finalists at all the four rounds played, third on 66. Nakuru, who were beaten finalists in Machakos and Cup winners in Mombasa, complete the top four on 63 points. Homeboyz run of three successive cup titles was ended last weekend during the Driftwood Sevens in Mombasa when they went down 36-21 in the semis to Mwamba. The Deejays will be seeking to win their third consecutive Dala Sevens title but must qualify from Pool ‘D’ where they are paired with Nondescripts, hosts Silverstone Kisumu and MKU, Thika. Second-placed Stanbic Mwamba are in Pool ‘B’ with Menengai Oilers, Resolution Impala and Blak Blad while third-placed KCB headline Pool ‘C’ where they are grouped with Kabras Sugar, Northern Suburbs and Machine. Nakuru, who won the Driftwood Sevens last weekend headline Pool ‘A’ with Resolution Kisii, Kenya Harlequin and Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology.
