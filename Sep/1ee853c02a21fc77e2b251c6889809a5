Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju has defended China’s
interests in Kenya saying that the Asian nation has no colonial experience to
take over the country. The Cabinet Secretary without a portfolio said those
criticising China's activities in Kenya are only jealous. "China has never had a colony and it has no experience to colonise
other countries," Tuju said in a video posted on Chinese media websites. He spoke at the launch of the Sichuan and Chongqing
Chamber of Commerce in Nairobi. "China does not have a propaganda machine but those who are
jealous are having sleepless nights to fight China in Kenya," he
said. "I can’t name those countries which are jealous of China because I am a diplomat. But people know them." Read: China take-over worries Kenyans Without pointing directly to the West,
Tuju said the dissenting forces were using the media, NGOs to drive propaganda against the Asian nation. "We know those who are fighting to bring problems
between China and Kenya." He asked China to expand
its activities in the country in order to take on its competitors strongly. "Thank you very much for the investments you bring to this
country. You are also our ambassadors and you can tell other investors in your
country about us," Tuju said. Tuju's remarks came at a time China has overtaken the World
Bank to become Kenya's single largest creditor, accounting for 72 per cent of
the total debt owed to foreign lenders. Despite setting
up multi-billion shilling infrastructure development projects, the local
industries are closing down over cheap imports from China. There is a fear that China might take over strategic public entities, such as airports and ports, to
recoup the public debt if Kenya fails to pay. But Tuju said China does not have instruments of propaganda but has come
out strong to torment its competitors. Click here for the latest political news
