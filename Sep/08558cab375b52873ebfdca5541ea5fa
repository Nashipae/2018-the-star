Kisumu Senator Fred Outa has hailed President Uhuru Kenyatta for the merger of police service, but cautioned over the move to procure the same uniform for the officers. Outa said the country is facing financial problems and cannot afford to overburden taxpayers with another purchase of uniform for police officers. He said the merger will enhance service delivery in the police service, but asked the government to reconsider the plan to change the uniform. The senator, however, warned the procurement of new uniform could become “another big scandal” if not properly undertaken. “The laid down procurement rules must be followed to prevent massive loss of public funds meant for development as witnessed in NYS and other departments in government,” he said on Sunday.
