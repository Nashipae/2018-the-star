Willy Paul and Nyashinski have been ranked as the leading artistes nationally in the 2017 Music Publishers Associations of Kenya (Mpake) royalty distribution, with Sh11,685.39 and Sh11,482.52 respectively. This distribution is with respect to collections realised through joint collection with Kamp and Prisk between November 1 and December 31 last year. The total collections realised in that period stands at Sh4,677,130.76, of which the share committed to the specific class of rights represented by Mpake is Sh1,856,314.68, following revenue between copyright (Mpake) and related rights (Kamp and Prisk). The board of Mpake has elected to commit 70 per cent of this revenue to distribution as per its licensing terms and international best practices. The remaining 30 per cent has been committed to administration expenses. Mpake has entered into debt agreements with suppliers and vendors to recover the initial set-up costs in future and to do so within the 30 per cent thatâ€™s allocated for administrative expenses. The 2017 Audited Financial Statements that contain the finer details of this shall be published on the Mpake website for review and perusal. During Q4 of this year, MPAKE shall be releasing its five-year strategic plan, which shall further detail the debt management strategy as well as opportunities for growth that have been identified.
