Doha are preparing to stage a spectacular IAAF World Championships next year, when they become the first city in the Middle East to host athletics’ premier showcase event. A large team of IAAF event and technical experts has spent the last couple of days conducting an extensive site visit with the Doha 2019 Local Organising Committee, part of the process of coordination that precedes every major championships. IAAF Vice President Dahlan Al Hamad, who is also the Vice-Chairman and Director-General of the Local Organising Committee, said that with little more than one year to go to the opening day of the championships, he was confident that Doha would be ready to host the athletes of the world. “Our airport and hotels are ready, our stadium is ready, our ticket programme and brand will be revealed when we celebrate One Year to Go on Thursday (September 27),’’ he said. “All the big pieces are in place. Our task over the next year is to link all the pieces together as we prepare to stage an innovative and exciting event that will engage athletics fans both near and far.” The highlight of the visit was the demonstration of the world-first air-conditioning system that will keep Khalifa International Stadium at a comfortable temperature for athletes, officials and fans, protecting all from Qatar’s desert climate. IAAF Council member Geoff Gardner, who led the federation’s team, said everyone was impressed by the effectiveness of the stadium cooling system.
