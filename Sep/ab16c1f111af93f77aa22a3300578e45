Whale watching is increasing becoming a tourist attraction in South coast as hoteliers and service providers in Watamu report increased demand by foreign and local tourists. In the last three months, some tourists are treated to as many as three such trips daily. “Kenya’s coastal region has largely been seen as a beach destination. The humpback whale migration has now created a great opportunity for tourists coming to Kenya to experience the humpback whale migration as part of their coastal experience,” said Betty Radier, CEO of Kenya Tourism Board. She said the phenomenon is becoming a top experience that can be sold to tourists as a must-see attraction alongside the world famous wildebeest migration into the Maasai Mara National Reserve. One of the best places to see the humpback whales in Kenya is at the Watamu Marine National Reserve where Watamu Marine Association (WMA) has been studying dolphins and whales since 2011. WMA has been working with the Kenya Wildlife Service to help protect marine mammals, recycle plastic and marine litter and to engage the local community, including fishermen in eco-tourism activities. Many tourists visit Watamu for sport fishing as well as dolphin and whale shark watching expeditions. Whale sharks are mostly seen during the months of February and March. The area is also popular for snorkeling, scuba diving and kite surfing owing to its clear blue waters.
