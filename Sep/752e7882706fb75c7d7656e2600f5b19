Mathira residents are not opposed to the installation of water meters at the intakes in Mt Kenya forest, Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua has said. Gachagua said the residents were againstbeing charged for the water, but not against the installation for the purposes of regulating the water they use. “What we would be opposed to is using the flow meters as a benchmark for charging the local people for water,” he said. “Surely the people cannot afford to pay for water that is metered in the sense that the government has no business levying a charge on these people,” he said. Rigathi was speaking in Mathira yesterday. All water intakes in the forest had been disconnected following orders from Water and Sanitation Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui.
