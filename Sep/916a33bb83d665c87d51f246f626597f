A Chinese national identified as Liu Jiaqi has been deported following his arrest for referring to President Uhuru Kenyatta and Kenyans as monkeys. The Immigration Department on Thursday posted on Twitter that Jiaqi’s permit had been cancelled. "Liu Jiaqi a Chinese National who was arrested due to his racist remarks has been deported," Immigration department wrote on its Twitter handle. Jiaqi was secretly captured in a video by a worker he had threatened to sack from his motorcycle shop in Ruiru. In the clip, the trader brags that there is nothing that 'poor, black, smelly' Kenyans can do to him. He added all he wanted in Kenya was to make money. Click here for the latest political news
