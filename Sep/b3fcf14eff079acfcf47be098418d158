Police are holding a woman who conned three people of Sh24 million by posing as an Office of the President's employee. Grace Mwania faces the charge of obtaining money by false pretence, the investigators said in a statement on Thursday. "She had told the complainants she works at the OP and had been awarded a tender to supply Jubilee Party campaign materials last year." The officers said the woman, who claimed she worked at Harambee House, further told the victims that she had another tender to supply mattresses and foodstuffs to the needy. "The suspect vanished after she obtained the money. She was arrested in Nairobi on Wednesday and will be arraigned as soon as possible," police said. Click here for the latest political news
