The High Court yesterday stopped Kenya Power from disconnecting electricity supply to the founder of a national monument in Athi River over bills. American artist Alan Donovan sued the firm after it allegedly served him with an inflated Sh616,000 bill. He said Kenya Power without notice disconnected his supply, causing him untold frustration and loss of resources. Donovan said he heavily relies on the power to run African Heritage House. He has accused Kenya Power of abusing its monopoly, dominance and buyer power by disconnecting electricity for “backdated, illogical, unexplained and contested amounts.” Read: Gallery owner fights Sh616,000 Kenya Power ‘inflated’ bill Yesterday, the court heard that the power had been restored although Donovan questioned how his bill accumulated to the figure. Justice Chacha Mwita directed that the petitioner continue to pay monthly consumption bills, pending conclusion of the case. Donovan said he had been “indisposed and admitted to Nairobi Hospital from September 2017 until February” and electricity consumption for that duration was on the bare minimum. “I was shocked to learn through an unofficial communication of an amount owed to them totalling Sh616,000,” he said. The petitioner said the communication was on a piece of paper given to his representative Tom Otieno who had gone to enquire about April and May bills. “After I received the outrageous bill, I wrote a letter to the KPLC requesting for further explanations on how they arrived at the figure and explained my absence from home due to my illness,” Donovan said. “I concluded that the alleged uncharged consumption units were simply malicious and exorbitant and only meant to harass and extort [cash from] customers in paying for unexplained and inflated electricity consumption.” The petition will be heard on November 12.
