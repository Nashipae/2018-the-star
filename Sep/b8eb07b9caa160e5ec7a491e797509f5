Chief Justice David Maraga has termed a letter calling for the resignation of Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu fake. The letter that has been doing rounds on social media asked Mwilu to step aside until she cleared her name. “In addition with the dignity and reputation of the Judiciary at stake, I would like to suggest that you consider taking some time away from the office until this unfortunate matter is dispensed with,” it read in part. Mwilu is accused of Sh12m corruption, failure to pay tax and improper dealings with Imperial Bank, now in receivership. But Maraga via a tweet on Wednesday said, "This letter circulating on social media purporting to be authored by me is FAKE, please ignore." The letter has made the Deputy CJ trend. Her lawyer Nelson Havi wants the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji to investigate its author. “Dear @DCI_Kenya and @ODPP_KE, you were quick to charge DCJ Mwilu for using her official letterhead in an application for a loan to Imperial Bank Limited as if it was wrong." “Could you put our taxes to good use and get to the bottom of this letter and the hashtag #MwiluTheWicked,” Havi said.
