Kenyans were yesterday gloriously united in celebrating marathon superstar Eliud Kipchoge's record breaking win in Berlin. For two hours, the country was one. From Moyale to Mbita Point and from Lokichogio to Lwakhakha. Facebook posts and Twitter messages all hailed the 'King'. No one cared about the village he or she hails from, he was simply one of us. But that is as far as it goes. It disheartens to see how tribalism has chipped away at our patriotism. The damage politicians have made in our national fabric will take long to heal. Every event and every issue is viewed from this prism. Politicians are not judged by what they can do, but by tribe. Jobs, tenders and contracts more often than not are not won by competence. The prosecution of a public officer caught with their hand in the cookie jar, turns into a chorus of our tribe is being finished. Kenyans live a big lie about patriotism, for it simply does not exist. Politicians revel in the mess. It works wonders in their favour. Mwalimu Julius Nyerere will always be remembered for moulding Tanzania into a cohesive nation. No mean feat for a country with more than 120 ethnic groups. Unless we wake from tribal idolatry and embrace the unity inspired by the victory of the likes of Kipchoge, our desire for a strong, cohesive nation will remain a pipe dream.
