Kitui governor Charity Ngilu yesterday told matatu operators to observe high safety standards and improve services. “In the wake of the increased petrol prices, I wish to cut costs by abandoning my official car and taking a ride in a safe matatu from Kitui to Nairobi to attend to official duties,” she said. She spoke to PSV operators at Kitui town main terminus. She said she is alarmed by the increasing number matatu accidents of late. “The carnage involving PSVs has shot up in our county. One recently nearly caused a crash with my vehicle because the driver was driving at a very high speed,” Ngilu said. She said although in some cases roads are bad, most accidents are caused by human error and speeding. Ngilu said her government will take Kitui PSV drivers for refresher courses to improve competency. “I will also award drivers who do not cause accidents. I want PSV drivers to be neat while at work. We will provide hot showers for them at the Kitui bus park and a free public toilet,” the governor said.
