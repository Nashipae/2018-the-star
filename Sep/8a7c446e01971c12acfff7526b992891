Kitui governor Charity Ngilu has urged the church to join her push for the exploitation of minerals in the county. Ngilu said Kitui has enough minerals that can be exploited to create wealth and end the poverty among residents. Speaking during a workshop in Kitui on Tuesday, the governor urged church leaders to preach to faithful about the potential in exploiting minerals in their regions. “Minerals are found everywhere in Kitui,” Ngilu said. The workshop was attended by representatives from different denominations, Haki Madini Kenya, Transparency International and county officials. Catholic Archbishop of Nyeri Antony Muheria who is the apostolic administrator of the Kitui diocese was among those in attendance. Ngilu said political rivals were misinforming residents about exploitation of minerals and urged them to stop.
