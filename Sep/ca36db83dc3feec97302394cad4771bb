Two human rights groups have sued IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati for locking out three commissioners from office. International Human Rights Defenders and Carewell Society say Chebukati is not the employer of Consolata Maina, Margaret Mwachanya and Paul Kurgat. They say locking their offices and ejecting them compromises public interest. “This matter should be determined to stop Chebukati from proceeding with such action,” reads part of court documents. Through lawyer Edward Nyakeriga, the groups say Chebukati has abused his office and exercised his powers with an improper motive. Read: Chebukati to explain why he locked Chiloba out of office Click
