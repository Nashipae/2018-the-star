Police in Mai Mahiu, Naivasha, are looking for a woman who allegedly stabbed her boyfriend to death after quarrelling over a mattress. The woman in her late 40s stabbed the 22-year-old casual labourer on the chest and fled. The lover died on arrival at Mai Mahiu Health Centre following the 2 am attack. Witness John Njenga said the deceased arrived home drunk and a quarrel ensued. Njenga said the man demanded his mattress back from the woman after she threw him out of her house because of his drinking habits. "The two have been cohabiting but fell out. The woman stabbed the man twice," he said. Njenga said the woman rushed to Mai Mahiu police station to report the deceased for beating her only to receive news that he had passed on. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru said they are looking for the woman who is on the run. He said the body was moved to a mortuary in Naivasha.
