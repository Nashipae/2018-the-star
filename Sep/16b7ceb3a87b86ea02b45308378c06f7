Residents of Muumoni in Mwingi North want the Kenya Wildlife Service to capture a stray lion that has been killing their livestock in the past one week. Area ward administrator David Kyalo said the beast has given residents sleepless nights. "The lion killed a donkey in Kanyoeni village, four cows in Mukong'a, a goat, and another cow in Kanyungu village," Kyalo said. Locals suspect the cat is hiding in Muumoni hills. KWS officer in Mwingi Paul Langat said they have laid a trap to catch the lion. Click here for the latest political news
