Wahu's move from secular music to the gospel industry was sudden, but Nameless took it in his stride. Speaking to Word Is, Nameless said: "I was working on a project with her before she quit secular." Adding: "Wahu had always been talking about joining gospel for a long time, and when her time came, I could not hinder her from doing what she has always wanted." He promised to back up his wife even after she shifted genres. "When she finally joined gospel, I had to let her be, because it is about how she feels, not what I feel for her. She told me this is where I am and my heart is here and I promised my support to her." He said Wahu has been part of his journey in music, supporting him. "She knows what inspires me in music and therefore, I will support what is currently inspiring her songs. We've learnt how to support each other, and though we are a couple, we are separate human beings. If my call will be gospel in future, I will also join her because it is always about what inspires us." Wahu is currently taking her classes in gospel music, studying the Bible.
