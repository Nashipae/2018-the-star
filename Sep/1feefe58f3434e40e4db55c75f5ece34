Classic 105 radio presenter Mike Mondo is giving women sleepless nights. During the Morning Show on Classic 105 hosted by Maina Kageni, several confessed their love for Mondo and longed to meet him. One woman said her love for Mike is driven by the fact he is organised, has a voice to die for and dresses well. In response, Mondo said: “Mad love. I appreciate it and I love that I am in someone’s bucket list, and as the wise men say, it’s only mountains that don’t meet. So hopefully I will bump into her one day.” Adding: “About taking her on a a date, I am not sure, but one thing I am certain of is if she ever bumps into me at a club, her bills will be on me.”
