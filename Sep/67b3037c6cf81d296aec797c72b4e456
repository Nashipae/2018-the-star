Police in Mombasa are holding a man found with a Barette pistol and seven rounds of ammunition. The man whose identity is unknown was arrested after officers on patrol ambushed a group of three women and two men at Mwembe Tayari on Monday night. The group is suspected to be part of an organized criminal gang operating in Majengo, Old Town, Likoni, Kisauni and CBD. Mombasa Police Commander Johnston Ipara told Journalists on Tuesday that three other suspects are also in custody. "This weapon has been used to terrorise Mombasa residents. Recently a businessman was attacked by gangs and lost Sh 60,000 at Inuka area in Likoni. This weapon was also used in a robbery incidence in Moi Avenue and Jomvu robbery incidences last week," Ipara said. On Saturday, police killed four young men in Kisauni area over terror-related activities. On Monday, police killed another man in Mtopanga area over thefts of goats. Ipara who was flanked by Central Police OCS Barnabas Chumo, County AP Boss Nelson Masengeli and Coast Criminal Investigations boss Washington Njiiru said security agents will work together to weed out terror gangs in Mombasa.
