Harambee Stars coach SÃ©bastien MignÃ© has his eyes set on his first competitive match in charge of the national team in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Ghana this weekend at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Following the conclusion of a training session at the Kenya School of Monetary Studies, the coach expressed satisfaction with the players’ fitness and motivation, further noting that they’ll give a good account of themselves on Saturday. “We have started off well. I’m happy with the players’ fitness levels and morale,” said coach MignÃ©. “We are working on getting ready for the match. Ghana will pose a tough challenge but I have trust in my players and I’m confident they will get a positive  result.” Fit again captain, Victor Wanyama gave the squad a major relief as he was for the first time in the English football season named in the squad for last Sunday’s trip to Watford where his Tottenham Hotspurs side lost their first league match. Wanyama has been hampered by a knee injury he got during the clubs pre-season in July. Though he did not feature in the match, his mere presence on the bench was a boost for club and country and he will be hoping to get playing time this weekend as he improves his match fitness. Wanyama and a host of Kenyan  players  based in Europe were due to join their compatriots for training yesterday. Japan-based striker Michael Olunga, whose Kashiwa Reysol side are due to play in a cup match this afternoon, might be the last foreign-based player expected in camp. Stars started the qualifiers for next year’s Cup of Nations on a poor note after they fell to defeat at the hands of Sierra Leone in the opening match of the campaign. Though he is part of the squad, South Africa-based defender Brian Mandela will not feature in Saturday’s clash against the new look Black Stars. The Maritzburg United defender was sent off in the 41st minute of the duel in Freetown in June where Kenya lost 2-1. Click here for the latest political news
