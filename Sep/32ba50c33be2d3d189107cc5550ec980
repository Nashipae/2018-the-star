Motorists in Samburu have urged the Energy Regulatory Commission to crack the whip on fuel dealers in the region for selling fuel at extra prices. The motorists said they won't accept the high charges adding that is is the region's fuel prices were higher compared to the rest of the country. They noted that even after ERC reviewed the prices on Friday, petrol stations in Maralal, Baragoi and Wamba were selling fuel at old prices. A spot check on Sunday indicated that a litre of petrol was being sold at Sh150 in Baragoi and Wamba town while diesel was going Sh140 a litre. Prices were slightly lower in Maralal town as a litre of petrol was going for Sh139 while that of diesel was going for Sh131. The motorists said that they are now forced to travel all the way to Nyahururu or Nakuru where fuel is cheaper. "We are now forming groups, contributing money and sending a representative to Nyahururu to bring fuel in order to save money," Sammy Monjore said. ERC's latest review as at September 21 showed that a litre of petrol should be sold at Sh121.13 in Maralal, Sh112.68 for diesel, and Sh112.96 for kerosene. However, petrol station operators say they incur high costs in transport and security when bringing fuel from Nakuru to Maralal town.
