Deputy President William Ruto wants NHIF rates reviewed to cater for vulnerable groups. He said the Sh1,700 paid monthly is unfair for some categories of Kenyans. The DP said reviewing the charges will help the government achieve universal health care. "We cannot have people earning Sh500,000 a month paying a premium of Sh1,700 like those earning less than Sh50,000. They should pay Sh10,000 per month," Ruto said. He spoke in Kajiado on Monday during the Mbuzi Moja Afya Bora goat auction. Ruto said 1.5 million people are registered under the category of vulnerable groups have been enrolled on government's NHIF programme. President Uhuru Kenyatta and the DP bought 1,400 goats worth Sh10 million during the auction. All proceeds from the auction will support 5,000 families get NHIF medical cover in Kajiado. On the debate about the 16% VAT fuel tax, the DP said as much as the government is seeking to collect tax, it must be mindful of the common mwananchi. "We must not burden poor people. The people earning huge salaries should be taxed more," he said. "As a government, we must have a balance between looking for resources through taxes while not hurting the people." The DP said the Jubilee government's main focus is the Big Four agenda. "We cannot achieve our goals by making headlines in newspapers or politicking the whole year. We need good planning to spur development," he said. Read: NHIF cover for 1.7 million students under Uhuru plan See: NHIF will compensate parents who lose kids in school Sh600k
