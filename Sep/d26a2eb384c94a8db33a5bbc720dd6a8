Kirinyaga county will not pay Sh290 million pending bills from the last regime until a special audit is done by the Auditor General,Governor Anne Waiguru (pictured) has said. She addressed the press on Tuesday after meeting officials from Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation. Waiguru said most of the bills lack supporting documents. ‘’If we pay these bills, the EACC and the Office of the DPP will come for us. We have invited the Auditor General to do a special audit and only those found to be genuine will be paid,’’ the governor said. ‘’Some individuals, in collusion with a few rogue county staffs, sneaked bills during the transition period. They will not get a penny.” But former Governor Joseph Ndathi told the Star on the phone his government did not leave behind any pending bills. He said the county had Sh360 million in the revenue account to pay for incomplete projects. Waiguru said her government will consider completing some projects started by Ndathi’s administration. But she said some are of no benefit. ‘’In some cases you find an incomplete dispensary and after another three kilometres you find another incomplete dispensary,’’ she said.
