Card payments hit 127.34 million transactions between January and July this year compared to 124.34 million transactions over the same period in 2017, according to Central Bank of Kenya data. The data also captures an 10.38 per cent increase in number of ATMs, ATM Cards, and POS machines over the same period to 17.23 million in 2018 from 15.61 million in 2017. Kenya Bankers Association CEO Habil Olaka(pictured), said card transactions have faced stiff competition from mobile money transactions and any further growth will be determined by cost of transactions and other economic variables influencing the uptake of cards. “Our worry remains on how card usage is experiencing a modest growth while mobile money transactions in the country have picked up more than other economies,” Olaka said. Mobile money transactions still dominate with 663.73 million mobile money transactions recorded in 2017/2018 third quarter ending March 2018, according to Communication Authority. The transactions were valued at Sh1.87 trillion a 59.83 per cent increase from the third quarter ending March 2017 which recorded Sh1.17 trillion.
