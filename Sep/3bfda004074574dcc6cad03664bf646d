The Finance Bill seeking to suspend implementation of 16 per cent VAT on petroleum products is likely to be presented to President Uhuru Kenyatta today. National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi said once Attorney General Paul Kihara and Treasury agree on the contents of the Bill, he will present it to State House for the President to sign. Clerk Michael Sialai told the Star the Bill that was amended to suspend the implementation by another two years has been processed and ready. “The Bill is ready. We are only waiting for directions from the Speaker,” Sialai told the Star on the phone. Uhuru jetted back into the country on Sunday evening. He is said to have been consulting over the issue which has put him at a crossroad with Kenyans. There have been calls on the President to sign the Finance Bill, 2018. It is unclear why the President’s arrival from China, where he has been for almost a week, was not announced as it has been the tradition. “Yes, the President is back,” State House spokesperson Kanze Dena told the Star on the phone. Last Thursday, Muturi, Finance committee chairman Joseph Limo, Treasury CS Henry Rotich, Kihara, Solicitor General Ken Ogeto, deputy chief of staff Njee Muturi, Majority leader Aden Duale, Sialai and Budget committee chairman Kimani Ichung’wa met at Parliament Buildings. The three-hour meeting is said to have explored other areas of the bill which must be reviewed. Muturi said the matter will be resolved in due course.
