The Senate Public Accounts Committee has adjourned a sitting where it had invited Machakos governor Alfred Mutua to answer audit queries. The committee chaired by Homa Bay senator Moses Kajwan'g accepted Mutua's plea for adjournment. He is to attend a governors' meeting in Malindi on funding for arid and semi arid areas. Mutua said as much that the Senate invite was important, it was equally necessary to meet development partners in Malindi who had pledged billions to counties in ASAL areas. "A properly functioning democracy can never run away from accountability issues befitting public officers and we have to get it right for posterity sake,"' Mutua told the committee prior to the adjournment. Mutua appeared before the committee to answer queries on the Auditor General's report on the fiscal year 2014/2015. "I'm pleased that from the previous audit queries, we have been ably guided and continue to learn on best practices that will ensure the highest level of accountability in the County and the Country as a whole,"Mutua said. The Machakos was accompanied by deputy governor Francis Maliti, Chief officers for finance, Jacinta Masila and county executive committee executive for roads and public works, Moses Aluanga.
