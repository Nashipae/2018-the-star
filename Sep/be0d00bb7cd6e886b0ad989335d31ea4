Bungoma police are holding three brothers for allegedly
killing their sister’s lover. They are said to have killed 24-year-old Bonface Nyongesa on
Sunday night and slashed his penis in Muyekhe village, Kabuchai. Bungoma county commissioner
James Kiandaa said the three brothers will be arraigned once investigations are
completed. On Monday morning, passersby found the body of the deceased near a
road a few metres from the home of the suspects. The girl is said to be in Form Two. It is said the brothers
accused the lover of interfering with her studies. Residents and neighbours said Nyongesa had just responded to a
night invitation by his girlfriend at her place before he was attacked by the
three brothers. Ken Wamalwa said Nyongesa was hit on the head with a blunt object and
a rock. Nyongesa had been accompanied by his elder brother who fled, he said. Nyongesa’s
mother said he was killed elsewhere before the body was dumped by the roadside. Residents have expressed concern about rising crime. The killing
came after a woman from Bulema village in Kanduyi allegedly killed her
husband and cut off his private parts. Click
