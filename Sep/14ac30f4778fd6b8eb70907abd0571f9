Bungoma senator Moses Wetang’ula wants the government to change the route of the standard gauge railway line to follow the old one. He said diversion of the line from the old route was economic sabotage to the towns that fell under the former path. “You don’t empower some towns by killing the economy of other towns. The new line should follow the old line,” Wetang’ula said. He spoke in Bungoma town on Sunday. The new phase of the standard gauge railway will run from Naivasha to Kisumu-Malaba border. According to the government’s plan, Phase 2B of the SGR project will start at the planned Naivasha industrial park where Phase 2A ends. It will pass through Narok, Bomet and Kericho counties and terminate in Kisumu, where the government will put up a modern inland port. The railway line will have 25 stations, including a county station in Kisumu, then head to Malaba with six intermediate stations and 18 crossing stations. Kisumu will have a modern inland port in a project that will cost Sh380 billion.
