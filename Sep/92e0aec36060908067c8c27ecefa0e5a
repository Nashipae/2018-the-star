The Law Society of Kenya wants an alleged assassination plot against lawyer Charles Kanjama probed. Kanjama is representing the family of former Garissa Finance CEC Idris Mukhtar who escaped death on August 19. He was shot by a lone gunman captured on CCTV footage in Nairobi’s Kileleshwa last week and is admitted to Nairobi Hospital in critical condition. The lobby cited the death of key witness David Mwai as a pointer to interference with investigations. Mwai, who died in a Parklands police cell, is said to have confessed to the police how he was contracted to kill Mukhtar as he left a mosque in Kileleshwa. A report by police chiefs said the Mwai committed suicide, but the circumstances are unclear. LSK president Allen Gichuhi said Kanjama, who is the Nairobi LSK chairman, has reliably been informed by investigators he is a target for elimination.

"The loathe, lackadaisical and scattered responses so far are totally unacceptable," he said. Flying Squad arrested Garissa governor Ali Korane at his home over the ex-CEC's shooting.
