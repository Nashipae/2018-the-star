A bomb believed to have been left behind during the colonial era was found on Saturday at Mbaranga in Tigania East constituency. Children found the bomb on a farm while playing near a river. British soldiers used the area as a training camp. Antuanduru chief Jeremiah Murira said the bomb was taken by experts from Isiolo. "The children thought it was a scrap metal. We informed the police who collected it. This is not the first bomb to be found here. This was a military training ground during the colonial period," he said. Murira cautioned residents to be careful when they come across such suspicious objects. Click here for the latest political news
