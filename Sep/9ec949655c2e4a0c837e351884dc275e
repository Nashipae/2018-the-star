Deputy President William Ruto Will today break ground for a proposed public university in Kajiado. Thereafter, Ruto will preside over a grand auction of more than 10, 000 goats in Kajiado town, whose the proceeds will go towards helping the needy and vulnerable families access medical insurance under the National Hospital Insurance Fund scheme. The Deputy President, who will be hosted by Governor Joseph Lenku, is expected to lead more than 100 MPs and other leaders across the country in the goat auction, which is the first of its kind in the county. “I urge all our development partners to turn up at this noble event on Monday to assist our vulnerable people. The goat auction will be conducted at the county demonstration farm next to AIC Boarding Girls Primary School,” Lenku said. In an interview with the Star on Sunday, Lenku described the auction a unique way of providing universal health coverage to Kenyans. “We as a county has adopted a health coverage initiative through sale of goats, which will ensure needy households are safeguarded through medical insurance,” Lenku said on the phone. The governor said Kajiado county initiated “Mbuzi Moja Maisha Bora” programme, which is worth being emulated by other pastoralist counties since it is an ingenious way of achieving universal healthcare pillar of the Big Four agenda. Separately, county Health executive Esther Somoire said the proceeds of the goat auction will benefit vulnerable families in all the wards in the county. “This goat auction is almost a replica of famous Mogotio goat public auction in Baringo during former President Daniel Moi’s regime,” Somoire said.
