The government now has a Sh71 billion hole in its budget after MPs rejected VAT on fuel. The MPs also saved the bank interest rate cap after government had promised to drop it. We can argue all day over interest rate caps and VAT on fuel. But what is clear is that government wanted these changes and MPs blocked them. The executive is not being allowed to govern. The tail is wagging the dog. The government is led by President Uhuru Kenyatta, who was the Jubilee candidate in the 2017 election. Jubilee is the biggest party in Parliament and controls the majority. We can blame MPs for sabotaging government's economic policies but the greatest failure belongs to the Jubilee Party. If the Jubilee government wanted these changes, why didn't the party in the National Assembly support them? The Jubilee Party whip should have insisted that Jubilee MPs back VAT on fuel and end interest rate caps. Without party discipline in Parliament, Kenya will not have effective government. President Kenyatta should veto the Finance Bill as it now stands, send it back to the House, and insist that Jubilee MPs support his policies.
