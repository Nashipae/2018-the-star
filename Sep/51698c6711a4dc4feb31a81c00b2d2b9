A high school teacher has been stabbed to death in his car after he left a bar. Harold Wariuwa, a mathematics and physics teacher at Loreto Girls High School, Limuru, was stabbed on Sunday night. The motive was not immediately known and police did not release the name of the attacker. The man was lynched. Wariuwa had been drinking beer and watching a football match at Muna Pub on the outskirts of Limuru town. He left at 10 pm, Limuru police boss Eunice Githure said. Wariuwa was followed by a man, who also had also been taking beer. “A bar attendant wondered where the gentleman (assailant) had gone, since he had not paid his bill, She hurriedly followed him to ask him to pay,” Githure said The OCPD said the bar attendant saw the man stab the teacher with a kitchen knife through the open window of his car. She rushed back to the bar screaming. “All the customers and the other attendants went outside to witness. The suspect tried to run away but was nabbed by the mob and beaten to death,” the police boss said. Speaking at her Tigoni police station office, Githure said Wariuwa was reversing his Toyota Passo car, having lowered his windows when the assailant struck. He was stabbed several times in the neck, jaw and torso. “He died owing to loss of blood. He had so many injuries” she said. “Both the teacher and the assailant are dead. The bar attendants said the two were not seated at the same table, but different tables. We are trying to establish if there was anything going on between them,” Githure said. Efforts to get a comment from the school management yesterday were unsuccessful. The Kenya National Union of Teachers has not yet commented. Knut has complained about increasing attacks on teachers, mostly in terrorist activities in northern Kenya. The attacks had worsened when 28 Kenyans, 17 of them teachers, died in a terror attack in November 2014. The teachers were proceeding for holidays. The attackers claimed they were not targeting teachers.
