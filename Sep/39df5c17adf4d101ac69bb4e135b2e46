Residents of a location in Tana River county protested yesterday against the appointment of a new chief. The Chewele location residents rejected the promotion of assistant chief Abdi Adhan. Waving placards and chanting slogans, the protestors marched through the streets of Bura town saying Adhan is an “outsider” who does not even know the location’s boundaries. They temporarily disrupted business in Bura town. The protestors later converged outside the office of Tana North subcounty deputy commissioner Chaka Nyamawi, whom they accused of rejecting applications from the community’s candidates. They read out a memorandum to the press that they had presented to Nyamawi last week. The administrator was not available for comment when the Star called him. Nyamawi said he was in a meeting and would call back, but never did. In the memorandum, the protestors said they have a number of qualified candidates who could have filled the post of chief. The position fell vacant following the death of chief Juma Charero in 2016. Adhan has been holding the position in acting capacity since then. Chewele youth leader Ali Duke said residents are not comfortable with the chief since he does not understand their way of life and the community will not recognise him. “He should pack and go to his previous post of assistant chief. We have no problem with that, but he should forget about being our chef,” Duke said. Resident Abdirahman Bamaro said the Wailwana are a minority community who live along the River Tana, but the government wants to suppress them by denying them a post that is rightfully theirs. Amina Daye dismissed the new chief as an outsider who might have a hard time solving land disputes owing to his little knowledge of the community. President Kenyatta ordered official recognition of the Wailwana and Mnywoyaya communities of Tana River county in May last year. Click here for the latest political news
