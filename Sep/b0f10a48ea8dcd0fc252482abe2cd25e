President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday affirmed Kenya’s support for a historic UN Political Declaration of 2019-2028 as the Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace. The President asked other world leaders to emulate the values that defined the global icon who was the first democratically elected President of South African. Speaking during the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit, on the sidelines of the 73rd United Nations General Assembly in New York, Uhuru said Kenya is committed to Mandela's values that defined his legacy. This include promotion of peace, reconciliation, non-discrimination as well as protection and promotion of human rights. "I welcome, in particular, the recognition of the period 2019 to 2028 as the Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace as a constant reminder to all Member States to redouble efforts in the pursuance of peace, development and human rights," said President Kenyatta. He described Mandela as a beacon of hope, whose ideals continue to inspire Kenya to nurture and consolidate social cohesion and peaceful coexistence between people of different tribes and races. "Madiba inspires us to seek regional peace and political stability," Uhuru said. He said that Kenya has over the years supported peace and political stabilisation of Somalia through hosting and facilitation of negotiations, contributing troops to AMISOM and providing technical support. The Head of State said through regional and international support, remarkable progress has been made in achieving peace and security in Somalia. On the South Sudan peace process, the President underlined the progress. He said Kenya and other IGAD member countries are seeking a sustainable solution to the political challenges facing the young nation.

"We earnestly hope that in the spirit of this Peace Summit, parties to the Revitalised Agreement will set their differences aside and work together in its implementation for the good of South Sudanese who have borne the brunt of the unnecessary civil war," Uhuru said. Uhuru said the greatest honour world leaders can bestow on Madiba and other African heroes is to emulate them. "We should rededicate ourselves to African solidarity with shared values of freedom and human dignity," the President said. "We should seek homegrown solutions to our challenges and pursue amicable negotiated settlement to disputes for sustainable peace and political stability which are prerequisites for meaningful socio-economic development," he said. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who opened the day-long peace event, asked world leaders to build on Nelson Mandela’s legacy. His fight against apartheid marked a landmark in human rights and freedom, the UN boss said. "Today, we remember a man of great wisdom, quiet dignity and towering achievement, who worked tirelessly for peace and human dignity for people everywhere," Guterres said. To commemorate the peace summit, he unveiled a statue of Mandela at UN headquarters in New York. Before the summit, President Uhuru joined other world leaders in committing themselves to taking specific measures aimed at combating the drug menace. US President Donald Trump said the scourge of drug addiction can be firmly dealt with if leaders join hands to come up with specific measures to dismantle cartels and save lives. "All of us must work together to dismantle drug production and defeat drug addiction," Trump said. Earlier, President Uhuru held bilateral talks with the President of Austria Alexander Van der Bellen. The Austrian leader invited Uhuru to the Africa-European Union Summit to be held in Austria in December. Kenya will play a pivotal role as a role model for Africa in innovation and technology at the conference. Uhuru invited Van der Bellen, who was accompanied by his Federal Chancellor SÃ©bastien Kurz, to the Blue Economy Conference to be held in Nairobi on November 27. The President sought Austria's support in Kenya’s bid for a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in the period 2021 to 2022. Click here for the latest political news
