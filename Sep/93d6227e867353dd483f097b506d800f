Over 184 golfers have conformed participation in the Oxygene, Tropical Brands Afrika Golf Day tomorrow at Ruiru Sports Club. The golfers will be battling it out for top honours and prizes during the event as the two firms make their second return to the Thika Road-based par 72 course. Ruiru Sports Club captain Peter Mwaura expressed his gratitude to the two corporates for sponsoring the weekend event and revealed that the course was currently playing well. “We have received great entries for the game and we are grateful we are hosting this event for the second year running. This is a show of the club’s growing and strong partnership with the two brands,” the captain said. Oxygene’s Partner Mutahi Mureithi said: “We are passionate about growing the game of golf and sports in general in the country. We see this as a way of engaging with our customers and potential customers.” Some of the key players to watch out for during this tournament include Muraguri K, Kairu Mwaura, Mitii Patrick, and Munyua Kimani who were top winners last weekend. Lady golfers Catherine Wambui, Beatrice Waweru are also expected to offer stiff competition to the huge field of golfers after impressive performances during last weekend’s Mt Kenya Leisure Lodge golf day at the same venue.
