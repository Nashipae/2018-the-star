Manyatta MP John Muchiri wants the Inua Jamii and free maternity programme scrapped so Kenyans are not overtaxed. Inua Jamii involves cash transfer to the elderly, orphans and vulnerable children, and persons living with severe disability. Muchiri said the programmes promote laziness and the culture of handouts and burden Kenyans with heavy taxation. Instead, he wants the cash channelled to socioeconomic projects that would empower people so they become self-reliant. It can be invested in farming and the cottage (jua kali) industry. The lawmaker spoke during the launch of a cooler at Mburugu Dairy Cooperative Society limited in Kiriari market in Embu North. “The government should come up with proper measures that ensure even the less fortunate or the elderly are empowered economically through farming and other socioeconomic activities,” Muchiri said. He urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to come up with a tax system that does not hurt wananchi. Muchiri said he and colleagues opposed to the eight per cent fuel levy will will not relent in their efforts to ensure Kenyans are not burdened. Muchiri said high taxation raises the cost of living and ruin lives.
