A postmortem on two men killed in Kenyenya subcounty on Wednesday has established that one was shot and the other hit with a blunt object. Dr Benjamin Ndibile, who conducted the exercise, said Hosbon Nyachoka died from one gunshot injury. He said the bullet penetrated Nyakocha’s body from the right side of chest and went through the left side. “The postmortem I have carried on Nyachoka established that he died as a result of one gunshot. He died on the spot because of excessive bleeding,” Ndibile said at Hema Hospital where he conducted the exercise. It was witnessed by lawyer Edward Begi, who represented the two bereaved families. Ndebile said that the other victim, identified only as Ondari, died after he was hit by a blunt object on the head. The pathologist said Ondari also had bruises on the back and on the left hand, which may not have caused his death. He said that Ondari’s stomach will also be examined to establish whether he succumbed to internal bleeding. Relatives said when they took him to Kenyenya sub-county hospital, blood was oozing from his mouth and nose. " Ondari’s stomach will be taken to the government chemist in Kisumu where it will be opened to establish whether he died as a result on internal bleeding,” Ndebile said. He will release the full report next week on Friday. Ndibile said other body samples will be taken to Kisumu for analysis and results will be released by the Government chemist after three months. The two died after residents held protest over the killing of a matatu tout who was trailed by police to Magenche area.
