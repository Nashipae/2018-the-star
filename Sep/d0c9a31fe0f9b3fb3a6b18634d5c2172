The main suspect in the murder of Rongo university student Sharon Otieno has been moved to a Nairobi court to take plea. Michael Oyamo, an aide of Migori Governor Okoth Obado, was transferred for charges to be read to him over the murder. Homa Bay DCIO Joseph Tuksho said Oyamo left Homa Bay police station under tight security. "The suspect is going to be charged at a Nairobi court today. A fleet of 16 security vehicles picked him in the morning," Tuksho said. The DCI officer said Oyamo could not appear at Homa Bay High Court due to tension the matter has attracted in Homa Bay. The matter has also attracted great public interest. "The gravity of the matter also could not allow police to produce Oyamo any court around. The public is not calm about it,"  he said. On Monday afternoon, Homa Bay senior resident magistrate Lester Simiyu directed the DPP and OCS to ensure Oyamo appears at the Homa Bay High  court on Tuesday at 9am. Simiyu said continuous holding the suspect in custody would amount to a violation of his rights. "We don’t want to violate rights of a suspect by holding him for long in police custody. I order that the accused be arraigned in High Court tomorrow or he be released from police custody," Simiyu said. Defence lawyers Niville Amolo, June Ashioya and Rogers Abisai remained in state of confusion after they failed to see Oyamo in court. Amolo said they want to know whereabouts of their client. "We’ve
been in court since 8:30am but can’t see our client appearing. The
state breached the court directive that wanted Oyamo charged by 9am," Amolo said. Read: DCI officers grill Okoth Obado over Sharon's murder See: Ex-Homa Bay MCA in Sharon Otieno's murder case detained 14 days Click here for the latest political news
