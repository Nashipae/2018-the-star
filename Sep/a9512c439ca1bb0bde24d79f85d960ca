Cherangany MP Joshua Kuttuny wants the government to compensate Mau evictees. He said it is unfair to kick people out of the land the had bought empty-handed. The MP spoke on Saturday at a burial in Ngonyek in his constituency. Kuttuny told Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji and Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to arrest Narok Senator Ledama ole Kenta over alleged incitement. He wondered why the senator is still a free man yet there is a video that has gone viral on social media with disturbing utterances. Kuttuny said it is not the first time that leaders are inciting residents living around Mau Forest. "It is not in order that after the senator abused another community and called the people warmongers, no action has been taken against him," Kuttuny said.

They also want an overhaul of the entire security team for allegedly taking sides in the tribal skirmishes. At the same time, Kuttuny warned the government against high taxation. “I'm in Jubilee, it is our government, but I will not keep quiet. Last time I supported the government and voters home for five years. This time round let me stand with the people," the MP said. Kimilili MP Chris Wamalwa supported his colleague on his stand about the senator. Click here for the latest political news
