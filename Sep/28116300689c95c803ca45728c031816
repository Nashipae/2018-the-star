Hundreds of traders at Sofia market in Homa Bay town yesterday protested against the county government’s plan to evict them from their stalls. They accused Cyprian Awiti’s administration of issuing a five-day vacation notice without providing an alternative place. They have until Sunday to leave or their property will be destroyed. The eviction is to pave the way for construction of a stadium. The space will be used as a parking area for those who will be attending matches and events at the proposed facility. Yesterday, traders, led by market chairman Richard Opiyo, said the notice is too short and caught them unawares. “The eviction letter we received on Wednesday indicated we should vacate by Sunday. We won’t leave because we’ve not been provided with an alternative place,” Opiyo said. He said they will hold peaceful demos at the county’s sports offices. They warned that they will stay put until they are provided with an alternative space. “We’ll demonstrate to show our dissatisfaction with what the county government intends to do,” Onyango said. James Ouma appealed to Sports executive Roseline Odhiambo to consider their plight and get them a place. He said they are already counting losses because customers fear possible fracas. “We’re ready to vacate the place, but let’s be showed a place where to go. I’m ready to demolish my stall and reconstruct it elsewhere,” Ouma said. Last month, the Sports department said it will partner with the Trade docket to have the traders relocated. Odhiambo said evictions should be systematic. “No one will be forcibly ejected. We want them to move peacefully without fracas,” he said. MCA Mary Odira urged the county government to suspend the plan for three months. “The traders need a grace period of at least three months to decide on where to relocate,” he said.
