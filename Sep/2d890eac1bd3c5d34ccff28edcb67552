The government has been urged to partner with pastoral counties to adopt ways that would motivate pastoralists to keep camels for sports and milk. Livestock keepers say camels can yield more and improve their incomes. The government plans to improve the annual international camel race held in Yare, Samburu county. Former Samburu West MP Simeon Lesirma, now a farmer, yesterday said residents can bring their camels for hire during the race and sell their “rare medicinal milk for good prices” to increase their incomes. “It’d have been better if Samburu, Marsabit and Baringo administrations motivated farmers to keep camels for sports and milk,” he said. The farmers incurred huge losses in the recently concluded camel derby. Local and foreign tourists did not attend. In previous events, they used to hire their camels for a race competition and fun.
