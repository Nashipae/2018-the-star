National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi on Thursday presented to President Uhuru Kenyatta, the Finance Bill, 2018, which suspends the 16 per cent tax on petroleum products. State House Spokesperson Kanze Dena acknowledged that the president received the legislation which was approved by the National Assembly on August 30. The Head of State has 14 days to either assent to the Bill or send it back to Parliament for review if he is not satisfied with the proposals contained therein. A Bill automatically becomes law if the days elapse without the President's action on the same. The 16% VAT was imposed on September 1, resulting into a sharp increase in fuel prices. The introduction of the charge has seen fuel prices rise to Sh130 per litre for petrol and almost Sh100 for kerosene. The mid-month review is due on Friday. The decision sparked protests among Kenyans who have in various platforms reached out to the president to sign the Finance Bill, 2018 to cushion them from the high costs. The National Treasury, the proponents of the tax, put forth the measures in the wake of IMF's requirement that they improve on revenue collection so that the country can be a position to be advanced development loans. Various government officials have also cited the Uhuru's Big Four development agenda as one of the reasons Kenyans have to pay the tax despite the pressure on their income in the face of high cost of living. Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria is among the legislators who have said the country has no other alternatives for raising revenues to reach the levels set by IMF. In a recent interview with Citizen TV, he said the citizenry will have to pay the VAT. "Take it to the bank," he said. Should Uhuru assents to the Bill, the VAT will be suspended bringing down the cost of fuel.
