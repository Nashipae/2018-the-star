For the fourth year in a row, Kariobangi Sharks will be in the last four of the Sportpesa Shield after they stunned record winners Gor Mahia 4-2 on post match penalties after the tie had ended goalless in regulation time. Sharks were the dominant team against a K’Ogalo side that looked jaded after their continental travails earlier in the week. But for the heroics of goalkeeper Peter Odhiambo who denied Eric Kapaiti and George Abege in either half, Gor would have been knocked out inside the 90 minutes. Pascal Ogweno, Bolton Omwenga, Gad Matthews and Duke Obuya converted for Sharks while Gor Mahia scored through Francis Mustapha and Boniface Omondi. Earlier, the battle of former champions saw Sofapaka come from behind to knock out 2016 champions Tusker. The brewers got off to a flying start with Jackson Macharia side-footing the ball home inside five minutes after exchanging passes with Boniface Muchiri. The brewers had barely taken in their lead than Sofapaka leveled. A long ball picked out Kevin Kimani on the right and the diminutive winger curled in a freekick that was nodded home by Umaru Kasumba. Second half substitute Ezekiel Okare rifled the ball home from the edge of the box as Sofapaka legend and current tactician John Baraza outfoxed his former coach Robert Matano. The duo now join AFC Leopards and Ulinzi Stars, who prevailed over unheralded rivals on Saturday. The two former winners recorded identical 4-1 wins over Kenya Police and Riverplate respectively in the quarterfinals played at the Bukhungu Stadium, Kakamega. A goal apiece by Whyvonne Isuza, Ezekiel Odera, Eugene Mukangula and Brian Marita were enough to see Ingwe past Police, in their quest to retain the cup they won last season. Victor Majid’s own goal served as the law enforcers’ consolation. Ulinzi Stars, meanwhile, got their goals through Enos Ochieng, Ibrahim Shambi, Daniel Waweru and Elijah Mwanzia, with Kennedy Wandiri striking a late consolation for the Western Branch League side.
