Senators have defended the decision to take their sittings to Eldoret, terming the move constitutional and necessary for the success of devolution. Speaker Kenneth Lusaka said this is the first time a parliamentary house has taken its sittings outside Nairobi as provided for in the Constitution. “Since devolution started we have been operating from Nairobi, yet we are an oversight body for counties. We made the right decision to come down to the counties, so we can interact with Kenyans and know how they want us to work for them,” said Lusaka. Chairman of the Senate Public Accounts and Investments Committee Moses Kajwang said those questioning the importance and cost of Senate mashinani are wrong. “We don’t want to be like a father who works in Nairobi and always asks his family to visit him in the city but he never goes home. We have decided to come home and see for ourselves how everything is going on,” Kajwang said. Senate Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen and his Minority counterpart James Orengo said the Senate trip to Uasin Gishu was an eye-opener and that the House should have similar visits to other counties. Critics have questioned the cost of the exercise and whether it adds value to the lives of Kenyans. The team of 67 senators and more than 50 staff have camped in Eldoret where they are putting up in top hotels.
