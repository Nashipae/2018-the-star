Schools involved in examination irregularities will be closed down and managers held liable, Kenya National Examination Council has said. KNEC chairperson George Magoha said the council has delegated the responsibility of exams integrity to principals to reduce the number of people handling test papers. He said the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) and Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exams will begin on October 30 October and November 2, respectively. Magoha was addressing education stakeholders at Pangani Girls High School. To ensure exams are not sabotaged, KNEC will use invigilators registered as teachers by the Teachers Service Commission. Magoha said last year some teachers who worked as invigilators were not registered and it was difficult to follow up on exam cheats. During this year's exams, students will sit 1.2 metres apart to prevent copying. Supervisors are not allowed to take gifts from head teachers. The council has acquired 415 containers to secure examinations. Principals will pick exams and deliver them to supervisors. They will be designated transport and security. Magoha said supervisors will visit exam centres to asses possible sabotage of exam materials. Two security officers will be deployed to each centre. In urban areas, exam papers are to be returned to the containers not more than 30 minutes after a test since collection points are at least 10km from exam centres.
