A businessman has sued KRA and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations for seizing and illegally detaining a consignment of motor vehicle tryes worth Sh1.9 million. The case was filed under a certificate of urgency by Mohamed Osman. He is the director of Global Africa Auto Tyres. Osman says his goods were illegally impounded and detained by KRA and DCI on June 14. Through lawyer Mohamud Muhamed, Osman says he has learnt that the commissioner of customs and KRA's commissioner of investigations and enforcement are in the process of disposing of the goods. The agency claims the goods are liable for forfeiture, Osman said in affidavits. “I've been importing motor vehicle tyres from China since April but I have been forced to close shop since all the stock was seized by KRA and DCI,” Osman says. He said a criminal case has been instituted against him and that he has been summoned in court over the matter. Osman said he is expected to take plea on September 27. He wants the court to suspend the criminal case and compel KRA and DCI to release the the 2,962 tyres impounded without imposing warehouse charges. Court documents indicate Osman imported motor vehicle tyres from China in a single container in June. The container had 2,240 pieces of different categories and sizes of motor tyres. He also had a stock of 722 tryes imported in May. The goods allegedly arrived at the port of Mombasa on June 11 and 13 and were processed and cleared at the Inland Container Depot in Nairobi after Osman paid duties, taxes and other charges. The total costs amount to Sh1.9 million. On June 14, the tryes were loaded in two trailers destined for Osmans godown in Eastleigh, Nairobi. Police impounded the goods as they were being offloaded.
