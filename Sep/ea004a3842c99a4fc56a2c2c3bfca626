Kenyan teenage model Stacy Wangui took second place at the just-concluded Few’s Next Face Africa 2018 competition. The 17-year-old was among the top 10 finalists who competed in the finals on Sunday at Grand Palace Hotel in Lagos, Nigeria. Dotain Yeshitela from Ethiopia won the title, trumping other finalists to win the international competition. She won Sh200,000, three-year modelling contract with Few Models and IMG Models Worldwide (Paris, Milan, London, New York, Australia). Stacy attributed her passion for modelling to her journey of self-discovery, which made her accept herself after being bullied through primary school, forcing her to be home schooled. She found her purpose in life, which led her to become more confident and comfortable in her own skin, and got her to the top three position of Few’s Next Face 2018. Stacy is currently signed with Mochez Models in Kenya. Mochez is a modeling and casting agency based in Nairobi. It started in 2009 to train dancers and models, but has since grown into a leading casting agency that includes actors of all ages founded by Dorothy Oliech.
