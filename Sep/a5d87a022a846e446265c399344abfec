STARRING: Anna Kendrick, Blake Lively, Henry Golding, Andrew Rannells DIRECTED BY: Susanna Fogel BASED ON: A Simple Favor by Darcey Bell RELEASE DATE: September 14  Stephanie Smothers is a single stay-at-home mom who runs a housewife-themed vlog. She ends up befriending Emily, the hot-cool mom at her son’s school, since their sons insist on having playdates together. Emily invites Stephanie and her son to their house. While the boys play, Emily and Stephanie drink and trade secrets from their pasts. The two moms become close friends over a surprisingly short time. But their friendship is short-lived when Emily asks Stephanie the simple favour of picking up her son from school. Emily ends up missing that day, leaving Stephanie with the burning desire of finding her friend. As Stephanie digs into Emily’s past, she uncovers a web of twisted dark secrets that could scare anyone into hiding. The stories of these so-called ‘soccer moms’ have always been intriguing. Remember the case of the New York mom caught growing weed in her house? They always seem to have it all on the outside, but if you look closely, there are dark secrets dictating their lives. This is the case in A Simple Favor. A lavish lifestyle can mean bankruptcy, and a beautiful young woman can actually be a crazed monstrous killer. Although the film grapples with genre, as it slips in and out of comedy, mystery and thriller, the characters are what hold the story together. Kendrick and Lively’s on-screen friendship draws in the audience and keeps them invested as they navigate the treacherous labyrinths of female friendships. The measure of a good film is when we leave the theatre drawing comparisons to our everyday lives. Is doing a simple favour for a friend really that simple? The film also stars Crazy Rich Asians’ breakout star Henry Golding.  Star Rating: 4/5
