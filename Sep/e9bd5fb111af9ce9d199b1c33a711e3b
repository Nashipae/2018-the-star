Police officers manning a power installation in Kiunga, Lamu county, from the regular police have not received allowances for nine months. The allowances are for securing a KenGen main generator which sits on four acres. “There was payment in form of allowances of securing the facility but it stopped. We don’t know what happened,” an officer said. There are about 12 regular police officers manning the facility in two shifts. Each officer was paid about Sh500 per shift. Coast regional police commander Noah Mwivanda yesterday said the officers are ‘victims of rationalisation’. Mwivanda said deployment in Lamu was rationalised and all those who had been deployed in the county were transferred there permanently. “We said instead of deploying people from different areas for three months, let’s absorb those already in Lamu.” “Their service station is Lamu county now and they do not attract any allowance,” Mwivanda said on the phone.
