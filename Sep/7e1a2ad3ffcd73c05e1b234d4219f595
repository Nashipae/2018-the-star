All members of the once-thriving hip hop group Camp Mulla have steadily moved on to solo careers. The truth is, none has managed to outdo the impact they had as a collective. The numbers back this up. They influenced the music industry in a big way and undoubtedly dominated the industry when they needed to, but no member has managed to transcend the group’s success to showcase the most promise as solo artistes. Shappaman was truly a dominant figure back when Camp Mulla was hot, but hasn’t been quite as visible since he branched out. He has worked with many artistes including Blinky Bill, Barak Jacuzzi, Bobby Mapesa, Calvo Mistari and Nuru, creating some significant effect on each of the tracks he has been featured on. He has also been fortunate to showcase his brilliance on the Coke Studio cypher alongside stars like Fid Q, Sugar, Abbas and Wangechi. For an artiste who once had all things looking right for him, it’s quite unfortunate that he lacks an extensive catalogue of his own. Early signs indicated that he was going to maintain an alternative hip hop sound, like he did on the “Love Wild” mixtape, but two years on, he knows he needs to stay relevant with the trends and make music that will be easily accepted. His latest release, Surfin’, deviates from the expected as he embraces a more afro-pop sound familiar with the mainstream. Judging from this approach, it is obvious he has taken his time to study the music scene, and he now understands what works best for the market. This time, he maintains a West African sound, maybe with the aim of trying to tap into the already-booming industry, or simply it could be his current vibe. It’s a bold statement, considering the pre-held perspective we have of the artiste. To some extent, it could be the start of something fresh.
