Migori Governor Okoth Obado will be charged with the murder of Rongo University Student Sharon Otieno, the DCI has confirmed. In a Twitter post on Friday, the DCI said Obado was arrested after recording his second statement at their headquarters in Kiambu. "He is currently in lawful custody at Gigiri Police Station. He will be in court on Monday to face charges of murder of university student," the tweet reads. Obado was grilled for hours by officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations after he reported there at 10am. The county chief has denied any link to the murder of the 26-year-old student but admitted they were lovers. Last week, Obado told the police in Kisumu that he was equally interested in knowing Sharon’s killers. This was the first time he was questioned over the incident.

He said it was unfair for the governor to be arrested "without even checking what he had recorded in his second statement". Sharon's body was on September 5 found dumped in a thicket near Kodera forest, Homa Bay county after her abduction on September 2. She was in the company of Nation journalist Barack Oduor who says he escaped from the hands of the abductors. Two suspects, being Obado's PA Michael Oyamo and former Kanyadoto MCA Lawrence Mula were arrested and charged owing to their link to the student's killing. There were reports Obado's wife Hellen was summoned on Wednesday for interrogation as a person of interest in the crime under probe. However, it remains unclear whether she was probe or not, and at which police station.
