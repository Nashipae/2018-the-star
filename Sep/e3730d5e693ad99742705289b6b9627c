On-form left attacker Leonida Kasaya sat out of training sessions yesterday as the national women’s volleyball team wrapped up their training ahead of their departure this evening for the FIVB World Championship in Tokyo Japan. Team’s coach Japheth Munla said there is no cause for alarm but remained hopeful that the hard-hitting Kenya Pipeline player will be fit for selection prior to the event set to run from September 29 to October 20. Munala said: “We hope she will have recovered well before the event. It is not serious and we expect her to be fit again for selection soon.” Meanwhile, a number of the national women’s volleyball team players return to familiar grounds but different competition. Save for sensational setter Jane Wacu, who was part of the team that played in the 2010 World Championship, majority of the team were in Japan for the World Cup in 2015. In an interview, Wacu said the team is in high spirit ahead of the championship but was quick to note that they will have to use the 10 ball if they have to earn more points at the three-week event. “Most of our players here have mastered the use of 10 balls and they are scoring points at will in the training. I hope we will apply the same at the championships in place of the usual balls on the net,” said Wacu. Among the players, who were in Japan for World Cup, are Jane Wacu, Triza Atuka, Jannet Wanja, Noel Murambi, Elizabeth Wanyama, Edith Wisa and captain Mercy Moim. The remaining players including Emmaculate Chemtai, Violet Makuto, Agripina Kundu, Christine Siwa, Lorraine Chebet, Sharon Chepchumba and Leonida Kasaya will debut. At the same time, team Munala said they are targeting at least two wins in the championship which will see them proceed to the next round. “Our target is the second round and we only need to win at least two matches to proceed to the next stage,” Said Munala. Kenya are drawn in Pool ‘D’ alongside former champions Brazil, Serbia, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and Kazakhstan.
