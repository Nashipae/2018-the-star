Two suspects in the murder of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno will remain in custody for 10 more days. Kisii senior principal magistrate Lutta Shiundu allowed an application by the state council for investigators to complete their work. Prosecutor George Muhindi asked the court to direct that the accused Caspal Ajwang and Omondi Okoth Elvis be detained in Keroka or any other police station. He said investigators are following crucial leads, and if the suspects are released they will interfere with the probe. Muhindi said more suspects are being sought. "The suspects were attached to Governor Okoth Obado’s security detail, they should be taken back to custody because of the complexity of the case," Muhindi said. He said despite the crime being committed in Migori, it was not filed there because of security reasons. However, lawyers representing the suspects objected to the application. They said seeking for more days will be a violation of their clients' constitutional rights. Shiundu ruled that the matter will be mentioned on September 28.
