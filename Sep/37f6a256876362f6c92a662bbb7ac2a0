Chief Justice David Maraga has demanded speedy investigations into the killing of Meru senior resident magistrate Caroline Kemei's daughter. In a condolence message on Monday, he condemned the circumstances under which 9-year-old Maribel Kapolon died. Maribel's body was found dumped in a thicket in Meru on Sunday night. The pupil of Consolata primary school was kidnapped on her way home on September 6.

The Supreme Court president  further assured the family that efforts are underway to punish the girl's killers. "The Interior Cabinet Secretary and Director of Criminal Investigations have assured me that everything is being done to bring them to book," he added. The Githongo law court magistrate's case is not the first time where the life of a Judiciary officer has been in danger. In December 2017, Maraga called upon the Inspector General Joseph Boinnet to beef up court official's security. This followed after Kwale chief magistrate Doreen Mulekyo was carjacked. In October last year, Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwiluâ€™s bodyguard was shot three times, an incident reported days to the October 26, 2017 repeat vote.
