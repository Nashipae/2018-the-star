Two deputy governors have appealed to Deputy President William Ruto to settle on a woman as running mate in 2022 presidential race. Samburu's Julius Leseeto and Kirinyaga's Peter Ndambiri said they support Ruto's bid but want him to consider working with Governor Anne Waiguru as his number two. They said that Waiguru's leadership skills had proved that she would make a good deputy president. "Kenyans are convinced that given an opportunity to serve the entire nation, Waiguru would serve very well," Ndambiri said. They said it was time the country changed tact and elected a woman to the seat which has been dominated by male candidates since Kenya's independence in 1063. Leseeto said he will lead campaigns for Samburus to support the deputy president's bid. "We are asking our people and all Kenyans to look at that team as it will be of help to the nation," he said. Leseeto said that they encourage women to stand and be counted. "Waiguru should also be counted in the list of those being fronted to be deputy president," he added. In an interview with Citizen TV on Wednesday, Waiguru hinted at working with the DP in 2022 adding that their relationship is 'cordial and professional'. She said that being a member of the Jubilee Party, Kenyans should expect to see her and Ruto having a lot of interactions. Click here for the latest political news
