Two reservists and an administration police officer were injured by armed bandits in Ramacha, Baringo South sub-county on Saturday. The security officers had accompanied Tugen and Ilchamus residents in an ongoing bush clearing operation to resettle thousands of their members who were displaced by bandits since 2005. “The officers were just conducting normal border patrols when the armed bandits laid ambush and shot in the air around 2pm,” Arabal location chief William Koech said. The incident comes barely three days after a Tugen herder was shot and injured in the same area on Thursday. Last month, newly-elected Baringo South MP Charles Kamuren ordered back Pokot herders grazing thousands of their livestock in his constituency. “Mukutani, Arabal, Rugus, Noosukro and Kapndasum are in Baringo South therefore Pokots should leave to Tiaty so I can resettle my people,” Kamuren said after being declared winner of the by-election in Marigat town on August 18. On Friday the Tugen and Ilchamus residents, armed with pangas and arrows, vowed to fight for their resettlement, “even if it means dying for our rights.” Koech said the injured officers might have been injured by rocks after jumping from their moving vehicles. The three were rushed to Baringo County Referral Hospital in Kabarnet town where they are currently undergoing treatment. Nurses at the hospital said they were in stable condition. They said X-ray examination shows none of them sustained gunshot injuries. Tension is still high on the ground. Koech said the entire area is abandoned and bushy, making it difficult to locate the enemies. “We cannot tell their mission exactly because there was no livestock around when the bandits shot in the air before vanishing to the bushes within flash of seconds,” he said. Kamuren visited the victims in hospital yesterday. “Nothing whatsoever will stop us from reclaiming our land and resettling my displaced people,” he said.
