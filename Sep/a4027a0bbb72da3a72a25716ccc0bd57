Nonini has signed a six-month contract to be Safaricom’s brand ambassador, a deal that’s likely to position him as the king of the internet. The godfather of Genge music will be the face of Safaricom’s brand campaigns, which will include the use of his image, voice and content. One of the campaigns include the Giga bundle, which gives subscribers access to 1GB. Nonini also runs the Colour kwa Face Foundation, which advocates the rights of people living with albinism. “Safaricom, being the number one communication company in Kenya, will be supporting me in my album launch, and my other music [ventures] and reaching out to the community with any charity work,” he said Nonini is ready to do his best and welcomes the opportunity for other artistes to get such deals. During the course of the partnership, Nonini will educate fellow artistes on monetising their songs and creative endeavours by registering and joining Skiza. “We settled on this partnership with Nonini because he is a pioneer of new-age Kenyan music popularly known as Genge, is passionate about artistes’ rights through his involvement with Prisk and other organisations that fight for artistes’ rights,” said Charles Kare, acting director- Consumer Business, Safaricom.
