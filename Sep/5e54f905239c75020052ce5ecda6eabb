Teso South MP Geoffrey Omuse has said he is working with former MP Mary Emaase for the sake of the people. On Saturday, the two met for the first time since the 2017 general election during a funeral in Apokor. They assured the residents that they have embraced a new chapter in their political journey aimed at bringing peace, unity and development for all. Omuse urged Emase to forget their past differences and forge ahead for the sake of the electorate. The two leaders told the Teso South residents they have finally buried the hatchet and agreed to work for the constituents, regardless of party or political affiliations. The split between the two politicians deepened after the August 8, 2017 general election when Emaase of Jubilee was trounced by Omuse of ODM. Emaase’s application at the High Court in Busia for a recount and scrutiny was later dismissed with costs by judge Kiarie Waweru on January 31. Kiarie dismissed the petition on grounds of lack of evidence. Emaase cited fraudulent tallying of votes by the returning officer. Emaase said she is ready to work with Omuse. "Some people here have been celebrating our differences. They feed you mheshimiwa with propaganda all the time, but I am ready to advise you on matters of development in our constituency, anytime," Emaase told Omuse. The MP said he should be given “peace” to complete the projects he has started, without much politics. "With or without Emaase or Omuse life will go on. The most important thing is for a leader to use his or her tenure wisely to serve his constituents," Omuse said. Commenting on the war against corruption, Omuse called upon the Directorate of Public Prosecution’s office to have concrete evidence before making the arrests. "It is very unfortunate to see DPP’s office seeking more time to conduct investigations after already arraigning graft suspects in court," he said. Click here for the latest political news
