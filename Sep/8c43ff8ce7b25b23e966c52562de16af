A form two student at Nyangau Mixed Secondary School
committed suicide after being left by his girlfriend in the same. The body of Eutycus Onyango, 18, was found on Sunday dangling from a rope tied to a eucalyptus tree in the middle of their homestead. North East Kamagambo
chief Charles Ouma Owuor said a relative who had left at dawn saw the body and
alerted others who reported the matter. “He left a suicide note that he chose to commit suicide
after his girlfriend left him,” Owuor said. His relatives said the deceased was distraught when he came
home from school and kept to himself throughout the evening before going to
bed. Rongo OCPD Peter Kirui said the body was taken to Rosewoord
Mortuary awaiting postmortem examinations. Click here for the latest political news
