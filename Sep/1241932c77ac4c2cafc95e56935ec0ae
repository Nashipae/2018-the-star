Jose Chameleone’s wife Daniella Atim has for the first time opened up about how her secondborn son, Alfa, was born prematurely. While wishing him a happy 10th birthday, she wrote: “I can’t seem to stop replaying your birth in my mind, how you came out prematurely at only 26 weeks of my pregnancy, weighing a mere 1.1kg, how I had no hope that you would make it, but look at you now, who would ever believe that you were that baby; you are my miracle child and Gods reminder to me everyday of his might. “We stayed in hospital for 2 weeks only and came home when you made 1.7kg and I had to always carry you “kangaroo style” and many times I kept a thermometer in your cot so that we could maintain a normal temperature.”
