Global beverage maker Coca-Cola has denied claims that it plans to start making marijuana-infused drinks. A statement on the firm's website dated September 17, said the company has no interest in cannabis or in marijuana as reported by international media outlets. "We have no interest in marijuana or cannabis. Along with many others in the beverage industry, we are closely watching the growth of non-psychoactive CBD as an ingredient in functional wellness beverages around the world. The space is evolving quickly. No decisions have been made at this time," read the statement. The company declined to comment on further speculation. Cannabidiol is a non-psychoactive ingredient in marijuana that treats pain but does not get one high. Yesterday, South Africa's highest court voted unanimously to legalise the growing and use of marijuana by adults. A Canadian startup is experimenting with beer brewed from stalks, stem and roots of the cannabis plant, as the country heads towards legalisation of marijuana as a recreational product from next month. Uruguay was the first nation in the world to legalise the drug last year. Related: Coca Cola eyes marijuana drinks business Click here for the latest political news
