Olympic champion Eliud Kipchoge will have another piece of inspiration when he seeks to lower the world record at the Berlin Marathon on September 16. Kipchoge, who holds a personal best time of 2:03:05  will be seeking to not only lower this but erase compatriot Dennis Kimetto’s world record time of 2:02:57 set while winning the Berlin Marathon in 2014. Kipchoge renewed an improved deal with Isuzu East Africa worth Sh20m yesterday where a world record will fetch him a Sh5.9m Isuzu double-cabin pick-up. “Anything that can come down I call it a PB. So if my PB becomes the world record, I’ll be even happier,” said Kipchoge. However, Kipchoge said he will not be underrating his competitors in the Berlin race noting that each of them has prepared well for the event. “I’m feeling good, especially having finished my preparations. I feel like I am the best amongst the field but I still respect my competitors. Before the gun goes we are equal. Isuzu gave me one extra leg, making my hustle lighter,” added Kipchoge. “We are here for the long haul. We are committed to the field of sports and are exploring how we can support more talent. Our partnership aims to facilitate Kipchoge’s movements in his daily activities,” said Isuzu East Africa managing director Rita Kavashe. In the wake of increased cases of athletes failing doping tests, Kipchoge implored on his colleagues to know and embrace industriousness because money has to be worked for. He said: “Money is not plucked from trees, hard work must be put in for any earnings. There is not shortcut, period!
