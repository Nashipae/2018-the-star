The big set piece event in China otherwise known as the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation has come to an end. "The future of China-Africa relations lies in our young people'' ... ''I am confident that the baton of China-Africa friendship will be passed from one generation to the next and that China and Africa, working together, will build an even more vibrant community with a shared future,'' said Chinese President Xi Jinping. Cheng Tao, a former head of the Chinese foreign ministry’s Africa division, said it was unfair to blame China for supporting governments accused of corruption. “An African friend told me, our government is extremely corrupt. How come you’re still involved with them? Our government has asked the Chinese government to build a bridge and a hospital, but the Chinese government shouldn’t help them,” he said, without naming the country. “I told him - you voted for this government. It’s the only government we can deal with. But the bridge and the hospital are not built for the president or officials, but are for the common people. So I think this is another perspective that can be considered when looking at this issue.” "Biggest news of the day broke, Chinese telling Kenyan Govt to relook at the commercial viability of SGR, media houses just gloss over it or missed it completely'' said @kachwanya.
