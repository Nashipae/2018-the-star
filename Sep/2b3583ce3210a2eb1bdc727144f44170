Singer Akothee has told off those seeking her opinion on sponsors relationships. The self-proclaimed president of single mothers has been accused of being a poor role model to young girls because of her dress code, but she has told critics to mind their own business. "I am not anybody’s mother. Those girls have their own parents to educate them on what to do and what not to. I am not responsible for anyone’s choice, just the same way you can choose to wear condoms or not. Halloo, does your mother follow you to check if you are doing the right thing in bed? So whom am I? Don't hang your children’s responsibility on my back! I have only three girls, whom I’m responsible for," she posted on social media.
