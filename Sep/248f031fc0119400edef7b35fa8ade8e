A cyber cafe attendant who was found making fake Police clearance certificates has been arrested. Michael Ayoma was nabbed on Monday evening by Director of Criminal Investigations officers. "The suspect is in custody and will be taken to court to face charges of making documents without authority," DCI George Kinoti said. He warned members of the public to confirm with the authorities so that they do not engage in criminal activities. "...request potential employers to always confirm with us in case of doubt," he said. To get the certificate, one is supposed to pay Sh1,000 after applying online through e-citizen. After one has applied, he or she can visit the Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters or Huduma Centres for fingerprints to be taken. This takes at least three days to process before the applicant receives the document in his or her email provided. Click here for the latest political news
