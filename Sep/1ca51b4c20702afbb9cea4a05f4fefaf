The labour court has extended orders barring the Nairobi County MCAs from removing Speaker Beatrice Elachi. Justice Stephen Radido has dismissed preliminary objections by the MCAs who had argued that orders issued by Justice Maureen Onyango last week had been obtained unlawfully. Judge Radido further directed all parties to appear before judge Onyango on Monday next week. On Monday, the MCAs caused drama in Elachi's office in the push for her to leave the office. The ward representatives had last Thursday impeached the speaker on grounds of abuse of office. Elachi, however, moved to court and obtained a temporary order reinstating her. But despite this, the angry MCAs said they had lost faith in her and forced her out of the office. Governor Mike Sonko has denied claims he has a hand in the speaker’s woes, saying he had had a good working relationship with the former Senate chief whip. See:  Toka Nje!
