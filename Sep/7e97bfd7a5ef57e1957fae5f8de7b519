The Teachers Service Commission has been urged to ensure fairness during recruitment and employment of teachers in Taita Taveta County. Speaking in Chawia Secondary during an educational talk between school, parents and leaders, Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja slammed TSC for denying locals opportunities during recruiting exercise. He stressed that TSC should give priority to locals when it comes to employment. "I understand that there has been unfairness during the employment of teachers within the County something that we condemn in the strongest terms. The coming recruitments should be done fairly so that many of the local unemployed graduate teachers get an opportunity to serve in their County," Samboja said. Samboja had visited the school to hand over a cheque of Sh 210,000 to aid the constructions of the school kitchen. However, Mwatate Sub-County Director of Education Fatuma Omara defended TSC over claims raised by the leaders saying always the exercise of recruiting teachers has been open and with transparency involving school board members and not government officers. Omara challenged the community members to launch a campaign to bring back the boy child to school. The school’s enrolment is below 100 students where the majority are girls. “Where are the boys in this school? We need to start a campaign to bring back the boy child to school,” said the incoming education director. Click here for the latest political news
