Days after a Chinese man was deported for calling Kenyans monkeys, Classic 105’s Maina Kageni has opened up about his experience with an abusive racist boss. Liu Jiaqi was captured on video bragging that there is nothing that “poor, black, smelly” Kenyans can do to him, including their President, and called them stupid. During his morning show with Mwalimu King’ang’i, Maina spoke about his experience back in the day when he was forced to swallow a bitter pill while hustling to make ends meet in the United States. “You know I have been called a nigger before. It’s the worst feeling ever since he is your boss and you can’t answer back because you still need the job. I stayed because I still needed the job although it was the worst feeling. I don’t know whether he is still there,” he said. Mwalimu King’ang’i talked about the time he lost his job after his boss insulted him. “There is a time I was working in Industrial Area when the boss asked me, ‘unafikiria hapa iko mama yako (do you think your mother is here)? and all I could think of was my sick mother. I did not have money and I had not even taken breakfast. I could not stand it, so I just left.”
