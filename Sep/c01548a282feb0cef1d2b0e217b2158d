County DCIO Commander Paul Leting told the Star the man was arrested on Friday evening at Lamu King Fahad Hospital staff headquarters. Detectives nabbed the suspect following a tip-off. He said more arrests will be made. Leting said the suspect was found with materials for making a bomb and Improvised Explosive Devices. "We have intel that he has been in contact with commanders of the terror group. We found material that we believe is for making explosives. We will give an update after completing investigations," he said. Police are trying to establish if the terror suspect has links with medical staff at the hospital. Lamu county has been a terror hotbed since Kenya Defence Forces soldiers went into Somalia in 2011 to fight the militants. Scores of civilians and security officials have been killed. Last month, 11 KDF soldiers died in two separate attacks by al Shabaab terrorists in Lamu. On August 8, six KDF soldiers were killed and five others seriously wounded after their vehicle ran over an explosive at Kwa Omollo bridge in Lamu East. On August 29, five other soldiers were killed and 10 injured after their car hit an explosive on the Kiunga-Sankuri Road. The soldiers are part of a security operation formed to flush out al Shabaab militants in Boni Forest in Lamu. The government launched Linda Boni Operation in 2015.
