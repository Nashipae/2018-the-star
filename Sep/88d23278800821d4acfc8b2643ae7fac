The Labour court on Friday extended its orders barring MCAs from removing speaker Beatrice Elachi from office. On Wednesday MCAs elected Chege Mwaura as acting speaker. Employment and Labour Relations Court Justice Maureen Onyango stayed the hearing of the
petition until Elachi's contempt of court case is determined. Read: Court halts Elachi's impeachment as Nairobi County Speaker She has sued the county assembly
and County Public Service Board. Elachi, through lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui, wants the
MCAs and the board to be held in contempt and jailed for disobeying
court orders. Onyango allowed Elachi to serve the contempt of
court papers against acting speaker Mwaura and the assembly clerk. The court heard that the board was being cited
for contempt because it had refused to pay Elachiâ€™s rent and utilities for September despite court orders. However the assembly, through its lawyer, said it had tried to comply with the orders and that lawyer Tom Ojienda
had filed an affidavit in court to explain its reasons. The assembly said Elachi is free to go to her office but she has never gone there. The assembly said it never denied her
the chance to occupy it. The MCAs said the speaker can go to the clerk and
she will be given the key to the office. More: Use the law, not the backdoor to remove me - Elachi Click here for
