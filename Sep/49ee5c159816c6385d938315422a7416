Nairobi MCAs want Governor Mike Sonko to make public the list of bursary fund beneficiaries.They have demanded a comprehensive report of all students who have benefited from the kitty, the total amount disbursed and the amount given to each student from former Governor Evans Kidero’s time.Some MCAs claim their wards have never benefited from the governor’s special kitty introduced by Kidero in 2013.They claimed issuance, especially from the governor’s bursary kitty, has turned political. The ward representatives said the governor withholds bursaries to ‘punish’ MCAs who criticise his administration.

The County Assembly Education Committee had summoned Ouko to explain the controversies surrounding the disbursement of the funds.“I have never known there were executive bursaries in this county because none of my constituents has ever benefited,” Kariobangi South MCA Robert Mbatia said.Nyayo Highrise MCA Kennedy Oyugi said, “These students are neither Sonko’s nor Kidero’s. They need not to be subjected to this kind of suffering.”Makongeni MCA Peter Imwatok claimed Sonko dropped all students who were beneficiaries during Kidero’s administration,“It is not their fault that Kidero is no longer a governor. No child has been born in this country is affiliated to any political party,” he said.But Ouko defended the governor and the executive, saying the fund has not turned political and there is no law that students would benefit from the kitty for the entire four years in high schools.She said the county would have disbursed money to all the beneficiaries but financial constraints forced it to delist some students. The fund, she said, has Sh100 million. Some Sh60 million went to new beneficiaries in Form 1.“The kitty is currently benefiting 10,030 students — the top three from each of the 205 public primary schools in the city,” she said.Committee vice chairman and Kayole North MCA Samuel Ng’ang’a directed Ouko to provide a reconciled list of all beneficiaries of all bursary funds. “We want the county to do a proper audit and pass regulations to cure the mess being experienced,” Ng’ang’a said.
