Five firms in Murang’a have launched a Sh500,000 programme to supply water for poor families. In the project, 500 needy families will get free, clean tap water and tanks to harvest rainwater. The five companies are Murang’a Water and Sanitation Company, Murang’a South Water and Sanitation Company, Gatanga Community Water Company, Kahuti and Gatamathi water firms are behind the plan. Each of them will contribute Sh100,000 to uplift 100 families in their areas of jurisdiction. Muwasco MD Daniel Ng’ang’a said they came up with the plan after realising many people could not afford to connect clean water to their homes. Gatamathi Water Company MD Charles Mwaniki on Friday appealed to well-wishers to support the plan. Kangethe Mwangi, a beneficiary, is happy to receive water supply. The father of three mentally disabled children said it is difficult to care for them without running water because they soil their clothes. "I'm happy to get water. I will be able to keep my family clean without much struggle," he said. Ng'ang'a said water firms will help conserve the Aberdare Forest by planting 1 million trees. "The Aberdare forest is our main water catchment and the sole source of water for a majority of the rivers flowing in Murang’a," he said. Click here for the latest political news
