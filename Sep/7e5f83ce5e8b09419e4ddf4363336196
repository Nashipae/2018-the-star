Akothee, alias Madam boss, has said she is neighbours in Zurich with the legendary Tina Turner, an American-born Swiss singer-songwriter, dancer and actress. Everyday, the mother of five has a topic for her fans to talk about her, mostly always calling out her haters. A few years ago, Akothee shared photos of her mansion in Rongo, Migori county, a mansion that amazed many and raised questions as well. She has another home in Mombasa, and she has once again shocked us after she recently shared a video of her new home, which is not just a normal home like the one in Rongo. We do not know the worth of Tina Turner’s home but living in a house that overlooks Lake Zurich must cost you a fortune. “The only celeb owning a home with this great view of Lake Lugano in the middle of billionaires, come beat me!” she captioned the video. “I am coming home in two weeks my love. My baby is wishing me well. So who do you think you are to wish me muchele? I think it’s only me and Tina Turner, she lives directly opposite my house in Zurich levels.” Turner has lived near Zurich since 1995, when she surrendered her American citizenship and became Swiss after marrying Erwin Bach.
