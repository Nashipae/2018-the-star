Equity Bank have recruited Betty Kananu and Celine Okumu from national champions Kenya Ports Authority ahead of the Fiba Africa Zone Club Championships slated for later this week in Dar-es-salaam. An ecstatic Equity coach David Maina yesterday confirmed KPA women’s team dangerous duo has joined the ‘Hawks’ and are all set for the regional show in the Tanzania port city. “It’s now official that Kananu and Okumu are with us and have already joined the camp,” said Maina, adding that his main aim is to build a strong team for the future. With Kananu, a guard and Okumu a forward, in his stable, Maina and Equity Bank have made a strong statement both for the up coming tournament in Dar and the on going national league championship. Equity Bank finished runners to KPA both in the national league and the zonal championship in Kampala, Uganda last year. So far, they remain unbeaten in the league. Other than Equity Bank and KPA women, the event has attracted 23 men and women teams from the region, among them KPA men and Strathmore University Blades. The tournament throws off on September 30 to October 7 with Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania—all sending four teams each. Powerhouse Egypt will have three, Ethiopia (two), Uganda two, South Sudan (two) and Somalia (one). Vitalis Gode, who is the Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) and Zone Five secretary, confirmed that all the teams have submitted their registration to Fiba Africa secretariat.
