Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi who was charged
with treason has left Uganda by plane, his lawyers said. Kyagulanyi, 35, known by his stage name Bobi Wine, was
elected to parliament last year. "I can now confirm that Hon. Bobi Wine ... is on a KLM
flight out of Entebbe Airport," lawyer Nicholas Opiyo wrote on
Twitter late on Friday. He did not give further details on the MP's final destination. Bobi amassed a large following
among youth electrified by his scathing criticism of President
Yoweri Museveni, sometimes delivered in his songs. Another lawyer, Robert Amsterdam, wrote: "Now that Bobi Wine
is finally safely en route on a flight, we owe a tremendous debt
of gratitude to his local lawyers, his family, friends, and
supporters who refused to back down in the face of extreme
pressure and intimidation." Kyagulanyi has been charged with treason over his alleged
role in the stoning of Museveniâ€™s convoy this month, but a court
granted him access to private doctors citing health concerns. He
has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The lawmaker has said he was beaten up and tortured while in
detention. Police say they are investigating the allegations. Protests erupted in the Ugandan capital on Friday after
police detained Kyagulanyi at the international airport during
his previous attempt to travel abroad for medical care. Click here for the latest political news
