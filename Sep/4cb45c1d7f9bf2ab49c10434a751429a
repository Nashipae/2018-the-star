Interior Cabinet Fred Matiang'i wants a review of bail and bond applications for suspects facing criminal charges. He said this will help the judiciary and investigative agencies to prepare for the cases in good time. The CS spoke in Kahawa on Monday during the ground-breaking ceremony for the Kahawa law court in Kamiti. The new court will deal with the prosecution of drug-related, human trafficking, and terrorism cases. Matiang'i said the court is part of the reforms that have been recommended in the correctional services sector. A blueprint will be launched on reforms in the sector, he said. "We want efficient services and an improvement in the time of transporting inmates to court with reduced risks." Matiang'i said the court at Kamiti follows a successful model at the Shimo La Tewa prison in Mombasa. He said more of such courts will be constructed in eight regions. "We have not forgotten about the welfare of prison warders. We will adjust your house allowances," he added. Chief Justice David Maraga said cases are delayed because remandees are not taken to court in time. He blamed the delay in transporting suspects by prison officials on logistical problems. Maraga said the Kamiti court will ease congestion in other courts. The CJ said in the near future, all minor cases will be decriminalised and suspects subjected to community service.
