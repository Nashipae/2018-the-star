Detectives on Thursday dusted Citizen TV anchor Jacque Maribe's car in probe into the murder of Kilimani woman Monica Kimani. The car was checked by forensic experts after the journalist presented herself to the DCI officers at Kilimani police station. Police say Maribe is being treated as person of interest in the case following the arraignment of her fiancÃ© Joseph Irungu alias Jowi. There are reports that Irungu, who was charged with the murder of the 28-year-old Kimani at an apartment in Kilimani last Friday, had been using the vehicle. Jowi, who is the main suspect in the crime, is yet to take plea. On Wednesday, he was remanded at the Muthaiga police station for 10 days.\  /COURTESY Kiambu senior principal magistrate Stella Atambo made the ruling saying this was to allow the DCI to wrap up investigations into the murder. The magistrate further granted Irungu’s wish to be allowed to go for treatment at the MP Shah hospital for an MRI scan on a bullet wound on his left shoulder. Irungu was arrested after Kimani’s neighbors positively identified him as the man who was last seen at the slain woman's house.
