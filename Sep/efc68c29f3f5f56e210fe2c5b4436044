Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has testified in a graft case against two top county workers union officials. Benson Olianga, the Nairobi City branch secretary and John Muriuki - assistant treasurer, were arrested on November 17, 2017. They were nabbed by EACC officials for allegedly soliciting Sh200,000 from Sonko to stop an impending workers strike. Sonko told chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti of the Anti-Corruption Court that he wasÂ aware of the bribery case and was involved in the setting of the trap. "I am conversant with the case as they had asked for Sh1million but after negotiation, they went down to Sh200,000," Sonko said.

The Governor added that the alleged bribe was captured on cameras and recorded. "Since I took office, workers are getting their salaries on the 25th of every month. Even yesterday, I disbursed Sh1.1billion for salaries," Sonko said. During his cross-examination, the county chief said that he has no issues with the workers or their unions. The Governor is among other prosecution witnesses listed to give their testimonies in the corruption case. Olianga is accused of soliciting the cash from Sonko's PA Joab Odhiambo on October 16, 2017.
