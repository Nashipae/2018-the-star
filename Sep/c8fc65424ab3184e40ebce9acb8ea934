Micro-lender, Ngao Credit which has been in the market for ten years will start a deposit taking service starting January. The company announced the move during a customer networking event to mark their tenth anniversary over the weekend. "We have began the licensing process and we expect to have an easy transition to a micro-finance," said finance director, Kenneth Njora. Ngao which according to Njora has a customer base of more than ten thousand people will be converting them to depositors and partners. "We expect our current customers to be our first depositors," said Njora adding that they are in the process of putting in proper systems. The company will at the same time be venturing out to East Africa where they are already licensed in Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda. "Through foreign control company registration and while working with locals we will soon be entering the Uganda market," said Njora. The company has in the past years been serving more SME's due to the cap on bank loans which has seen banks shy away from lending. "Ninety percent of our clients are from the SME's. They know and understand the value of our business," said Ngao chief operating officer Trevor Kimani. Trevor said Ngao gives competitive interest rates among micro-lenders in the country. The company has also introduced loaning against NSE shares. Before issuing the loans, the company first checks the value and the stability the company the shares belong to. "If the company is healthy, we give 50 per cent of the value of the shares," said Mombasa branch manager Emmanuel Murai. Murai said lending against shares is one of their best products at the moment. Ngao currently has five branches with two in Nairobi, one in Nakuru, an office in Mombasa and another in Eldoret.
