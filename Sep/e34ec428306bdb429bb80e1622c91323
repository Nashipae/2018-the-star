Carl ‘Flash’ Tundo and partner Tim Jessop will be crowned the 2018 Kenya National Rally champions should he win the penultimate Eldoret Rally next month. The Nakuru-based farmer swept the ground with all his opponents to register his fourth win of the season in Nanyuki and promised better displays in the last two rounds after a massive five-minute win. After a rather frustrating outing in Mombasa, which saw the five-time Safari champion settle for third, Tundo was peerless in Nanyuki. Should Tundo win in Eldoret, he will attain the unassailable 168 points which Baldev Chager can’t surpass in the season closing Guru Nanak. Tundo’s Nanyuki victory saw him improve to 143points while Chager retained second spot on 114. This went down as Carl’s fourth win of the season after RSC Rally, ARC Safari and KMSC Rally. Tundo beat second-placed reigning African Champion Manvir Baryan (Skoda Fabia R5) by a massive 5 minutes margin as 2018 Mombasa Rally winner Baldev Chager completed the podium dash in a Mitsubishi Evolution 10. “It’s always nice to win in Nanyuki which is my favourite event. For now, we are trying to consolidate the championship and we will have to attack a lot more and win more events. The car has been reliable this season and my navigator (Tim Jessop) on point. We are looking forward to a win in Eldoret and Guru Nanak,” said Tundo. Fourth overall was Farhaaz Khan who reunited with Keith Henrie in a Mitsubishi Evolution 10. Khan teamed up with Kashif Sheikh in Mombasa when Keith was taken ill in Mombasa Rally. “Nanyuki was a good event for us this time round. The club always ensures that the rally is friendly towards drivers. Last time out (in 2016) Keith and I blew the engine in sights of the finish at Batian View. This year, the rally gods were kinder to us,” said Farhaaz.
