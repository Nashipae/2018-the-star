Kenya have been knocked out of the 2018 Africa Twenty 20 Cup in South Africa following a tie with Namibia yesterday. The high-scoring match left Kenya rooted on the bottom of Pool ‘C’ with only six points after one win, two losses and a draw. Christopher Coombe stole one run off the final ball that helped the team level the score. Needing nine to win off the last over, Namibia were on course for a win when they got six from the first four balls but a single off the fifth delivery of the over put the required runs off the last ball to where Coombe managed a single to tie the match. Michau du Preez lead Namibia’s response to Kenya’s target of 183 by hitting 72 runs from 43 balls. After being put into bat, Alex Obanda and Dhiren Gondaria gave Kenya a strong start to their side with an opening stand of 107 runs in 9.5 overs. Obanda hot 49 before falling to Benard Scholtz. Gondaria went on to score a half a century ( 78 ) from 47 before he was also dismissed by Scholtz in the 16th over. Before falling, Gondaria had lost Shem Obado ( 1 ) and Rakep Patel ( 6 ) for only 15 runs. He received 30 runs stand from Irfan Karim ( 25 )   before was stumped. From there on, Kenya lost wickets regularly with only 31 runs coming from the remaining 27 balls. A third wicket stand of 74 runs between Preez and Jyan Frylinck revived Namibia’s chase after Nehemiah Odhiambo and Nelson Mandela had removed the openers in the second and the fifth over with the board on 45. Elijah Otieno got the breakthrough when he had Frylinck stumped in the 13th over with 65 runs needed. Rrylinck dismissal brought up two more wicket to put their side on 142 for 5 after 15.3 overs. And when it looked like the South Africans were cruising comfortably, Odhiambo got the prize wicket of Preez with 30 runs needed. Zane Green and Loftie-Eaton got the scores to 170 before Obado dismissed Eaton on 12 with 14 required from eight balls. Bundi was given the task of bowling the last over and he managed to lead Kenya into a tie. On Saturday, Kenya went down to Eastern Province by 79 runs before losing by eight wickets to Border. In the first match, Kenya were bowled out for 109 in their chase for 186. In the second match, Border needed only 10.5 overs to get the required target of 130.
