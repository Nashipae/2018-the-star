The Law Society of Kenya has sued the state over failure to swear in appeal judge Mohammed Warsame to the Judicial Service Commission.It wants the court to issue an order exempting Warsame from taking oath of office in accordance with Section 40 of the Judicial Service Commission Act and in turn allow him to discharge his duties as a member of the JSC.
