The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has summoned Nairobi county assembly leaders over alleged 'unethical conduct' of MCAs. Majority leader Abdi Guyo, his Minority counterpart Elias Otieno and Minority Chief whip Peter Imwatok are expected to report to Integrity Centre on Wednesday at 10am. The summon came just a day after City MCAs stormed speaker Beatrice Elachi's office and ejected her. "The commission is investigating allegations of unethical conduct against MCAs where they were involved in a scuffle on or about September 10, 2018, within the premises of the Nairobi county assembly " reads the letter a signed Lucy Kinuthia on behalf of chief executive officer Halaqhe Waqo. "The commission would like you to respond to the allegations and record a statement regarding the same," reads a letter addressed to Guyo. On Monday, the MCAs caused drama in Elachi's office in the push for her to leave the office. See:  Toka Nje! Chaos at City Hall as MCA's evict Elachi The ward representatives had last Thursday impeached the speaker on grounds of abuse of office. Elachi, however, moved to court and obtained a temporary order reinstating her. But despite this, the angry MCAs said they had lost faith in her and forced her out of the office. The Star has also established that EACC detectives were at City Hall on Tuesday and obtained the video footage of what transpired in the speaker's office. Speaking to the Star, Guyo confirmed receiving the letter but said he won't appear before the commission as he had scheduled events during the set time. He said the EACC will not dampen their resolve to oust the speaker and termed the move as intimidation.
