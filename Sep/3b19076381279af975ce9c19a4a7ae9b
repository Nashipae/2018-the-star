City Hall will hold its monthly tidying up exercise during the World Cleanup Day on Saturday. Environment chief officer Shadnoff Makori yesterday said, “Our programme of having cleanups every first Saturday of the month still stands; it is only this month that we shifted the date.” The cleanup, which takes place across the 85 wards, is usually headed by administrations and MCAs. Makori said the last two events have been successful, with residents turning out in large numbers. “We have been receiving calls from residents asking when the next cleanup exercise will take place. This shows that Nairobians have developed interest in major issues affecting the city,” he said. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko launched the county’s monthly cleanup in July to restore the city to being the ‘green city under the sun’. “The cleanup will be constant. We want the city to have a culture where residents are conscious about the need for a clean environment and it is their responsibility to keep the surroundings clean,” Sonko said. On equipment and tools for the cleanup, Makori said the available tools will be used, but residents can come with their own. In June, Sonko flagged off at least 850 cleaning equipment, including wheelbarrows, rakes and spades that will be used to clean the 85 wards.Environment executive Larry Wambua said county officials and administrators will gather at Kamukunji grounds after the cleanup for a ceremony. In addition, Wambua said daily collections have been a success and there has been a drastic reduction in waste on the streets. In June, garbage collection had improved from a range of 1,500 to 1,800 tonnes collected on a daily basis. Reports early this year indicated about 2,400 tonnes of solid waste is generated in the city daily, but only 1,500 tonnes is collected and taken to Dandora.
