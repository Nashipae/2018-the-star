Football Kenya Federation have exonerated themselves from the blame of booking Cameroon to train at the newly refurbished Moi Stadium, Kasarani at the expense of the national team, Harambee Stars. Stars head coach Sebastien Migne’s had accused his employers for overlooking the interests of the national team while giving Cameroon priority. Stars were forced to train at the bumpy Kenya School of Monetary Studies grounds after being locked out of Moi, Kasarani with Indomitable Lions of Cameroon, who have a wildcard to the next year’s Afcon showpiece by virtue of being hosts, being granted access. Cameroon trained at the 60,000 seater facility as they sharpened their claws to face Comoros in a match that ended in a one-all draw. The federation in a rejoinder to Migne’s post-match interview slur, accused Sports Kenya for booking Cameroon at Kasarani at the expense of the Kenya team. Stars hit residential camp on Sunday last week and trained at the Kenya School Monetary Studies grounds on Monday and Tuesday while Cameroon camped at Kasarani. Stars were only allowed to train at Kasarani on Thursday and Friday after the Lions jetted out to tackle Comoros in Moroni. FKF president Nick Mwendwa defended his body from any blame and pointed fingers to Sports Kenya for ignoring the national team’s interests. Mwendwa also declined to comment on Migne’s comments on the decision by several players to turn down an invitation to play Ghana
