 Applications for cheap government loans in Embu are too low, the administration says.  Embu West subcounty commissioner Caroline Imaya said despite the availability of funds, few youth have applied. “There are so many programmes and funds that have been given to the youth by the government but the uptake is very low in this area. We really want to know where the gaps are,” said Imaya. She was speaking during a meeting to sensitise stakeholders on an upcoming survey on skills and occupation in informal sector that will be carried out by the Kenya  National Bureau of Statistics and the Labour ministry. Imaya said the survey will be important in enabling the government to come up with appropriate policies and programmes for the youth and also to enable the State know how much it will invest in the informal sector. She said this will help in the growth of the sector and contribute to the gross Domestic Product. Benson Karugu from the KNBS said skills mismatch within the sector is key in addressing some of the challenges in the informal sector. Kenya National Chambers of Commerce and Industries Embu chairman Samuel Kanyi appealed to members to support the survey. He regretted that many college graduates can’t be absorbed in the informal sector because they don’t have the relevant skills.
