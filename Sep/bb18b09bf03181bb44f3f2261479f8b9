The Education ministry has identified six counties with a high number of children out of school. Primary education director Habat Abdi yesterday said 852,000 schoolchildren from Mandera, Garissa, Wajir, Marsabit, Tana River and Isiolo are not in school. He spoke in Wajir town, where he said the children out of school from the six counties are aged between six and 17 years. “The statistics are worrying,” Abdi said. Mandera is leading, with 124,000 children out of school. The figure translates to 15 per cent of the total number. “Unfortunately, a third of those not in school are children with disabilities. There is a need for parents to avoid discriminating their children and send all of them to school,” Abdi said. He added that those with disabilities should be taken to schools which incorporate Special Needs Education. Those with extreme or severe conditions should enroll in the special schools, the director says. Abdi added that further called on professionals and leaders from the affected counties to help empower residents of the affected counties on the importance of taking their children to school.
