Police officers in Nanyuki town yesterday handed over 11 people suspected to have al Shabaab links to the Anti-Terror Police Unit. The suspects, among them Kabiro mosque’s imam, were taken to Isiolo by ATPU officers. They had been held at Nanyuki police station since Friday. Laikipia East police boss Mutoro Kizito said they received intelligence reports that 40 suspicious people were being enrolled in madrassa classes in Kabiru area neighbouring the military base in Nanyuki town. “The suspects were being taken through suspicious sessions likely to convert them to terror groups,” Kizito said. Police found 11 adults and handed over 29 children to parents after collecting parents’ details in case investigations require more arrests, he said.

Five were Luhyas, eight were from Purji and Borana tribes, and five were from Nduruma, Rabai, Meru, Konsa and Numbi communities. “All are from outside Laikipia county and we have to be very cautious because we don’t know what the intention of joining this religion was,” Kizito said. The imam, he said, did not have any certification to teach in a madrassa and he had not been registered with the Council of Muslims, which registers madrassa teachers.
