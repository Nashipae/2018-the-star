A Kenyatta National Hospital official yesterday said the lack of enough ICU beds is to blame for the death of a 68-year-old woman on Tuesday. The chief medical specialist says despite lack of enough beds, professionals tried to save her life in the regular wards, and that it is wrong for the public to blame the hospital. On Thursday, hospital officials met the woman’s family though the outcome is unclear as the family refused to speak to the press. Chief medical specialist Peter Masinde said the woman had a head injury. He added that doctors and specialists tried to help but she had breathing difficulties, which required ICU beds that were unavailable.

Masinde said it is wrong for the public to criticise KNH. He urged the government to increase the ICU beds.“KNH is your hospital and you must appreciate its efforts. We receive many patients who require ICU care but sometimes we do not help them because we don’t have the capacity.” “We even tried to advise them to seek other private hospitals but they refused. We advised the relatives to take the patient to other facilities but they turned it down due to lack of funds,” Masinde said. He urged the government and the county government to work together to reduce congestion in KNH and equip county health facilities with ICU professionals and beds. “As I speak some patients are dying due to lack of beds. It’s time the government stepped in.” Hezra Opere, the head of the ICU department, said the influx of patients at KNH before confirming room availability has worsened the problem.
