Water CS Simon Chelugui has warned politicians against interfering with county water management boards. He said water is a national resource owned by the government. Chelugui spoke in Nairobi on Friday during the Kenya Water Institute (Kewi) 30th graduation. “No one claims the ownership of water sources, it is the responsibility of the national government to protect water catchment areas in any county,” he said.

Water shortage is among the causes of water-related diseases,” he said. The CS said sewerage coverage will also increase from 25 per cent to 35 per cent by 2022. Chelugui said Kewi students do not get government loans. “KUCCPS does not give loans to Kewi students. The ministry is working hard to come up with a water and sanitation revolving fund to help the students who take water-related courses at the institution,” he said. Last month, an umbrella workers’ union wanted Murang’a governor Mwangi wa Iria arrested for allegedly destroying the property of water companies in the county. The county chief dissolved water boards last year and appointed a caretaker team to run the companies, whose officials were accused of poor performance.
