Rift Valley MPs have called  for the arrest of two leaders for inciting their people against non-indigenous communities in Mau Narok. At least 100 families have fled their homes and 50 houses torched in the clashes. One person has been confirmed dead. The two leaders are Narok senator Ledama ole Kina and Narok North MP Moitalel ole Kenta. Joshua Kutuny (Cherengany), Hilary Kosgei (Kipkelion West), Nelson Koech (Belgut), Dominic Koskei (Sotik), Brighton Yegon (Konoin) and Sammy Serona (nominated) also demanded an overhaul of the area’s security apparatus. The government on Wednesday declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew in Olposimoru, which is hard hit by the clashes. Ledama dismissed the accusations and said his resolve to protect the people’s interests remains unshaken. Click here for
