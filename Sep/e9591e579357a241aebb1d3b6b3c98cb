Detectives are searching for nine-year-old Maribel Kapolon who went missing on Friday on her way from school in Meru county. DCI George Kinoti said the matter was reported to police on Sunday morning after the family failed to trace the girl. “Detectives are pursuing the missing girl and we are appealing to members of the public to help us with any information which may lead to tracing the girl,” he said. Kapolon was last seen wearing a blue dress with white stripes and a red sweater. Anyone with information has been asked to report it to the nearest police station. Meanwhile, burglary cases are reportedly shifting from slums to posh estates in Nairobi county. Areas including Korogocho, Mathare, Kibera, Dandora, Kawangware and Dagoretti have previously recorded high cases of burglary, mugging and theft of mobile phones. But burglary cases are now on the rise in Runda, Karen, Muthaiga, Spring Valley and Westlands. Police said domestic workers in posh estates collude with burglars to steal.
