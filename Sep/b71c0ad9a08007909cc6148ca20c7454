Homa Bay, a Lake Region Economic Bloc member, has called for the extension of the standard gauge railway to southern Nyanza counties. Governor Cyprian Awiti yesterday said he is lobbying through the LREB for extension of the project to open up the region for trade. LREB member counties from Southern Nyanza are Homa Bay, Nyamira, Migori and Kisii. In total it has 14 member counties. Speaking to journalists in his Homa Bay town office, Awiti said the region has is rich in agricultural produce, which can be promoted through SGR extension. Awiti said the SGR will provide alternative transport. He said it will expand markets for agricultural produce. “The SGR would help exploit agricultural produce and there is great potential of economic growth.” The government initially planned to extend the SGR to Kisumu through Nakuru county. But Awiti said he wants LREB to persuade the government to extend the tracks to the region. He said he will present the agenda at the forthcoming LREB meeting. Awiti said SGR will also promote fish production from Homa Bay. The governor said there is a ready market for fish in Nairobi no reliable transport system. “Fish is perishable and needs quick transport from the water to the market. SGR will enhance quick movement of the fish from the lake to targeted consumers in Nairobi and other counties,” he said. The governor said most fishermen from Homa Bay, Migori, Kisumu, Siaya and Busia lack ready markets.
