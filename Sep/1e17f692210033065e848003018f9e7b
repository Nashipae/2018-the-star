David Mwai, a suspect in the attempted murder of former Garissa Finance executive Idris Mukhtar by hanging, postmortem results show. The postmortem was conducted by three pathologists, Silvester Maingi, Peter Ndegwa and Grace Midigo. "It is now up to investigators to establish if it was a case of murder or suicide. But we have established that the deceased had an 8cm cut on his neck which was a result of the strap of his clothing suspected to have been used," they said. The pathologist also noted that Mwai's body did not have any other physical injuries thereby ruling out the possibility of torture. They said more samples have been taken for further examination at the Government lab. David Mwai is said to have pulled the trigger on Mukhtar. He is said to have confessed to the police how he was contracted to kill Mukhtar as he left a mosque in Kileleshwa.
