The girls’ team have been going to the Olympiad since 2006 and Andiwoh is confident they can make their mark in this year’s competition. “We have not had success in the recent past but our preparations this time have been different. We have had build up matches and we expect to be competitive,” added Andiwoh. Taiwan are the defending champions of the Category ‘E’ event.
