Jamaica's Usain Bolt sprinted
through thin air and sipped champagne floating on his back as he
enjoyed near zero-gravity conditions in an aircraft performing
stomach-lurching parabola dives. The eight-times Olympic champion grinned as he experienced
weightlessness in the modified plane normally used for
scientific research, but on this occasion to showcase a
champagne bottle that will allow astronauts to drink bubbles in
space. Bolt called it a "mindblowing" experience. "I was nervous but as soon as the first one (parabola) goes
you kind of go 'oh my God, what's happening'. But after the
third one I was like 'yeah, it's crazy'," Bolt told Reuters TV. The bottle was designed by champagne-maker Mumm. In time the
company hopes to capitalise on the advent of space tourism. Billionaires Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon Inc, and Richard
Branson are locked in a race to send wealthy tourists into
suborbital space, high enough to see the curvature of the earth.
Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has ambitions to send paying
passengers around the moon. They may want to toast their adventures. "The tourists will be enjoying the view of the earth, the
view of space, weightlessness, and they will celebrate. So maybe
there is not a market for a lot of bottles in space, but there
is a market for some bottles," said Jean-Francois Clervoy, a
French former astronaut who accompanied Bolt on his flight. Click here for the latest political news
