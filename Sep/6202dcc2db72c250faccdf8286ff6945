Rocky Dawuni, a Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter, has been appointed as the Regional UN Goodwill Ambassador. This happened during an evening of celebrations at the conclusion of the Global Landscapes Forum (GLF) African Landscape Restoration event at the UN Environment headquarters, Nairobi. Rocky, a celebrated global performer with a decade-long career, is an avid humanitarian and environmentalist, lending his voice to amplify issues of poverty, environmental degradation, water and sanitation issues and women’s rights. “There is so much positive energy in Africa and many opportunities to protect and restore the environment across the continent, and music is a powerful force that brings people together and inspires action,” Dawuni said. “I want to work with communities and help them share their successes and encourage them to keep moving forward to make the future brighter for generations to come.” Rocky is uniquely positioned to generate support and publicity amongst his audience for UN Environment’s messages. UN Environment executive director said, “Dawuni’s eloquence, cultural diplomacy and successful melding of music and activism have led him to become a passionate spokesperson for various global causes.”
