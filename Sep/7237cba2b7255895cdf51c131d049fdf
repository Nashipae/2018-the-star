Police in Homa Bay on Saturday arrested three people suspected of perpetrating trade in illicit brews in Rangwe sub-county. The police, during a raid in Genga village, also seized 39,650 litres of kangara, 105 litres of chang'aa and apparatus used in liquor distillation. County police commander Marius Tum said: "The suspected perpetrators were found distilling the illicit brews in a sugarcane plantation." "They normally dig plastic barrels on the ground to hide the drinks," Tum said. "We are interrogating the suspects for more information. We expect them to tell us their accomplices." Tum urged members of the public to work closely with the security officers to wipe out illicit brews in the county. "The crackdown will not end any soon. We appeal for support from the public," he added. Click here for the latest political news
