Samburu West MP Naisula Lesuuda is among 19 nominees who have been shortlisted for the inaugural One Young World Politician of the Year Awards. The award was created to recognise five of the most promising young politicians aged between 18 and 35 from around the world. The winners will be chosen on the basis of the impact they are having in their home countries and how they have used their position to benefit young people specifically. It is the first global award recognising the work of young politicians and was launched to counter the low level of youth engagement in politics. “The purpose of this award is to highlight the work of those young politicians who are using their positions to make a difference and to encourage others who have not considered politics an appealing vocation to see it is one of the most impactful ways to create positive change,” award organizers said. Lesuuda, 34, made it on the shortlist courtesy of her peace initiatives in rural communities aimed at helping reduce cattle rustling. Through her Naisula Foundation, the MP who was previously a nominated Senator between 2013 to 2017, has been able to assist disadvantaged school students to pursue their academic and career dreams. The youngest of the 19 nominees are 23-year old Travis Robinson from Bahamas and Jordon Steele-John from Australia. At 35, Lam Tungwar Kueigwong from South Sudan is the oldest nominee. He is the State Minister of Information, Communication, Youth Culture and Sport in the Northern Liech area of South Sudan. He uses sports to unite and engage youth communities throughout the war-ravaged country. The nominees are currently being reviewed by a panel of judges who will decide the final five winners. “The five winners will be announced and presented with the award at the One Young World 2018 Summit taking place in The Hague, 17th-20th October,” the organizers said.
