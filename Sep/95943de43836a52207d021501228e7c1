The much awaited National Super League Police derby pitting Administration Police and Kenya Police ended in a barren draw yesterday at Camp Toyoyo. The match was marred by wastefulness in front of goal by either sides as they both failed to end their three-match winless run. Although there was no rivalry on the pitch, the few plain-clothed Administration Police officers who turned to cheer their side openly booed Police players in a bid to muck up their concentration. AP will have their goalkeeper Mark Kioko to thank for his superb saves in either halves which kept them in the match.Kioko denied towering forward Clinton Kinanga three times in the opening first half where he gathered three goal bound headers from well executed corners by Kelvin Kwasila. The paramilitary side also had open chances where Salim Mzee and Hillary Otieno were guilty not to break the deadlock in the final five minutes of the first half. Second half substitute Benjamin Megason thought he had given Police the opener in the 74th minute but his goal was correctly disallowed by centre referee Yassin Nadir for offside. The forward who had came in for Otieno was lively in the final minutes of the game raiding APâ€™s camp severally but his attempts were equally thwarted. At the same venue, FC Talanta beat 10-man Kibera Black Stars 3-2. A brace from Rodgers Omondi and a strike from Michael Muya rendered Filbert Ochieng double null and void. Kibera were forced to play with one player less after MacDonald Malika suffered an ankle injury with all the three substitutes already exhausted. In Kisumu, hosts Kisumu All Stars fell 3-2 to promotion chasing Ushuru. Fabian Hosea and Dismas Amunga scored for the home side but Anthony Ndolo, Benson Amianda and Evans ensured the three points for the visitors.
