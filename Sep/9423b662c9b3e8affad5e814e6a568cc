Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter and his Soy counterpart Caleb Kositany (pictured) want the Constitution amended to reduce the number of elected and nominated leaders so Kenya can cut its wage bill. They said on Friday that the country does not need the huge number of nominated members of the National Assembly, senators and MCAs. Keter and Kositany said wananchi should not pay more taxes. “We should not tax Kenyans excessively when there are other ways to get money by ending wastage in government expenditure and reducing the wage bill,” Keter said in Eldoret. They urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to look into ways of handling the taxation that “has drastically raised the cost of living”. “We know when he returns he will give the necessary direction to ease the tax burden,” Kostany said. Meanwhile, Christian and Muslim clerics have asked the government to withdraw the 16 per cent VAT on fuel. Director of the Friends Church John Muhanji and chairman of the Imams Abubakar Bini said it will ruin lives of already-suffering Kenyans.
