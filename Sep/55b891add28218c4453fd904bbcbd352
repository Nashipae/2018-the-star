The Baringo government faces audit queries over the purchase of a wooden meat chopping block for Sh20,000. A report tabled on Monday during a special sitting of the County Public Accounting and Investment Committee shows the block was bought in the 2014-15 budget. The supplier was paid on delivery, yet payments are supposed to be done through IFMIS. The assembly met to discuss misappropriation of funds ahead of the senators' sitting in Uasin Gishu. Baringo governor Stanley Kiptis is among the county bosses expected to be summoned to answer questions on the use of county resources. Nominated MCA Saphina Chelagat said there was wastage of public funds.

"We are asking the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to probe this," he said. Minority leader and Tirioko MCA Sam Lokales said, "Every sensible human being knows a mere block of wood cannot cost that much." He wants the Department of Criminal Investigation to urgently hunt down those behind the purchase of the block. Another allocation in question is Sh40 million used for the extension of the assembly hall, which is moving at a snail-pace since the project started in November 2014. The completion date was supposed to be in August 2015. The report also shows Sh4 million was paid to a contractor to design and construct an assembly gate. The MCAs said other stalled projects are Kabarnet Stadium, a market, empowerment centres in six sub-counties, irrigation schemes as well as slaughterhouses in Loruk and Barwessa.
