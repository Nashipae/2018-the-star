Watamu police have been accused of failing to execute court orders seeking to evict occupants from a property and hand it over to a Swiss family. On August 20, the court ordered that Joyce Reinhard Jepleting, who has roots in Kenya, Daniel Reinhard and Elizabeth Reinhard be allowed to take possession of the property. The orders from the High Court directed Watamu OCS to give security during the execution of the warrant. The property includes Mawimbi lodges, which consists of 47 Luxurious bungalows and a hotel. All are located in Watamu village. It is being occupied by Damaris Nthenya and an Italian National Giovanii Ozzi, who were defendants in a suit filed six years ago. The case was ruled in favour of the Reinhard family. Nthenya and Ozzi were served the order on Monday and were supposed to vacate on Wednesday. But by Wednesday Ozzi had not vacated the Mawimbi lodge. When contacted, he said he needed time to clear with tenants but did not give specific timelines. Nthenya could not be reached for comment. But Jepleting said they were being frustrated by police who are not helping to implement the orders. Jepleting, who lives in Switzerland, said she has spent a lot of money on the case. She appealed to Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet and government agencies to intervene and help her reclaim the property. “I’m being frustrated. I keep moving from this to that office and I have spent a lot of money,” Jepleting said. She said she plans to petition the court to seek direction on Watamu police’s failure. Malindi police boss Matawa Muchangi dismissed claims that police had refused to comply with the orders and asked to be served by court if there were such complaints.
