Struggling Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) men’s Premier League outfit Nakuru head coach Anthony Agesa is keen to work with a younger squad next season irrespective of whether they will survive the axe or not. Nakuru are second from bottom with 11 points and Agesa has attributed the poor run to lack of cohesion in the playing unit. He attributed their woes to players skipping training due to personal commitments, observing this would not have been the case if he had a younger squad. He revealed his intentions of building a young and fresh squad after scouting heavily in the national secondary school games staged in Eldoret last month. “We have struggled to get results as a team simply because we do not train together. We only meet on match days and our fitness levels have always been wanting. I do not care whether we get relegated or not, all I want is to build a new and younger squad for the coming season,” he said. “I want to work with players who can find time to train and give their all in our matches. I have a few in mind who caught my eye at the national secondary school games last month and I hope to rope them in my team.” “I do not blame the current players at my disposal for the poor run. They have really tried considering that they forfeit their jobs to attend matches and even pool resources to honour away matches. If I retain a few and bring in young players, I am sure we will restore our fading glory.” Nakuru suffered their worst defeat of the season over the weekend after bowing 9-1 defeat to Butali Warriors, leaving them staring at relegation. He called upon well wishers to support the team.
