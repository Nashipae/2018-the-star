Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki has ordered investigations into the death of 12 infants at the Pumwani Maternity Hospital on Monday. She directed the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board, Nursing Council and Clinical Officers Council to probe the matter and report back within 24 hours. Sicily gave the orders after Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko alleged that there was an attempt to cover up the deaths. Pumwani Maternity Hospital superintendent Catherine Mutinda was suspended following the revelations. Dr James Kamau - the obstetrician gynaecologist, and the hospital's administrator Zadock Angahya were also asked to step aside for probe.

Pumwani nurses lifted the lid on the challenges they face in their line of duty in the wake of the deaths. The health workers complained of consultants failing to report to work, malfunctioning equipment, lack of promotions, inadequate personnel, and managers' high-handedness. The issues emerged in a crisis meeting called after the Monday incident. Sonko attended the session.
