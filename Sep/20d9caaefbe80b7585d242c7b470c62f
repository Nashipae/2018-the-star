A 28-year-old woman has given birth to quadruplets at Kapenguria County Hospital in West Pokot. Peninah Chenangat, mother of two, hails from Karita in North Pokot subcounty. She appealed for help from wellwishers and charitable organisations, saying she cannot afford the upkeep of her children. The four newborns weighed 700gm, 830gm, 925gm and 1kg at birth. They are all in good health. Chenangat safely delivered two boys and two girls who are currently in an incubator at the hospital. The parents are casual labourers and don’t have a fixed source of income. “We never expected quadruplets. It is rare but it has happened. We will have to work harder to ensure they are strong and healthy until they mature,” Chenangat said. She said she carried her pregnancy without complications and had no idea she had more than one child. Chenangat sold her chicken to get money to travel more than 100km to Kapenguria. “I come from a poor family and I don’t know how I will feed my children,” Chenangat said. She thanked the staff for the good care. Nursing officer Simon Konoch said the babies will be referred to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital as the hospital has no paediatrician.
