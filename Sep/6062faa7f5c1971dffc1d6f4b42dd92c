Elders from Kirinyaga county have dismissed claims that they were handpicked by Mwea MP Kabinga Wachira to lead negotiations over the Mwea Settlement Scheme in Mbeere South. Although the land is in Embu county, Kirinyaga elders are also laying claim to part of it. The elders, led by chairman Jeremiah Gateri and secretary Wilson Kinyua, defended Kabinga saying he only wanted to ensure a peaceful process in the sharing of the Mwea Trust land. Gateri accused Francis Njiru, the secretary general of the Mihiriga Kenda — the Kirinyaga elders council — of spreading falsehoods against the Mwea MP. “These reports arose when the MP was outside the country on parliamentary duties. Because we realise Kabinga is a peace-loving leader, we take responsibility to clear the matter and exonerate him (Kabinga) once and for all,” Gateri said in a statement. The Kirinyaga elders will negotiate with those from Embu and Mbeere communities, who are the majority in the settlement. Two weeks ago, Njiru claimed Kabinga had handpicked his allies to negotiate with elders from Embu. In the last subdivision attempt, it had been decided people from Embu would be allocated 30 per cent, Mbeere 40 per cent, Mwea 20 per cent and Kirinyaga 10 per cent.
