Thirteen-time champions AFC Leopards will be boosted by the return of defender Christopher Oruchum when they clash Kariobangi Sharks today in a SportPesa Premier League match at Kenyatta Stadium Machakos. The availability of the former Thika United centre half, who has been away taking examinations, will be a big relief to head coach Rodolfo Zapata who has been roping in makeshift defenders, thanks to injuries which have seen the five of his hard-men remain on the sideline. AFC have in the past couple of matches been forced do without the services of Robinson Kamura, Isaac Oduro, Abdallah Salim, Moses Mburu and Dennis Sikhayi who are nursing different injuries—a situation which has left Zapata with the option of using the utility players Duncan Otieno and Baaker Lukooya to complement the available defenders. The two teams curtain-raised the match with comfortable weekend wins with Sharks mauled Nakumatt 5-2 and Leopards clawing Posta Rangers 2-1. Leopards will use the match to end their long wait for their inaugural win over Sharks since their elevation to the top flight last year. In the past three meetings, Sharks have reaped a win and managed to hold Ingwe twice.7 However, Leopards assistant coach Tom ‘Gaza’ Juma has predicted to end the long wait for the first league victory over Sharks. He said: “We are looking forward to break the win-less jinx against Sharks today. We have prepared for the match well and we are happy to welcome back Oruchum in the squad after missing the last two matches due exam commitments. It is a boost to our defence which has been hit hard by injuries. Although the makeshift defenders have performed well, his return will give us selection options at the back.” Leopards are placed third on the log with 51 points—four shy of second-placed Bandari and a win will enrich their chances of a runners up finish as they will move to a point off the dockers. On the other hand, Sharks are sixth with 43 points.
