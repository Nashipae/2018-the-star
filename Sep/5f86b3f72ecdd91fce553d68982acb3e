Micro loans lender Unaitas today will officially open its 25th branch in Kisumu as it seeks to expand its customer and revenue base. Opposition leader Raila Odinga’s family hosted Unaitas board members for breakfast at the former Prime Minister’s Opoda’s farm in Bondo on Saturday, where investment in the region was discussed. Unaitas public relations and customer care officer Sam Otieno said the branch has been operational for the last two months but will be officially launched today. He said the launch coincides with the sacco’s silver jubilee celebrations. Otieno said more branches will be opened in Nyanza, Western, Eastern and the Coast regions. “Our strategic plan is to open five branches annually. In this region, we target to open branches in Siaya, Homa Bay, Migori, Kakamega and Busia,” he said. The official said the sacco has a membership of 400,000 in Kenya, US, Asia and Europe. “Actually, 16 per cent of our members are in the diaspora,” Otieno said. “In this region, we shall partner with local saccos to empower them financially. Fish farmers and fishermen who have been exploited by middlemen will benefit from our products.” Otieno said a moratorium has already been deposited at the Central Bank of Kenya to transform the sacco into a commercial bank. Unaitas CEO Tony Mwangi said expansion plans are the result of increased demand for financial services. He said there are more opportunities from devolution, urbanisation and a young population keen on entrepreneurship. Unaitas disbursed more than Sh2 billion in loans to 5,000 groups (chamas) last year. Launched in 1993 to serve tea growers then known as the Murang’a Tea Growers, the financial institution changed the name to Muramati in 2007 and later rebranded to Unaitas in 2012.
