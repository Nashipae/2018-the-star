Anxiety has gripped the Council of Governors after its chairman, Josephat Nanok, refused to step down for Kwale governor Salim Mvurya. Mvurya was supposed to succeed the Turkana governor in July this year, at the end of his one-year term. Mvurya was elected in dramatic polls held last December. “No comment from the governor,” Kwale communications director Daniel Nyassy told the Star yesterday. “Please get the information from the Council of Governors.” Read: Governors back Waiguru for deputy CoG chair, Mvurya to succeed Nanok in June Nanok, Mvurya and CoG officials did not respond to calls. During the last year’s polls, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto opted for consensus following fears that a bitter rival would divide the governors’ club after the disputed 2017 polls. There was also panic in Jubilee following the surprise entry into the race of Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago. Mandago’s threatened to split Jubilee’s votes in favour of Nanok but later withdrew after Jubilee luminaries reached out to him. Jubilee had won majority 25 governors seats in the 2017 election,  compared to Nasa’s 18 seats. At the time Uhuru and Ruto were keen to control CoG after their administration was given sleepless nights by former chairs Isaac Rutto and Peter Munya.  Munya and Rutto accused the Jubilee administration of killing devolution by starving counties of resources, failure to fully devolve county functions and delayed disbursement of funds. “The replacement of Nanok by Mvurya indeed was brought up by a section of governors but members couldn’t agree. They agreed to revisit in the next summit meeting,” an Ukambani governor told the Star. The summit brings together the President, Deputy President and the CoG.
