Kitui, Nairobi, Nyeri and Samburu are the only counties out of 47 that have made transparent their budget making process, according to International Budget Partnership Kenya. The four published five out of the the six documents assessed in the IBPK budget transparency survey.  Isiolo, Kajiado, Kirinyaga, Kisumu, Lamu, Mandera, and Migori did not publish a single document as required by the Public Finance Management Act. The counties average transparency score rose to 42 per cent from 25 per cent over the same period last year. The survey is conducted twice every year. First survey results of 2018 were published in March. IBPK lead research analyst John Kinuthia said they looked at official county government websites to assess the availability of key county documents that should have been made publicly available. “These key documents should have been released during the formulation of the 2018/19 county budgets between September last year and June 30,”  he said. Other than online checks, IBPK made physical requests for county budget implementation reports in 12 counties in line with the Access to Information Act, 2016 out of which only four were availed.
