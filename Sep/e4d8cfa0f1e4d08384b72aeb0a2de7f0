Kenya is not leaving Eurobond market anytime soon, the state said on Thursday. It also announced that it has set aside Sh97.7 billion to service the first Eurobond in the second half of this financial year. Kenya borrowed $2 billion (Sh202 billion) from international investors in June 2014 comprising a five-year issue of $500 million (Sh50.50 billion) at an interest of 5.875 per cent and $1.5 billion(Sh151.50 billion) for 6.875 per cent to be repaid in 10 years. In February, the government raised $2 billion (Sh202 billion) in a new sovereign bond issued in two equal tranches of 10 years at a coupon of 7.25 per cent and 30 years at a coupon of 8.25 per cent. How the first Eurobond was used is shroud in mystery, with opposition chief Raila Odinga insisting the cash was squandered. Almost 80 per cent of the second stanch was used to settle syndicated loans. National Treasury CS Henry Rotich told journalists the government will issue another sovereign bond when in need. “We are there to stay. We will access it when we need to. You don’t go to the market and disappear. You are supposed to be there, not necessarily raising funds,” Rotich said. He, however, downplayed the country’s activities in the sovereign debt market, saying Kenya will stay there not necessarily to fundraise but for debt management and investor engagement. “It is not a stop and go thing. Like South Africa, which has been there since 1960s, we will maintain our presence at the market to refinance and fine tune our products,” Rotich said. He added that the government is also benchmarking for local private sector to enter the international debt market for growth. While pressure is on Kenya to cut debt appetite, especially external one, the country is staring at huge budgets for the current financial year and 2019-20, whose preparation was launched last week. Kenya is targeting a Sh562 billion budget deficit this financial year and 568.2 billion in financial started July 1, 2019. According to the Treasury, 2019-20 fiscal deficit will be financed by net external financing of Sh272 billion ( 2.7 per cent of GDP), Sh 319.6 billion ( 3.2 per cent of GDP) from net domestic borrowing, and other net domestic receipts of Sh3.9 billion. Last year, the government spent Sh240.1 billion to service external debt and projects to spend Sh364.6 billion this fiscal year. Central Bank of Kenya’s bulletin for the week ended September 14 put the country’s total public debt at Sh5.039 trillion with external loan at Sh2.56 trillion and Sh2.47 trillion for the domestic one.
