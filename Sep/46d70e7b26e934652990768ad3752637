Nine presidents, three prime ministers and First Lady Margret Kenyatta are among the 22 people President Uhuru Kenyatta follows on Twitter. All the accounts of the 22 people have been verified by Twitter. They are; US President Donald Trump, Muhammadu Buhari (Nigeria), John Magufuli (Tanzania), Yoweri Museveni (Uganda) and Cyril Ramaphosa (South Africa). Others are Barrack Obama (Former US President), Hage Geingob (Namibia), Alassane Ouattara (Côte d’Ivoire), Paul Kagame (Rwanda) and Ali Ondimba (Gabon). “President of the Republic of Rwanda, write to paulkagame@gov.rw,” reads Kagame’s profile. Uhuru also follows the First Lady on his verified official Twitter account @FirstladyKenya. Kenyans will be curious if any changes will be made to the name of the account after he leaves office in 2022. He also follows UK Prime Minister Theresa May, Narendra Mondi (India) and Abe Shenzo (Japan). Uhuru also follows his Deputy William Ruto as well as the current head of the Presidential Strategic Communication Unit Kanze Dena and her predecessor Manoah Esipisu. Esipisu is not the ambassador to the United States. The other people the President follows are Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich and National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale (Garissa Township MP). Uhuru also follows the president of Dangote Group Aliko Dangote described by Forbes as Africa's richest man worth Sh 117 billion. Click here for the latest political news
