The National Super League encounter between leaders Western Stima and third-placed KCB will be the highlight of the round of 31 matches scheduled for today and tomorrow in various venues across the country. The game will be played at Kisumu’s Moi Stadium and Stima’s interim coach Paul Ogai hopes his charges will maintain their winning ways to enhance their chances of qualifying for the SportPesa Premier League come next season. Stima welcome Erastus Mwaniki from injury. “Playing against KCB is not easy because they are also chasing promotion to the top tier league. We want to pick maximum points from all our remaining games,” Ogai added. He said the derby win against Kisumu All Stars over the weekend was a morale booster for his boys.
