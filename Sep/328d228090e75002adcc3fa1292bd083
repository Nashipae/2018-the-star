Jirongo risks being jailed if he does not raise the bail, an additional bond and a surety of the same amount. The registrar noted that Jirongo had time from August 6 when the warrant was issued but did not present himself in court until he was arrested. However, his lawyers asked the court for more time to comply with the court's direction arguing that they need to ask Jirongo's friends for the Sh5 million. They further pleaded with the court saying that the politician is a public figure and therefore, not a flight risk. Lawyer Danstan Omari said their request for more time was because of the money involved. He further claimed they had only Sh 900,000 ready. Omari also requested the court to give them until Monday to confirm whether they will have complied with the courtâ€™s directive. However, the registrar declined to allow the application ruling that the politician has until Wednesday 1 pm to comply with the orders. He said that in the event the politician fails, he will be remanded at the Industrial Area prison pending compliance.
