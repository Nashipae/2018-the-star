The 20-year-old Mercado, who weighs 55.5kg and made her debut in professional boxing with a victory against compatriot Yoatzin Meraz in 2014 looks determined to upstage Zarika, who came back two weeks ago from Liverpool, United Kingdom, where she attended a two-month training. Mercado edged out her compatriot Beatriz Arangure on unanimous points in their super featherweight bout in Hermosillo, Mexico, in June this year, which stands out as her last fight. Before the fight Zarika said she was ready to defend her title in front of home fans. "I am grateful to all my fans. Thanks for coming in large numbers to support me. If it were not for you I wouldn't have managed and I will always be grateful to you," she said after she was declared the winner. Also Read: The story of Kenyan pride ‘Iron Fist’ Zarika Fatuma
