Former Nairobi governor Evans Kidero and his four co-accused have protested against what they called the DPP’s failure to comply with court orders to share evidence. Their lawyers, led by Tom Ojienda, on Friday said the DPP partially disclosed evidence and materials to be relied on during trial.They said they were only supplied with their clients’ individual statements, yet they are jointly charged. They also said the witness statements received had missing pages and some layers had not received charge sheets. The lawyers said they had not received statements from EACC detective Mulki Omar. They demanded the OB or investigation materials that led to the charges. Other documents demanded included Cooperative Bank’s deposit confirmation slips for the money the suspects allegedly received in kickbacks. Ojienda protested submission of a statement from Central Bank without notice and said they could be ambushed with undisclosed evidence and witnesses during trial. They said statements of former county secretary Robert Ayisi have not been produced to them. State counsel Joseph Riungu listed the remaining statements and said he would make them available. Chief magistrate Douglas Ongoti told the parties to agree. He directed Riungu to share the statements and directed the defence lawyers to appoint one among them to agree.
