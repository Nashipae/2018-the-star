Two mourners died while heading to a funeral in Baringo after their vehicle crashed in Keiyo escarpment. Five others sustained serious injuries after their Toyota Probox rolled several times off the steep and rocky Iten-Kabarnet Road on Saturday morning. They were travelling from Tinderet, Nandi, to Kabartonjo in Baringo. Their vehicle rolled over 100m on the rugged escarpment that is a popular tourist point overlooking the scenic Kerio Valley in Kolool. Elgeyo Marakwet Health CEC Kiprono Chepkok said the injured were taken to Iten County Referral Hospital. He said three were moved to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret for specialised treatment. "Those who sustained spinal and neck injuries have been referred to MTRH. Two others are receiving treatment at Iten County Referral Hospital," Chepkok said. The bodies were taken to Iten County Referral Hospital mortuary. Area assistant chief John Letio said residents rushed to the accident scene after they heard the vehicle rolling at 7.15am. They removed five survivors and the two bodies from the wreckage. "The vehicle stopped at the viewpoint. Moments later the occupants got back into the vehicle to proceed with their journey and the driver started reversing,” Letio said. “We suspect that the driver underestimated the distance, and that’s why the vehicle veered off the road and rolled.” Letio said at least five fatal accidents have happened at the black spot in recent months. He urged drivers to be careful. The Iten-Kabarnet road has several sharp corners. Former Nandi Deputy Governor Dominic Biwott urged the Kenya National Highways Authority to erect guardrails on the sharp bend to reduce accidents. He thanked villagers who helped the victims.
