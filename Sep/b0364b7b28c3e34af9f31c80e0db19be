Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka has told Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati to stop blame games and deliver. Speaking at Buema in Kanduyi at the weekend, the former Bungoma governor said it is unfortunate that one year down the line his predecessor is still blaming him. “When I lost the election I took all my belongings and handed over county property to him. I'm surprised about the claims of sabotaging his leadership. The accusations are not true because I moved on," Lusaka said. Lusaka has been criticised by Wangamati and Deputy Governor Ngome Kibanani for frequenting the county every weekend "instead of concentrating on his duties at the Senate". He laughed off the accusations, saying Bungoma is his home and he will go there whenever he has time. “They are saying I should not be coming home to meet my people. Where do they want me to go? he asked. Lusaka said as a national leader it is important to have grassroot networks. Wangamati is facing five petitions from members of the public and some special interest groups over his nomination of chief officers and advisers. The governor blamed external forces for his woes.
