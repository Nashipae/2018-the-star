Property worth millions of shillings was destroyed on Tuesday night after a fire broke out at Breeze Point Hotel in Malindi. Witnesses said the fire started on the makuti roof at around 7.30 pm. Clients who noticed the fire alerted the management. Guests at the hotel scampered for safety. Firefighters from Malindi Sub-County Firestation delayed as the fire spread quickly. No one was hurt during the incident. Director Grave Laika said they put out the fire with the help of residents. Speaking to journalists at the scene, Laika said firefighters arrived late without water. "We have special firefighting equipment at the hotel. We used a hosepipe to pump water from the swimming pool," she said. Laika accused the county government and the firefighting department of laxity. She said they respond poorly to fire outbreaks in Malindi. Witness Hadheif Omar said he helped put out the fire. This is not the first time theÂ fire department has failed to respond quickly. Malindi and Watamu are tourist resort towns with luxurious hotels and multi-billion shillings investments. Kilifi County Secretary Arnold Mkare said they were in a meeting to discuss the issue and promised to give a briefing later in the day. Click here for the latest political news
