Students joining Technical and Vocational Education Training centres will receive Sh30,000 bursary each, the government has announced. Deputy President William Ruto yesterday announced that every student will benefit from Sh40,000 from the Higher Education Loans Board. He said all students will access Helb. Ruto said they will continue investing on equipping students at TVET with skills. The DP spoke at a fundraiser in Nyeri. Ruto said the initiative will not only spur economic growth but will help over three million youths enrol in TVETs in the coming years. “We cannot drive the Big Four agenda without having equipped our youths with skills,” the Deputy President said. During the commemoration of the International Youth Day in Kisii last year, President Uhuru Kenyatta assured the youths of their inclusivity in the implementation of the Big Four agenda but challenged them to take up leadership positions to effectively articulate their issues. Uhuru said the programme will be rolled out through the Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender to ensure youths’ potential is incorporated in its implementation.
