A court has released nine suspects linked to the tribal clashes in Olpusimoruon on bail. Narok senior principal magistrate Tito Gesora freed the suspects on a Sh100,000 bond or an alternative bail of Sh75,000. The suspects were charged with preparation to commit a felony on the border of Narok-Nakuru counties. They were arrested on August 25 at Olengeruone. “On September 25, 2018, at about 5.30pm at Olenguruone they were jointly found armed with five bows, 26 arrows and a panga in circumstances that indicated you were armed with intent to commit a felony," reads part of the charge sheet. While granting the bond terms on Tuesday, the magistrate said the prosecution led by David Mwangi had failed to provide sufficient reasons to deny the accused persons bond or bail.

The magistrate ordered the suspects to report once every month to the DCI Department until the case is concluded. But lawyer Sigei arap Bett opposed the prosecution's move to have the suspects remanded. He said they are innocent until proved guilty. He said one suspect has throat cancer and needs specialised treatment. Since his arrest, he has no access to any facilities, Bett said. The lawyer said care should be taken so that the situation does not escalate. He claimed people from one community were being arrested. Efforts by the lawyers to have a car belonging to one suspect released failed. The prosecution said the car had assorted weapons that will be used as exhibits in the case. If the suspects are found guilty they risk a seven-year term. The case will be mentioned on 11 October and the hearing is on November 13. Click here for the latest political news
