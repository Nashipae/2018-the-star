Bunge la Mwananchi yesterday urged police and the DPP to investigate two MCAs over graft allegations. Its members threatened to march to the county assembly if no action is taken. Chairman Henry Shitanda said the ward representatives — Makongeni’s Peter Imwatok and Kitisuru’s Alvin Palapala — collude with rogue county employees in fraudulent activities. The MCAs dismissed the claims. “It’s with profound shock that we’ve learnt of the heinous schemes employed by some MCAs in collusion with county staff to loot public cash,” Shitanda said at a press conference. He said Imwatok and Palapala swindled bursaries through a proxy firm and personal bank accounts. “The same fictitious company, operating without a physical office, has also received monumental sums from the Lang’ata Constituency Development Fund”. Shitanda also accused the MCAs of dishing out bursaries to their relatives, friends and close associates. Some are non-residents, he said. “As we engage in a constitutional process to recall these MCAs, we plead with the EACC, the ODPP and the DCI to move with speed and end this distasteful theft. It has placed the future of our children and society at large in serious jeopardy,” he said. Imwatok said the lobby has been hired by Governor Mike Sonko to malign those criticising “his poor leadership style”. Palapala said he will sue Shitanda and his team for defamation. “I’m not a signatory to any cheque. I don’t own a company. These people have been sent. I’m taking them to court,” he said.
