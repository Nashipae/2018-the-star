Maasais occupying Kiket farm in Mai Mahiu are crying foul over a planned move to evict them from their dwellings. The lot occupies the farm which is on a piece of land located off the Mai Mahiu-Narok road which they have occupied for years. Over 400 members of the community held a peaceful demonstration on Sunday where they vowed to stay put on the 22,000 acre-parcel. The land is part of Utheri wa Lari farm, which has been at the center of dispute between members of the Kikuyu and Maasai community before the court awarded it to the former. According to the pastoralists representative Paul Ole Koilel, tens of police officers have been deployed in the area to evict them. Koilel said many were caught unaware as the government began the process of constructing a police post in readiness for their eviction. He said a public primary school has been closed as a result of the rising tension. "We wonder why we are being moved from the area." "This is our land in which we have lived peacefully for ages. We wonder who is this that wants us out of this place," he said. Koilel asked the government to investigate the matter saying most of them are living in fear of forceful removal from the area they have known as home. "Why are they building a police post here yet we have never had any confrontation with our neighbors," he added. His sentiments were echoed by Newton Ole Pariasu who said they were not prepared to move. Pariasu said the land has generated a lot of interest due to the development activities in the area. "The SGR passes through this land and there are indications that the dry port will be constructed around here, hence the move to have us evicted," he said. Pamela Nkaletalu, one of the community's leaders, asked the government to quell the tension by resolving the matter urgently. "We just want to know what is going on here other than having police officers being driven in and out because this move is creating tension." Click here for the latest political news
