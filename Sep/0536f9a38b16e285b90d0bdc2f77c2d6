Secondary schools whose best students in KCSE score a D grade should be closed, Lari MP Jonah Mburu has said. He cited Kariguni Secondary School whose best student in last year’s exam scored a D+. Thirteen other candidates scored grade E. Mburu said he was considering having the school closed and students transferred to neighbouring Gachema and Gachoire secondary schools. He said the trend had continued for a long time. Mburu said students in the three schools come from the same villages yet their performances were different. “That tells you there is something not right in that school. We might dissolve it very soon,” Mburu said in reference to Kariguni. He spoke during the unveiling of the constituency’s five-year plan at the county headquarters on Friday. Mater Hospital CEO Dominic Mwenja was the chief guest. Area director of education Omari Barua and Kenya Secondary School Heads Association chairman George Muchiri attended.
