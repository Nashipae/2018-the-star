Top seed and tournament favourite Ismael Changawa led four Kenyans into the quarter finals of the Britam Kenya Open yesterday. The hard-hitting Changawa had a relatively easy time on court, edging  Samuel Urasa in straight sets in the third round matches to set a date with Burundian Cuma Issa,  who saw off Derrick Ominde 6-2, 7-5. Changawa admitted not to have had any major challenges so far but predicted tough matches from stronger opponents in the remaining rounds. “I play Issa in the quarters and I can say he is a great player and he hasn’t made it thus far by luck. He has beaten strong players and I have to tackle him seriously.” Second seed Ibrahim Kibet easily sailed to the final eight after tossing out Kennedy Musembi 6-1, 6-1. The burly Kibet consequently set a date with Tanzanian Frank Menard, who beat Ernest Habiyambere in the third round. Kibet said he had mastered his rival’s weakness ahead of the quarter final duel. He said: “I have watched him play severally and I have noted that he likes slicing the ball which exposes the back of the court. I will capitalise on his mistakes and ensure I am less erratic.” Albert Njogu also qualified to the quarters following his 6-1, 6-0 win over Denzel Seetso of Botswana. The student at Mbagathi Secondary School is set to play Ugandan Boris Aguma who slapped home player Benson Mugo with a 6-3, 6-0 loss. Petty Andanda recovered from a set down to supplant Sampras Rakotodrainaibe of Madagascar 5-7, 6-2 and 7-6( 2 ). He will play Adboul Shakur of Burundi in the quarters after the latter made it to the last eight courtesy of his 6-1, 6-0 win over Yabets Kebede of Ethiopia. In the girls’ category, Shufaa Changawa eased to the semi finals after annihilating Cynthia Cheruto 6-1, 6-0. Shufaa is set to renew her rivalry with Madagascan Narindra Ranaivo who edged out South Sudan’s Achu Madhieu 6-0, 6-2 on Friday.
