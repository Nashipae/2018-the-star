Police yesterday seized expired rice, cooking oil, sugar and flour valued at Sh20 million that were being repackaged for sale in Eldoret. The goods were confiscated from a store where two traders, including a Briton, were arrested. The raid was conducted in conjunction with public health officers and Kenya Bureau of Standards officials. Eldoret West police boss Zacharia Bitok said some of the goods expired in 2011. “It’s immoral and illegal for people to engage in such businesses of selling harmful products to the public,” he said. The goods were being repackaged and branded with fake Kebs stickers for fresh distribution to shops. Uasin Gishu governor Jackson Mandago asked the government to crack down on traders carrying out illegal business. Two weeks ago, police seized a lorry with 2,000 cartons of fish allegedly imported from China. The fish was being offloaded at a garage in Eldoret. Mandago spotted the lorry parked on a footpath along the Eldoret-Iten road and confronted its owners. He said the fish was illegally sneaked into the country. CRACKDOWN INTENSIFIED The governor called police, Kebs and Kenya Revenue Authority officials who arrested the owners of the lorry. Some of the fish was rotten. “I stopped because I thought the lorry was obstructing the public as it was parked on a pedestrian lane. But I soon realised the owners were engaged in another business which I felt was illegal,” Mandago said. He asked authorities to ensure all food handlers comply with public health regulations. Mandago said the owners of the fish did not have importation documents and had not complied with Kebs and KRA requirements. “Some of the rotten fish had been offloaded. We suspect they wanted to sell it to the public. That is dangerous,” he said. Bitok said police have intensified the crackdown on illegal businesses. The operation is part of the countrywide clampdown on contraband and counterfeits, including illegal gaming machines.
