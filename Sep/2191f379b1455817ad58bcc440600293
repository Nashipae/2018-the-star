Omtatah in suit papers says the decision by state violates the Constitution because it has an effect of limiting rights to property and advancement of social economic rights. He says that Treasury CS Henry Rotich allowed the implementation of the new levy in total defiance to Parliament, which suspended the same last week. The National Assembly deferred for two years the decision to impose the new fuel levy meaning its implementation was moved to September 1, 2020. However, arguing that the President has not signed the amendment to the Finance Bill 2018 into law, the executive has insisted on implementing the VAT on petroleum products. As a result, Kenyans are paying high fuel prices. He has sued CS Treasury, KRA, ERC and AG. He listed National Assembly as interested party.
