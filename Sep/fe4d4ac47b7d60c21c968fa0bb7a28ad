Embu parents have been advised against preventing their sons from taking beauty courses owing to traditions that frown upon men who spruce up women. A manager of a beauty college said many parents have been preventing their sons from enrolling for beauty courses “because beauty careers are for women only.” Glamour-land Technical and Vocational Training institute’s manager Elizabeth Njeri, said as a result, many talented men have been locked out of the industry. Speaking to the Star at the institute, which is situated on Wanjau Building along Mama Ngina Street in Embu Town, Njeri described the habit as outdated, and anti-development because the world has changed. “There are no careers for men or women in the modern world. A man can offer services that were before exclusively for women and vice versa and do very well by earning a decent livelihood,”Njeri said. She said there are many talented male students who, if well trained, can do better and excel in life instead of languishing on the streets. Njeri said out of the current 200 students enrolled in the college, only three are men. She noted that hairdressing and beauty careers are well paying since more women are seeking the services. Njeri said 50 students will be graduating with certificates and diplomas credentials on Friday at Embu stadium.
