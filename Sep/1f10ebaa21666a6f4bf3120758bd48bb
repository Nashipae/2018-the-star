A man in Webuye town is suspected of fatally stabbing his wife of five years. They were estranged. The body of Phoebe Nanjala, 23, was found on the roadside at T-Junction in Webuye town on Wednesday night. It was near a bakery where she worked. She had four stab wounds to the chest and abdomen. Good Samaritans rushed her to Webuye Subcounty Hospital, where doctors pronounced her dead. Residents of Muslim area said Nanjala and her estranged husband Moses Wang’ila, 32, parted ways four months ago. The mother of two rented a house near the bakery where she worked. She left the children with their father, who is a boda boda operator. Tabitha Ng’ang’a, the bakery’s manager, said Nanjala had worked at the business for only two months. She said Wang’ila would often come to plead with her to go back to her matrimonial home but she refused. “We know her husband very well and we suspect he is the one who had killed her since he was here even last evening [and] they quarrelled after she declined to go with him to his house,” Ng’ang’a said. Webuye police boss Zaccheus Ng’eno said they are searching for Wang’ila, who has gone into hiding. He asked residents to give police information leading to his arrest and prosecution. An area leader called Ken urged young families to seek guidance from church leaders, elders and parents whenever disputes arise. Ngeno warned residents against committing crimes, saying the law will catch up with them.
