Siaya senator James Orengo has said Kenya risks being recolonised due to its huge debt. He said the country has borrowed too much and it’s likely to be used as a weapon to recolonise the people. “The debt acquired by the Jubilee government is so huge compared to the previous regimes,” he said. Orengo spoke to residents in Rarieda on Sunday. He urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to sign into law the amended Finance Bill 2018 to lower the prices of fuel products. Orengo said he is optimistic the President has the interest of Kenyans at heart and he will revoke the added tax to lower the cost of living. The senator was accompanied by Siaya deputy governor James Okumbe, speaker George Okode, Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo and six MCAs. Amollo said there are three options to save Kenyans from the high fuel prices that has made the cost of living unbearable. He said the first option is for Treasury CS Henry Rotich to retract, obey and remove the fuel tax. The second is appointing an authority to compel him to pull down the Bill. Amollo said if these two options fail, then they will have no alternative but remove Rotich.
