The National Police Service  has received 800 vehicles from Toyota Kenya under the Government’s pilot lease programme. The programme started in 2013 when the Government through the National Treasury awarded Toyota Kenya the tender. This is the fourth phase of the lease programme and is set to continue for two weeks after the flagging off. The tender for the initial 1,100 vehicles was awarded to the company in October 2013, with the first batch of the vehicles being delivered in December of that year.

The NPS was selected as the ideal institution to carry out the pilot program owing to its nature of operations. Currently, the service has a need for 4,500 units of vehicles, with the shortage expected to rise to 11,000 in the next five years following additional administration structures, additional constitutional offices and a strengthened Criminal Investigations Department (CID). “As an institution, we are proud to be associated with the program which has immensely contributed to the country’s national security. Based on our interactions with the project, we can say the government has benefitted from cash flow management, professional fleet management, driver training and aftersales support. The program has also promoted skills transfer to counties,” he said. He further said the organization has been able to train more than 2,500 police officers on product operation, lease procedures and safe operation of the vehicles in 41 counties. The event was attended by representatives from Toyota Kenya, the National Police Service and National Treasury. Read:Mombasa gets 11 more police vehicles
