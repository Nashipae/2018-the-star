Kenya faces a debt crisis. Taxes are controversially being raised and spending cuts considered. Instead let's save money by restructuring the public sector. In 2013 the new President Uhuru Kenyatta very sensibly instituted a review that proposed the consolidation and closure of many parastatals and state bodies. Nothing happened. Let's close all loss making parastatals. We will save as much as VAT on fuel. NCPB soaks up close to Sh10 billion a year and achieves very little. Close it and sell the silos to the private sector. Why subsidise East African Portland Cement or National Oil Corporation to compete with private sector rivals? Close or sell Mumias Sugar, Nzoia Sugar, South Nyanza Sugar, Uchumi Supermarkets, Kenya Meat Commission, KBC, and Kenya Wine Agencies. Eliminate irrelevant state bodies like Kenya Yearbook Editorial Board and Brand Kenya Sell the government shareholding in KCB, Telkom, Safaricom, National Bank, Consolidated Bank, and Kenya Reinsurance Corporation to raise funds. The biggest losers in such a radical restructuring of the public sector would be the failed politicians who are given consolation jobs as directors. But that is a small price to pay for rescuing the economy from the suffocating weight of these parasitic bodies.
