September inflation touched an 11-month high at 5.7 per cent, indicating tougher times ahead as effects of value added tax on petroleum hit. According to Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, prices for both food and non-food items rose marginally, pushing inflation from a low of 4.04 per cent in August. The 16 per cent VAT on petroleum products that came into effect on September 1 saw fuel prices go up by up to 12 per cent, with a litre of petrol retailing at between Sh125 and Sh134. The Finance Act 2018 has since lowered VAT to eight per cent, cutting petrol and disease prices by at least Sh6. Kerosene, relied upon by majority of families in the country has however gone up after introduction of kerosene adulteration tax. Inflation data released yesterday shows that prices of food and nonalcoholic drinks increased by 0.37 per cent while housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels increased by 0.47 per cent in September compared to August. Sugar prices went up with a kilo retailing at Sh152.29 up from Sh147.33 in August. A kilo of Irish potatoes was sold at Sh77.60 up from Sh73.62 while Sukuma Wiki rose from Sh55.59 in August to Sh57.83. One kilo of beef with bones rose from Sh442.95 to Sh443.21, beans at Sh120.83 up from Sh119.04 while cabbage rose to Sh43.53 compared to Sh42.58 in August. Maize and maize flour prices dropped marginally during the month under review. A kilo of maize grain dropped to Sh40.55 from Sh42.38 while that of flour moved from Sh45 in August to Sh43.59. “Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuel index increased by 0.47 per cent in September compared to August. The index was 7.29 per cent higher compared to same period last year on account of new power tariff structure,’’ KNBS director general James Gatungu said. Early in the week, CBK warned that overall inflation is expected to rise in the near term, as secondary effects of VAT on petroleum products move to other sectors.
