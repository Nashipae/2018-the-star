Mother to child transmission of HIV must be eradicated completely, Eliud Mwangi, the county director Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric Aids Foundation, said yesterday. He said progress has been made with infections reducing over years from 30,000 to 8,000. “What is sad about this is that these cases can be prevented. There are many children out there who are infected but not on treatment,” Mwangi said. He said 50 per cent of children born with HIV do not live beyond their second birthday and 80 per cent don’t go beyond fifth birthday.
