Sunderland have terminated Papy Djilobodji's contract, saying the defender returned to the club late and unfit. The 29-year-old Senegal international, who was on loan at Dijon last season, put in a transfer request in June. He
failed to report for training in August after Sunderland allowed him to
take unpaid leave during July to agree a deal at a new club. The club said he "comprehensively" failed a fitness test upon his return. Djilobodji,
who was under contract until June 2020, only returned to training in
the first week of September after ignoring a number of written requests
from the League One club. In a statement, Sunderland said he was subjected to the same pre-season fitness tests that the rest of the squad went through in July. Sunderland paid Chelsea Â£8m for Djilobodji
in August 2016, becoming former manager David Moyes' first signing at
the Stadium of Light, but his last first-team appearance for the Black
Cats was in August 2017. Click here for the latest political news
