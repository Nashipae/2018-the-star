With Thika United already relegated to the National Super League,the pressure to remain in the SportPesa Premier League falls on second from bottom Wazito who will be out this afternoon to intensify their quest to keep their top flight status against Kariobangi Sharks at Machakos Stadium. The league debutants have 28 points four off the red line and will be seeking to cut the deficit to a point against the high flying Sharks who are seventh with 28 points and are on a winning trajectory having won their last four league matches and a huge 4-1Shield cup semi final victory. Frank Ounaâ€™s charges will hope to silence Sharks and hope that third-from-bottom Chemelil Sugar falls in their remaining matches, a result which will see them survive relegation. Chemelil will be up against Thika United at Thika Stadium tomorrow. Another battle to avoid the drop will see another debutant, Vihiga United, take on champions in waiting Gor Mahia at Mumias Sports Complex. Vihiga are 15th with 34 points and face out of sorts champions, who resumed training this week after a one-week go slow. The match will pave way for an clash between Sony Sugar and Kakamega Homeboyz. Promoted sides Zoo Kericho and Nakumatt will heavily rely on home advantage to fully delink themselves from relegation when they battle Ulinzi Stars and Nzoia Sugar respectively. Zoo are 13th with 35 points while the soldiers are fourth with 50 points. Nakumatt ( 14 ) are also on 35 points and take on the millers, who are 11th with 37 points, at Camp Toyoyo. Bernard Mwalala will be seeking to extend his unblemished run with Bandari when he rallies his charges against Sofapaka at Mbaraki Stadium. Since taking charge from Ken Odhiambo, Mwalala is yet to taste defeat, guiding his side to seven wins and sharing spoils twice and his run will be severely put to test by the former champions, who are oozing in confidence after booking a place in the Shield Cup finals.
