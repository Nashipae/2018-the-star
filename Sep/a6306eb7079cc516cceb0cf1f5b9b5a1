Embu’s gender executive Joan Mwende has expressed disappointment over laxity is arresting suspects accused of defiling girls. Mwende said cases of violence against children were rampant yet the authorities were not making arrests. “The authorities should decisively deal with the cases of violence against children. There are so many defilers who are on the loose,” Mwende said. The official was speaking on Tuesday during a post-election reconciliation, healing, peace and cohesion forum at Country View Hotel in Embu town. Mbeere South deputy county commissioner Berverly Opwora blamed parents of victims for killing the cases by negotiating with suspects for compensation.
