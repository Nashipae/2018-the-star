A case seeking to determine the validity of the title deed of the controversial Ruaraka land has been referred to Chief Justice David Maraga. Environment and Lands court Judge Bernard Eboso said the matters raised in the reference filed by National Land Commission are weighty and complex in nature. He said they will, therefore, require an uneven number of judges to hear and determine it. NLC filed the reference a month ago urging court to help them determine whether the two schools - Ruaraka high school and Drive Inn primary school, sit on public land or private land. In a sworn document, former NLC chair Muhammad Swazuri says the determination of the issues in question, and specifically determination of the validity of the title document to the suit property, shall have bearing in the previous acquisitions undertaken by the commission.
