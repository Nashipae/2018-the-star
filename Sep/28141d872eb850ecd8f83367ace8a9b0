Busia deputy governor Moses Mulomi has given a contractor 10 days to hand over Kapina dispensary, which has stalled for more than two years. “I want this project handed over within 10 days, no more dillydallying, ” said Mulomi. He condemned contractors over stalled projects including those who fail to complete them within the stipulated time. Mulomi said he will visit all such projects across the county before deciding on the next cause of action. On Monday the DG expressed displeasure over a number of stalled projects when he kicked off his tour of health facilities in the county to ascertain the status of initiated projects.
