The Kisumu Water and Sewerage Company has used more than Sh500,000 to replace stolen meters. MD Thomas Odongo on Wednesday said more than 163 meters were stolen last year and some cases were not reported. He said they used Sh3,000 to replace one meter. Odongo urged consumers to report theft so they can take action swiftly. “If you report a case of a stolen meter, the company has a cash reward of Sh10,000 for you,” he said. On Wednesday, a suspected thief was arrested after he allegedly stole two meters in Lolwe estate. The firm has alerted the police to launch a crackdown on theft. Odongo said most of the meters were stolen in Lolwe, Nyalenda, Manyatta, Obunga and Robert Ouko junior and senior estates. “Theft of water meters increased in the last three months, with more than 70 households targetted during that period,” Odongo said. He said brass meters with cast-iron boxes are targeted by the thieves because of their high resale value. The MD said they will install plastic meters with low resale value throughout the town as a deterrent measure.
