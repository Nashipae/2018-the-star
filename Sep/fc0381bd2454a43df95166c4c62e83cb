Kenya Pipeline Company has recalled 14 trucks that were mistakenly loaded with water instead of petrol at its plant in Kisumu. Depot manager Herman Munga said all the trucks loaded since Tuesday morning were recalled and have responded positively. Munga said they have opened investigations to establish what went wrong. "We have no reports of any truck that offloaded as they have all reported back," he told the Star on phone. The manager said the matter was taken seriously to protect members of the public. He said other products were not affected. Abiud Jafar, a driver, said he noticed the mistake following a leak from one of his truck's compartments. He immediately notified the depot managers who recalled all the tankers that had been loaded. Other drivers had traveled more than 50km before they were alerted to verify the contents of their trucks. "I didn't even realise that I was ferrying water instead of petrol. I was called when I was about to offload the product," a driver said. The incident occurred at a time Kenyans are debating on the high costs of fuel as a result of the introduction of 16% VAT. President Uhuru Kenyatta has proposed that it be slashed to 8 per cent; a move that NASA has supported with conditions.

With the Kisumu case, detectives are likely to explore if there was an act of sabotage following the fuel crisis or a mere systems error at the Kisumu depot.
