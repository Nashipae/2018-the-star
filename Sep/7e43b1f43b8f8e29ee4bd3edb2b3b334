Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has suspended four senior city officers citing insubordination in the Pumwani Hospital saga. They are County Secretary Peter Kariuki, Health executive Vesca Kangogo, Health chief officer Mahat Jimale and County Attorney Lydia Kwamboka. The governor, in a statement on Tuesday, appointed in an acting capacity, Pauline Kahiga to act as the County Secretary. He also named Charles Kerich to act as the acting Health executive, Mohamed Saleh (Health Chief Officer), and David Aseko as acting county attorney. This followed after the four officers defended Pumwani staff against Sonko's accusations following the discovery of bodies of 11 babies in a room at the hospitality. The officials cited systemic failures as the problem at the facility even as the governor maintained that the children died as a result of negligence. The hospital has maintained that none of the children, highlighted during the governors' raid, were a case of emergency mishaps. The managers said the deaths were normal and called for patience with the DCI, medical board, and Health ministry probe into the incident.
