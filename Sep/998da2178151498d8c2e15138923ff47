The Directorate of Criminal Investigations and that of Public Prosecutions have moved to seal gaps that have challenged collection of forensic evidence to nail suspects. DCI boss George Kinoti and DPP Noordin Haji on Tuesday conducted a benchmarking tour of the BKA Forensic Laboratory in Germany. BKA is Germany's National Central Bureau of the International Criminal Police Organisation - better known as Interpol. The two leaders, with their teams, went to Germany with a view of bringing on board a specialised team of Forensic Prosecutors. Via Twitter on Tuesday, Kinoti said the prosecutors will work closely with detectives in the prosecution of complicated cases requiring such evidence. BKA Vice President Michael Kretschmer and his team were also present. Forensic scientists collect, preserve, and analyse scientific evidence in the course of an investigation. While some forensic scientists travel to the scene of the crime to collect the evidence themselves, others occupy a laboratory role. Last year, IG Joseph Boinnet said the new police forensic laboratory will be fully operational in the first quarter. Issues that will be investigated at the lab for forensics include rape cases and human fluid examinations. He said the major challenge the police service has been grappling with is dealing with evidence, and the lack of a lab forces them to look for the services elsewhere.
