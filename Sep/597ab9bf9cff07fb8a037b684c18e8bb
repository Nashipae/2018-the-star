Healthcare in Siaya is still poor despite the region producing among the highest number of health experts in the country.
Dr Khama Rogo, lead health sector specialist with the World Bank, said the county is among areas that have met the universal threshold of being declared Open Defaecation Free Zones. “Siaya is number one followed by Isiolo in the list of counties declared OPDF zones,” Rogo, the proprietor of Sagam community hospital in Gem subcounty, said.
He was giving a lecture to health experts on Tuesday during the three-day Siaya County First Scientific Conference at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology. Rogo said although the region turns out many health professionals — the highest in the subSaharan region — it is ranked in the same level with Isiolo county.
He termed the county a great “paradox” because the highest number of professors per capita originate from Siaya, yet child and maternal deaths continue to increase steadily.
“Why should a woman die from obstruction [in childbirth], yet we have more than enough gynaecologists virtually in every village?” Rogo asked.
