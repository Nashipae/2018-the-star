Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji has vowed not spare anyone linked to the death of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno. Haji said any suspect, including Migori governor Okoth Obado, who has been adversely mentioned, will be charged if investigations link him to the murder of the 26-year-old woman. “Investigations are going on, and at the right time when we feel the governor needs to be arrested, that will definitely be done,” he said. He said they will only do so when they have watertight evidence. “No one is above the law, not even the governor. And no one mentioned will be spared,” he added.

The DPP further urged Kenyans to be patient as investigations in some cases take time. He said there is a process to follow including taking DNA samples for testing. Haji said there are many theories that have come up and the police are connecting the dots to ensure that they charge the right culprits. “There is no sacred cow, no one linked to this heinous act will be left untouched. We will go for each one of them,” he said. Haji told Kenyans to stop speculating over the issue and allow the investigators to carry out their work. He also told off politicians. "Shut up and let the police focus on getting the culprits," Haji said. Sharon was abducted together with Nation journalist Barrack Oduor on Monday.
