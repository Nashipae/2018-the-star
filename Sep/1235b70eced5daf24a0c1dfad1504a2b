The war against HIV in Homa Bay got a major blow after a key Non-Government Organisation announced plans to downsize its staff citing financial constraints. Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric Aids Foundation (EGPAF) plans to lay off 217 workers from next month. It has been a major partner of the Homa Bay government in combating new HIV infections, especially from a mother to her unborn child. National Aids Control Council's data says Homa Bay leads with a HIV prevalence rate of 26.7 per cent in the country.

Jenipher Ndege, Homa Bay Health chief officer, wrote to the affected workers with instructions they should not to report to work after the end of this month.

However, it will not be renewed because of budgetary constraints," reads part of the letter "The Ministry of Health appreciates your valuable contribution in the service you have been providing during the contract period." "Your efforts have gone a long way in improving the management of HIV/Aids among other health conditions," Ndege told the health workers.
