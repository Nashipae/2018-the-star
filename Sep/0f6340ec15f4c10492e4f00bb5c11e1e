Governor Mike Sonko has set up a task force to investigate the root cause of management and financial problems at Pumwani Hospital. The team is also expected to recommend workable and sustainable solutions in a special report within 30 days. Members of the task force are acting Health executive Charles Kerich, Dr John Nyamu (Gynecologist), Simon Mueke (Ministry of Health), Prof Joseph Karanja (University of Nairobi Medical School), and Dr Anne Kihara (Kenya Obstetrics and Gynecological Society). Kenya Medical Association's Carol Odula, Mugure Kiambati (Principal, Pumwani Maternity Hospital Nursing School), Joe Aketch (Former Nairobi Mayor), and David Kimaiyo (former IG and current chairman Kenyatta National Hospital Board) will be part of the team. Others are Dr Evan Seqeuira (Aga Khan University Hospital), Nathan Kahara (former Nairobi Mayor), Dickson Mbugua (Matatu Welfare Association), Dr Thomas Mutie (CEO Kenyatta National Hospital), and Bashir Admali (Paediatrician, Aga Khan Hospital). The team was put in place following the recent discovery of bodies of 12 infants stashed in a polythene bag. The situation brought systemic flaws at the facility to the fore.
