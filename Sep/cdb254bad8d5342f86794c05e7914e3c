Boda boda riders in Bungoma have rejected a proposal to pay a Sh1,200 levy to the county government every year. Out of this, Sh500 is for registration, Sh500 for a one-year sticker and Sh200 for an official badge. Chairman John Masika said members are not ready to pay the new levies. He said Governor Wycliffe Wangamati, in his campaign manifesto, promised to exempt grocery sellers and riders from daily levies. "Wangamati said we would not be paying any levies, but now he has changed the tune. He wants us to make a one-off payment. Our members are unhappy,‚Äù he said. Kanduyi Sub-county Boda Boda Chairman Jairus Simiyu said the governor needs to come clean on the issue of levies. He said the county government is sending mixed signals. Simiyu said if the new levies are imposed, it will be hard for the riders to earn a living. He said many of them are employed and they are required to give a certain percentage of what they make to their bosses for them to get a commission. "These motorbikes are not ours, if we pay the levies how will we survive?" Simiyu asked Click here for the latest political news
