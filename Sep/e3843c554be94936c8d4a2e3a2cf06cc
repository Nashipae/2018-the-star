Kibwezi West MP Patrick Musimba and his wife Angela Mwende have been arrested and charged with stealing Sh1.1 billion from Chase Bank. The two were arraigned before Milimani senior principal magistrate Hellen Okwani. The court issued a warrant of arrest against them on Friday after they failed to appear on Thursday. They were to be charged alongside the former bank's chairman Mohamed Khan, Dancun Kabui, James Mwenja, Makrios Agumbi, Luciane Sunter and Ronald Vlasman. However, they failed to turn up for plea taking. Okwami ordered that the MP and his wife be remanded at Kileleshwa police station until Thursday when the court will rule on their bond terms. State counsel Mungai Warui opposed bond for the couple and four others. He said they are likely to abscond trial. The bank's former chairman was however released on Sh2 million bail.
