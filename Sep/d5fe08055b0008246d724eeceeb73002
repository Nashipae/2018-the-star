Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i on Friday presented 100 vehicles to the Kenya Prisons Service. "The vehicles will complement available resources in the security sector, and should support sister departments and promote overall security in the country," Dr Matiang'i said. He said they should be maintained well and put to proper use. The CS was accompanied by Interior Chief Administrative Secretary Patrick Ntutu, PS State Department for Correctional Services Zeinab Hussein, Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet and Commissioner General of Prisons Isaiah Osugo. On Thursday senators visited Kakamega and Shikusa prisons. They found the facilities in poor condition. "Kenyan prisons are in appalling condition because the department has been ignored," a Senate committee said. Some 2,474 prisoners have petitioned the Power of Mercy Advisory Committee to recommend their release by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Click here for the latest political news
