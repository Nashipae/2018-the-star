Artiste Atemi Oyungu prefers to keep her life private, only letting the public in on what she feels is necessary. Speaking to Word Is, she opened up on losing her father.Â "Losing my dad to cancer in 2005 was my lowest moment. Before his death, it's only my dad and I who were living in Kenya. "My whole family lives abroad, so it was just me and him in Africa. I don't think people value friendship that much as people abroad do, and when my dad died, the realisation hit really hard. It was difficult and still is." Despite still mourning her dad, Atemi has used the experience as a stepping stone to emerge stronger than before, keeping us entertained with her music.
