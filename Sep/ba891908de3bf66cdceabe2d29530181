Njuri Nceke secretary general Phares Rutere has quit the position. The long-serving Rutere who assumed the post in 1998, said he relinquished the position to concentrate on his role as Kenya Council of Elders' chairman. "It is difficult to multitask. That is why I opted to resign," he said. One of the highlights of his tenure is crowning the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi as a Njuri Nceke elder. His reign was also clouded with leadership wrangles, resulting in the formation of a breakaway faction under chairman Linus Kathera.

"He is a good leader, and I am sure he will steer Njuri Nceke in the right direction," Rutere said. Paul M'thinkia retains his position as chairman while Francis Kamwara is vice chairman. The splinter group led Kathera and Josphat Murangiri as secretary general has also called for elections. "We will go to court if they hold elections. We already have a certificate from the Registrar of Societies as Njuri Nceke officials," he said. Rutere, however, said resigning his position does not mean he will cease being a Njuri Nceke elder. The Njuri Nceke council of elders has been governing the Meru community since the 17th century. The Ameru comprise the Chuka, Igembe, Igoji, Imenti, Mitine, Muthambi, Mwimbi and Tharaka Tigania. Elders who form the council are carefully selected. They have to be respected and must be incorruptible. The elders execute community laws, settle disputes, and pass on community knowledge to younger generations. They are the custodians of the Meru culture. Click here for the latest political news
