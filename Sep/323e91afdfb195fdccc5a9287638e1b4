In a historic verdict, India's Supreme Court ruled that gay sex is no longer a criminal offence in the country. The ruling overturns a 2013 judgement that upheld a colonial-era law, known as section 377, under which gay sex is categorised as an "unnatural offence". It is one of the world's oldest laws criminalising gay sex, and India has been reluctant to overturn it. However in recent years, there has been a very vocal campaign to decriminalise homosexuality in India. Campaigners outside the court waiting for the ruling began cheering as
the verdict was made public, with some even breaking into tears. India's gay and transgender communities have fought long and hard to
strike down section 377, which carried a 10-year jail term for those who
engaged in what it termed "unnatural sex". Equal rights activists
had argued that the very existence of such a law was proof of
discrimination based on sexual orientation. They frequently said that the law has been used to harass LGBT people. Click here for the latest political news
