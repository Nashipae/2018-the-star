Kenya Breweries Limited has suspended its contract with Civicon Limited following protests by suppliers for non-payment. They are demanding millions of shillings for goods supplied to Civicon which is one of the firms contracted to undertake works at the brewer’s Kisumu plant. They are owed between Sh1.1 million to Sh7 million for general building materials and equipment used for construction at the plant’s Sh15billion brewery. KBL Corporate relations director Eric Kiniti said the suspension will remain in effect until Civicon fully resolves any pending contractual issues. “As a responsible corporate citizen, KBL is committed to the fair treatment of all personnel working at our facilities,” Kiniti said in a statement. He added: “We have taken this action because we hold all our suppliers and contractors to the same high standards of conduct performance and ethics that we practice.” Civicon was subcontracted by main contractor Diageo International to build a water treatment plant. The chief executive Ben Kiilu could not be reached for comments as he did not pick calls nor reply to text messages. Big Wave supplier Lilian Ligeyo said they have not been paid for goods they supplied.
