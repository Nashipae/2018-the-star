A police officer has been fined Sh700,000 with an alternative of a two-year jail term for collecting bribes at the Nairobi Railways bus terminus. Constable Charles Mbiti was handed the sentence at the Milimani Anti-Corruption court on Thursday. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission said they investigated the case following reports made by the public. On August 18, President Uhuru Kenyatta urged the commission to step up the fight against corruption and economic crimes. In the last financial year, theÂ commission recovered illegally acquired assets and cash amounting to Sh488 million. The corruption proceeds from individuals and institutions were recovered through court proceedings and out-of-court settlements.
