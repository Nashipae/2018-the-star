Redsan has been
accused of assaulting his producer Sappy. An audio released by the producer went viral and you could clearly hear the two arguing over something before
Redsan slaps the guy. Sappy abuses Redsan and it
doesn’t end well. Word Is reached out to Philip Makanda, the Main Switch Production CEO, for comment. "There was a disagreement between one of our
producers and Redsan, which generated a physical confrontation," he said. During the day, Redsan was unable to get in touch with
the producer through his phone, and therefore he decided to go to his house, and
that is where things got out of control. "This had not just happened once because, even before
that, we had a lot of things that we were trying to reconcile, and part of it was
what caused the confrontation," Makanda said. Asked if they had reported the matter, Phillip said: "Yes, and a case for the whole
issue is underway. It is not about money but his character is bad. When someone
ignores your call, you don't go to their residence or place of work. Instead
you should wait for them to get back to you on phone," Makanda said. He does not intend to reach out to Redsan "because as
the production company, it is wrong to assault a team that has worked with him
for the past four years". Word Is tried to get comment from Redsan, but all his
phone numbers did not go through.
