Embakasi East MP Babu Owino has written to President Uhuru Kenyatta requesting him to assent to the Finance (Amendment) Bill 2018 to "save people from the difficult times". Owino wants the government to find ways of reducing public expenditure and wastage instead of increasing the tax burden on Kenyans. In the open letter to Uhuru, Owino claims that the Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich was effecting an 'illegal tax' to finance the ballooning public debt. The legislator based his assertions on grounds that Parliament voted to amend the Finance Bill and suspend the implementation of the proposed 16% VAT on fuel. The tax measures, however, are based on the Finance Act 2013 whose implementation was postponed in 2016 and was to be effected in 2018. MPs on Thursday voted for the same to be shelved until 2020, a decision that is yet to be ratified by Uhuru who is in China for the summit of African leaders.

Any attempt by the executive to levy the tax that is not approved by Parliament is illegal and unconstitutional," he said. Owino, in the same vein, said he supports a decision to suspend new projects until old ones are completed. "I note that in your visit to China, your government has taken on a further Sh380 billion in debt for the construction of Phase 2A of the Standard Gauge Railway from Naivasha to Kisumu." He said MPs read the mood of the people and realised that the Bill, as initially proposed, would portend untold suffering on Kenyans. Click here for the latest political news
