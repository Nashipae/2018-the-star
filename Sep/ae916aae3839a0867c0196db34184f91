MCAs in Baringo have criticised Governor Stanley Kiptis for ordering a staff headcount to weed out ghost workers. On Monday, Kiptis launched the three-day drive in Mogotio. "Counties like Nandi have launched President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s Big Four agenda while here in Baringo we are still struggling with ghost workers," Bartabwa Ward MCA Reuben Chepsongol said. The Chief Whip claimed that workers hired by former Governor Benjamin Cheboi are being targeted. Twenty-five ward representatives backed him. They include Francis Kibai (nominated), Nelson Lotela (Silale), Sam Lokales (Tirioko), Jennifer Kabon (Kapropita), Francisca Cheburet (nominated), Richard Cheserem (Saimo-soi), Diana Siriti (nominated) and Ernest Kibet(Kabarnet). The reps addressed the media at the assembly in Kabarnet on Monday. They told Kiptis to concentrate on development instead of wasting time on unproductive matters like workers' headcount.
