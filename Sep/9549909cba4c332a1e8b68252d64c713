A political showdown is looming in the Ugenya parliamentary race between former MPs Chris Karan and David Ochieng’ after the seat was declared vacant. National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi declared the seat vacant in a letter to IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati on September 11. Muturi invoked Section 101 of the Constitution which says the speaker shall, within 21 days after the occurrence of the vacancy, give notice in writing to the electoral agency. The Constitution states that a by-election shall be held within 90 days of the occurrence of the vacancy. Muturi’s notification to the IEBC followed the Court of Appeal’s August 16 ruling which annulled Chris Karan’s election in August last year. Ochieng’ had successfully challenged his defeat. In March, the High Court ruled that Karan’s campaign was “perverted” and that the entire election in Ugenya was “compromised”. The Court of Appeal later dismissed Karan’s case challenging the High Court ruling. Appeal Court judge Hannah Okwengu said the election was validly nullified. JUBILEE MOLE Karan narrowly beat Ochieng’ with just 200 votes. It was the second time the two were facing off in the parliamentary race. In 2013, Ochieng’ emerged victorious. Last year, Ochieng’ ran on the Movement for Democracy and Growth party after falling out with ODM whose flag was flown by Karan. Ochieng’s loss was largely due to being branded a jubilee mole. All candidates vying for various positions against ODM opponents in Siaya were accused of being Jubilee sympathisers. But the notion has since changed following the famous March 9 handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. So far, no other candidate had declared interest in the seat. Ochieng will be banking on his development record. He is credited with boosting agriculture through annual distribution of free hybrid maize seeds and fertiliser to farmers.
