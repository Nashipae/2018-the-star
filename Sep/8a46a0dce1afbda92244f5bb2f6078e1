Police have arrested Michael Oyamo, the personal assistant of Migori Governor, in connection to the abduction of Daily Nation journalist Barack Oduor. Oyamo was arrested in Uriri, Migori, on Tuesday and was taken to Homa Bay police station. Police are investigating the Monday night incident. Oduor, who sustained injuries on his limbs after jumping out of a moving car, was treated at Aga Khan Hospital in Kisumu and discharged. At the time of his abduction, the reporter was in the company of a woman, identified as Beril Sharon. Oduor was to meet Oyamo at Rodi Kopany in Homa Bay before the venue was changed to Rongo. He was bundled into a car which instead of heading to Rongo, sped off towards Kisumu. The journalist said he jumped off the car having sensed danger after his phone was taken by the abductors.
