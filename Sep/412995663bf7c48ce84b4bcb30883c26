Rongo traders have accused the Migori county government of failing to clear the town of piles of garbage. They said on Sunday the waste is hurting their businesses and could drive away investors. They also fear there could be a cholera outbreak if no action is taken. Residents said the refuse has piled since August last year and their frequent pleas to have it cleared have been ignored. Yesterday, efforts to get comments from the county government were unsuccessful. Disaster Management and Environment executive Elijah Odhiambo did not return calls or reply to text messages. Meanwhile, residents demand that the town be restored to its lost glory if it has to grow. “Rongo was the cleanest town in Migori county, but because of poor garbage collection and waste management by the devolved government, we’ve become the filthiest,” Eric Odhiambo said. Elizabeth Atieno said they have lodged complaints through MCA James Maende, but the Okoth Obado administration has been indifferent. “The last time we sought redress we were told the problem would be fixed in a week. That was two months ago. We are staring at a cholera outbreak,” she said. Market chairman George Odiwuor accused the county of focussing only on tax collection and ignoring services that would improve their lives. “Sadly, each time we seek to be addressed by our leaders, they think we need hand-outs. The little money we make here is enough for us. All we want is a clean town,” he said. Odiwour said tax collectors act with impunity and do not care about their situation. He said they are told to pay levies “even if you sell your wares on top of maggots”. Central Kamagambo MCA Maende promised to ensure the problem is fixed soon. He is the county assembly Health committee chairman. “We’ve raised the issue, but there are procedures to be followed in other departments. The matter will be resolved,” he said.
