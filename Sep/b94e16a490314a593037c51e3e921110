The Nairobi government has urged the court to dismiss a case filed Visa Oshwal Community Centre seeking to
stop the demolition of their building, The county has defended its decision to mark the centre for
demolition, saying it sits on riparian land. In an affidavit filed by the Nairobi
Development Control officer Fredrick Ochanda, the county says the decision was made by the Nairobi Regeneration Project Committee. The county is a member of the committee. Ochanda says the county has
the power to prohibit or control the development of land and buildings within
its jurisdiction and also to consider and approve all applications and grant
permissions. He states that if indeed Visa Oshwal
obtained the necessary approvals as alleged, then the same are null and void as
they were issued illegally and in utter contravention of the law. Oshwal have obtained
temporary orders barring the demolition of the centre. Justice
Samson Okongo extended the orders until October 8, when
the case will be heard.
