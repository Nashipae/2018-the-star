Former President Mwai Kibaki has eulogised former Education PS George Godia as a versatile professional and a boardroom reformist. Godia, who also served as Kenya Ambassador to Unesco died, at his Nairobi home after a short illness on Saturday. "He will be remembered as a versatile professional who served multiple roles across a spectrum of sectors within the public service with seamless flair," Kibaki said. In a statement on Sunday, Kibaki said Godia was an astute scholar, accomplished technocrat and consummate diplomat. "His professional imprint and legacy are indelible. I pray that God gives His immeasurable peace and fortitude to the late Godia’s family," he added. DP William Ruto also eulogised Godia as distinguished scholar and diplomat. "Condolences to the family, friends and academia following the passing on of Prof George Godia. Godia advanced Kenya's interests in the international arena," he said. "The country is grateful to Prof Godia for his meticulous service and dedication." National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi said Godia has left behind a rich legacy of a distinguished civil servant. "My heartfelt condolences to the relatives and friends of Prof. George Imbaga Godia. He led an illustrious career in the education sector... May he rest in peace," he said. Professor Godia had just completed his term as Kenya’s ambassador to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. Kibaki appointed him to the position in October 2014. Godia joined the Ministry of Education in 2004 to take up a newly-created position of Education secretary. He later rose to become the PS, replacing Professor James ole Kiyiapi, who resigned to contest for the presidency in 2013. In his earlier life, Godia served as the director and board member at the Central Bank of Kenya. He was also a member of the national task force to review maritime laws and also served as a member of the National Transport Policy Committee. Click here for the latest political news
