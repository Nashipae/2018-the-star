The High Court has ordered Mama Ngina Senior High School and its management out of Kinoo Girls’ High School barely a week after they were integrated. Environment and Land court judge Samson Okongo said the welfare and well-being of the students was more critical. “The status quo, which was there before August 31, when the merger happened, be restored pending the hearing and determination of the case filed by the Presbyterian Foundation,” he said. The church opposed the merger, saying girls have been forced to share toilets with boys. The church, through senior lawyer Kamau Kuria, told the court the merger happened without consultation, yet there was a case pending in court on the ownership of the land on which the school stands. He accused Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung’wah of storming the school last week together with students of Mama Ngina and their teachers. The legislator reortedly changed the management and forced the students to share the facilities. “The girls’ school had 85 students, with some preparing for the national exams. The merger has forced the girls to share toilets with boys,” he said. Prior to the court order, the Land registrar- Kiambu county, Commissioner of Lands, and the MP were opposed to plans seeking to temporarily stop the merger on grounds that learning for the Form Four students had not be disrupted. The case will be heard on October 10. Click here for
