Lack of understanding on the role of county public service boards is hampering development, Devolution PS Charles Sunkuli has said. Sunkuli yesterday said most boards do not understand their role in human resource management and development. “There is need to build the capacity of county public service boards. We came up with training to address the identified gaps to ensure Kenyans get efficient services,” Sunkuli said in a speech read on his behalf by administration secretary Kula Hache. Hache represented the PS during the offi cial opening of a capacity building workshop for county public service boards of Garissa, Wajir and Mandera in a Garissa hotel. Sunkuli said there are no mechanisms for inter-county and intergovernmental transfer of human resource because there is no uniformity across the boards. He said counties had not adhered to the Constitution that requires 30 per cent of jobs be fi lled by minority communities. “This is not being observed against the spirit of inclusivity that the Constitution sought to address,” he said. The PS said some counties were sending employees on suspension and compulsory leave without regard to disciplinary mechanisms. “This has exposed human resource at the counties to a lot of uncertainties and apprehension,”he said. He asked Parliament to address the loopholes. Garissa deputy governor Abdi Dagane said there was need to clarify the roles of county departments
