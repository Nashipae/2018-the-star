Speaker Justin Muturi, Majority Leader Aden Duale and Budget Committee Chairman Kimani Ichung'wa were in attendance.

"We have held discussions with the leadership of Parliament and we will have more engagements to find a solution." For his part, Muturi said they will hold more meetings with the Executive over the matter. "This is our first meeting and moving forward, we will hold more discussions," the speaker said. He did not divulge details of some of the measures the government intends to take to resolve the fuel price row. The 16% VAT saw fuel prices rise to Sh128.7 in Nairobi and Sh140 in Mandera.
