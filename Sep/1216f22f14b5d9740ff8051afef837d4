Rebbecca Leibich, 22, is a youth in Trans Nzoia whose passion for modelling is driven by messages she passes to Kenyans. Leibich, a Bachelors of Human Resource management graduate from Moi University, has developed an outfit that she used to contest for Miss Trans Nzoia 2018. She developed the outfit using used Safaricom scratch cards. She says the concept was motivated by last year’s call by Opposition leader Raila Odinga to boycott the mobile subscriber for allegedly being behind the election malpractices. “With the reality of joblessness and especially among the youth, if Safaricom would have been boycotted, most of us would have lost our jobs, and where would we be able to eke out a living from?” she said. “With the idea I wanted to pass a message to our leaders that no matter what happens, politics should not interfere with business. Back then I was in campus and I was doing a promotion with Safaricom, and I knew that if the boycott could have spread then I would have lost the job.” She showed up with the outfit, under the creative wear category, during the Miss Tourism Trans Nzoia County beauty pageant, which was held in Kitale in May, and took position four. “I was crowned the Miss Sports Ambassador 2018, despite coming position four in the Miss Trans Nzoia,” she said.
