Nakuru assembly deputy speaker and four others charged with links to Njoro land clashes have been released on Sh300,000 bond or Sh100,000 bail. Chief magistrate Josephat Burudi ruled that the state had not given sufficient reasons to continue keeping the accused in custody. “There is no compelling reason to deny the accused person bond. The state has not demonstrated how the accused persons will interfere with the witnesses on the ground,” he ruled. The court said they should not take part in public gatherings. The five — Samuel Tonui (deputy speaker), William Kipkemboi, Joshua Kipchumba, Joseph Rutto and Christopher Samoei — were accused of promoting war-like activities that left six people dead from September 11 to 14 in Neissuit village, Nakuru county. The case will be mentioned today to fix a hearing date. Click here for the latest political
