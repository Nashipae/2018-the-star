A group of activists has warned that Kenyan women risk being bundled out of public service if the fight on corruption is politicised. Under the 'Women Stand Together' caucus, the lot said they are saddened by the way Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu was arrested and dragged to court. The women led by Pamela Mbala said at a Nairobi hotel that it is the prerogative of the Judicial Service Commission to investigate the DCJ. They asked for due process to be followed in dealing with the abuse of office allegations against Mwilu. A court suspended the criminal charges related to the case. "The arrest and arraignment of the DCJ was malicious. We read sinister motives. She is being victimised," Mbala said. The women also condemned what they termed as an attack on acting Lands Commission chairperson Abigail Mbagaya. Mbagaya took over after NLC Chairman Muhamad Swazuri was charged in court. Mbala's team said "those opposed to the Mbagaya's career growth" are determined to see her out of NLC "because she is a woman". "Why did they not report corruption claims against her in the past if they were there," Mbala asked. She faulted the leakage of information on the probe targetting the NLC acting chair to the media. "Leaking information to the media and claiming Mbagaya is corrupt won’t help," Mbala said. Mary Kinyanjui of the group said will not defend women who are corrupt but will stand with "trustworthy and clean" Kenyan women. She asked the DPP and the DCI to follow due process while dealing with state officers or else they "won’t win the war on corruption."
