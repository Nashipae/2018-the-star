Siaya county health facilities have received Sh189 million for the purchase of supplies and equipment to fight HIV-Aids. The money was donated by the Center for Health Solutions and Center for Disease Control. CHS chief executive Paul Wekesa said the initiative is part of a five-year programme running from 2016 to 2021. He spoke at Ukwala Subcounty Referral Hospital. Siaya has the highest HIV-Aids prevalence rate in the country at 29 per cent compared to the national rate of 24.8 per cent. Wekesa said they have put 6,926 people out of 7,663 who tested positive for HIV on antiretroviral therapy. The Sh189 million will also be used to set up 120 testing and counselling booths. Wekesa said the booths will be distributed across the six subcounties and extend their working hours. “...we will be targeting working class residents who are always occupied throughout the day and the fisherfolk who only appear in the evening,” he said. calls for tolerance Wekesa said the funds will facilitate the recruitment of more volunteers in every subcounty to meet the rising number of patients. He said they will provide free HIV testing and checkups. “This is a good step towards the fight against HIV prevalence, which is now at a very alarming rate,” Wekesa added. Governor Cornel Rasanga said the initiative is bound to improve uptake of HIV testing and help realise universal healthcare objectives. “At least 22,306 pregnant women will have knowledge of their HIV-Aids status before delivery,” he said. Rasanga said moving forward the collaborative approach adopted by the project and the county Health department will lead to even better results through his government’s commitment. He called for tolerance among medics when salaries delay due to factors beyond the county’s control.
