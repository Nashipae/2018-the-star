Migori governor Okoth Obado will spend the weekend in police custody as the probe into Sharon Otieno's murder continues. Police said the governor will be charged in a Nairobi court on Monday as a person of interest in the Rongo university student's killing. He was grilled  for hours by officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations at the Kiambu headquarters. The county chief has denied any link to the murder of the 26-year-old student but admitted they were lovers. Last week, Obado told the police in Kisumu that he too was interested in knowing Sharon’s killers. His lawyer Cliff Ombeta has maintained that his client is innocent and has told the police what he knew about the case.

She was in the company of Nation journalist Barack Oduor who says he escaped from the hands of the abductors. Ombeta said: "The pregnancy was an act of love from the governor, from the other side (authorities) its an act of malice." "Today is a very sad day for us. The DCI and the DPP should be ashamed it is very unfair." He said they had responded to the DCI knowing that the governor would not be taken to court. "They have arrested him and he will be charged on Monday," he said. Click here for the latest political news
