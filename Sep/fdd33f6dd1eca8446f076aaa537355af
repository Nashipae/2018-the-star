Likoni Cable Car project fi nanciers
will rake in billions over and above
their initial investment raising the
question whether the deal left Kenya
with the short end of the stick. The Sh5.8 billion project expected
to be operational by 2020 is
funded by Australian fi rm Doppelmayr
Garaventa Group. Kenya Ferry Services and Kenya’s
Trapos Limited are the contracting
authorities.
“ The project will run for 25 years
after construction after which the
project and its assets including
revenue will revert to the contracting
authority, KFS,” project overview
documents seen by the Star
show. The period will enable the investor
recover the initial and operating
costs and also generate a
reasonable return. With 22 cabins carrying 38 passengers
each, the cable cars are expected
to transport at least 70,000
commuters on a daily basis from
Likoni district to the Mombasa Island. This is 20 per cent of the estimated
commuters who use the ferry
everyday with each passenger paying
between Sh20 and Sh100, or an
average of Sh60 per ride depending
on ridership category. Going by Sh20 per ride on the
lower end, the project would makeSh1.42 million in gross revenue on
a daily basis, which is Sh518.3 million
annually or Sh12.95 billion in
25 years. On average, the project would
raise Sh4.24 million a day, which is
Sh38.69 billion gross revenue in 25
years. It would also make Sh7.66
million a day if commuters are to
pay Sh100 per ride. This is Sh64.42
billion in 25 years. This shows that Doppelmayr Garaventa
will make twice, seven or
11 times their investment in gross
revenue on a charge of Sh20, Sh60
and Sh100 respectively per ride
share in 25 years. “Estimated total corporate tax to
be paid by the Project in the concession
period will be Sh17.1 billion.” This is thrice the initial investment.
While the 25 years concession
period is a provision of the
Public Private Partnership Act of
2013, the project’s executive chairman
Gerald Chege said the investment
capital can be recovered in a
shorter period. “From the feasibility study wehave, its easy for the project to
repay itself within 10-15 years,”
Chege said. He denied that KFS will start receiving
the revenue after 25 years
but will start drawing the revenue
from the fi rst year of commercialisation.
