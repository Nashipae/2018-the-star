Knut has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta (pictured) to intervene in talks with the Teachers Service Commission to prevent a strike. Western regional secretary Adeo Owaya said Uhuru’s intervention will help forestall the looming teachers’ strike. The boycott will interfere with national examinations set to begin next month. Knut has opposed some TSC policies, including performance appraisals, delocalisation of school heads and delayed promotions. Adeo said all school heads who had been transferred under the delocalisation programme must return to their homes before the exams begin. He addressed the press on Wednesday after a regional meeting in Kakamega. “Our strike is still on until we reach an amicable solution to the issues we raised concerning draconian policies with our employer before we can call the strike off,” Adeo said. Kenya National Union of Teachers and the TSC are to hold a retreat in Mombasa from September 30 and October 5 to iron out the issues. Adeo said some teachers who were transferred have died. He said the transfers were punitive. Adeo said a teacher who is about to retire cannot be transferred far from his or her home. Adeo said though the President had shown commitment to addressing issues afflicting the teaching fraternity, the talks could collapse due to the stubbornness of some TSC officials. “We’re not going to accept useless government policies lying down. Teachers have rights just like any other public servant,” he said.
