Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to adopt the "Kamata Kamata" slogan in his administration fight against corruption. He made the proposal when he joined Uhuru for the destruction of Sh1.5 billion contrabands at Portland Cement grounds in Mavoko on Friday. Mutua told Uhuru to adopt the message of 'Kamata' - Swahili for arrest, against all corruption suspects. He urged the Head of State to put on blinders like those of racehorses so that he is not distracted by people who would wish to slow his zeal. Mutua added that the fight against corruption will determine whether Kenya leaps economically. "The destiny of our country and children depends on how successful we are in slaying this devil of graft," he said. He called upon actors to ensure fairness and to follow the due process so that the guilty are punished. "I will continue cascading this tough stand against corruption in the Machakos county government. We must clean and save Kenya." Speaking at the same forum, Uhuru said the current war against corruption, contraband, counterfeits and all forms of economic crimes will not be derailed. He cautioned politicians to stop politicising the crackdown adding that he will neither be scared, threatened or side-tracked. Click here for the latest political news
