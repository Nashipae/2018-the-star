A businessman yesterday was charged in a Makadara court with assaulting three people and stealing from the owner ofRidgeways-Inn Restaurant. Daniel Kimani denied five counts of assault and stealing money from the premises on September 20. He was released on Sh100,000 bail by chief magistrate Emily Ominde after Kimani pleaded for lenient bond terms, saying the matter came up following business issues. The case will be heard on November 26. He and others not before court are accused of assaulting and causing bodily harm to Samuel Kiarie at Ridgeways Inn in Nairobi. Kimani faced two other counts in which he was accused of assaulting Alex Wangila and Bernard Kariuki on similar dates and place. In the fourth count, he was charged with stealing Sh103,000 and a mobile phone worth Sh40,000, the property of Silvia Wambui on same date. According to the prosecution reports, the complainants are employed by Wambui, a director of Ridgeways Inn-The Yard along Kiambu Road. While they were on duty, they were confronted by Kimani. Court papers said he arrived at the compound with 15 men, all dressed in black suits and calling themselves bouncers. They were armed with crowbars and chains and told the complainant they wanted to take over the ownership of the management and had an order from Kiambu court number 145/2018. The accused told the first complainant to surrender the keys and and leave the compound. Kiarie refused and a commotion ensued. The other two complainants were also roughed up and beaten by the accused. The first second and third complainants sustained injuries.
