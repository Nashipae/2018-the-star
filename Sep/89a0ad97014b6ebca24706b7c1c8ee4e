Bomachoge Borabu MP Zadoc Ogutu wants top police chiefs in the region overhauled following the killing of an officer and two civilians on Wednesday. He blamed the police for the chaos that rocked Kenyenya town for the better part of Wednesday afternoon. Ogutu told them to release motorcycles and vehicles seized during the protests. He also urged Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to act swiftly. He and Kisii woman representative Janet Ong’era demanded justice for the victims. They welcomed investigations ordered by IG Joseph Boinnet. “We’ve given them a week to conclude investigations or we hold protests to the office of Kisii county commissioner’s office,” Ong’era said. They visited the affected families. Governor James Ongwae, Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, Senator Sam Ongeri and Bomachoge Chache MP Alpha Miruka also condemned the killings. The protests were sparked by the death of matatu conductor Paul Omare, after he was allegedly hit by a police officer. But the police said he fainted while running away from officers on patrol. County acting police chief Francis Nguli said the man died as police were taking him to Kenyenya Subcounty Hospital. Boda boda operator Hesbon Onkoma was shot dead by police while police officer Tom Onyango was killed by protestors. Two other officers, Erick Okemo and Jonathan Musonik, were injured. A Standard 6 pupil who was also injured is admitted at Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital. Officers from the Internal Affairs Unit and another team from the Independent Policing Oversight Authority have launched investigations.
