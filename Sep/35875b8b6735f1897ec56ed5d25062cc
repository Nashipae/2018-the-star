Hundreds of Garissa residents yesterday turned up for a two-day free medical camp. The camp was to help residents suffering either because of lack of awareness or poverty. The camp was organised by the Garissa government, the Kenya Association of Muslim Medical Professionals, Kenyatta University Medical Students Association and Umma University. It was held at Garissa Primary School. Services provided included hygiene education, screening for hypertension, treatment of common ailments and cataract screening. Kenyatta University Muslim Medical Students Association chairperson Anwar Abdi urged residents to seize the opportunity and visit the camp before it ends today. “We will make referrals where necessary at our expense,” Abdi said. Muslima Hassan, whose child was born with blurred eyesight, had the condition corrected by the team. County secretary Abdi Muhumed said the initiative by the medical students has helped residents from poor background who cannot afford to pay for surgery and to be screened for chronic ailments. Meanwhile, Garissa county has started a blood donation drive to ensure its blood bank at the Referral hospital does not run dry. Health executive Ahmed Nadhir said communities need to be educated on the need to donate blood. “We have been losing a lot of lives because of lack of blood. We want to take advantage of this camp to create awareness,” Nadhir said.
