Former Roads assistant minister Joshua Toro has asked Kenyans to ignore leaders from Central supporting DP William Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid. He said Central has decided it will not field a presidential candidate and is not interested in the Deputy President position. “We [in Central] have decided that we will back another person. If there will be a candidate from the region he or she will be on their own,” Toro, a former Kandara MP, said on Sunday. He said the DP manipulated Jubilee nominations to lock out independent-minded leaders from Central and “plant his sycophants who follow him for handouts”. Toro spoke at St John’s Khwisero ACK church during a fundraiser in aid of the church’s venerable Dinna Nambwa, who has suffered stroke. Also present were Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya and Lurambi MP Titus Khamala. He hinted that Central could support a Luhya presidential candidate to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta. ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetang’ula, UDP leader Cyrus Jirongo and Oparanya are among Luhyas who have declared interest to succeed Uhuru. Toro asked leaders from Western to abandon the Luhya unity crusade, saying the community will elect leaders of their choice. “You’ll be lost with this unity thing. Ape Central. In 1997, we had Kibaki [Mwai] and Kenneth Matiba. In 1997, Central had Kibaki and Matiba. In 2002, we had Kibaki again and Uhuru. Did you hear us sitting down to agree on one among them?” he said.
