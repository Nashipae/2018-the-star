Kenya Pipeline’s middle blockers Yvonne Sinaida and Beldine Akinyi are back in training ahead of the seventh edition of the Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) national league on Friday in Wote, Makueni County. Sinaida was down with a knee injury while Akinyi was sidelined with shoulder knock. The presence of the two players is a big boost for assistant coach Margaret Indakala, who will take charge in the absence of head coach Japheth Munala, who will be away with the national women’s volleyball team in Japan for the World Championship. Indakala, a former international, said the two are training with the rest of the squad as they prepare to take on Bomet County in their only fixture of the day. She said: “Team captain Triza Atuka and Christine Siwa, who play in the same position are with the national team. However, we still have other players in that department and the availability of Akinyi and Sinaida is a major boost.” The back-to-back champions take on win-less Bomet County as they seek to guard their unbeaten run. “We have upped our training and the players are in good form ahead of the league match. We are aware our day’s opponent have not won any match and we are not going to be complacent,” Indakala said.
