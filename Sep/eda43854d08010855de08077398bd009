County officers have seized imported alcohol packaged in plastic bottles and sachets. On Wednesday, Embakasi South subcounty liquor committee members and enforcement officers raided a godown in Kiang’ombe ward and found cartons of assorted liquor suspected to have been imported from South Africa. The County Alcoholic Drinks Control and Licensing Board officers said some of it was being loaded onto vans for distribution. Robert Beverages Company Limited manager Daniel Muchai was arrested. The firm had more than 12 cartons of liquor in 200ml sachets. They had Kenya Revenue Authority and Kenya Bureau of Standards stickers and standardisation marks. The company has a distribution licence. Muchai was charged before a city court with importing alcoholic drinks without licences and selling alcohol in plastics. He denied the charges and was granted Sh150,000 bail. The Nairobi City County Alcoholic Drinks Control and Licensing Act banned the use of sachets and plastic bottles in sale, packaging and distribution of alcoholic beverages. “We are determined to rid the city of plastic and sachet alcohol, which has been responsible for deaths of several young people,” Nairobi Liquor Board chairman Kennedy Odhiambo said. The amended Customs and Excise Act (Mututho law) also prohibits the use of plastic bottles in the manufacture of alcohol. Violation of the law attracts a fine not exceeding Sh50,000 and (or) a jail term of six months.
