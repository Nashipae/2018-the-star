He accused them of running illegal businesses and importing contraband goods. "Cross-border smuggling of goods must stop. We've agreed with our security counterparts in Ugandan and Tanzanian to boost border security," he said. "Illegal immigrants smuggle drugs into the country and are also human trafficking kingpins."
