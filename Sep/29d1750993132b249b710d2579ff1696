Trade CS Peter Munya has opposed a bill by Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria that seeks to bar exportation of raw coffee. Munya said the problem with the coffee industry is the lack of good markets. "Coffee after processing has a shorter life shelf of two weeks hence it will result in farmers going at a loss,’’ Munya said. Kenya’s coffee accounts for about 1 per cent of the annual global output, but the top quality Arabica beans are sought after by global roasters who use them to blend with other varieties. Raw coffee beans, which are Kenya’s fifth-biggest source of hard currency, are usually sold at a weekly auction in Nairobi or directly to buyers abroad who then roast, package and sell them at a hefty premium. Coffee exports earned $214 million (Sh21.4 billion) in the year to March. Munya further said his ministry is in the process of doing away with the coffee auction process and introducing commodity export process that will link local coffee factories to international markets since the process will be digitalized. "It is regrettable that countries like Rwanda and Ethiopia have overtaken us in export of coffee and are getting good prices’’ Munya said. Kirinyaga governor Ann Waiguru who accompanied the CS said the county is ready to export directly to international markets. She said they have sourced for a market in Italy and the USA.
