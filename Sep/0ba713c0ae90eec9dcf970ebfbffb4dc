After
an enjoyable morning spent mostly in the Athi Basin, we drove up to the little
dam near No 10 junction. The dam was teeming with wildlife of various species,
including a very noticeable large gathering of vultures. We
sat and watched as they rapidly approached from the sky by landing one after
the other, and then seemingly challenged each other to enter the water first.
No doubt some of them must have been at a kill somewhere. Eventually the
boldest vultures entered the water and started their cleaning ritual, by first dipping
each wing into the water, and then wetting their heads a few times. After
leaving the water, the cleaner vultures flapped their wings a few times and
then opened them wide and let the warmth of the sun dry them slowly. Vultures
play a vital role in nature: to clean up carrion. Their sharp beaks and talons
are efficiently designed to quickly reduce carcass remains to bones. The
cleansing role they play ensures there is less disease by reducing flies. However,
sadly, many people do not know how important they are, and they have even been
poisoned in some parts of Africa. Even though vultures do not look very
handsome or beautiful, they can be fascinating to watch. It is good practice
when in wild areas to watch for vultures, as they often point to where
predators, such as lions, have killed. There
are a predominantly three species of vultures in the Nairobi National Park: the
larger lappet-faced vultures, white-backed vultures and Ruppels Griffon vultures. So
next time you are in the park try a bit of “vulture culture” by looking for
them. Who knows, they could reward you with large a cat sighting.
