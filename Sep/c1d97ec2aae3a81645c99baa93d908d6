Fourteen governors will from tomorrow meet in Nandi county for two days for a special summit of the Lake Region Economic Bloc. Governor Stephen Sang of Nandi will host the county bosses at Nandi Hills. The forum will bring together county chiefs from Busia, Kisumu, Vihiga, Kisii, Trans Nzoia, Kericho, Bomet, among others. Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya will chair the summit. Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa is expected to attend to witness as the governors agree on key deals, including formation of a regional bank for Loreb, which will cost more than Sh2.8 billion. Sang has clarified that his county has not quit the North Rift Economic Bloc (Noreb) and it will be a member of both blocs. “Nandi joined Loreb for strategic reasons, mainly trade because we sell most of our produce to the western counties and we stand to benefit a lot by being members of that group,” he said. Sang also said Nandi has adopted the Big Four agenda which will be aligned with a new development strategy for the region. The county will next week unveil a unique development strategy that will focus on integrating the Big Four and help mobilise internal and external resources. Sang said he believes President Uhuru Kenyatta’s vision on affordable healthcare, manufacturing, food security and affordable housing will transform the country.
