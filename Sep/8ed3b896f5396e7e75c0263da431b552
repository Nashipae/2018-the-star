Kenyatta University midfielder Griffin Okombe is in Italy for a one year renewable contract with club Potenza Picena. The former Kakamega High School player left the country for Italy last week. KU coach, Moses Kagochi said the player deserved the opportunity due to his discipline and style of play, which suits the demands of European hockey. He said: “I believe he is one of the most talented holding midfielders and his style of play suits the teams in Europe. As a team and his coach, we are happy for him and I believe he will create a way for many players to go to Europe.” He added: “The Vultures will miss his services but it’s an opportunity for others to step up and create a niche for themselves. We need to get more players outside the country to play professional as that will help the country close in on the North and West Africa countries who are on the rise.” The Vultures are third from bottom in the Kenya Hockey Union Super League with nine points from nine matches and Kagochi believes the remaining players in that positions will rise to the occasion. Daniel Kundu and Godwin Aseka are expected to fill the void left by Okombe. Kagochi, the brain behind Hockey Farm Sports which focus on coaches’ development through coaching courses, clinics seminars and player development and exchange programs, observed that Kenya has good players who can excel in Europe. “When we have many players playing professional hockey, it is definite that when they come back to Kenya, they will bring on board something different and that is why the HFS is trying to do, get more players turn professional. The country don’t play international friendly matches as we would have liked but if we get various players turn professional, we will have a strong national team,” said Kagochi.
