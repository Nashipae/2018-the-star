The owner of Airgate Centre - formerly known as Taj Mall - Ramesh Gorasia - has said his demolished building is not on the oil pipeline. Kenya Pipeline Company MD Joel Sang said it is. Gorasia said no road can be constructed without demolishing the KPC houses which he claimed are built on a road reserve. “If you look at the buildings that belong to KPC, they are on road reserve and it will be useless to demolish this and not demolish them,” he said He said it was wrong for the Kenya Pipeline boss to support the demolition of his mall because “he was among individuals who approved its construction”. “Let’s be open on this issue; Kenya Pipeline cannot allow anyone to construct above the oil pipeline. This is false and aims to taint my image publicly. I want Kenyans to know that the government approved all the documents,” he said. Gorasia said he has written to the DCIO for “appropriate action” to be taken against those who authorised the demolition. He urged the government not to be in a hurry to demolish structures without carrying out adequate investigations. approvals “We have lost at least between Sh40-50 million, over 10,000 families have remained hopeless due to joblessness and 139 tenants are outside the building,” he said. Gorasia said Kenya Pipeline has not communicated to him. “I was approved by every organ, including the Ministry of Housing,” he said. demolition Last Saturday, Sang, in a statement, said the building was a threat not only to tenants, but also residents living in adjacent areas. He said the mall was also a threat “to the supply of fuel in the country and the East African region”. He said the affected lines are the Old Mombasa-Nairobi pipeline (Line One) and the recently completed Mombasa-Nairobi pipeline (Line Five). The company supported the demolition, saying it is a move to safeguard the pipeline.
