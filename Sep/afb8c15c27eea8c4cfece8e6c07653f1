International Monetary Fund said Kenya’s external financial position is strong, as the country awaits the international lender’s review on the facility that expired Friday. IMF representative to Kenya Jan Mikkelsen told Reuters that Kenya’s foreign exchange reserves are at a very comfortable level, adding that the fund will continue to support the country’s fiscal reforms. “The second review of the IMF-supported program has not been completed, and the program will expire today (Friday). It should be stressed that Kenya’s external position remains strong and foreign exchange reserves are at a very comfortable level,’’ Mikkelsen told Reuters. IMF granted Kenya the $1.5 billion (Sh150 billion) facility on March14, 2016, to end on March 14, 2018 but Treasury secured a six-month extension to September 14, 2018, promising to undertake sound fiscal changes. In a letter to IMF managing director dated March 6, 2018, Treasury CS Henry Rotich and CBK governor Patrick Njoroge promised to reduce fiscal deficit from 8.8 per cent to GDP in 2016/17 to 7.2 in 2017/18 and 5.8 per cent in the current financial year. They also promised to scrap interest cap law that masked lending rates at four per cent above Central Bank rate, increase revenue collection by removing tax exemptions, cut on borrowing and freeze infrastructure projects. The government on Wednesday said it has steady forex reserve to cushion shilling against external forces and can cover six months of sustained imports, hence no urgent demand for the IMF cover.
