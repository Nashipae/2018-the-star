The Coast’s huge potential in agriculture needs to be exploited, Taita Taveta governor Granton Samboja has said. Kilifi, Kwale, Taita Taveta, Tana River and Lamu have adequate land for large-scale farming. "Cashew nut farming in Kwale, Kilifi and Lamu counties collapsed 30 years ago, turning a potential farming population of 15,000 people into beggars," the governor said. Samboja spoke on Saturday at the end of this year’s Agricultural Society of Kenya Mombasa International Show. "What must we do to help our people? We must embrace agricultural production, equip our agricultural extension officers and re-train them," he said.
