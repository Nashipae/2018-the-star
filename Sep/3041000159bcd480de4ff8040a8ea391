Eleven Coast MPs and a senator have promised to forge a joint front ahead of 2022. Speaking in Bura, Tana River, during a funds drive in aid of youth groups, the politicians said previous regimes took advantage of the political division. Speaker after speaker emphasised the need for unity among them, saying Coast will play a central role in the formation of the 2022 government. Coast Parliamentary Group chairman and Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori said the unity drive will incorporate programmes and projects to uplift economic standards. “As leaders we have realised our biggest undoing is lack of unity. We stand a better chance of being in the next government if we speak in one voice,” Dori said. “We are doing this for the sake of our people, who are languishing in poverty because of our division.” Dori was elected on the ODM ticket. He said the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga closed the political divide. The MP said some top party leaders still view them as disloyal to ODM. “When Aisha Jumwa and I declared our support for [Deputy President William] Ruto’s 2022 bid, some leaders branded us betrayers,” he said. Bura MP Ali Wario said the region will support Ruto. “We have made up our minds. As elected leaders from the Coast we shall rally behind Ruto’s candidature.” Others present were Ali Wario (Garsen), Danson Mwashako (Wundanyi), Ali Mbogo (Kisauni), Said Hiribae (Galole), Kassim Tandaza (Matuga), Paul Katana (Galoleni) and Badi Twalib (Jomvu).
