Cotu has threatened to call for a national workers strike if the government will not do away with the 16 per cent VAT. The umbrella workers union wants the government to suspend the increase or scrap it completely. Speaking to the press in Nairobi yesterday, secretary general Francis Atwoli said it was wrong for President Uhuru Kenyatta to remain silent on the matter as poor Kenyans are suffering. “Since the President came back silently from China, the public remains optimistic on his comment. We urge him to salvage this issue.” Atwoli said the hiked VAT has increased the cost of living. He added that Kenyans are struggling to raise money for transport. The secretary general urged the government to instead tax those found guilty of corruption. “We all know those who have money in their houses. We know who have acquired property by dubious means. Why don’t you tax them? We need to find other means of getting revenue.” Cotu told Uhuru to crack the whip on corrupt individuals. “We are 100 per cent behind Uhuru. We support the handshake and any effort that will help eradicate corruption, but we insist the 16 per cent levy must be scrapped.” The Cotu boss told Deputy President William Ruto to stand by his word concerning the tax increase. “I am wondering why the DP promised to look into the matter but he has now disappeared. I urge him to advice Uhuru to do away with the increase,” Atwoli said. He added that seized contraband sugar must be destroyed. “Some of them are being re-packaged in branded packages.”
