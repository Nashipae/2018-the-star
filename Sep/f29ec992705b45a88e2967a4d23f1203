STARRING: Esther Povitsky, Benji Aflalo CREATED BY: Benji Aflalo, Esther Povitsky, Eben Russell GENRE: Comedy PREMIER SECOND SEASON: August 1  As millennials grow more and more obsessed about trends, their lives seem have less and less meaning. And no, that’s not harsh. If Alone Together, is any indication of the future (or present), then we are doomed. Esther and Benji are eccentric to say the least. Esther is trying to make it as a comedian and Benji is waiting for his trust fund to kick in. Their peculiar natures are their binding force in a dysfunctional platonic relationship. They adore the glitz of the Los Angeles life and long to be part of the in-crowd. But their bitchy attitudes and lack of proper socialism makes them unwanted. The duo ends up mooching off family and friends, as well as getting into all types of shenanigans, as they try to achieve their ambition of being popular. Having been based off a short film by the two stars, the show is a testimony that the younger generation are in fact much smarter than they are given credit. Although Povitsky and Aflalo get credit for being creative in their satirical representation of their generation, they lack experience as to what constitutes a great show.  The content, the plot and the dramatisation are all as dry as a bone. And the comedy hardly produces any chuckles. And whilst there are many of the generation Zs who’ll find the show appealing in their own right, most viewers will miss the point completely. The show desperately needs the experienced comedic expertise of Andy Samberg, who serves as executive producer.  Star Rating: 2/5
