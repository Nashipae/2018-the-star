MPs who defied President Uhuru Kenyatta and voted against his eight per cent tax on fuel were playing politics, a development expert has said. International development consultant Kithinji Kiragu said the MPs were more interested in protecting their seats. Kiragu said legislators had voted to shelve implementation of the tax for two more years before the President intervened and slashed it by half. They played politics instead of giving a solution, Kiragu said. He said the MPs only wanted to appease their voters by removing the tax completely, yet they did not say where the country would get money for development and services. He praisedthe President for reducing the tax. “They removed the tax because they heard people complaining and thus feared they might lose votes,” Kiragu said. The expert said MPs should decide whether they want to help Kenya’s economy grow or decline. He argued that by trying to postpone implementation of the fuel tax, and then voting against reduction without giving a solution, the MPs were pushing the state into a budget deficit. Kiragu said a deficit is more likely to destroy the country than the tax on fuel as the shortfall might force the government to print paper money. Kiragu, who consults for among other organisations the World Bank, said a country cannot survive without taxes. He said that the VAT on fuel would not affect the ordinary people much as the rich who own cars. “The woman who is weeding her farm using her panga will only be affected in a small way when she is travelling to the market,” Kiragu said.
