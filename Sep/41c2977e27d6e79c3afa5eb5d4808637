ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru yesterday launched Ajira Digital Club, a programme meant to introduce youths to online jobs and provide them with necessary skills.  Speaking during the launch at the University of Nairobi, Mucheru said online work is “a revolution whose time has come”. He said it will curb unemployment among the youth. “This is a transition for the youth to even learn as they earn. We are committed to train people on how to get online jobs because that is the key driver to reducing unemployment,” Mucheru said. He urged youths to register for training to learn new skills on how to find jobs online. The programme will offer students mentorship and collaborative learning approaches. University of Nairobi chancellor Vijoo Rattansi praised the ministry for choosing to partner with the institution. “The partnership will help our students join the job market and provide incredible services,” Rattansi said. Vice chancellor Peter Mbithi said 193 students had already been trained over the last two months. More were targeted for enrolment in the next academic year. “Statistics show that 39 per cent of Kenyans are unemployed, 70 per cent of them are youths. We have to do something as a country and I’m happy the Ministry of ICT has partnered with the university to train the youth to access and secure online jobs,” Mbithi said. The launch was attended by PS Jerome Ochieng. The government is implementing the programme in collaboration with Telkom Kenya Ltd and other partners. Click here for the latest politicla news
