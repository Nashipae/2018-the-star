DJ Stylez is still going through a “naturally tough” time a year after losing his and Madtraxx’ sister, Dr Njeri Muigai. Dr Muigai died after an accident in her home. She was eight months pregnant at the time. Her mother found her lying on the floor and rushed her to hospital in Nairobi,where she was pronounced dead on arrival.Unfortunately, the baby did not make it either. DJ Stylez opened up to Word Is about how he has been holding up. He said they are trying to keep her work alive by helping people with mental issues, as she was a mental health specialist. “It’s tough, it’s naturally tough. That was my best friend,” Stylez said. “She was a doctor who was very big on mental health, psychology and psychiatry, and she had started initiatives to do with mental health. So what we are trying to do, and we have big shoes to fill, is see how to continue with that work.” He said mental health is a serious problem in Kenya, and Dr Muigai had started different initiatives to tackle it. Stylez and family are trying to see how they can “plug into those initiatives” and continue her work. “I mean, it’s tough. There are some things you really don’t ever get over, but you learn to take a step at a time,and we are thankful for that,” he said. Dr Muigai worked with the Health ministry in Kiambu county
