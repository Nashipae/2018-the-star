Kenya National Union of Teachers appears to soften its stand over the move by the Teachers Service Commission to have teachers undergo performance appraisals. Knut deputy secretary general Hesbon Otieno said the union was not opposed to the appraisals but the manner TSC in which was conducting the exercise. He said TSC must suspend the appraisal first and invite the union to discuss the same before subjecting teachers to the exercise. Speaking at Getumbe Secondary School in Belgut constituency in Kericho on Saturday during the Kericho branch AGM, Otieno asked the TSC stop pushing the appraisals down the throats of the teachers. “We demand withdrawal of the letters (forms) immediately. We will only accept this if we are called to discuss the issue in a fair and conducive environment. We detest such like policies by TSC pushing down the throat of the teachers before proper consultations are done,” said Otieno.

He said it was wrong for TSC to force teachers to download appraisal forms online using their own money instead of bringing the same to their schools. “It is common practice to have evaluation and we are not opposing it but the way TSC is doing it is not right.” he said. Last week, teachers in Uasin Gishu burnt the forms saying they did not support the exercise. The AGM was attended by the acting national chairman Wycliffe Omuchei, national executive council members and branch official from various branches across the country. The union also asked the TSC to heed the order by President Kenyatta not transfer teachers with families in the on-going delocalisation. Otieno claimed the TSC has become stubborn and continue to transfer teachers despite the president directive.
