A Chinese national is set to be deported following his arrest for referring to President Uhuru Kenyatta and Kenyans as monkeys. Liu Jiaqi was secretly captured in a video by a worker he had threatened to sack from his motorcycle shop. In the clip, the trader brags that there is nothing that 'poor, black, smelly' Kenyans can do to him even he sacks the said employee. He even proceeds to say the Kenyans he is referring to includes the President. He speaks of how stupid Kenyan citizens are. The employee is heard arguing a case of unfair treatment by the Chinese man who interrupts him saying it is because he is Kenyan. "Everyone, every Kenyan is like a monkey. Even Uhuru Kenyatta, all of them," Liu says. "I donâ€™t like you monkey people, [you] smell bad and foolish and black." Liu says all he wanted in Kenya was to make money. Police said the foreign national will be put in a plane this morning. The video emerged barely hours after police raided CGTN studios in Nairobi and arrested foreign nationals. The company said police arrested 13 workers, eight being the broadcaster's employees. Liu runs the Sonlink Limited, which sells motorbikes in Ruiru. Click here for the latest political news
