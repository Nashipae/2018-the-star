Interior CS Fred Matiang'i on Wednesday said the instant fine for motorists who flout traffic rules will take effect in the next one month. The High court had on Tuesday dismissed a suit seeking to block the penalties ranging from Sh500 to Sh10,000. The case, filed by employees of the Kenya National Union of Co-operatives, sought to have the rules nullified and police stopped from applying them. Matiang'i, while opening the national policing conference at the Kenya School of Government, said the new rule will be of convenience to the judicial processes. He said that together with his ICT counterpart Joe Mucheru, and Transport CS James Macharia, they have formed a task force that will come up with the best framework for implementing the new rules. The task force chaired by Transport PS Esther Koimett will lead consultations with the Judiciary, the National Transport Safety Authority (NTSA), the Attorney General, and Solicitor General to see to it that the new regulations take effect as planned.

In the new regulations, the offenders can be granted instant bails if they do not plead guilty, after which they are booked for court trials. "This will foster convenience and help in decongesting remands," the Interior ministry boss said. Matiang’i also revealed that the government is mulling over legislative amendments to Parliament in a bid to decriminalise minor traffic offences.
