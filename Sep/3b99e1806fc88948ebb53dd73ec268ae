The resumption of second leg of the Football Kenya Federation women’s Premier League has stalled due to failure by Football World governing body, Fifa to release funds. The second leg was scheduled to kick off last July. FKF chief executive officer, Robert Muthomi, confirmed the development, saying they are yet to receive their second funding from Fifa hence the delay of the kick off. The official said: “Fifa released money at the beginning of the season and were to send the balance later in the year. As a federation, we held executive meeting with the members and decided that we will give clubs a grant of Sh750,000 each. During the first leg, we gave some clubs half the money while others received slightly more.” He added: “We are in constant communication with the Fifa and going by the look of things, we might receive the money any time from now. Should we receive the cash this week, we intend to communicate to the clubs to start preparations. We are targeting to start the second leg on September 22 if all goes well.” At the same time, Muthomi said the grants they receive from Fifa cannot be enough to funding the 16 women’s clubs in the premier league and the 16 teams that form the Division 1. “The money we receive from Fifa can never be enough especially considering that we have to pay referees, playing fields as well as ambulances. That’s why we are calling on the clubs to look for alternatives so that the federation compliments them,” said Muthomi. Former champions Thika Queens, who have acquired the services of speedy national team player Esse Akida from Spedag, are in currently pole position after an unbeaten with 36 points from 12 matches. Champions Vihiga Queens are second with 33 points from 13 matches while Trans Nzoia Falcons complete the top three with 29 points from 14 matches. However, relegation cloud hangs over Mombasa Olympic and Baringo Starlets. Starlets remain win-less from 13 matches while Olympic have six points from 13 matches.
