Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has accused assembly speaker Florence Mwangangi of engaging in politics instead of effectively discharging her constitutional duties. The governor said Mwangangi should resign if she wants to engage in local politics. Mutua spoke during a leaders meeting organised by Machakos county commissioner Abdullahi Galgalo at his residence on Monday. Mutua said Mwangangi was elected only by 50 people, and must recognise there is a government with a governor, his deputy, CECs and MCAs. “She should do her duties so we all improve the lives of the people,” Mutua said. He said the Machakos county assembly was out to frustrate his government. “They declined to approve my nominated CECs. Their plan was to frustrate Mutua so that residents suffer. They are so much focused on Mutua than anything else,” said the governor. He told the MCAs he acted constitutionally by appointing the county executives without the assembly’s approval. He said the county assemblies should be advised to stop politicking, saying it would take them nowhere. Mutua said he is ready to meet with the MCAs. “I want unity, let’s work together. I am ready to work with all the elected leaders, MCAs, MPs, senator, Woman Representative, just the way I am working well with the Machakos County Commissioner Abdullahi Galgalo,” said Mutua. Mutua said he had appointed subcounty, ward and village administrators as enshrined in the constitution. He said there is no competition between his administration and the county assembly. In July, Mutua appointed seven ministers after the assembly failed to approve the nominees within 21 days as stipulated under the Appointments Act. Mutua said he made the appointments in the best interest of Machakos people and in upholding the constitution and rule of law. The seven have since taken up their positions.
