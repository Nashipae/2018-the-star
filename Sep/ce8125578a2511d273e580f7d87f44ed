Stakeholders in the matatu sector held a peaceful protest over the 16% VAT on petroleum products which took effect on Saturday. Together with residents, they paralysed Kanu Street for the better part of yesterday. Nakuru political activist Abdul Noor, who led the protest, told the government to rethink the tax which is a burden to Kenyans. The protesters said many youths who depend on the sector for a livelihood will be rendered jobless. They vowed to hold the demos until the government rescinds the decision. "Even though the government is in debt, hiking prices of commodities such as fuel will not help. It should look for other ways of cutting costs and raising money," Noor said. A spot check by the Star at Mololine booking office in Nakuru found stranded passengers. In an interview, Mololine operations manager David Kahiga said they increased fares because of the new fuel prices. Passengers were paying Sh500 from Nakuru to Nairobi, up from Sh300. Kahiga said business is low because people are not travelling owing to the cost. Passengers and drivers we spoke to the Star want the government to shelve the tax to end Kenyans' suffering.
