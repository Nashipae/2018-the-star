Kenya Cup champions Kenya Commercial Bank play Western Province and their Under 21 side during their 10-day trip to Cape Town next month.  The squad will also have a feel of the high performance facilities in Cape Town as part of the trip and interact with players from Western Province. This will be the second year in row that the bankers are heading to South Africa ahead of the start of the Kenya Cup season.  KCB RFC patron Job Njiru said the club must stay ahead of the chasing pack if they are to win a third consecutive crown come the end of the season. “If you saw the final against Kabras last year, it was too close. We are aware teams have upped their game and we must stay ahead of everyone. The trip down south will be key for the us,” added Njiru. “The High Performance Training tour in South Africa will entail highest levels of coaching commitment, if we are to develop and implement our programs. We need highly structured competitions, heavy emphasis on decision making and data management, extensive interpersonal contact and very demanding and restrictive athlete selection criteria for each game,” he added. Head coach Curtis Aluoch toured the Western Province facility in July in a bid to build the team’s confidence and consistency ahead of the season in November KCB will be playing at next month’s Impala Floodlit tournament, where they are the defending champions. The 40-man squad will leave in two batches with the first batch leaving on Wednesday and the second batch on Thursday.
