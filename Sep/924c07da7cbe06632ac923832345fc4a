The national government will issue a directive on how farmers will access markets when they harvest maize this year, Livestock PS Fred Segor has said. He said the ministry will advise in the next one and a half months on how marketing of maize will be done to cushion farmers from problems like late payment and nonpayment. “The government is determined to ensure we create market for farmers. Discussions are ongoing in the ministry to see how the produce that farmers will harvest reaches the market,” Segor said on Friday. The PS said farmers have invested heavily and the government will ensure they benefit from their sweat. He said the government will continue to reduce the cost of production so farmers can reap maximum benefits from their investments. Segor said the cost of production has been high in previous years but interventions such as the fertiliser subsidy programme and tax-free importation of farm machinery has helped. Uasin Gishu governor Jackson Mandago asked the national government to speed up efforts to solve problems facing the maize sector. He urged the government to set aside money early so that when the time to harvest comes, farmers will be paid in time. Mandago urged the management of the National Cereals and Produce Board to ensure only genuine farmers deliver their produce to the stores.
