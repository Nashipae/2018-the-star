The congestion at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital in Kisumu is caused by the high number accident cases in Western Kenya region. Kisumu health executive Rosemary Obara said rising accidents especially those involving bodaboda riders are to blame. Obara who addressed the press on Monday said staff were overstretched and called for more personnel. She said they had put in place measures to deal with congestion at the 200-bed capacity hospital. Improvisations have been made to accommodate 526 beds. “It is clear that the referral status of the hospital has attracted massive patient admissions. Quality service is the cause of the current congestion,” Obara said. The county government allocated Sh3 billion for health this financial year. Obara said they have earmarked resources to be used in constructing a new 300-bed capacity surgery hospital as long-term solution. Obara said the hospital is the only referral facility in the region and cannot accommodate all emergency surgery cases. She urged residents to enroll for universal health coverage through NHIF to enable them get treatment in subcounty hospitals.
