At least seven senators are expected to leave this weekend for Japan to attend the world volleyball championships. They are not players or famous fans. Call them prominent spectators if you like. They will each be earning a daily stipend of Sh80,000 for 18 days to watch the Kenyan team whose players are on an Sh80,000 allowance for the entire duration of the championship. The senators will cost the Kenyan taxpayer nearly Sh2 million each, accommodation and travel included. After the MPs’ infamous Russia 2016 World Cup benchmarking fiasco, what value will this trip add to the sport of volleyball? We wait for the justification of this profligacy at a time when the government is exhorting Wanjiku to accept the burden of more taxes. The trip comes just weeks after the government issued a circular on austerity measures, including a freeze on training, hospitality and other luxurious expenditures. We expect the Senate, led by its speaker, to empathise with the suffering of the electorate. But, alas, it has exhibited a rare penchant for fleecing the public with useless overseas junkets. Either the House has excess funds or its priorities are not in sync with the national mood. We take solace in the wisdom of National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi in turning down a bid by MPs to also hop onto this gravy train, and condemn this proclivity by senators to line their pockets at the expense of the public.
