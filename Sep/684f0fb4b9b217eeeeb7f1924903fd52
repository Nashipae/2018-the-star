Education authorities on Wednesday closed a school in Thika over claims of devil worship. Thika director of education Ronald Mbogo said Caritas Mariana Secondary School was also shut over cases of sexual exploitation and indiscipline. A team of officials from the Education ministry recommended the closure of the institution sponsored by a Nigerian-run Catholic mission. Seventy-two students, among the 10 KCSE candidates, have not found new schools. The school's Parents Teachers Association chairman Henry Ngure said they were shocked by the decision. The management reads an ulterior motive in the closure. They claim land grabbers are eyeing a prime plot owned by the school. "Parents are frustrated because their children have been rejected by other schools," Ngure said. Director John Mwaura said no one bothered to investigate the allegations made in an anonymous letter. A parent asked, "Where will we take our children? Schools are telling us to wait until next year." Parents told the Star they have faith in the school since it is founded on Christian principles. They said allegations of sexual harassment and the existence of a cult at the school are malicious. Mbogo said they have the names of students who did not find new schools, and they will intervene for them to get admission elsewhere. In 2016, Kiambu county officials raided the premises and closed a primary school. A priest at the school wrote a protest letter. He accused government officials of acting with malice.
