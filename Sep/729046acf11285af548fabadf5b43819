Kisumu MCAs have accused speaker Onyango Oloo of single-handedly running the affairs of the assembly. Members accused Oloo of ‘deliberate’ delays in tabling the assembly’s financial report since they were sworn-in office last year. Kolwa East MCA Stephen Owiti said the speaker is micromanaging the House and derailing its operations. He said the assembly has a recurrent budget of Sh700 million, but no financial report has been brought before MCAs. “It is required that financial report is brought in the House quarterly. Such has never been done since the inception of the current MCAs,” Owiti said.

Owiti claimed Oloo wants to micromanage the assembly including expenditure and employment of staff. Kisumu West MCA Paul Okiri said members have not received quarterly financial reports on assembly expenditure as required. This prompted members on Wednesday to seek removal of two members of the board- Agnes Nyagoya and George Abaja. The two were to be replaced by majority leader Kenneth Onyango and chief whip Gard Olima. They are accused of conspiring with Oloo, who chairs the board, of micromanaging the affairs of the assembly. But before their removal, chaos started when nominated MCA Caleb Omoro tabled an impeachment motion to sack the speaker. Oloo left the seat when Omoro stood to move the motion and MCA Roy Sambu “took over as speaker”. Members opposed to the motion termed it illegal since proper procedure was not followed. Oloo’s allies engaged with colleagues in a heated exchange. More: Speaker Oloo ducks impeachment motion Click here for
