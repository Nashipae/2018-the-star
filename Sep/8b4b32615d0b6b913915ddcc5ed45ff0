Two popular policewomen who became a sensation on social media because of their looks may be in trouble. One almost lost her job recently after she was found guilty of leaking police information to her controversial boyfriend, who was deported a few weeks ago. According to our source, the policewoman was forgiven after her ‘godfathers’ intervened. The other cop is among the over 300 police who will lose their jobs after they were found to be corrupt. This is as the government implements major reforms in the structure, command, control and welfare of the National Police Service. The two have of late toned down on social media, and rarely post a series of pics a day like they used to before.
