Female MPs have come out to the defence of embattled Nairobi Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi, saying she is being victimised because she is a woman. National Assembly Women Caucus condemned the move by MCA's to forcefully evict Elachi out of her office on Monday MCAs impeached Elachi last week on Thursday but a court reinstated her. Some 103 MCAs voted to remove her from office, two voted against while two others abstained. The MCAs removed her for causing 'great embarrassment' to the county assembly.

Chaos at City Hall as MCA's evict Elachi But Kenya Women Parliamentary Association chair Fatma Gedi said in a press conference at Tamarind Hotel Mombasa that it was totally wrong for the MCAS to use force against Elachi. “We believe that Elachi is being fought for being a woman, but she deserves a chance to be heard and the MCAs should respect the court order that is in place,” Gedi said. Gedi said Elachi obtained stay orders from the Court, which allows her to continue staying in office until the matter is heard and determined. “We know there are some issues, but she has stay orders and we must respect the law. I want to urge MCAs, especially women MCAs not to be used by men colleagues to fight their fellow women because we have seen before that when a woman does something she is being fought left right and centre, but men are protected,” said Gedi. Samburu West MP Naisula Lesuuda said it was total disrespectful of the MCAs to use force to try and eject the Nairobi speaker from office. “Yes, there could be issues, but as leaders, we must do things in a manner that bring honour to the offices we hold. It is very wrong to see MCAs trying to eject a speaker who has already obtained a court order and we believe that she should be given an opportunity to be heard by the relevant authorities in their own structures,” said Lesuuda.
