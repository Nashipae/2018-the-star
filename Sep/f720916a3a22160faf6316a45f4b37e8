Sauti Sol’s guitarist Polycarp Otieno, famous as fancy fingers, is set to have a church wedding after saying ‘I do’ to his long-time Burundian girlfriend Lady Mandy last month in Burundi. “The one we had in Burundi was big enough and I had everybody that I wanted to see there, but we have to do a church wedding to get church blessings,” he said. “Dates and destination of the wedding are not set yet, although it will be exclusively for family,” Polycarp told Word Is. The couple solemnised their union in a stunning traditional wedding ceremony in Burundi the same day Polycarp went to pay the dowry. “That is according to the Burundi culture,” Polycarp explained. How is their culture different from Kenya’s? “There are two clans in Burundi, which speak the same language but each has its own way of doing things. So you pay the dowry after negotiating and agree with the family before the actual date,” he said. “Then on the actual dates, you meet there. There is a lot of celebrations with music and drums, which they play in a perfect way. Then the groom presents the dowry, which the family either accepts or refuses. All this time, the lady is hidden.” The wedding was attended by the groom’s brother, his band mates and Kenya’s Ambassador to Burundi, Ken Vitisia.
