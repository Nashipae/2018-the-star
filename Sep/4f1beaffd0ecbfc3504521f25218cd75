Controversial singer and performer Esther Akoth, alias Akothee, spent Sh300,000 on her latest single, Lotto, produced by Nigerian record producer DJ Coublon. “For the first time my fans have responded positively to my songs. I know they are not easy people to deal with and tunakazana. I am very inspired and I think I should do this even more,” she told Word Is. “The whole project wasn’t a cheap project because the audio alone cost me $3,000 (Sh300,000 ) and the video was even more.” Lotto is about finding love against all odds as a woman. “I always sing for myself before jumping to a studio. I was born a happy person and the only way I can share that with my fans is through songs. “The whole project was inspired by my life and it is basically to uplift women’s spirit and let them know that God can work for them any time. Be happy because there could be someone dying to reach that position you think is the lowest for you.” She said she is now able to feed over 40 families through her many business, including her travel company. “Women succumb to opportunities that men offer them. Most women think that by sleeping with their bosses, they will get whatever promotions they want, but in reality, you end up losing your dignity and self-esteem,” Akothee said.
