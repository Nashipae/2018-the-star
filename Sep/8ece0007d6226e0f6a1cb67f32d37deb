The person who will succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022 will be endorsed by him, Cherangany MP Joshua Kuttuny has said. â€œAnybody who wants to be the President must go slowly. The person must respect other leaders otherwise this is a hard task," Kuttuny said. The MP who spoke on Saturday in Sinoko, Cherangany, during the burial of Mama Rhoda Rukia, said the next leader should be loyal to President Uhuru. Kuttuny said based on his experience, he will reveal who is capable of taking over after Uhuru's term ends. The MP said the March 9 handshake between the President and ODM leader Raila Odinga has improved the atmosphere in the cosmopolitan constituency. "There is peace in the country. Some people in Jubilee are not comfortable with the handshake. It seems as if Baba came with pepper that is making them uneasy," Kuttuny said. On the much criticised 16% fuel levy, Kuttuny said Cabinet secretaries do not understand the problems of ordinary Kenyans. He proposed constitutional changes for MPs to be picked as ministers. Kuttuny wondered why Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich disregarded MPs' amendment to the 2018 Finance Bill and effected the tax on September 1. On August 29, lawmakers voted to suspend the implementation of the fuel levy until September 1, 2020.
