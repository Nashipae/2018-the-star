The Frontier Counties Development Council will focus on eradicating animal disease and promoting access to international markets for its livestock products. This emerged yesterday during the second day of the bloc’s conference in Kanyerus, West Pokot. Its governors said they produce 90 per cent of meat consumed in Kenya and it was time they exploited international markets to improve farmers’ incomes. “Diseases have prevented us from selling our livestock products, especially meat, to other countries. We want to collaborate with neighbouring counties and countries to ensure our region is disease-free,” West Pokot governor John Lonyangapuo said. The development bloc brings together West Pokot, Isiolo, Tana River, Garissa, Wajir, Turkana, Mandera, Samburu, Lamu, Wajir, Baringo and Marsabit. Lonyangapuo said they will partner with neighbouring countries like Uganda to vaccinate livestock and control crossborder spread of disease. He appealed to donors to help them complete Nasukuta Slaughterhouse in Cheparereria so they can control the market and enable farmers to read from the venture. “Frontier counties have resources but lack avenues to exploit them. The region has remained marginalised since independence,” he said. FCDC CEO Mohammed Gullet said the council had invested heavily in education to reduce illiteracy levels. He said they will set up border schools to unite warring communities. “The schools will ensure children from warring communities come together to learn and enhance coexistence,” he said. They have also identified education, roads, food security, health, peace and agriculture to improve livelihoods. World Bank will fund the council’s Sh120 billion projects. Other governors who attended the conference were Mohamed Ali (Marsabit), Moses Kasaine (Samburu), Patrick Khaemba (Trans Nzoia), Ali Roba (Mandera), Mohamed Kuti (Isiolo), Mohamed Abdi (Wajir) and Alex Tolgos (Elgeyo Marakwet).
