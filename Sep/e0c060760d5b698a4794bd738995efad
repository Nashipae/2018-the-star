Tourism stakeholders at the Coast recorded an increased number of domestic and international guests in the month of August. The hoteliers said August recorded bed occupancy of between 75-90 per cent in most hotels. Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers Coast boss Sam Ikwaye told the Star that this year the sector has recorded better performance than the last two years. “We are doing quite well. August was very good and we are seeing our hotel continuing to receive more guests this September. We also have booking going all the way to December,” said Ikwaye. At the South Coast, Diani Reef Managing Director Bobby Kamani said this year’s high season, which started in mid-July, has seen an increased number of guest coming to the coast. According to Kamani, domestic tourists account for 70 per cent of all festive bookings and many facilities have now developed different packages for the locals. “Domestic tourism barely existed a decade ago. However, many hotels have now come up with different packages for locals. This August, normally a busy month for foreigners in Kenya, we saw many more Kenyans visiting the coast than foreigners,” he said. Kamani said the emerging Kenyan middle class is driving this. He said they are also optimistic that President Uhuru Kenyatta's visit to the US and China will bring good tidings to the sector, as they expect more Americans and Chinese tourists to come to Kenya. “The most recent visit of President Kenyatta to the US to meet with President Trump will encourage international visitors from the US to Kenya, not only for trade and investment but also contribute significantly in the tourism sector,” said Kamani.
