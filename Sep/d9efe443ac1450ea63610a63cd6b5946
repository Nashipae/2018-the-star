The national women’s volleyball team will now depart to Tokyo, Japan on Thursday ahead of the FIVB World Championship set for September 29 to October 20. The team, under the tutelage of coach Japheth Munala and his assistant Josp Barasa were set to travel to the host nation today but the government, through the Ministry of Sports, rescheduled the trip to Thursday. Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) chairman Waithaka Kioni thanked the government for the support. “Yes, the team will travel on Thursday aboard Ethiopia Airline at 7:15pm and they are scheduled to be in Japan on Friday. Of course, we had planned for the team to leave on Tuesday but the government gave us their arrangement and we don’t have a choice but to abide. Now the traveling party of 19 will fl y out on Thursday,” said Kioni. “We remain grateful to the government for the gesture. I would like to wish the team the best of luck in the three-week event. They are in good shape and raring to go.” The team will now have a reduced training camp facilitated by former Kenya team coach, Sadatoshi Sugawara of Japan. The Kenyan girls were set to have a 10-day training camp and a couple of friendly matches with top Japanese sides to help them acclimatise to the humid Japanese weather. The Malkia Strikers are pitted in Pool ‘D’ and play Kazakhstan in their fi rst match on September 29 before facing Serbia a day later. They will then come up against Puerto Rico, former champions Brazil and Dominican Republic in other preliminary matches.
