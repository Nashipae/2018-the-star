An AP officer on Monday accidentally shot dead a bread vendor in Kigumo shopping centre. The officer had allegedly left his gun cocked and it went off by accident, shooting John Ihura, 42, in the torso and killing him instantly. The victimâ€™s father, Wilson Irungu, yesterday said he received a phone call from a police officer at 4pm, informing him that his son had died in an accident. He said the officer told him that a colleague had accidentally shot his son. Irungu said when he insisted on a detailed explanation of how his son died, the police officer told him to visit Kigumo police station. Kigumo police boss Ibrahim Mchuma said they are investigating. He said the suspect is being held in Buruburu police station.
