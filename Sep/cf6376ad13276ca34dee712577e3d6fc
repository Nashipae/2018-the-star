Arthur Chiluba is back again with his fourth release since he quit dance in favour of a music career. The track, called Chukucha, is a happy song that will get everybody dancing like they just don't care. "As choreographer, I love dancing and I know most people do. That is what inspired me to write Chukucha. It is an original Kenyan song blended with slices of zuok, afro-pop and kapuka genres," Chiluba told Word Is. "The message mainly aids one resonate with feeling good and appreciative of life and all surroundings." Sauti Sol’s Live and Die in Africa and Unconditionally Bae dances were choreographed by Arthur Chiluba. His new song is also a build-up towards the release of Chiluba's much-anticipated collabo with Jamaican star Maxi Priest later in the year.
