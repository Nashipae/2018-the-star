Narok county has entered a partnership with Philips Africa in which the company will provide medical equipment for specialised health care. The partnership was announced by governor Samuel Tunai and Philips Africa CEO Jesper Westerink (pictured) at the county offices in Narok on Wednesday. Philips Africa has already provided three beds for the county referral hospital’s high dependency unit and another six beds for the intensive care unit. The company pledged to support the county medical department in conducting preventive healthcare campaigns. The two institutions also partnered to host hosting the Beyond Zero Medical Safari that was launched by First Lady Margaret Kenyatta at Narok Stadium on Wednesday. Tunai asked medical service providers to support county governments to actualise the provision of affordable healthcare for all in line with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda. He said the county had already reviewed its strategy by improving the quality of healthcare through partnerships with the private sector. The county is also focused on the improvement of medical facilities and employment of more personnel. The county has employed more than 300 medical personnel and set up a 24-hour emergency and ambulance service since 2013. “As a county, our focus now is building on earlier successes by entering into partnerships with private sector players to improve the management of healthcare services,” Tunai said.
