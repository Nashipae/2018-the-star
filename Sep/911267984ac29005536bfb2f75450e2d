Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi has faulted the government for implementing the 16 per cent Value Added Tax on petroleum products. Speaking to the press in Kakamega on Saturday, he said National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich should immediately rescind his directive and look for other avenues of raising money. Osotsi said imposing the tax is punishing the already overburdened Kenyans. He said it is unfair and inhuman for Kenyans to bear the pain caused by the governments’ overborrowing as the price of fuel and other products goes up. Osotsi said it s unfortunate that the CS disregarded Parliament’s resolution to suspend the VAT, saying he was not only being insensitive to the poor majority but also a sign of impunity on the side of Jubilee government. Last week, Parliament, through an amendment of the Finance Bill 2018 sponsored by Suna MP Junet Mohamed, suspended the implementation of the 16 per cent VAT until 2022 to cushion Kenyans from the increased cost of living. “The voice of the millions is through their representatives in Parliament and the wisdom of the motion to defer the implementation period of the tax regime on petroleum products was as a result of the MPs’ understanding of how the common mwananchi is hard-pressed when it comes to the cost of living,” Osotsi said. He added that it is important for Rotich and the Jubilee government to note that Parliament is the only institution mandated by the Constitution to make laws and this must be respected by the executive. Osotsi said the CS’s statement is unconstitutional, illegal and exudes the highest level of impunity. Click here for the latest political news
