Pre-race favourite Valary Jemeli Aiyabei lived up to expectations to become the first ever Kenyan winner of the women’s race at the Beijing Marathon yesterday. The women’s race was first introduced to the Beijing Marathon in 1989, but Kenyan runners had never previously managed to reach the top step of the women’s podium. Aiyabei, the fastest entrant and the only Kenyan in the elite women’s field, broke clear after 20 kilometres and kept pushing ahead until hitting the line in 2:21:38, ending a four-year winning run by Ethiopian runners. Her winning mark is the fourth fastest in the history of the race and the quickest mark since 2005, but is two minutes shy of the 2:19:39 course record set by Sun Yingjie in 2003. “This is my first time running the Beijing Marathon,” said the 27-year-old, who set her PB of 2:20:53 when finishing third at last year’s Berlin Marathon. “The race today was good and the weather was good. Everything was good. I want to say thanks to my pacemaker and my husband, he did the best job. I am very happy.” Meanwhile, Elijah Kemboi and Mercy Kibarus duly delivered a double victory for Kenya at the Blackmores Sydney Marathon. Kibarus timed 2:31:24, the third-fastest winning time in the race behind Harun’s 2:28:02 from last year and the 2:29:42 by Biruktayit Degefa in 2014. Kemboi looked the class of the men’s field but the wind off the harbour kept the winning time down to a modest 2:13:37. Uganda’s Thomas Ayeko was second in 2:15:52 while Birhanu Addisie closed the podium places in 2:16:25.
