Western Stima extended their lead on top of the FKF National Super League table without kicking the ball after being awarded a walkover against Green Commandos. Green Commandos failed to secure Bukhungu Stadium for the match despite having held a pre-match meeting at the venue. Nairobi Stima moved to 73 points while KCB maintained the second place after narrowly beating Nairobi City Stars 1-0 at Hope Center. Simon Abuko scored the all-important goal in the 66th minute of the game. Western Stima and KCB stretched away from the chasing pack of Nairobi Stima and Ushuru who lost their footing after being held by Nakuru All-Stars and Kibera Black Stars respectively. Nairobi Stima played to a barren draw against relegation-threatened Nakuru All Stars at Karuturi grounds while Ushuru drew 1-1 with Kibera Black Stars. Maxwell Ravel’s goal for Ushuru at the stroke of halftime was canceled out in the 57th minute by Wilson Njuguna to ensure a share of the spoils. Kenya Police also picked up three points in their match against visiting Kisumu All-Stars in Naivasha after winning 4-2. A brace by Clinton Kinanga, coupled with a goal apiece by Joseph Oyule and Nixon Omondi was enough for the law enforcers to bounce back from their last match defeat against KCB. Gerishom Osumba scored a brace for Kisumu All Stars. Kangemi All Stars piled more misery on Migori Youth, beating the relegation threatened outfit 2-0 at Camp Toyoyo while Coast Stima and Administration Police battled to a 2-2 draw at Serani Sports ground. St. Joseph’s Youth held Modern Coast Rangers to a 1-1 draw as Bidco ended Talanta’s impressive run with a 2-0 win.
