A student has been arrested for wearing a T-shirt written ‘Kieleweke/Big4 first’ at Deputy President William Ruto’s function in Gikondi in Mukurweini, Nyeri county. Albert Nderitu, a 21-year-old student, was nabbed on Sunday. Nderitu’s sister Emma Nyokabi said he left home in the morning to attend the event at Gikondi Catholic church. She said he wore another shirt on top of the T-shirt. “After the Deputy President arrived, police officers called him and requested him to accompany them outside the compound where they removed his shirt and left him with the T-shirt,” Nyokabi said. They also took photos of him in the T-shirt. They took him to Mukurwe-ini police station, where they informed him he was under arrest for inciting people against the DP. Nyokabi said Nderitu had bought the T-shirt a while back and had worn it on several occasions. He was arrested at 11am on Sunday and police were still holding him by press time. “I was here (at the police station) early in the morning, but detectives told me they were still doing investigations. Nderitu left with the detectives who claimed they were heading to Nyeri Town MP’s Ngunjiri Wambugu’s office to find out whether his office was the source of the T-shirts,” she said. Wambugu said he received calls there was a young man arrested for creating a disturbance, but said he does not know him. “I enquired and was informed that police were asking for a Sh50,000 bond. I asked what the man’s offence was and was told he was causing a disturbance,” he said, adding that the police were “economical” with information. Wambugu also took to social media to complain about the arrest. “...I thought this kind of intimidation tactics ended with President Moi? Or is this how Ruto’s government would operate if he was to ever become President?”
