Kenya Power has disconnected electricity supply to Samburu Water and Sanitation Company over Sh800,000 debt. Acute water shortage has hit the town including most hotels. "We had no other choice but to cut off their power supply, they have accumulating bills and any further usage will make it more hard for them to pay," said an employee at Maralal Kenya Power branch. Speaking on phone SEWASCO Managing Director, Mark Lenolkulal said they are making plans to pay the debt. "We are going to pay and there will be running water in town soon," Lenolkulal said on Friday. Water vendors have now taken advantage of the situation and doubled their prices. A 20-litre jerrican of water is being sold at Sh50 while that of salty water is going for Sh35. Hotel owners said they are the most hit by the water shortage as their businesses entirely depend on the commodity. Irene Kendi of Acacia hotel said that if the problem persists they would stop selling tea. "Salty water is what we are getting, unfortunately, it cannot make tea. If this shortage continues we will not be able to sustain our tea customers," she said. Other residents said that they cannot afford to buy water daily. "If you buy two jerricans at Sh100, you will be forced to skip a meal since on average some families spend Sh100 on one meal," said a resident.
