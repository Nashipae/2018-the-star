Shufaa Changawa launched her bid to reclaim the Britam Kenya Open Championship with a comfortable 6-0, 6-0 win over compatriot Gertrude Tuei at Nairobi Club yesterday. On a day which the home players thrived, the three-time winner sailed to the second round at the expense of her opponent, who crushed out of the tournament without a single game to her name. Changawa, who bowed out of last year’s edition in semis to Argentine and the eventual winner Natali Coronel, said the winning start was a motivation for her to push for the title which she last won in 2016. She revealed that last year, a recurring shoulder injury was her major undoing but had recovered and rested well before the tournament began. “Although the match wasn’t tough I am happy I started the tournament on the right footing. I really want to reclaim the title after bowing out in semis last year,” she said. "I performed dismally last year courtesy of a slight shoulder injury but I have fully recovered and ready to face any challenge. I have not played many tournaments this year since I wanted to concentrate on this one and I am glad the first win will motivate me to fight till the finals.”
