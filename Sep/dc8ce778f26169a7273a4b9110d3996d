Skillful Gor Mahia right back Karim Nizigiyimana has promised to stick with the club even as his contract comes to a close in December. The highly-rated Burundian said the compassion he received when he was sidelined with a career threatening injury which stretched to almost a year has influenced his decision. The multiple league winner tore his tendon in September 2017 while on duty against Mathare United at Thika Stadium, an injury which needed surgical correction. He revealed that the compassion and care shown by his employers during the long salaried period of recovery made him ignore offers from other clubs including Tanzanian giants Yanga. After Gor were crowned the 2017 champions, part of the club’s executive committee paid a courtesy call to the player to deliver his medal and the trophy. The club also catered for his medical bills. In addition, he has quashed reports suggesting that he is ready to follow in the footsteps of Meddie Kagere and Godfrey Walusimbi, who decamped to Simba and Kaizer Chiefs respectively. “I do not have plans to quit Gor Mahia even though my contract ends in December. The club showed me compassion when I was injured, catered for my medical bills and remitted my salary for the past one year even without kicking the ball. Many clubs in Africa isolate a player when he suffers a career-threatening injury but Gor took care of me and my family and I can only repay them by sticking with them. Treat the reports linking me to Yanga or any other club as rumours,” he said. “Even though the club hasn’t approached me for negotiations, I believe when they do, I will have no option but to stay. I am ready to work for Gor and hit the form I had before the injury. I am glad to have recovered fully and I am looking forward to be part of the club’s success story in the forthcoming season.”
