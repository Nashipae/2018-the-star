The chief executive officer of a firm has apologised for hiring Chinese Liu Jiaqi who referred to President Uhuru Kenyatta and Kenyans as monkeys. Sonlink boss Troy Guo yesterday said Jiaqi had been subjected to internal disciplinary measures. Liu was deported last week following a public outcry when the recording went viral on social media. He was secretly captured on video by a worker he had threatened to sack from his motorcycle shop. In the clip, Liu bragged that there is nothing that "poor, black, smelly" Kenyans can do to him even if he sacks the employee. Guo said they were aware of the video in June and had apologised to its workers.

Guo said they also held a reconciliation party to revive the good working relationship between the Chinese and Kenyan workers. He said Sonlink strives to foster harmonious cooperation among its staff to ensure minimal conflict. "In the minimal instances where there has been conflict — like the above incident — Sonlink has made steps to bridge the gap by adopting and implementing stern disciplinary measures and adopting numerous social events and training to facilitate team building and appreciation of the unity in our team," Guo said. Guo said his company wishes "to sincerely apologise to Kenyans for the utterances". He said the words were "completely unacceptable to anyone", and "were private and personal, and do not reflect the position of the company". "Sonlink distances itself from the words in their entirety," he said. Guo promised to do all twithin his powers to ensure another incident doesn’t occur.
