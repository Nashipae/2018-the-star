Hamdi Ahmed was sworn in yesterday as a Garissa nominated MCA after she successfully challenged the nomination of Cheruto Limo by the Kenya Patriotic Party. The party nominated Limo who hails from Uasin Gishu county. The move prompted Ahmed to file a petition in September last year. Garissa senior resident magistrate James Masiga quashed the nomination of Limo in a ruling on March 8. The court also nullified the gazzete notice about Limo’s nomination to the special gender representative seat. Masiga directed the party to carry out a fresh nomination within 45 days. Limo unsuccessfully appealed the ruling. Garissa High Court judge George Dulu upheld the nullification of her nomination on August 30. Ahmed, who was accompanied by her lawyer and family members during the swearing-in, thanked her legal team for “a good job.” “We sought justice and we’re celebrating the fruits today. I thank my team for bravely fighting it out in court,” she said. Ahmed promised to advocate for gender equality and end socials ills against women. “I really appreciate everyone who contributed in one way or another in this fight. We must now focus on transforming the lives of our people,” Ahmed said.
