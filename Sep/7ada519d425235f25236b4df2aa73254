All Makueni county departments are expected to sign performance appraisals by September 21 to improve services, Governor Kivutha Kibwana has said. He said the reviews will ensure timely service delivery to residents and hold public servants accountable. “Performance management must be entrenched as the culture in which Makueni delivers services in its four years,” Kibwana said. Makueni executives, chief officers, directors and chairpersons signed the appraisals on Monday in an event president over by Kibwana and deputy governor Adelina Mwau. The governor awarded the departments ranked best performing in 2017-18. He warned against unhealthy competition among the departments. The Education and ICT department was ranked top, with the Health department ranked position two. The governor said the programme should focus on improving services. He said departments should not set soft targets to be ranked the best. “Mwau and myself signed a four-year performance contract with Makueni county on March 23. Our performance contract was developed in line with the County Intergraded Development Plan,” Kibwana said. “We expect the departments have included the document we signed into their appraisals to ensure what we committed to do in our last term is achieved.” Key highlights of the performance contract Kibwana and Mwau signed include improved water services, better healthcare, youth and people living with disability empowerment and institutional strengthening. Construction of four mega dams and promotion of household and institutional water harvesting targeting 100,000 households were also listed. In Health, the Makueni government will invest in automating health care, diagnostic infrastructure, technology and equipment for fast screening in health facilities, staffing and provision of universal health care targeting 150,000 households.
