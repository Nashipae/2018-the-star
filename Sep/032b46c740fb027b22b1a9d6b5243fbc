The Kenya Forest Service has instituted tough measures aimed at weeding out unscrupulous saw millers. The service has at the same time dispatched demand letters to saw millers that have not paid up after cutting trees. Acting chief conservator Monica Kalenda said saw millers will no longer be registered manually. She said the pre-qualification will be done and registered electronically. "There will be no interaction with saw milers to curb collusion," she said at her office. Kalenda said the management of saw millers has in the recent past caused wanton destruction of forests. "Due to this, the service has found it imperative to commence on fresh pre-qualification of saw millers in order to identify authentic industry players. For the first time, the service will utilize e-registration to carry out the pre-qualification process," she said. Kalenda said some saw millers have not paid KFS money after harvesting trees. "It is a matter of great concern to the KFS board that the service is owed Sh1.2 billion in unpaid monies by saw millers and a demand letter has already been issued to all the debtors to clear these bills in 14 days commencing today. Failure to adhere to this directive will lead to disqualification from pre-qualification process," she said adding that the service may institute legal proceedings against them. Over 600 millers have not paid the service, a move that has crippled service delivery. Kalenda said e-registration will start in two to three weeks. She said saw millers will have meeting September 12, to deliberate on the best approach to streamline the industry. She said 936 cases have been prosecuted in court, out of which, 544 have been finalized. "In addition, 4,696 bags of charcoal have also been forfeited and a total of Sh 10.9 million has been issued as fines. All these achievements were realized due to joint efforts," she said.
