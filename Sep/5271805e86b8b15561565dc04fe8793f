Residents of Kiandutu slums in Thika town took to the streets yesterday to protest a plan by Kiambu county to subdivide their land. The irate residents accused Governor Ferdinand Waititu of hatching a scheme to sub-divide the 100 acre land and allocate it to private developers. The county denied the claims. The protestors camped outside Thika subcounty offices and demanded to know why the governor had sidelined slum settlers in his meeting with residents. “We know they have been meeting to plan how to subdivide the land and allocate it to people we don't know," a infuriated protester shouted. They asked Waititu to hold a public meeting in the slum to discuss the matter. "Otherwise they'll carry to kill us before subdividing the land," he said. They claimed a village elder was involved in organising the "clandestine meetings" with the county administrators over the land. “We know they have an ill-plan and we won't allow them to execute it. They must know that outsiders will not be allowed here," Maxwel King'ori said. The residents said a local politician was "bringing unknown people" to the area with the intention of helping them get land. County principal administrative officer in charge of Thika region Christopher Wanjau said no meeting had been held to discuss the Kiandutu land. He said the allegations were rumours and that residents would have been consulted if the county wanted to subdivide the land. Wanjau said a meeting will be convened in the slums to clarify the matter. He urged residents to shun incitement by politicians.
