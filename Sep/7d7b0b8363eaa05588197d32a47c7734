Meru residents
whose lands will be acquired for
Lapsset projects will be swiftly
compensated. Governor Kiraitu Murungi said
his government supports the Lapsset
corridor because the county
stands to benefit. “We have all agreed to support
it and fast-track issuance of title
deeds so people along the corridor
can be paid compensation and
project can proceed,” he said in
Meru yesterday. Lapsset chairman Titus Ibui said
the project will open up 70 per cent
of the country. “It will also provide jobs in the
country, especially the nine counties
it touches,” Ibui said. He said the project, the Lamu
Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport
project,will also open up trade
with South Sudan and Ethiopia. He said once complete, Lamu
Port will be the biggest in the country. Lands CAS Gedion Mung’aro
said they will speed up issuance of
title deeds within 90 days in areas
where people have no title deeds,
so they can be compensated. Principal Secretary Andrew Kamau
in the petroleum department
of the Energy ministry said the
pipeline from Turkana is also a key
component of the project and compensation
is important. Last year, the Meru county government
said it has set aside 10,000
acres for construction of a metropolis,
in the event that the Isiolo Resort
City is rerouted. Some conservationists had suggested
the rerouting of the resort
city to protect wildlife, including
elephants, in the vast region. Meru Tourism executive Ntoitha
M’Mithiaru said the county was
ready in case the city is relocated
to Meru.
Mithiaru and Igembe North MP
Joseph M’Eruaki, said the Kachiuru
area had a vast tract of idle community
land suitable for a resort
city. “The Lapsset management has
written asking whether we have
land for a resort city. We have said
trust land is readily available,” said
M’Mithiaru. He said the city would greatly
transform the economy of the arid
region
