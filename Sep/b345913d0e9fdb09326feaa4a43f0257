Kisumu residents have accused police of brutality after one person was shot dead during a crackdown on illegal liquor. Francis Ogutu, alias Onjelo, was shot during the raids at Kisumu Bus Park on Saturday, while Rayan Otina sustained bullet wounds on his left leg during the incident. Residents have condemned the shooting and demanded the arrest and prosecution of the officer involved. Audi Ogada, Kisumu City Residents Voice Association chairman, accused police of brutality and extrajudicial killings. He claimed that the bullet was immediately removed from Ogutuâ€™s body at the Kisumu County Hospital by a team of armed police officers. Kisumu OCPD Meshack Kiptum said Ogutu was hit by a stray bullet as police tried to disperse crowds during the illegal liquor raids. He said the groups were throwing stones at police, demanding the release of 10 suspects arrested during the crackdown, forcing them to shoot in the air. The police boss said four suspects escaped and the six arrested will be arraigned today. They will be charged with sale and consumption of illegal alcohol. Click here for the latest political news
