Kenyan-American star Edi Gathegi is off the market. He's shared pictures on social media of himself with a Caucasian girl from California. For so long, little was known about his personal life, especially when it comes to his love life. He also showered love messages to a woman identified as Adriana. During her birthday, Edi posted a photo of her and captioned it: "Happy birthday mi amor (My love). You the light that guides me and the rock that anchors me. You’ve made it another trip around the sun and it’s been a pleasure to watch you grow and navigate the world. I’m inspired by your spirit everyday. May this year continue to bless you, bring you peace and joy. And remember your boy is always gone ride for ya. The depths of my love know no bottom." During Edi's birthday, Adriana also shared a photo of them together as well, writing: "Happy birthday my walking heart!! I love you so much and am so grateful that God put you on my path1" The information we have about Gathegi shows he is probably married at the moment but has no child yet. The two (Edi and Adriana) have posted photos of themselves hanging out together for a while now. Gathegi has made quite enough for himself and also got some awards and nominations over the course of his career, including Lead Performance at the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award. He has earned recognition for his roles as Laurent in the Twilight and New Moon movies.
