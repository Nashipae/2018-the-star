Residents of Kabiro in Dagoretti North constituency have been assured no demolitions or projects will start without proper consultations. The residents had raised concerns after some buildings and structures were marked for demolition, yet they were not been given legal notice. Kabiro MCA Clarence Munga on Friday said there has to be proper communication before any action is taken. Earlier this month, Nairobi governor Mike Sonko ordered the suspension of demolition of illegal structures in the slums. He said he has received many complaints from Nairobi residents, saying the demolitions are destroying livelihoods. “I hereby direct the Lands executive, director in charge of the inspectorate and the county secretary to immediately stop the demolitions. I can no longer persevere seeing my people crying and wailing over destruction of property,” Sonko said. The teams in charge of demolitions were told to give the families alternative structures before proceeding. Former City Hall director of operations Peter Mbaya had earlier said notices are always issued before any operation. This year, demolition of illegal structures on public land and road reserves has left many people jobless as well as homeless. The demolitions aim to restore order in the city.
