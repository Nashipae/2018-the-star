A Baringo man is suspected to have killed three family members in Kasawan village in Tiaty subcounty on Friday at dawn. Survivor Loritamak Asimakok, 45, said he does not understand why his 28-year-old cousin Elijah Lodomo killed his family in cold blood. “We were asleep when he started shooting indiscriminately in the house,” Asimakok said. He managed to escape and hide in a bush. Asimakok said he heard his wife Chemket Loritamuk, 40, scream when she was shot three times in the chest and head. He also lost his 13-year-old daughter Chebet Loritamuk and a relative Kokwo Tepangura. A seven-year-old child was injured. Surrenders After committing the murder, the suspect fled. Lodomo surrendered to Tot police station in the neighbouring Elgeyo-Marakwet county on Friday morning. Police said they are investigating. There were unconfirmed reports that the suspect claimed Asimakok owed him a number of cows. But Asimakok has denied the claims, saying he did not have a dispute with his cousin. Tirioko MCA Sam Lokales urged the government to speed up investigations and ensure the family gets justice. “We thought bandits from Elgeyo-Marakwet had struck again,” Lokales said. Baringo county commissioner Henry Wafula condemned the killings, saying the suspect will be arraigned in court. He blamed the incident on illegal firearms in the hands of residents and called for disarmament.
