Mathioya MP Peter Kimari has appealed to the government not to scrap 27 constituencies in the boundaries review next year. Kimari has said scrapping the constituencies would disadvantage residents and disorient service delivery. He said the government should instead consider reviewing its resource distribution and ensure large constituencies receive more funds. Speaking on Saturday in Murang’a town, Kimari noted that the government can also hive areas off bigger constituencies for mergers with smaller constituencies. He said this will not be applicable in areas such as Nyeri and Lamu where all the constituencies fall below the population threshold. “In Nyeri county, Othaya, Mukurwe-ini and Tetu constituencies will be affected while Lamu only has two constituencies, both of which do not have the required population,” he said. Kimari said Mathioya should remain a protected constituency but should receive a smaller share of resources compared to its vast neighbours, such as Kiharu. “Issuing the same amount of funds to Mathioya and Kiharu is being unfair to the people of Kiharu,” he said. Mathioya and Kangema constituencies in Murang’a county have been listed among the 27 constituencies that may be scrapped for not attaining the population threshold. Mathioya has a population of 88,219 people while Kangema 78,988, according to the 2009 census.
