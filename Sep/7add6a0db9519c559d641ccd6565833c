Suspended IEBC CEO Ezra Chiloba's personal assistant Abednego Ominde has been arrested following an attempt to sneak out files from the commission offices. Ominde was arrested alongside the IEBC acting finance director Agatha Wahome at the basement parking while in possession of the files. It is said the 14 files were from the Finance and Procurement departments. The Nairobi area DCIO is handling the matter. Nairobi Central OCPD Robinson Thuku said: "It is true we have two individuals who were brought from IEBC over claims of stealing." "They are being interrogated. They are being held at Central police station," the police boss said. The IEBC has  been tense amid a quorum hitch occasioned by the exit of four commissioners. They are deputy vice chair Consolata Maina, Commissioners Margaret Mwachanya,
Paul Kurgat, and Roselyne Akombe. Maina and Mwachanya attempted to return to their offices in the wake of an August 10 ruling which held that they did not follow due process while quitting. Chiloba was first suspended on April 9 and later on June 15 after the CEO sought to resume work hours after he was reinstated by the Employment and Relations Court. The IEBC chair, in effecting the suspension, cited vetting of procurement officers which was ordered by President Uhuru Kenyatta on June 1. "The commission has resolved to suspend you (Chiloba) with immediate
effect pending the audit of all major procurements relating to the
August 8 general elections and the repeat elections held on October 26,
2017," Chebukati said then. Details: Five IEBC tenders at heart of Chiloba, Chebukati wars Also read : IEBC crisis: Chiloba sues Chebukati over 'illegal suspension' Click here for the latest political news
