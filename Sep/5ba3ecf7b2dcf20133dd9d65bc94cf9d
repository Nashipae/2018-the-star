The accident left his car’s bumper and rear tyre badly damaged. An agitated Gidi took to Instagram to slam the matatu driver for speeding at a roundabout. “Today I have become a victim of Rongai Matatus madness, hit from behind. My entire afternoon wasted by this Rogue Matatu....Why speed at around about surely?” he asked.
