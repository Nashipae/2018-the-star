Hundreds of Garissa and Wajir residents have destroyed their thermos flasks following claims they containa cancer-causing agent. On Monday and Tuesday, panic spread throughout the counties after social media became abuzz with the allegation. On Tuesday, Wajir public health officer Noor Kato said the agent is asbestos fibre contained in the separators of the double glass wall of some thermos flasks. It has good heat retaining, heat resisting and anti-abrasive properties. “The separator lies between two glass walls in vacuum condition to minimise heat transfer from inside to outside the flask,” he told the press. “If the thermos breaks, the user(s) may inhale loose asbestos fibres, which are carcinogenic — meaning they have the potential to cause cancer.” Residents said most of the flasks were imported from China. A World Health Organization report released in 2015 condemned the use of asbestos.  In 2015, the EU recalled flasks containing asbestos.
