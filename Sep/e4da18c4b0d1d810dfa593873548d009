Some 60,865 schoolgirls in Nyandarua will get sanitary towels from the national government. Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs PS Safina Kwekwe on Wednesday said the ministry targets 3,750,000 girls countrywide. They will cover those from Standard 6 to Form 4 to ensure they continue with education without interruptions associated with menstruation. “Menstrual cycle is a normal biological function that should not be a barrier to education,” she said in Ol Joro Orok Stadium where she launched distribution. The project was transferred from the Education ministry to the Gender docket under the patronage of woman representatives. Every girl will get four pads a term. County director of education Esther Nyang’au said girls lost out on continuous schooling before the project was introduced.
