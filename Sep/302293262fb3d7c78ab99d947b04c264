Hyena attacks on donkeys in Lamu have left 10 dead and at least 40 with serious wounds in various parts of the county. This is according to a monthly status report released by the Donkey Sanctuary Lamu office yesterday. Sanctuary senior vet Felix Rachuonyo said the trend is worrying and could get worse if prompt intervention is not made. Matondoni, Kipungani, Tchundwa and most recently Lamu town are the most affected by the hyena invasion. Rachuonyo said his office has written to the KWS Lamu office. “We hope the KWS will take us seriously, hunt down these hyenas and take them back to their habitat,” he said. The hyenas are believed to have come from deep in the Boni-Dodori reserve. Residents accused KWS of laxity in dealing with the situation and threatened to hunt down and kill the hyenas if the KWS does not act fast. Donkeys owners who lost their animals to the hyena attacks have demanded compensation from KWS. “Everybody knows that donkeys are our lives here in Lamu. The importance attached to cows back in Western Kenya is the same importance we attach to donkeys here. When we lose our donkeys to hyenas, we cannot keep quiet,” Omar Kidege, who lost three donkeys, said. Donkeys are an importance part of Lamu’s culture and heritage. They also form an integral part of the region’s transport system, especially in Lamu town where they are the only mode of transport allowed due to the narrowness of the town’s alleys.
