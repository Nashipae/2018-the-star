Some NASA lawmakers accompanied an activist to court where he filed an application seeking to be enjoined in a case filed by Okiya Omtatah challenging the 16% VAT on petroleum products. Lawmakers MPs Babu Owino, Antony Oluoch and Senator Cleophas Malala, among others, were present in court with activist John Wamagata. In the application, Ondoa Panya Operation national coordinator Wamagata wants to be a second interested party. He said they are representing 3,000 residents of Kakamega, Vihiga, Embakasi East, Saboti, Alego Usonga and Uriri constituencies. Through his lawyer Oluoch, he argues the matter is of great public interest. On Tuesday, Justice Chacha Mwita declined to issue orders to suspend the fuel tax implemented by the government on September 1. The judge agreed that the case is urgent and of great public interest but ought to be heard in presence of all parties. He directed activist Omtatah to serve his suit papers on the other parties. The Treasury Cabinet Secretary, Kenya Revenue Authority, Energy Regulatory Commission, and the Attorney General are the respondents. Omtatah wants the tax suspended pending determination of his case. He avers that the decision by state violates the Constitution because "it has an effect of limiting rights to property and advancement of socio-economic rights." He observed that Treasury CS Henry Rotich allowed the implementation of the new levy in total defiance to Parliament which suspended the same. On August 29, MPs voted to suspend the implementation of the tax to September 1, 2020. The amendment to the Finance Bill, 2018 was moved by National Assembly Minority Whip Junet Mohammed. The matter will come up for direction on September 10.
