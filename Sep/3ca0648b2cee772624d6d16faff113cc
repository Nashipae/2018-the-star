The influx of cheap maize from Uganda is frustrating farmers in West Pokot and Trans-Nzoia Counties, Governor John Lonyangapuo has said. Lonyangapuo said the stock from Uganda is pushing local farmers out of the market. The West Pokot Governor spoke at Makhonge village along the border of Kenya and Uganda on Monday.

The leaders said most of the maize enters into the country through the porous Suam, Karita and Amudat border points. “I have more than six thousand bags of maize in the store. Large-scale maize farmers like me, Noah Wekesa, and Jackson Kibor have turned to planting sugarcane,” Lonyangapuo said. Lonyangapuo said maize farmers in Uganda do not use fertilizer hence they have less expenditure on their farms. “We use tractors, fertilizers and we spray maize. In this region we solemnly eat ugali for breakfast, lunch and supper,” he said. Lonyangapuo said the region is the food basket and neighbouring areas are suffering. “As much as we respect the EAC common market protocol, the government needs to cushion us from unfair competition by regulating the importation of cheap produce and subsidizing the cost of production as much as possible,” said Waswa.
