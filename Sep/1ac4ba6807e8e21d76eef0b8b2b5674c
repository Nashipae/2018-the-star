Omena, sweet potatoes and pineapples sold in Homa Bay county should be exempt from tax, a group of Homa Bay MCAs has proposed. Dan Were (Kokwanyo), James Ochieng’ (Kabondo East) and Juma Awuor (Homa Bay East) called for reduction of taxes on local goods to ease the burden on residents. This follows the signing of the Finance Bill by the National Assembly last week which, among other levies, imposes an eight per cent VAT on petroleum products. The MCAs said the taxes will make life difficult for the majority of Kenyans. Deputy speaker Evance Marieba on Monday said he will introduce a bill for tax exemption or relief on some goods. He said at least 25 MCAs have assured him of their support. He urged more MCAs to support the bill when it is presented in the assembly. harmonisation The MCAs said the bill will promote locally produced goods and business among small-scale traders. “Most traders, especially small-scale business operators in the county, cry over hefty tax. It’s high time we also promoted local goods,” Were said. Ochieng’ said, “Fishing and agriculture are some of the major economic activities for our people hence a tax relief or exemption would help our people.” The Homa Bay government automated tax collection in a bid to increase its revenue and expand the economy. Finance executive Nicholas K’Oriko said the electronic system would minimise the loss of funds. “The county used to collect Sh17 million monthly but it reduced to Sh10 million because of loopholes in collection methods,” he said. Bunge La Wananchi head Walter Opiyo urged the assembly to harmonise tax collection to help the county achieve its goals. “Corruption loopholes should also be fixed to ensure funds from the national government develops locals,” he said.
