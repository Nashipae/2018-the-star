A delegation of health experts from 10 countries has stressed the need for African countries to invest more in the sector for quality and affordable care. The experts, who spoke during a benchmarking tour of the ongoing installation of specialised health equipment at Thika Level 5 Hospital on Monday, said African governments should invest in bringing quality medical care closer to the people. “We are pleased with steps Kenya has taken in provision of better and affordable healthcare through installation of state-of-art specialised medical equipment across the country. Other countries must borrow a leaf in improving medical care,” Ramadhan Mrisho from Tanzania said. Mrisho, said the specialized machines are direly needed for diagnostics in health facilities to save lives. H “The CT scanners in my opinion should be installed in all major public hospitals because they are turning around the lives of many people. All nations must advance together in medical technology,” he said. The machines are being installed in the 37 counties through a partnership between the China-based Neurosoft Medical Systems Limited and the Ministry of Health. Megascope Medical centre has been contracted to undertake the work. Emmanuel Sappo from Ghana said the adoption of hi-tech medical care by African countries will end the suffering of most Africans, who can’t pay specialized treatment from the European and Asian countries. He added that countries must be ready to embark on training specialists.
