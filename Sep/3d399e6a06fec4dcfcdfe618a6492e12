A Busia cleric has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to further reduce the proposed eight per cent VAT on petroleum products to four. Addressing a church congregation in Busia town on Sunday, presiding bishop of Hope of God Gospel Mission Church Samuel Welimo said the VAT is a huge burden to many Kenyans, who ares already facing tough economic times. Welimo urged Uhuru to fi nd other alternatives to raise funds to meet budgetary targets. “As a church which is the voice of the common mwananchi, we are pleading with you Mr President to please listen to the many cries of Kenyans and do something to ease this burden,” he said. Welimo said the increase in fuel prices translates to a rise in the cost of other commodities. Uhuru has secured the support of both Jubilee and NASA ahead of Parliament’s debate. MPs from both camps held Parliamentary Group meetings yesterday where they resolved to support the memorandum by the President during Thursday’s voting. Ahead of the meetings, some MPs had expressed their reservations after Uhuru vetoed their earlier decision to suspend the 16 per cent VAT for another two years. The NASA Parliamentary Group meeting was held at Orange House and chaired by ODM chief Raila Odinga. Some 181 Jubilee MPs met at State House where Uhuru chaired the meeting, according to National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale.
