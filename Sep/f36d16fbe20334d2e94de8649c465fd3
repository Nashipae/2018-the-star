Migori Governor Okoth Obado has warned members of the public not to fall victim to fraudsters who are swindling money in his name. The Governor said the conmen are using the phone number 0722219297 to call residents claiming he needs financial assistance. On Sunday, Obado's communication director Nicholas Anyuor said in a statement that the fraudsters have been making distress calls claiming the governor is in dire need of money. “It has come to our attention that a fraudster is using the phone number to extort money from members of the public,” Anyuor said. “This is fraudulent and untrue. It is a fabrication whose intention is to rob members of the public and soil the reputation of the Governor,” he added. Anyuor also dismissed claims that his boss is broke and is selling his property to meet his financial obligations. “Governor Obado is not, in anyway, selling any of his property to get money,” he said. Governor Obado hit the headlines early this month after a Rongo University student, Sharon Otieno, whom it's alleged the county boss had an affair with, was abducted and brutally murdered. Sharon's family accused Obado and his personal assistant, Michael Oyamo, of masterminding their daughter's murder after she reportedly refused to abort a pregnancy. Obado has since denied that he was involved in the murder. The body of the 26 year-old second-year medical records student was found at Kodera forest in Kasipul constituency on September 4.
