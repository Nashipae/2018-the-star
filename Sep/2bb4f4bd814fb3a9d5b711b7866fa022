Suppliers have accused Civicon Limited at the Kenya Breweries plant in Kisumu of failing to pay them their dues. They are owed amounts ranging from Sh1.1 million to Sh7 million for building materials and equipment at the Sh15 billion brewery. Civicon was subcontracted by Diageo International to build a water treatment plant. Kisumu community chairman Philip Ochieng told KBL to take action or the matter could escalate to protests. One of the suppliers, who sought anonymity to avoid being victimised by KBL, said he fears they may lose their money. He alleged Civicon removed its machinery and equipment from the site on Saturday night. "They moved hurriedly after some suppliers got a court order allowing auctioneers to tow the equipment for lack of payment," he said. “We took bank loans from banks which we are unable to repay. We are appealing to breweries to step in fast so that we can be paid. We are tired of empty promises." Civicon is also accused of paying Sh704,000 to a supplier on July, 2018, but wired back the cash. The firm is accused of sacking 100 workers without following the right procedure. Suppliers are now planning to demonstrate at KBL Kisumu offices.. Kisumu Residents Association chairman Audi Ogada faulted Civicon for refusing to pay suppliers. “We want our people to be treated fairly. They diligently supplied materials and must be paid,” Ogada said. Efforts to reach Civicon CEO Ben Kiilu for comment were futile. He neither answered calls nor replied SMS's. Kisumu senator Fred Outa urged KBL to be fair when employing workers at the new plant. He said residents should be given first priority. Click here for the latest political news
