Behind the big walls
and bars of Shimo la Tewa prison in Mombasa county lie great talents. In the
women’s section, inmates hone their skills in a range of activities, from artwork
to entertainment. These talents give them
something to look forward to that can change their lives once freed. “The prisoners are
doing sewing through crocheting, others sew by using a sewing machine, others
involve themselves in beadwork,” officer in charge Fairbain Ombeva said. She said the prisoners
need to be given capital upon discharge so they can start businesses with the
skills they learn. “If they are not supported, they will do more
crime so they can return to prison,” she said.  DIFFICULTIES FACED Lack of raw
materials and a workshop in the prison premises are the main problems inmates
face. For all the
vocational training, Ombeva said they usually use the dining hall, which also
acts as a workshop. She appealed
to any donor willing to help to come forward. She also called for more cash
from the government. The county government,
led by woman representative Asha Mohamed, visited the women prisoners on May 13
as a way of celebrating Mother’s Day. They donated
sanitary towels, panties, pampers for the prisoners’ children, toilet paper,
soap and flour. A cake was cut and drinks shared. Mohamed said the
county is willing to look for a market for the prisoners’ products. “What we
can do is to ensure we look for a market for them out there, so they don’t just
wait for visitors who visit them to buy those products,” she said. The
products are displayed at the Agricultural Society of Kenya show, which in
Mombasa runs in August. Mohamed said
through the Affirmative Action Fund, the county will purchase tents for the
prison so they can welcome visitors without worrying about the rain or the heat
from the sun. The
prisoners entertained gests through reciting of poems, singing and traditional
dances.
