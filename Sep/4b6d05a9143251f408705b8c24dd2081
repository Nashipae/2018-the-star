Nairobi county assembly is trying to stop the EACC from investigating some lawmakers over alleged bribery in the award of a health insurance contract. The county has been on the spot over the extension of medical insurance cover for county staff. The executive had been accused of forcing the assembly to pass a supplementary budget for the contract. Six MCAs and two others face arrest if they fail to honour summonses by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to appear on September 24 and 25. The EACC, in a letter to the assembly clerk, ordered the appearance of MCAs Margaret Mbote, Peter Kimuhu, Jacob Ngwele, Habiba Hassan, Esther Nyangweso, Eve Murenya and another two suspects — Josephine Kamau and Beryl Oguta. But the assembly and the eight suspects said proper procedures have not been followed and the investigations should stop. The suit paper said, “The applicants’ rights to a fair administrative action under Article 47 of the Constitution and rules of natural justice have been violated as the respondent [EACC] has not given them reason for failing to follow the set-down procedure when handling them.” Privileges The MCAs say they should be investigated by the assembly’s Committee of Powers and Privileges first before other government agencies can take over. They said the Constitution accords them privilege while conducting official business of the county. They told the court that they have legitimate expectations to freely participate in county assembly proceedings without fear of victimisation over unfounded allegations.
