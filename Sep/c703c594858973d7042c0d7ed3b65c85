Kenya Tourism Board has partnered with Google to market Kenya digitally. In a partnership, KTB will launch Google street view on October 15, a Google Map feature that will provide 360 degree panoramic views that enables visitors explore places without actually visiting them. The first Google Street View was featured in Samburu National Reserve in 2015 to create awareness and showcase efforts aimed at conservation of elephants in Kenya. Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala said enough investment has been done onÂ  Facebook, Investopia and various search engines. He said the partnership with Goggle will be rolled out in Nairobi and Mombasa before moving to the rest of the country. He spoke at the World Tourism luncheon in Nairobi.
