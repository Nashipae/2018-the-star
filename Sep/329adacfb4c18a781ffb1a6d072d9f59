The Sh1.7 billion Kisumu jetty will reduce the number of trucks on the roads and spur oil transportation,
Petroleum and Mining CS John Munyes has said. He visited the facility, which was handed over in May, on Wednesday. Munyes was accompanied by Kenya Pipeline Company MD Joe Sang and Infrastructure and Transport PS John Mosonik. Munyes said the
jetty will boost transportation of petroleum products to Uganda, Rwanda,
Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo through Lake Victoria. “The
completed facility, with a 14-inch diameter pipeline, will also reduce storage
space constraints on the Mombasa-Nairobi pipeline,” the CS said. Munyes said the plant, whose
construction was launched last year by President Uhuru Kenyatta, is ready for
operations after being handed over to the government in May. The operations have
delayed as the Uganda government has not completed its plants in Jinja and Entebbe,
he said. "In a fortnight
we will be visiting Uganda to see how prepared they are to expedite fuel
transportation using vessels," Munyes said. A vessel is projected to
ferry 4.7 million litres of fuel per barge, equivalent to 100 trucks. Munyes said about 250 tankers
transport petroleum products daily. “Water is the cheapest mode of transport
and should be fully exploited in the country,” he added. Munyes said the jetty is
a flagship project under the KPC’s strategic plan to expand and improve safety,
efficiency and reliability in the delivery of petroleum products to customers. Munyes said proper
environmental measures are in place to prevent water pollution. He said
the vessels are in good condition to prevent oil spillage. He said the jetty
will boost volumes in Kisumu by a billion litres a year in phase 1 and up to
three billion litres per year by 2028.
