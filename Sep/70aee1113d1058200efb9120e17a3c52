The course for the annual Eldoret Half Marathon has been altered as the organisers seek smoother running at the October 7 event. Athletics Kenya Eldoret branch secretary general James Lagat noted that route will change from loops to ‘linear’ system. “Initially athletes ran on a three kilometre loop seven times to cover 21km but this year’s edition takes a point-to-point form. Unlike the previous route, this year’s will be decongested and far from vehicle traffic areas hence inconveniences to other road users will be minimal. It is a great course and I think the athletes will like it,” said Lagat. The event has been a springboard that has propelled runners into the world stardom. Some of the athletes who sprouted from the Eldoret Half Marathon include Solomon Busiedich and Prisca Jeptoo (2009). The two have won several half marathon titles in Europe since then. While announcing a Sh10m sponsorship towards the event, Family Bank COO Godfrey Kariuki, said: “We are proud that the dream of nurturing talent is already on fertile grounds. Our focus now shifts to education for autistic children.” AK president Jackson Tuwei praised the organizing committee and the title sponsors saying: “A well organized event attracts everyone to either take part or witness.” He added: “We thank Family Group for supporting children with autism and we urge other corporate companies to support persons with disability. This is a group of people who are more often than not ignored from the basic unit of the society — at home, the family.” Podium finishers in the 21km race will pocket Sh250,000, Sh150,000 and Sh100,000. Registration fees are Sh1,000 and Sh1,500 for the two individual packages, while corporate companies will be levied Sh100,000 to enter their teams.
