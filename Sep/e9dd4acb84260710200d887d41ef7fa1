Wajir senator Ali Kabreta yesterday pledged to improve his “below average” performance. Speaking in Wajir town during a youth forum, the legislator said he will be more proactive. “I want to apologise to you. I know I have not been performing my duties as per my mandate,” Ali said. Kabreta’s critics have accused him of remaining silent on alleged corruption and nepotism surrounding key appointments in the county. “I was busy with other issues,” he said. Kabreta has been battling an election petition, which was settled out of court. The county government has been tainted by claims of corruption. Anti-corruption detectives have raided the county offices twice this year.
