Retired President Daniel Moi celebrated his 94th birthday on Sunday surrounded by members of his immediate family at his Kabarak home, Nakuru County. His son, Baringo Senator Gideon, led the family in marking mzee's birthday. Also in attendance were some members of the legendary missionary Bill Barnet and missionary Reverend Roy Stover. Moi retired from active politics in 2002 after ruling the country for 24 years. His exit paved the way for the Rainbow Alliance government under President Mwai Kibaki. Despite the former head of state maintaining a low profile since he bade farewell to active politics, he has remained a key pillar in shaping the country's politics, 16 years on. Leaders from either side of the political divide have been trooping to Moi's Kabarak home, in what can easily be described as 'competition for his blessings'.

Deputy President William Ruto's quest to wish him good health on May 3 proved futile after it was said his visit coincided with Moi's date with his doctors for a physiotherapy session. A statement from Moi's office stated that "Mzee Moi agreed to meet the visitors at a convenient time on another day in the very near future". The former president has had a troubling knee for quite a while that saw him travel to Israel in March for specialized treatment.
