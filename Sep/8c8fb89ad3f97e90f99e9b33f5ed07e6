Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) officers from Nairobi on Friday raided the Meru town lands Registry offices. The officers brought the activities in the offices to a stand still when they arrested the nine suspects at the offices over allegations of involvement in corruption. The officers however could not immediately address the Media as they are not authorized to do so in such raids. EACC spokesman Yasin Amaro is expected to issue a statement over the raid. An officer, who headed the raid but sought Anonymity told the Star EACC detectives were on high alert and had set traps and camped at the office for the past two weeks gathering information. “During our operation, we already had information, so we knew who our target was,” the officer said.
