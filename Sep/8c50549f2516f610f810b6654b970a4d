Mathare United began their preparation for Saturday’s league match against Chemelil Sugar with a strength and conditioning session at the Goan Institute with star striker Ronald Reagan expressing his delight of scoring his first goal of the season in the 2-0 win over Kakamega Homeboyz at the Kenyatta Stadium last time out. Reagan, who joined the club in June 2017 from Kibera Black Stars, has struggled to find playing time in his second season at the club; his contribution being limited to only substitute appearances. Ten days ago, he made his first start of the season which turned out to be a memorable one as he showed his class to control a lobbed pass from Roy Okal before rifling into the roof of the net for the Slum Boys’ second. Cliff Nyakeya had opened the scoring in the 21st minute. “I feel good to have scored because this was my first start this year. Competition has really been tight and I have been working hard in training for this opportunity. I am happy that I capped a good performance with a goal,” said Reagan. Having broken into the first team, Reagan is now eyeing at least five goals in the remaining five matches before the end of the season. “I had a target of 5-7 goals this season and I think it is still achievable. I want to give my best in the remaining matches and ensure that I meet my target,” he added. The Slum Boys, whose coach Francis Kimanzi was with the national team Harambee Stars for the past week, are only aiming for a high finish in the league as they once again did not take part in the ongoing SportPesa Shield.
