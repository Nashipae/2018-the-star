The Nairobi County will set up a modern Intensive Care Unit at Mama Lucy Hospital in Kayole by December 2018. Governor Mike Sonko on Monday issued an executive order for the immediate resumption of construction of the building which had stalled for several years. "I want the construction of the stalled ICU building at Mama Lucy Hospital to commence immediately. We must provide quality health care to all Nairobians," said Sonko. The ICU is expected to ease congestion at the Kenyatta National Hospital, which has of late been overwhelmed by the high number of patients seeking intensive health care services. The new ICU centre will have a capacity of 72 beds. Acting Nairobi Health County Executive Member Vesca Kangogo has assured city residents that the construction of the new building will be completed in time. She said Sonko is expected to unveil the new ICU within the next three months. â€œWe thank Governor Sonko for availing funds for the completion of this building which had stalled. The double storey building will accommodate an ICU and a High Dependency Unit (HDU). The unveiling of the ICU ward will end the acute shortage of ICU beds in Nairobi," said the County Health Executive. Click here for the latest political news
