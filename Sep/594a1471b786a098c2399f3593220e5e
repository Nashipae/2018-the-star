China is arming
parties in conflicts in the Horn of Africa, a special report
suggests. The investigative report published by EXX Africa says China is arming
warring factions in Sudan, South Sudan and Somalia using Djibouti as
the main arms trafficking hub. The report blames
laxity from the West and failure to put pressure on Djibouti for
increased arms trafficking, which is hampering conflict resolution in
the region. Stockholm International Peace Research Institute put China arms
export to Africa at 55 per cent between 2013 and 2017,
representing 17 per cent of the arms supplies. The numbers puts china
ahead of US in terms of arms supply to Africa, which now stands at
11 per cent of weapons exports. Porous borders,
volatile region, terrorists groups, drug smuggling and conflicts in
nearby Yemen coupled with less monitoring, the report shows, has
provided conducive ground for illegal arms trade in the Horn of
Africa. “Central to this
strategy is China's military logistic base in Djibouti which China is
preparing to facilitate large-scale shipments of weapons and military
equipment to African Countries in particular Sudan and South Sudan,”
the report reads in part. Click here for
