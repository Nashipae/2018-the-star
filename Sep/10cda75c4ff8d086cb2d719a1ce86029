Kiambu governor Ferdinand Waititu has been urged to include Nacada and professional counsellors in the county’s alcoholism rehabilitation programme for it to succeed. Limuru MP Peter Mwathi on Wednesday criticised the Kaa Sober programme saying the county risks wasting Sh750 million if it is not properly managed. He said more youths are drinking alcohol with the hope that they will be enlisted into the programme. The lawmaker demanded that proper structures to monitor those enlisted should be put in place to ensure they graduate and and create space for others to be enrolled. “The programme is good but its management and implementation is shambolic. We need to hear a group is enrolled, rehabilitated even if they are being paid for a certain period of time then they graduate and another lot is enrolled,” Mwathi said. The MP spoke at Utugi village in Lari constituency during the funeral of area MP Jonah Mburu’s brother, Peter Mugaki. He was accompanied by Kabete MP James Kamau and MCA’s Nyutu Wamwere (Kijabe) and Dominic Mugo (Kinale) and Lari deputy county commissioner Aaron Koros. Koros said the government was narrowing down on traders importing wines and spirits from Uganda before secretly selling it to residents. Mburu said his brother was an alcoholic addict and often over indulged. He urged residents to eat properly before drinking. ”Feed your husbands very well if they have to drink,” Mburu said.
