Thika MP Patrick Wainaina has urged the DPP and the DCI to probe what he called misuse of cash meant for an irrigation water project. The MP said the project to supply water to dry parts of the constituency, including Ndula, Maguguni, Gatuanyaga and Ngoliba in Thika East, was abandoned. It was dropped despite the government having allocated more than Sh400 million, through the National Irrigation Board (NIB) into the project, he said. The MP spoke in Ngoliba on Saturday while inspecting the project. “It’s unfortunate the government spent Sh400 million on this project but it hasn’t benefitted anyone three years down the line," Wainaina said. "A few individuals trusted to oversee its completion brought suffering to over 10,000 residents by misusing the project’s money. They should be brought to book soon."
