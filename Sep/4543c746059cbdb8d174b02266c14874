Motrext Transporters Limited, a Mombasa-based clinker storage company at the centre of poisonous emission claims, has finally been shut down. The announcement of the closure by Mombasa county secretary Francis Thoya followed eight years of locals’ suffering, outrage and demonstrations. Clinker is a nodular material produced during the production of cement. It is dangerous and may cause severe skin irritation, chemical burns as well as damage to human tissue, including eyes and other organs. On Monday, National Environmental Management Authority said Motrex has indefinitely been stopped from “receiving, offloading or loading clinker”. When Motrex general manager Islam Saleh was reached for comment he said: “I’m busy now, we will talk later.” NEMA had in August said a sanctioned air quality test revealed the dust from Motrex had clinker element. Motrex has been linked to sickness and more than 10 deaths since it started clinker storage. Saleh in past interview with the Star, denied causing the deaths, sickness or suffering. Jomvu MP Badi Twalib said the closure was long over due as he cited “severe ill health”. ”I shall seek justice for the affected people through the relevant authorities,” Twalib said.
