Efforts to halt an outbreak of
the deadly Ebola virus in Democratic Republic of Congo appear to
be working, but substantial risks remain, the World Health
Organisation said on Friday. The outbreak has so far killed 77 people in Congo's North
Kivu and Ituri provinces among 116 cases. Fifteen of the cases
were health workers. "Recent trends suggest that control measures are working," a
WHO statement said, citing improving figures for tracing
patients' contacts, rapid treatment of Ebola patients with
therapeutic drugs and vaccinations of people at risk. A previous outbreak in Congo this year was swiftly stopped,
despite the remote location and difficult terrain. The latest outbreak presents a different challenge,
occurring in a more densely populated area with dozens of armed
groups. Some areas are off-limits to health workers due to the
security risks, making it more difficult to ring-fence each
Ebola case by vaccinating all the patient's contacts. On Wednesday WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it
was too soon to say whether the outbreak was stablising due to
the difficulty of identifying new cases near rebel-controlled
areas. "Substantial risks remain, posed by potential undocumented
chains of transmission," Friday's WHO statement said, adding
that four of the 13 new probable and confirmed cases in the past
week were not known to have had contact with any Ebola patients. There were also risks from unsafe burial practices and
people's reluctance to accept contact tracing, vaccination and
healthcare, as well as poor standards in some health centres and
delays in getting patients to treatment. Click here for the latest political news
