The National Police Service has said it will not relent on the crackdown of illegal immigrants operating in the country despite resistance by civil society groups. This followed Amnesty International's concerns that the swoop is likely to ignite incidents of Xenophobic attacks against foreign workers in Kenya.

"In supporting the concerned agencies to enforce immigration laws, police wishes to advise foreign nationals that they must always carry their necessary identification documents for inspection," the statement issued on Saturday reads in part. "If and when they are required, they should produce them by the police or other relevant members of the multi-agency team." The raids intensified after the Immigration Department on August 27 set up a hotline where ordinary Kenyans could report aliens. Interior Cabinet Secretary Matiang’i earlier issued a directive ordering foreigners working in the country without official work permits to get documentation or be arrested. He gave them a 60-day notice adding that the move will help the government get rid of tax evaders and criminals. Matiang’i, earlier said all those who failed the vetting test will be flushed out in an exercise that will continue for the next three months.
