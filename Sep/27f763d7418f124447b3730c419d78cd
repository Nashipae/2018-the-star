Demolitions of buildings on river banks and road reserves have been stopped temporarily to allow for landscaping of places where structures were flattened. “We are going back to remove debris from the site and rivers so that water can flow,” officer in charge of demolitions Julius Wanjau said on Friday. Once the rubble is carried away, the places will be levelled with red soil and flowers, grass and trees to conserve the rivers. “These buildings were on riparian land and when we demolish, the debris ended up in the rivers. We don’t want the rains to start while the debris is still here,” Wanjau said. Airgate Centre, formerly known as Taj Mall, in Embakasi, Southend Mall on Lang’ata Road, Ukay Centre and part of Oshwal Centre in Westlands were among the buildings pulled down. Airgate was brought down after the Kenya Urban Roads Authority complained that it was standing on a road reserve. Southend stood on Ngong River and was blamed for frequent flooding in South C, Nairobi West and Lang’ata. Ukay Centre and Oshwal Centre were said to be standing near River Kinagare, a tributary of Nairobi River. Meanwhile, the National Environment Management Authority has refuted claims that Westgate Mall is among the buildings earmarked for demolition. “The car park at the Westgate Mall encroached on the riparian reserve but it should not be assumed that is owned by the mall unless it is proven ,” chief corporate communications officer Evans Nyabuto said on Friday.
