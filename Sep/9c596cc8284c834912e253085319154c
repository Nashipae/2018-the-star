People living with disability in Nyandarua county on Wednesday evening demonstrated in Ol kalou town demanding representation in the county assembly. They converged at Ol kalou town then proceeded to the assembly, where they vowed not to leave until speaker Wahome Ndegwa addressed and assured them they will get a seat in the House. After the 2017 elections, the Jubilee Party did not nominate anybody living with disability to Nyandarua assembly. Monicah Githae (living with disability) and Solomon Kuria (youth) moved to Nyahururu court to challenge the nomination of Wanjiku Muhoho, Joseph Kariuki, Margaret Ireri and Geoffrey Ngaruiya, whom they said were irregularly nominated to occupy the seats meant for people living with disability and the youth. Chief magistrate Judith Wanjala nullified the nomination of the four and directed that Githae and Kuria be considered as Jubilee Party and IEBC put in place a new nomination list. The four appealled in the High Court at Nyahururu and Justice Roselyn Wendo overturned the nullification a week ago. The people living with disability vowed not to give up the fight. They said they will go “even to the International Court of justice if necessary” to ensure they get justice. “We don’t want sympathy. We want truth and justice to prevail as stipulated in the Constitution for which you voted yes even when the Church said no,” Monicah Gichuhi told the speaker. She said the leaders who conspired to deny them representation in the assembly need to know they too are candidates of disability.
