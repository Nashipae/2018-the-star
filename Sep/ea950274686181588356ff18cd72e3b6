The wrangles at the Wakf Commission of Kenya deepened as imams from the Coast accused the chair of financial impropriety. The imams drawn from Kwale, Kilifi, Mombasa, Tana River, Lamu and Taita Taveta counties said they are unhappy with the way the commission is being led. They demanded a report from the chair, Zubeir Noor, who said he is not answerable to any imam. Noor told the Star the commission has been run with integrity and no amount of intimidation by imams would scuttle its activities. “If the chairman does not issue a detailed report on what is happening in the commission within a week, we will mobilise all Muslims at the Coast to demonstrate against him. We want to know how our money is being managed,” Sheikh Hassan Mubarak said. They spoke at the Wakf Commisison of Kenya offices in Mombasa after a meeting chaired by Commissioner Sheikh Juma Ngao, who is the audit committee chair. Noor accused Sheikh Ngao of dragging the commission into his personal differences with First Community Bank. “First of all, Sheikh Ngao is not the audit committee chair as he claims because he has not been elected or appointed by anyone. He should produce evidence of whatever he is accusing the commission or myself of doing. This is not a political party where one can insult another without evidence,” Noor said on the phone. Sheikh Ngao has questioned the stability of First Community Bank after, according to him, the bank failed to transfer some Sh50 million belonging to the commission to Gulf African Bank. The commission has Sh145 million in four accounts at the First Community Bank. The commission’s board sanctioned the transfer but it has not taken place.
