Muslims for Human Rights - MUHURI has asked DPP Noordin Haji to prosecute police officers implicated in the shooting of Katana Kazungu, a 17-year-old boy from Mariakani in July. The deceased was a class-seven pupil at Ndatani Primary School and was shot dead by police who were trailing a truck. The family said their son was not a criminal as alleged by the officers. Kazungu’s father, Fondo Katana told reporters that his son had returned from a funeral when he was called by friends to help push a truck that was stuck in the mud following a heavy downpour. The truck was transporting stones from a nearby quarry. Kaloleni MP Paul Katana on Sunday said the Independent Police Oversight Authority has faulted the police for the reckless shooting. The MP said he had been briefed and seen the report by IPOA. “We thank IPOA for acting swiftly. Those involved in killings must be punished,” Katana said. MP Katana and MUHURI executive director Hassan Abdille asked DPP Noordin Haji to speedily prosecute culpable officers. The duo spoke at MUHURI legal aid clinic in Mombasa. Abdille noted that Kenya is sliding back to a worrying 2013-14 era where police killings were rampant and most of the cases went unresolved. “It is not about condemning police but our life must be respected. You can’t just kill out of suspicion of criminality and radicalization,” the MUHURI boss said. Abdille said police key role is to protect lives and property but not to eliminate citizens. Abdille said police reforms announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta should be in mind, not in uniform. “The process must be serious. Uniform is good in branding but let’s check on the mentality of offices wearing them,” he said.
