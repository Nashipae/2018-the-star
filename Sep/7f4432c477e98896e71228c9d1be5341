Police in Eldoret have seized a lorry ferrying fish allegedly from China and arrested five suspects. The lorry was being offloaded at a garage near Action area along the Eldoret-Iten road. Uasin Gishu governor Jackson Mandago said he spotted the lorry on Friday evening on his way home and after he confronted its owners, he found them offloading fish suspected to have been sneaked into the country. The governor summoned police, KRA and KEBS officials who found some of the fish was already rotten. “I saw the lorry parked on a pedestrian line and thought it was obstructing members of the public using the road. When I went to ask them why they had parked there I realized they were engaged in a different business,” Mandago said. He said he was surprised that the lorry owners were offloading cartons of fish allegedly imported from China. “Am surprised that people of Eldoret eat fish imported from China. I don’t think garage business had anything to do with food handling. This is clearly unhygienic,” said Mandago. He said those found at the site did not have any documentation on how the imports were brought into the county and if they complied with all the necessary requirements including from KEBS and KRA. “Some of the fish is rotten and already it's being offloaded may be to be sold to people here exposing them to high risks," said Mandago. Several people were arrested to help in investigations. Click here for the latest political news
