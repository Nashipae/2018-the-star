Nacada board member Chipukeezy spent Monday night in Nairobi Hospital after a short illness. The comedian, who also has a TV show, apologised to his viewers, saying his show will not be aired. Later on, Chipukeezy posted a photo of himself in a hospital bed, saying, “I hate hospital.” “The doctors have said I need to sleep because I have fatigue,” Chipukeezy told Word Is. Asked what could be the cause of the fatigue, he said: “I felt so weak and was rushed to hospital for checkup. I think for a while I have been overworking myself without having enough sleep. But I am now getting better and already discharged.” He was nominated as a Nacada board member in June this year.
