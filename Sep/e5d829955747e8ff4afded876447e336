The 2022 election campaign has started in Busia after Bukhayo elders on Monday endorsed Nambale MP John Bunyasi to contest for governor. More than 100 elders and opinion leaders, who gathered at the legislator’s Madende home, told journalists they have reaffirmed their support and commitment to back his election. “After long, wide and careful consultations, we have decided to make a humble request to have Bunyasi vie for governor. He shall be our sole candidate. We appeal to voters from Nambale, Matayos and the entire Busia county to support our noble cause,” chairman Peter Madasi said. The elders said they have started campaigning early as the “race is tough.” “We have advised him to start now. When you start early, you have high chances of succeeding,” Madasi said. They said Bunyasi is their son and they have confidence he will transform the county, just as he has changed his constituency for the better. Bunyasi said he has accepted the elders’ decision. “It is my home team that is comprised of the elders, I have already done two rounds in each of the seven subcounties, as advised to seek a response from the people,” the lawmaker said. “This is a serious journey and no obstacle will bar me from achieving my goal. I will not be compromised.”
