Residents of Kibera are finding ways to cope with the increased fuel prices, days after the 16 per cent VAT levied on petroleum products took effect. In Makina vendors and hotel owners have reduced food portions instead of increasing prices. “I have reduced
the sizes of my chapatis so as to produce more to cater for the
increased cost of production. Lazima nicheze na kijiko [I must ration],” Alice Nabwire said. The mother of two runs a small hotel along the link road connecting
Ngong and Lang'ata roads. Her customers
are mostly construction workers. “They will go to
my competitors [if I raise the prices] and I will run at a loss,” Nabwire said. She said the cost of transporting ingredients from the supermarket to her hotel has increased from Sh250 to Sh400. But John
Munyoki, who runs a barber shop and video stall, accused some hotels of taking advantage of the situation to over
price commodities. “I used to pay Sh100 for chapati and meat in most hotels around, now the prices
fluctuate between Sh120 and Sh150. Vegetable vendor Boniface Kyalo, 32, used
to sell four tomatoes for Sh20 but he has reduced the number to three. “Most of my
customers are slum dwellers. The people here operate on minimal
incomes. If you increase the prices, no one will come to your shop,”
he said. Magdaline Awino, 46, a mother of four, uses kerosene for lighting and cooking. The price of kerosene went up to Sh117 per litre from Sh87.21. "Unlike before, today I buy boiled beans and only fry them in the house, it is much cheaper," she said. Her children, all of whom are in primary school, now have to do their homework early in order to go to bed early to save on fuel for lighting.
