Rongo University student Sharon Otieno died from excessive bleeding, government pathologist Johansen Oduor has said. Oduor also revealed that autopsy results indicated that the 2nd year medical records student may have been raped before her murder. The government pathologist said the bleeding was caused by a total of eight stab wounds. “She was stabbed three times on the neck, four times on the back and on the left side of the abdomen,” Oduor said. He said the victim’s body also had signs of strangulation and bruises that suggested she attempted to fight back her killers. Oduor spoke on Friday night at the end of the postmortem examination on Otieno’s body at the Rachonywo Level Four Hospital in Homa Bay County. Migori governor Okoth Obado was represented by a private pathologist and lawyer Cliff Ombeta. Sharon’s family was also represented by a private pathologist after they requested for one. Oduor said the stab wound on Otieno’s abdomen went through to the back, piercing the unborn baby in the process.

The pathologist said samples have been taken for further analysis to enable medical detectives unravel the mystery behind the gruesome murder. Sharon was abducted on Monday alongside Nation journalist Barack Oduor from a Hotel in Rongo. The journalist, however, managed to escape by jumping out of a moving vehicle and seeking help. He told reporters that they were lured into the abduction by Governor Obado’s personal assistant Michael Oyamo who is currently in custody. Sharon’s body was discovered two days later on Wednesday near Kodera Forest, Homa Bay County.
