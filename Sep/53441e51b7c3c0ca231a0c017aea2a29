Mombasa county will change its method of dumping waste to reduce the risk of bird strikes, which concerns the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority. KCAA wants Mombasa’s main Mwakirunge dumpsite in Kisauni relocated. It adds that it is on a flight-path, endangering planes that land and take off from the Moi International Airport. Environment executive Godffrey Nato on Thursday said the county will stop using the open dumping method that attracts scavenging birds. It will adopt a controlled dumping which will lead to a sanitary land fill. Scavenging birds are a danger to the planes that land or take off as they may be sucked into plane engines and cause crashes. “At the moment we are exploring the use of quarries for waste management,” Nato said. He spoke during a women’s dialogue forum on harnessing grassroots potential for solid waste management in Mombasa. The Mwakirunge dumpsite has faced opposition from residents who say it leads to outbreak of diseases and attracts children who drop out of school to scavenge for valuables in the garbage. The dumpsite has also been a hiding place for criminals who rob and rape passersby. Nato said the county will solve the bird menace in a year. “Once we get rid of the open dumping method for a more controlled method there will no longer be birds attracted to the dumpsite,” Nato said.
