Kibwezi West MP Patrick Musimba, his wife Angela Mwende and three others will remain in police cells until Thursday when the court will determine their bond terms. They are charged with stealing Sh1.1 billion from Chase Bank. The Musimbas were charged before Milimani law courts alongside the bank’s employees Duncan Kabui, James Mwenja and Makrios Agumbi. Kabui, Mwenja and Agumbi are facing an additional charge of stealing by servant. They all denied the charges before senior resident magistrate Hellen Okwani, who remanded them at the station. Okwani issued an arrest warrant of the five on Thursday after they failed to appear for plea-taking. But lawyer Steve Kimathi yesterday said the DCI’s Banking Fraud Investigations Unit had not informed them to turn up before the court. Read:MP Musimba, wife arrested over Chase Bank Sh1.1bn fraud case Kimathi unsuccessfully pleaded to have the accused persons released on personal bond. The lawyer told the court Musimba needed to attend to parliamentary duties and represent the Kibwezi residents. He said since the prosecution had not filed an affidavit to oppose the release of the accused persons, there was no need of remanding them. But his pleas were rejected. The MP and his co-accused persons and companies are facing charges of conspiracy to steal, stealing by servant and money laundering after allegedly colluding to siphon Sh1,150,125,587 from depositors accounts at the bank. Others are the former bank’s chairman Mohamed Khan, Luciane Sunter and Ronald Vlasman. Khan was charged on Thursday and he denied the charges. He was detained in police custody until yesterday. Okwani released Khan on a Sh2 million bail and an alternative of Sh10 million bond. A warrant against Sunter and Vlasman is still in force. Click here for the latest political news
