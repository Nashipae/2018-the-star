Some 3,903 graduands were yesterday awarded degrees and diplomas as the University of Nairobi marked its 59th graduation. As early as 6am, the university’s graduation square was a sea of people, loud and scuttling for a place to sit. The graduands, seated under white tents that stretched about 100m, expressed confidence of style and manner, faces drenched with make-up and smiles. Vehicles, big and small, scrambled for parking space in the university as people walked in groups. Doctorate graduands adorned red gowns while their masters, bachelors and diploma counterparts were dressed in black. In this year’s ceremony, the university awarded one doctor of science degree, 70 PhDs, 402 masters, 2,845 bachelors, 14 postgraduate diplomas and 571 diplomas. Among those awarded include Samburu senator Steven Lelegwe, who was awarded a PhD in Project Management. Julius Ogeng’o received a doctorate of science degree. He joins four other professors who have achieved the coveted feat since the establishment of the University of Nairobi. Education CS Amina Mohamed challenged the university to enhance its asset portfolio. She called for enhanced research to transform the economy. “On your part as universities, I expect to see significant growth in your Intellectual Property – including growth in IP Assets and their commercialisation.” Click here for the latest political news
