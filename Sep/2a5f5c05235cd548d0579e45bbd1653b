The Kenya Wildlife Service yesterday welcomed the birth of a black rhino at the Tsavo East National Park. Communications boss Paul Udoto said they were considering public suggestions on a possible nickname for the newborn. "New kid on the block: The birth of a black rhino in Tsavo yesterday [Tuesday] has brought thrill of amazement and smiles on our faces," KWS tweeted. The KWS registers all rhino births in a database and allocates the calves distinct ID numbers for lifelong identification. The details entered in the register include date of birth, place of birth, mother or father, age and sex. Udoto said rhinos are often named after partners, donors, well-wishers, KWS staff and important guests. He said this is done to appreciate their support and contribution to conservation of rhinos and other wild animals. "So for the rhino born in Tsavo East, we have the ID and other biometric details, but we have yet to name it after a human being or other discretionary identity," Udoto said. Members of the public also welcomed the good news. They urged KWS staff to protect the rhino with all their hearts and might. On their social media pages, they told the agency to seek help where necessary. The news followed deaths of 11 black rhinos in July. They were being moved from the Nairobi National Park to Tsavo. Reports indicated that the rhinos died after taking highly saline water on arrival in the new environment. Tourism CS Najib Balala said the KWS officers were "traumatised and shocked" by the deaths. The government launched an independent investigation.
