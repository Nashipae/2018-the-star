Caleb Otieno, a tout who died at Changamwe police station on Tuesday, was drunk and collapsed prior to his demise. Changamwe sub-county police commander Peter Omanwa said the death was natural and was not instigated as alleged. He said, amid claims of foul play, that the suspect was pronounced dead after being rushed to Coast Provincial General Hospital. The commander termed as "mere speculation", reports by human rights groups, witnesses, and family that Otieno was hit with a metal bar causing his death. "We invited IPOA to investigate as the law states," the commander said at his office on Thursday further admitting that the police had the last contact with the tout. "They (officers) have recorded statements. In case any person is found culpable, he will be held accountable," he said. Omanwa said other suspects who were in the police cell with Otieno have been interrogated by the IPOA team. He said Otieno was among four, two women and two men, arrested during an operation at an illicit brew den in Mikindani. He said the late tout refused to identify himself and was booked as "unknown prisoner". Omanwa said it was just coincidental that Otieno died while under police watch. "You cannot say a person has died of certain circumstances which have not been established." Click here for the latest political news
