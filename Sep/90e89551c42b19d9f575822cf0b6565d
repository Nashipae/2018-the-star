The Education ministry plans to broker a deal between the feuding camps at Masinde Muliro University. Workers unions — Uasu, Kusu and Kudheia — want vice chancellor Fred Otieno to be sent on leave to allow the varsity council to recruit his successor. His first term ends on November 30. Otieno had written to Education CS Amina Mohamed seeking renewal of his term for another five years. But the council told him to take terminal leave from September 1 so he could clear his accumulated leave days and make room for it to employ a new VC. On Saturday, Amina Mohamed said she met council members and the management. She will meet the warring sides again this week. “The ministry is determined to address the challenges and help restore its reputation. Stakeholders will soon see steps the government will take,” she said. Amina said it is the responsibility of the council, not the government, to hire a VC. On Thursday, the unions urged Amina to allow the council to advertise Otieno’s position. In a statement read by Kusu branch secretary Ronald Wamalwa, the officials said Otieno’s “high-handedness” had resulted in a mass exodus of staff, including senior professors. Otieno, through acting public relations officer Brendah Kabindio, dismissed the claims and said the unionists are “falsehood peddlers. For unions to purport to speak on behalf of the MMUST Council is unfortunate. We advise unions to stick to their mandate,” he said.
