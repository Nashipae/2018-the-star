The discovery followed Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko's impromptu visit to the facility after a tip off by members of the public. Sonko said that his raid was prompted by a video clip sent to him by a patient showing bodies being carried from the wards. Health CS Sicily Kariuki has directed the Medical Board, Nursing Council and Clinical Officers Council to also probe the matter.

newborns and stillbirths are collected by the city mortuary morticians. The health workers cited that unlike before when the bodies were collected on a daily basis, the same are taken to city morgue only on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Click here for the latest political news
