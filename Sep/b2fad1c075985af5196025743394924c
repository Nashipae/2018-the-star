President Uhuru Kenyatta has signed into law a raft of new taxes likely to raise the cost of living. We all accept that we must pay taxes to fund services but the government must make the most of what it collects and spend our tax money prudently. The government should stop wastage in public institutions and should promote stronger economic growth, especially through innovation to create jobs for millions of young people. Taxation should not stifle growth and cost jobs. Instead, President Kenyatta must demand every public servant deliver fully on their mandate. The President must also intensify the fight against graft by preventing it before it happens and where public funds have been stolen, swiftly prosecute those behind the theft and quickly recover the proceeds. That money could be invested in jobs and additional resources needed most. The government must take on the networks that have captured key institutions such as the Parliament, the Judiciary, the economy, the security sector ... just name it. Civil society must play its role to mobilise the public against corruption and hold the government accountable to its commitments.
