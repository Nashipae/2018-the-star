Good Morning. Most parts of Kenya are expected to continue receiving showers, especially in the morning with areas around the Indian Ocean registering strong winds and thunderstorms. The weatherman has indicated that most parts of the country will likely experience above average rainfall as the short rains season kicks off. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this Weekend. Murder! Murder! Murder! The news headlines for September could have set a new national record, sparking off debate in offices, homes, social media and social places about the state of Kenyan society. With the string of sensational gruesome and senseless killings, concern has peaked in the country on the safety of womenfolk who seem to be the main casualties. Danger beckons everywhere you look. And the victims cut across all ages and gender. Are people more than before now quick to anger and kill for revenge or to fix relationship issues? MPs to pay for waste of taxpayer’s money MPs, government officials and the public will henceforth be surcharged if they cause the loss of taxpayers’ money. This is among a raft of austerity measures imposed by the Parliamentary Service Commission in a bid to stem wastage and misuse of public funds by the legislature. The PSC has instructed the clerks of the Senate and the National Assembly to enforce a circular that, among others, demands that if an MP, government official or civilian is facilitated to travel (through the purchase of air ticket and paid accommodation) and fails to show up be surcharged. Sonko's chaotic management at City Hall Glitzy Nairobi governor Mike Sonko’s chaotic leadership and haphazard dismissal of staff has severely exposed his soft underbelly and brought into sharp focus his roughshod management style. While Sonko’s story doesn’t lie in his impulsive and radical decisions, his apparent self-injurious character lays bare a deep-seated personality disorder. Borrowing heavily from his topsy-turvy past, when he served as Makadara MP and Nairobi senator, Sonko’s perpetuation of a bullish culture, blended with intimidation and harassment, appears to have snowballed into large scale levels as governor. The Governor’s 13-month reign at City Hall has been described by some as an “occupational terror and sheer hostage”, with little options for staff working at his mercy. NYONG'O: Universal healthcare is realistic, what is needed is commitment In an international conference attended by professionals and leaders from 13 countries across the globe in the Dutch city of Rotterdam this week, it was observed that any country, at whatever stage of socio-economic development, can provide its people with universal healthcare. The word “universal” means simply “all” in the English language. In other words, any government determined to provide all its people or citizens with healthcare is capable of doing so, provided, as defined in our own Constitution, it is clear about “affordable, quality and accessible” healthcare. So why have we not done this in Kenya over the years, and what are the chances of doing so successfully now?
