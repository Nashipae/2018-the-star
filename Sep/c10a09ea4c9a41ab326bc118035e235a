Business in the Nyandarua county assembly was disrupted for the second day yesterday after speaker Wahome Ndegwa refused to recognise new house leaders. The new leaders were elected by Jubilee MCAs at a Nakuru hotel earlier this month. The assembly has 39 members. Twenty-five of them wanted Ndegwa to recognise Edinald King’ori (North Kinangop) as the new majority leader with Justus Gaita (Kiriita) as deputy minority leader. On September 10, the MCAs met in Nakuru and decided to replace majority leader Kamau Gathungu, deputy minority leader Ken Mukira and majority Whip Hussein Kasana. Hussein was replaced by his deputy Wangari Methu and nominated MCA Geoffrey Ngaruiya elected to take over from Methu. Ndegwa has refused to recognise the new leaders saying their election was illegal. Yesterday, King’ori said the speaker had been served with a court order to effect the changes. He said the order directed the new officials to hold office until the matter is heard and determined by the political parties dispute resolution tribunal. “There is no stay order in this instance,” Ndegwa said. The majority MCAs became unruly and accused the speaker of denying them justice. Ndegwa adjourned the sitting. He accused the MCAs of causing disorder in the house. “There has to be order and members must follow the law otherwise I will be presiding over a situation of anarchy which i don’t want to be part of,” Ndegwa said. Tuesday’s session was also adjourned under similar circumstances. The house resumed sittings on Tuesday following a recess. Chairperson of county assembly’s women MCA caucus Milka Wanjiru said the speaker has no choice but accept the will of the majority.
