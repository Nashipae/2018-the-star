Migori ODM senator candidate Ochillo Ayacko will start campaigns today after a successful fundsdrive on Wednesday in Nairobi. The fundsdrive was spearheaded by Nasa leader Raila Odinga and other politicians. The by-election is slated for October 3. The seat fell vacant following the death of Ben Okello of ODM. He had throat cancer. “The fundsdrive was successful. We will officially begin campaigns in Rongo. It will run continuously in all eight subcounties until our final rally in Suna East constituency on September 14,” Ayacko said yesterday. “I ask Migori residents to bank on me to have a strong senator.”
