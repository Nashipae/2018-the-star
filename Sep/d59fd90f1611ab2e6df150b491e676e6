ODM leader Raila Odinga and the Building Bridges task force on Friday paid a courtesy call on President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House, Nairobi. The 14-member team updated Uhuru and Raila on the progress it has made towards their mandate of charting the path to lasting peace and unity in Kenya. The task force was gazetted on May 31, a move that gives their recommendations a legal impetus. The team is expected to finish the task within a year.
