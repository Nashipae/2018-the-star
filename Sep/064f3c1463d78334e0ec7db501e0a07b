A protest against the destruction of stalls at a market in Narok town turned ugly after one person was killed and seven others injured on Sunday. The Narok County Government allegedly demolished stalls belonging to members of the Maa community at Uhuru Muthurwa market at midnight on Saturday. In retaliation, Maasai morans stormed the market and set ablaze all the stalls in the market which belong to members of other communities. The traders fought back using crude weapons before the police were called in to restore order. Traders who spoke to the Star said they were continuing with their businesses when the Morans attacked them and burnt their goods. Normal operations in Narok town came to a standstill when the group of Maasai traders held demonstrations in the busy town. They said the county government violated their rights in demolishing their stalls, their only source of livelihood. The business community called on the government to move with speed and quel tensions before the matter takes tribal dimension. Those injured are receiving treatment at Narok County Referral Hospital while the body of the deceased was taken to facility's mortuary. Click here for the latest political news
