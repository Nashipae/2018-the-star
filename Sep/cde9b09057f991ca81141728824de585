Police officers involved in the killing of youths at the Coast will soon face the law, DPP Noordin Haji has said. The Director of Public Prosecutions said it will not be business as usual for the officers who are behind the recent spate of killings. “If evidence links the killings to any police officer, they should be prosecuted," Haji said. Haji spoke on Sunday after a meeting with HAKI-Africa, a Mombasa-based civil society on the forefront in fighting extra-judicial killings. “There are no two ways about it, victims of the police killings must get justice,” he said. Haji said in the next three weeks there will be a response to the killings, investigations and arrest of officers.

Hajj received an extra-judicial killings report from HAKI-Africa listing victims of police killings. According to the report, 32 people including a 14-year-old boy were shot dead by the police. Two other people including a seven-year-girl were injured by the police under unclear circumstances, the report shows. HAKI's executive director Hussein Khalid said the killings executed under the guise of fighting crime in the county. “The rising cases of police killings are worrying. We are not against fighting crime, but we are against killing people,” Khalid said.
