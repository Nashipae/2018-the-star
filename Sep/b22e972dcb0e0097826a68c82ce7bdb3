Five counties have walked out of the North Rift Economic Bloc, which may collapse four years since it was formed. Noreb’s chairman since formation has been Uasin Gishu governor Jackson Mandago. The bloc brought together the eight counties of Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo Marakwet, Nandi, Samburu, Baringo, Turkana, West Pokot and Trans Nzoia. Nandi and Trans Nzoia have joined the Lake Region Economic Bloc, while Samburu, West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet have joined the Frontier Counties Development Council which brings together marginalised counties. Mandera Governor Ali Roba, who chairs the economic bloc, has said the request by Governor Alex Tolgos to have Elgeyo Marakwet county included in the pool had been accepted. FCDC bloc is a shared platform created by the county governments of Lamu, Tana River, Garissa, Wajir, Mandera, Marsabit, Isiolo, West Pokot and Turkana. The nine counties are listed as the most marginalised in Kenya where historical neglect has resulted in glaring inequalities. Last week, FCDC counties held a conference in West Pokot hosted by Governor John Lonyangapuo. Tolgos, who was in Kapenguria, said his county shared the same characteristics as those under FCDC and it was for that reason that it should be included. “I am here today as an observer and I have already presented the request to be included in this bloc because this is where we belong,” he said. Nandi county will on Thursday next week host the Loreb summit meeting in Nandi Hills, signaling its official exit from Noreb. “We will be hosting the Loreb summit and it will enable us to explore the potential we have, especially in terms of marketing our produce in the lake region,” Nandi Governor Stephen Sang said. Nandi stands to get better markets for its agricultural products, including milk, through Loreb. Noreb has not held meetings for a while and early this year, Mandago said the counties were free to join more than one economic bloc
