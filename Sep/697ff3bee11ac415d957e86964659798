Nyandarua woman representative Faith Gitau has said MPs will consider impeaching Treasury CS Henry Rotich for ‘arrogance’ and ignoring the voice of the people over the fuel levy. The 16 per cent VAT hike on all petroleum products has gone into effect, despite the public outcry and the National Assembly’s efforts to delay the enforcement for two years. “He should not think we cannot impeach him for going contrary to our decision. He need to know that seat does not belong to his mother,” she said. Gitau spoke at Ol kalou on Monday afternoon when she issued cheques to groups for projects under National Government Affirmative Action Fund.
