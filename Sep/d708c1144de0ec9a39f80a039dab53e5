Kitui governor Charity Ngilu on Tuesday said she is willing to use matatus if they improve safety and are spruced up to ferry dignitaries. "Owing to the increase in petrol prices, I'd wish to cut costs by using matatus instead of my official car," she said. "Former Transport minister John Michuki did a sterling job. The Michuki rules improved road safety. That can still be done. We don't want accidents on Kitui roads," she said. The governor was speaking to PSV operators at the main bus terminus in Kitui town. She was accompanied by Kitui County Commissioner Samuel Kimiti, County Police Commander Antony Kamitu and Lan and Infrastructure executive Jacob Kakundi. "Road accidents involving matatus are on the rise in Kitui. One nearly hit my car because the driver was speeding," Ngilu said. She said although some accidents are caused by poor roads, a majority of are by human error and speeding. Ngilu said the county will take PSV drivers for refresher courses. "I will award drivers who don't cause accidents. I want PSV drivers to be neat. We will provide hot showers for them at the Kitui bus park for them to take a bath before work and free public toilets," she said. Click here for the latest political news
