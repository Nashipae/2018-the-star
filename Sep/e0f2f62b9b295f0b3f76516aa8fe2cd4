The government will no longer buy transformers from vendors but directly from manufacturers, Energy CS Charles Keter told a Senate committee yesterday. He said this will enhance safety and integrity of the transformers and end power outages caused by substandard equipment. “Already we have stopped buying from the vendors because of the risks involved. We are now going directly to manufacturers because in the event of any mishap, we’ll know where to go,” Keter told the Senate’s Energy committee at Parliament Buildings.

Keter said the transformers often explode. “There is always an analysis by engineers before the transformers are declared faulty. Some of them had malfunctioned in the face of poor workmanship and poor quality of works,” he said. The committee is chaired by Nyeri senator Ephraim Maina. Keter was accompanied by PS Joseph Njoroge. Njoroge told the committee the reasons some transformers fail to serve their lifespans is due to poor handling, low quality and hazards related to lightning. Maina urged the CS to seek the support of the Treasury in implementing such projects. More: Audit reveals massive irregularities at Kenya Power as MD vows action Click here for
