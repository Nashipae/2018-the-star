Six women MPs have asked DCI George Kinoti and DPP Noordin Haji to speed up investigations into the murder of Sharon Otieno. Kirinyaga woman representative Wangui Ngirici and Bungoma’s Catherine Wambilianga said the main suspect should be in custody. Wambilianga said the pace of investigations is slow as almost everyone knows “the man” behind Sharon’s death. ‘’We are asking Kinoti and Haji to bring to book the main killer despite his position,’’ she said on Monday. Kitui woman rep Irene Kasalu said a governor has been adversely mentioned and no one should be spared. Nyandarua’s Faith Gitau said women leaders are ready to march to the office of the governor mentioned in the case, make a citizen arrest and hand him over to investigative agencies in two weeks if probe will proceed at a slow pace. ’We are ready to march to the governors office and arrest him to send a message to other men who misuse our young women and kill them at the end of the day,’’ Gitau said. Baringo’s Gladwell Cheruiyot said the main killer should be brought to book immediately. Kakamega woman representative Elsie Muhanda threatened to lead women in protest until the ‘’main’’ killer of Sharon is arrested. The women leaders spoke in Kerugoya.
