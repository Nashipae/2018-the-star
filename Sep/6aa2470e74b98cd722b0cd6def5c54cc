Nairobi MCAs were
treated to partying and merrymaking over the weekend by a Nairobi county
executive for a job well done. The county assembly members who returned on Monday
after a weekend of relaxation at the coast are said to have come back with
their loaded pockets too. Each was reliably rewarded for their hard work in the
ouster of Speaker Beatrice Elachi. Corridors is informed that they were told to
go slow on the impeachment plans for the county boss. Just what is
happening at a parastatal under the Ministry of Tourism? It is rumored that
after the release of the recent audit report revealing the misappropriation of millions,
the management is working overtime to ensure one of the top female managers is
interdicted. Those in the know say the woman who sued the institution for unlawfully
sacking her may spill the beans on what exactly is happening at the parastatal the
day the management will be summoned to appear before a committee of Parliament.Â The
lady is reported to be standing her ground in fighting impunity and has vowed
to ensure all the ills at the institution are exposed.
