Peace elders from Garissa have expressed alarm over rampant truancy among children who are skipping classes. The elders said they have received complaints that the children leave their homes for school but never get to the learning institutions. Garissa peace committee secretary Hassan Osman said childen are “soft targets” for al Shabaab recruiters. “We want to establish exactly where these children spend the entire day only to go back home pretending they were in school,” he said. Cases of children skipping classes have become rampant and they want to engage the parents and teachers to ensure all children attend classes. Hassan accused some parents of abdicating their duties and leaving everything to teachers. “There are parents who took their children the first day in school but have never gone back to inquire how they are progressing in their studies, leave alone checking their homework,” he said. Waberi West senior chief Yussuf Ali yesterday said his location is one of those affected. He said parents are partly to blame for failing to take their parental role seriously. Ali spoke to parents on the importance of closely monitoring their children. “Many parents have abdicated their parental responsibilities. Most of them don’t even know their children teachers’. They have no idea how their children perform in their studies,” he said. He said students who fail to do well in studies feel that their parents have neglected them. “These cases are of concern to us because they partly contribute to insecurity,” Ali said.
