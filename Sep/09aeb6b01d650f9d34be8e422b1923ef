Kisii is planning to invest in telemedicine, Governor James Ongwae said yesterday. Telemedicine is the use of telecommunication and information technology to provide clinical health care from a distance. It allows healthcare providers to evaluate, diagnose and treat patients with some ailments without the need for an in-person visit. Ongwae said diagnosis is becoming complicated and the programme will help residents’ access healthcare. “There is need to invest in telemedicine to help residents in rural areas access quality healthcare,” he said. Ongwae spoke to the Star on the phone. He urged Lake Basin Economic Bloc member counties to prioritise health by allocating more resources. Ongwae said his administration spends between 45 and 50 per cent of its budget on health. Kisii, he said, is the only county that has held a health conference. The governor said there is need for strong health evaluation systems. He said if all counties adopt the system, then it will provide an opportunity for cross-county learning as opposed to use of consultants and experts to guide health sector reforms. Deputy Governor Joash Maangi said to effectively prevent diseases, county bosses must allocate more resources to health. He said the Lake Basin Economic Bloc will succeed if member counties work to foster development. Click here for the latest political news
