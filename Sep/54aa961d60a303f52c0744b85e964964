Machakos University has been closed indefinitely after students took to the streets on Wednesday following their leader’s arrest. Gideon Omari was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly inciting his colleagues to engage in demonstrations. Prof Joyce Agalo, the university’s DVC Academic Affairs, announced the institution’s closure after the learners became uncontrollable. The students have since Monday been on the Machakos streets protesting against fee increment by the institution's management. On Monday, a contingent of police officers lobbed tear gas to disperse the riotous students after they blocked the university's main entrance. "The University Senate at its meeting on Wednesday resolved to close the university until further notice," Agalo said in a notice. The closure affected all TVET, Certificate, Diploma, and Undergraduates in session except postgraduate students. "The re-opening of the university will be communicated to the affected students through the print media and university website." The students were ordered to vacate the university premises including hostels not later than 5pm on Wednesday. However, the students vowed to continue with the demonstrations until Omari was released from police custody. "The arrested student leader has been fighting for us. We are demanding for his release or we will go release him ourselves." Zachary Onyok said: "Omari did nothing, he is not a school bus which can carry thousands of the comrades to the road." "Let them release him or else we do our comrades duty." The students addressed the press at the University on Wednesday. Click here for the latest political news
