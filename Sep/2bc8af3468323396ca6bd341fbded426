Gospel artistes Bahati and Willy Paul have been accused of not paying their video vixens. A source whispered to Word Is her experience with the two of them. “I was a video vixen in Willy Paul’s song Tempted, which we shot on a Sunday night. He had previously lied to us he would pay us on a Wednesday, which did not happen. Apparently, he first wasted our time by telling us to go to Komarock, where he did not show up. We had to board a matatu back to town on our own. Recording started at 11pm and ended at around 6am. After the shoot, Willy Paul did not pay us, neither did he provide transport for us. “He even tried to lure some of the girls to go home with him. He gave us 100 bob and finally and promised to invite us for the launch of the song. That did not happen.” Similarly, Bahati is also accused by the same video vixen of playing similar tricks as Willy Paul’s in his song Kumbe Kumbe, featuring Mr Seed. “We were told to be around Syokimau at 7am, and we did our rehearsals and they came at around 12pm, and they at least gave us food. But the bad thing is they started to discriminate us by the way we dressed. “We did the shoot and at around 10pm, they got a matatu for us, which dropped us in town, and they said we sort ourselves from there. It was now around 11pm and they did not care how we would get home.” Word is reached to the artistes and only Willy Paul responded, saying: “Please, let this go online. This will serve as an example to everyone who wants to make a living out of my hard work.” Bahati’s many calls and messages went unanswered.
