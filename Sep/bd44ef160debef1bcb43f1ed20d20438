A mother on Tuesday narrated to a Kisumu court how a close family friend defiled her six-month-old daughter at Nyamware. During the hearing, the woman said she never had any negative thoughts about suspect James Ochieng before the incident. On the fateful day, the woman said Ochieng visited them at home where he had tea with her husband and mother-in-law. The husband and her in law left, and the girl's mother remained with the suspect. She told him she needed to go and grind rice. "Ochieng asked me to leave my daughter with his kids as I went to the rice mill. He said if the baby soils her clothes she will be cleaned. I agreed,” the mother said. The woman told the court Ochieng’s daughter carried her child back to her house. Ochieng's daughter told her the father asked her to return the baby home. The mother took her baby, but when she tried to feed her she refused. She went to her mother-in-law's house to seek help. The girl also refused to be fed by her grandmother. The mother said when the girl went for a long call, the grandmother noticed that she had some blood stains as she cleaned her.  She also noticed her private parts were swollen. The girl was taken to a local dispensary and then to the county referral hospital. A doctor said the baby had been defiled. During cross-examination, the suspect's lawyer said a report shows the child’s hymen is still intact. However, the girl's mother became emotional before Resident Magistrate Angeline Odawo. She said the lawyer was not present before and after the baby was defiled. The hearing continues on October 9. Two witnesses are lined up to testify. Click here for the latest political news
