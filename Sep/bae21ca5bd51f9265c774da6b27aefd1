A group of Kitui MCAs travelled to Mombasa for a bonding retreat with Governor Charity Ngilu only to realise it had been moved to Mwingi. The leader of majority Peter Kilonzo said 35 out of 56 Kitui ward representatives made the trip. “We initially received communication from County Secretary Alex Kimanzi inviting MCAs for the forum. It was to run from September 4 - 8. The assembly was adjourned,” he said. Kilonzo said there appears to have been a change of plans. The venue was moved to Mwingi town in Kitui. “There was a communication breakdown. MCAs were not aware of the switch. We feel cheated,” Kilonzo said. Reached on phone of Thursday, Kitui speaker George Ndotto, who is in Malindi for the ASAL conference, said he could not give details about the failed meeting. “I do not know what happened. I'm in another meeting and will talk to your later,” Ndotto said. A source in the governor's office said the meeting was moved because it would contradict Ngilu’s policy of "buy Kitui to build Kitui". “The governor was firm that the bonding meeting be held in Kitui. She vetoed the Mombasa plans,” our source said. Communication consultant Martin Masai said there are fundamental differences between Governor Ngilu and MCAs. “Ngilu wants Kitui resources to be spent in the county or within Ukambani to benefit residents. But MCAs want to go to Mombasa. The governor was clear in her manifesto that she wants to uplift the people," Masai said. After her election, Ngilu rejected a Sh6 million budget for her inauguration. She said a Bible was enough for the event. Ngilu said the cash should be used for buying water tanks.
