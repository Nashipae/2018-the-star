The IEBC yesterday asked the Supreme Court to dismiss an appeal against Kwale governor Salim Mvurya. IEBC lawyer Paul Nyamodi said the appeal did not raise any matter of great national importance to warrant it being heard by the top judges. According to the commission, there is nothing relating to constitutional interpretation that has been raised before the Supreme Court. Nyamodi appeared before Chief Justice David Maraga, justices Jackton Ojwang’, Isaac Lenaola, Smokin Wanjala, Mohammed Ibrahim and Njoki Ndung’u. Three voters asked the Supreme Court to overturn the decision at the Court of Appeal. The lower court had  upheld Mvurya’s election by dismissing an appeal filed by Mwamlole Mbwana. Mbwana had initially moved to the High Court last year challenging Mvurya’s win against former Minister Chirau Mwakwere. Mbwana lost the petition at the High Court after Justice Mugure Thande ruled the petition fell short of the threshold for petition rules. Thande struck out the petition because Mbwana failed to include the name of Mvurya’s running mate. He had argued that the Kwale governor elections on August 8 last year were not free and fair. Mbwana then moved to the Court of Appeal, arguing that judge Thande erred by striking out his petition. Mbwana later wrote to the Deputy Registrar withdrawing his appeal against the governor but the three voters asked for the case to proceed. In their ruling, appellate judges Martha Koome, Wanjiru Karanja and Alnashir Visram dismissed the appeal in May this year, saying it lacked merit.
