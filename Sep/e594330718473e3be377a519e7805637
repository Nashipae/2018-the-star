Lack of enough trained pilots could negatively impact growth of the aviation industry in Africa, aviation professionals have said. International Federation of Airline Pilots (IFALPA) said there is need to facilitate access to training of pilots to meet current and future requirements. “Going forward, promoting excitement and passion for aviation will not be enough. We should have sustainable growth potential of the sector to attract and retail future aviators,” said IFALPA chairman captain Ron Abel during the annual IFALPA Africa and Middle East 2018 regional meeting and safety seminar in Mombasa. This year’s meeting was hosted by Kenya Airline Pilots Association (KALPA). “This meeting provides a platform for aviators from Africa and the Middle East to share experiences in matters to do with safety and the industry in general,” said captain Njoroge Muriithi, KALPA chairman. IATA projects air passenger travel will double to 7.8 billion within the next 20 years.
