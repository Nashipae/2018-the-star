The World Bank has just released an analysis showing that 17.4 million Kenyans live below the poverty line of Sh92 per day (see P14). Kenya is one of the most unequal countries in the world – only Angola and South Africa are more unequal in Africa. The controversy over VAT on fuel, however necessary it may be to balance the budget, reflects deep concern over how rising prices hurt the common people. If we are to reverse inequality, we need to invest in first-class education and health for all. This will make Kenya more competitive economically but also allow the children of the poorest to fulfil their potential. Sustained over decades, this would make Kenya a more equal and richer society. The masses want the Big Two – quality education and healthcare – not the Big Four. Let’s be less ambitious. Let’s concentrate on making life better for ordinary Kenyans. If people believe they benefit from government spending, they will be more willing to pay increased taxes.
