Nairobi Woman Rep Esther Passaris and Embakasi East MP Babu Owino have condemned impeachment threats by Nairobi County Assembly MCAs against Governor Mike Sonko. The two in their Sonko defense remarks said the threats by the MCAs hold no water since the governor has been discharging his duties in accordance with the law. They called on both Jubilee and NASA MCAs in the Assembly to set aside their political differences and support Sonko to deliver his promises to Nairobians. “I’m calling on the Nairobi MCAs to drop their threats against Sonko. The governor can work and sleep anywhere within the country. Let’s avoid politics until 2022 and give room to Sonko to deliver on his promises,” Babu Owino said. Passaris on her end urged the MCAs to drop threats against Sonko and focus on service delivery. “As Nairobi County legislators we are not interested in sideshows and unwarranted wrangles. Let us focus on development issues and delivery of services by the County government,” she said. The two were speaking at Mua Hills in Machakos County during the third anniversary of Sonko’s late father Gideon Kioko Mbuvi Kivanguli who died in 2015. This comes after the MCA's gave the governor 14 days to return to City Hall offices or be impeached. They turned the heat on Sonko after a successful motion that saw speaker Beatrice Elachi impeached.

"The Governor has been operating from his office in Nairobi. The MCA's are just bitter because he (Sonko) has sealed all corruption loopholes," Elkana said.
