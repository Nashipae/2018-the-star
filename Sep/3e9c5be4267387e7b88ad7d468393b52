A Mombasa court has temporarily stopped destruction of sugar seized from Kwale Sugar International Company Limited. Judge Erick Ogola issued temporary injunction orders restraining Kebs and KRA from destroying the 5,000 tonnes of sugar. Ogola further issued injunction orders barring Kebs from implementing recommendations of a laboratory report carried out on August 2 on samples of sugar seized by a multi-agency team. Ogola said the injunction orders will remain in place until the determination of the matter. Kiscol sued for “unlawful seizure”. Click here for the latest political news
