Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu’s political opposition to Deputy President William Ruto seems far from over. On his Facebook page, Wambugu protested his inclusion among other leaders from the county on a poster announcing those who will be accompanying Ruto to a fundraiser on Sunday. The poster, which also includes Ruto’s portrait, states that the leaders will converge at Gikondi Catholic Church in Mukurwe-ini for a fundraiser. But Wambugu retorted, “Why put my picture in an event I’m not attending? Isn’t it....dishonest? Kitaeleweka.” ***** A former senator from Central region is now a multi-millionaire. Well, a mole tells Corridors that the former lawmaker is setting up a posh mansion as he graciously enjoys the proceeds he reaped during his tenure. Corridors has also learned that the austere leader is relocating his wealth gradually from his oversees bank account. He is said to have amassed a lot of wealth during his tenure as a seasoned politician. ***** Although MPs are on recess, some can still be spotted in the corridors of Parliament fielding press interviews. One of them bluntly told Corridors recently, “I’d rather remain in the city.

Although his intervention was thwarted by MCAs, as 103 of them proceeded to vote her out, some curious observers were heard wondering whom Raila was representing. Or was he was just extending the handshake? ***** A vocal MP from Nyanza is celebrating. Why? Because a combative governor, who is his biggest nightmare, seems to be staring at his Waterloo. The two have been feuding for some time and their supremacy wars almost turned bloody towards last year’s polls. Corridors hears that the MP was heard bragging that his succession plans are now on course, as a section of MCAs are said to be deserting the county boss. ***** Click here for the
