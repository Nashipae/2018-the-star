Many Siaya and Busia girls become pregnant because no one educates them on sexual and reproductive health, a survey has revealed. A report by the Malaika Foundation says the counties recorded high number of pregnancies at 17 per cent. The national average is 18 per cent. “The lack of friendly centres in the hospitals and failure to implement the Kenya National Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health policy have majorly contributed to the rise of alcoholism, drugs and substance abuse among the youth,” Collette Anyango of the Malaika Foundation said yesterday. Busia Health chief officer Isaac Omeri said inadequate funding and staff hurts implementation of the policy. He said the county has no specific budget for adolescence sexual and reproductive health programmes. The survey also showed that many teenagers engage in unsafe sex, which is to blame for the increase of HIV-Aids infections in the region. The report recommended that county health departments partner with other agencies, including the media, to fix problems related to sexual and reproductive health.
