Rampant graft in government agencies is likely to hurt the Big Four agenda, Solicitor General Kennedy Ogeto has said. He said corruption has had adverse effects, mainly on the ability to attract foreign direct investment. Ogeto said due to corruption, incompetence and lethargy find their way into public offices. He said this hurts services and quality of work for which citizens pay taxes. “Corruption leads to growing poverty levels, unemployment, inequality, insecurity and general crime, among other social ills,” Ogeto said. He said the national government is working towards the attainment of the Big Four agenda, within the broader Vision 2030 economic blueprint. “I have no doubt that these laudable plans aimed at transforming the lives of Kenyans cannot be achieved unless we stem the tide of corruption,” Ogeto said. He said Kenya has a robust anti-corruption legal framework which can effectively combat graft. “Other offices and institutions, such as the investigative agencies and the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, have been granted greater independence and operational support,” Ogeto said. He spoke on Saturday during the official opening of the County Anti-Corruption Civilian Oversight Committees capacity building workshop at the Great Rift Valley Lodge in Naivasha.
