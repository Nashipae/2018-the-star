Treasury CS Henry Rotich should explain to Kenyans where he got power to ignore MPs, Cherangany MP Joshua Kuttuny has said. Kuttuny rubbished a Thursday meeting between National Assembly leaders and Rotich, saying the CS should adhere to amendments on Finance bill, 2018. Rotich was with Attorney General Paul Kihara and deputy chief of staff Njee Muturi. Speaker Justin Muturi, Majority Leader Aden Duale and Budget Committee chairman Kimani Ichung’wa attended. Addressing his constituents at Sinoko on Saturday during a funeral, Kuttuny asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to suspend the 16 per cent VAT on petroleum products. On Thursday Rotich said, “We have held discussions with the leadership of Parliament and we will have more engagements to find a solution.” Kuttuny said CSs do not understand the problems ordinary Kenyans experience. He proposed constitutional changes so that MPs are picked as ministers. The lawmaker questioned why Rotich disregarded the National Assembly’s amendments and went on to ensure a 16 per cent VAT is charged on fuel. Click here for the latest political news
