Maize farmers in Bungoma county have criticised the state’s directive to reduce prices of maize flour to Sh75 per 2kg packet. Farmer Musa Wanjala from Tingaren constituency said the reduction will have a negative impact on the prices of maize that are “already low”. He spoke in Webuye town on Thursday. Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri on Wednesday directed millers to reduce the price of a 2kg packet of maize flour to Sh75. He said any trader selling the flour at more than Sh75 will be arrested for exploiting consumers. Early this month, millers indicated they would increase the price of a 2kg packet of unga by Sh4 due the increase on fuel tax. But the CS said the price of a 90kg bag of maize has reduced to Sh1,600, a 50 per cent drop from last year’s prices. Wanjala said the reduction in flour price will cause problems for famers who will have to sell their maize at as low as Sh15 per 2kg. fuel “This is a big blow to famers who have invested heavily in growing their maize,” he said. “When someone leases a piece of land, invests in labour, fertiliser and other expenses, it will not be in line with the price he will sell the maize to use to pay fees for example.” Jacqueline Wekesa, a Webuye resident, said the state has done well to reduce the price. She urged the state to reduce the price of fuel. She also urged the state to reduce the price of wheat flour. Maize is sold at between Sh25 and 50 per kg at this harvest season in Western. Maize farmers in the Rift this week appealled to the Senate to intervene and have them paid. The farmers met senators at Eldoret Town Hall.
