The ban on logging could be made permanent to protect forests, Environment CS Keriako Tobiko (pictured) has hinted. On Wednesday, he warned that forests will not be turned into a cash cow by unscrupulous loggers. Tobiko cautioned the Kenya Forest Service that it was never created to sell trees. He said the KFS had no business selling trees to meet budgetary deficit in the face of dwindling donor support. He urged sector players to seek alternative sources of income. “Why don’t you take time to think just in case there is no lifting of the moratorium or in case we decide it is not a moratorium but a total ban,” he said at the Kitui Kefri centre as he delivered the keynote address at the launch of the 13th Foresters Scientific Conference. “Even as you were selling trees, our forest sector was in a mess. Our water catchment areas were degraded, encroached on recklessly with wanton abundance, and our rivers and riparian reserves were disregarded.” He said that when he took charge, trees were being harvested with impunity and wantonly and illegal logging was the order of the day and in some cases state organs and officers were involved.  The moratorium on community and public forests is meant to save future generations, Tobiko told the conference.
