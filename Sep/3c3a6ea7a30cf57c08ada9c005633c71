A case of a man facing charges of being in possession of 507 bullets and attempting to frame his sister over a Sh100 million property row was adjourned on Monday, again. Jan Asharaf Mohammed has since denied the charges in the case which has seen three magistrates recuse themselves since the matter was lodged in court about five years ago. The hearing was pushed to a later date on grounds that the magistrate, who is presiding over the matter, proceeded for leave. A notice at principal magistrate Charles Ndegwa's office showed that his leave started on September 17. "The honourable magistrate has since proceeded for leave and will be back by October 30. All matters from his court
will be mentioned by Hon Kassim," read part of the notice. Monday's adjournment was the second one in a row. This was after an earlier one in which the Mombasa principal magistrate was said to away after he lost his relative. The last witness in the matter, who is an investigating officer, was expected to give his account on the matter before the adjournment, to the disappointment of the plaintiffs.
