At least 40 people have been arrested in Iten in a crackdown on hotel workers without medical certificates. The raid was conducted on Friday by Elgeyo Marakwet county health officials led by executive Kiprono Chepkok. Chepkok said the crackdown was aimed at preventing spread of diseases caused by poor sanitation. The move came just two weeks after public health officials closed toilets at county offices over fears of diseases. The toilets serve at least 120 workers. Public health officer Mathew Kore said the toilets were in pathetic condition. Friday raid was conducted in 18 hotels and restaurants. “They will be taken to court and charged with failure to adhere to health regulations,” Chepkok said. The executive said the hotels did not comply with hygiene standards. They were given three weeks to comply, failure to which they will be shut down and their owners arrested. Chepkok said the crackdown will be extended to other towns and trading centres. “We have received reports of food hawkers who don’t meet health standards. We won’t ban food hawking but we want to regulate it to designated areas,” he said. In May, several eateries and hotels in parts of Kerio Valley were indefinitely closed following fears of a cholera outbreak after two people died. The victims, a 60-year-old woman and a four-year-old boy died in their homes. Similar fears were reported in Mogil, Chugor, Chesoi, Chesongoch and Arror areas.
