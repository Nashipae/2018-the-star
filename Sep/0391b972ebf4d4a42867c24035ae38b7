Mombasa governor Hassan Joho on Tuesday supported calls to change the Constitution through a referendum. Joho said since the Constitution was promulgated in 2010 it has brought a lot of changes. However, more needs to be done for counties to benefit more. He said governors are being blamed for non-performance, yet the national government holds a bigger percent of funds. "The national government has succeeded in building a narrative that governors are incompetent and cannot account for the cash they receive. But the 47 counties are allocated only 15 per cent of the national resources and the government keeps 85 per cent," Joho said. He wants the Constitution changed so that least 50 per cent of the resources goes to the counties. He spoke during the Mombasa County Devolution Sensitisation Week at Makadara Grounds. Joho said the conversation around referendum calls cannot be ignored. He said it is unfortunate that the national government is allocating billions of shillings to the ministries of Water, Health and Agriculture, yet these are all devolved functions.
