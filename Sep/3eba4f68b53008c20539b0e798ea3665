Embakasi East MP Babu Owino has asked embattled Nairobi Speaker Beatrice Elachi to embrace dialogue "if she wants to secure her job". The flamboyant legislator has warned the speaker against using the courts to fight for her survival, adding that "her battles can only be solved politically". "She is in a political quagmire and that means she can only come out as a victor if she cools down to embrace dialogue," Babu said on Thursday. Elachi was impeached by the city MCAs on September 6 over corruption allegations but went to court to challenge the decision. Her case is due to be decided on Friday. However, Babu told journalists that the outcome of the court might not be of help to the speaker. "When you are the speaker of a legislative house, you need goodwill from the members and not goodwill from the courts," the lawmaker added. Elachi's troubles got complicated on Tuesday when the MCAs elected Ngara MCA Chege Mwaura as an acting speaker. A section of MCAs have also accused the beleaguered speaker of sabotaging the development agenda of Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko. Her woes with the leadership of the assembly started when she invoked investigations by the Director of Criminal Investigations into flawed assembly tenders. She would later endure a tough battle with the clerk Jacob Ngwele who also accused her of plotting to defraud the assembly in the purchase of the speaker's residence. Normal proceedings have resumed at the assembly but the Friday court ruling is expected to be a key factor as well. Majority leader Abdi Hassan Guyo opines that Elachi's fate is sealed and that the MCAs have since moved on.
