The Education ministry, the TSC and other stakeholders have been criticised for reducing entry points to teachers training colleges to a D-. Teso South MP Geoffrey Omuse yesterday said a D- minus holder cannot be hired to teach someone expected to become a professor, for example. “It is impossible. Primary school is the middle foundation of education. The entry point should stick to C plain.” He addressed journalists at Township Secondary School in Teso South. Omuse said the move will discourage education training. Potential teachers will boycott the course, Omuse added.
