With four matches left to play, the relegation battle which could still cause late upsets and the Golden Boot race remain the focus in the SportPesa Premier League. Mathare United forward Cliff Nyakeya is among those eager to put their hands on the award that has opened moves abroad for previous winners with the current holder, former Kariobangi Sharks striker, Masoud Juma landing at Omani club Dhofar via Cape Town City Stars. Nyakeya failed to hit the target in the Slum Boys’ defeat to Chemelil Sugar over the weekend but is regarded highly as he was called up to the national team for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Ghana and the friendly against Malawi during the international break. Although he did not feature in both matches, he gained a lot in camp. “I was disappointed not to play but it was a good experience altogether to train with big players like (Michael) Olunga and Calabar (David Owino). I learnt a lot from them,” Nyakeya remarked on the club official site. With 10 goals to his name, the young striker has his work cut out to overhaul current leading scorer Elvis Rupia who has 15 goals despite not featuring in the second leg having moved to seek greener pastures in Zambia with Gor Mahia’s Jacques Tuyisenge (13), Kariobangi Sharks’ Eric Kapaito and AFC Leopards star Ezekiel Odera both with 12 goals, also pursuing the leading scorer gong alongside Nyakeya.
