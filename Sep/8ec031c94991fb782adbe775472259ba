Trans Nzoia county has suspended implementation of several projects due to grabbing of public land. Deputy Governor Stanley Tarus said they have invited the DPP and the DCI to investigate massive land grabbing and help to arrest those involved. He said they have also written to the National Land Commission over the land theft. Tarus said development of the Kitale Sports Stadium is among projects that have been put on hold after individuals grabbed land. “We have reached a point where development of public facilities, including schools and hospitals, has stalled because people have grabbed every bit of public land available,” he said in Kitale on Thursday. Tarus said the county administration will repossess the stadium land so that a modern facility can be established. We cannot roll out our plans because certain selfish people have decided to take the stadium land and other public plots in Kitale town. Our plan is to repossess the land to allow for construction of a modern sporting facility,” he said. Tarus said land grabbing problem should be tackled in the same manner as corruption. He said the economy of the county has stalled for years owing to the declining business activities in the region. “For many years, we have not provided opportunities for businesspeople because we have no land to expand our town,” Tarus said.
