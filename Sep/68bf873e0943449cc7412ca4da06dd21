The United Nations High Commission for Refugees has supported schools in parts of Fafi that have students from Dadaab camps. The agency, through Windle Trust Kenya and Fafi Integrated Development Association, has built dormitories, classrooms, toilets and set up water tanks. Speaking to the press in his office yesterday, Alinjugur Secondary School principal Noor Gani said out of 333 students, 175 are from refugee camps. They are sponsored by the UNHCR. Gani acknowledged efforts by the refugee agency through its partners in helping schools. He said the donations have facilitated the integration of refugees with the host community. The school has adequate infrastructure, most of which was set up by UN and its partners. There’s ongoing construction of four classrooms by the Safaricom Foundation. The school has government teachers despite the mass exodus of non-local teachers over security concerns. Alinjugur is in a refugee camp, a location the government had said harbours terrorists. Most of the students’ parents live in Somalia. Student Abdullah Osman fled from Mogadishu in 2011. He aspires to become a teacher and help younger students back home. Osman said education will change the attitude in his country and citizens from constant fighting and bloodshed. He was elected school president. Osman said he and other refugee students are anxious over reports the donor funding may be suspended.
