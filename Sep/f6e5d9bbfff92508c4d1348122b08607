Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has called for a stronger East African Community for better bargaining in international affairs. He said the dream of an East African federation is still valid and more concerted efforts should be made towards its realisation. “How I wish we could move and overcome the usual cobwebs and form the East African federation,” Kalonzo said. He spoke yesterday while presiding over the graduation ceremony of Uganda Technology and Management University (Utamu) where he is the chancellor. Earlier, Kalonzo and his delegation paid a courtesy call on President Yoweri Museveni at State House, Entebbe, where they discussed the East African federation and political stability. He urged Ugandans and other East Africans to embrace dialogue and political tolerance just like in Kenya where erstwhile political antagonists are now working together for national good. When Uganda or any other EAC partner is in political turmoil, the entire region is adversely affected, he said. “We decided to build bridges. That is why today in Kenya, President Uhuru Kenyatta, Prime Minister Raila Odinga, Deputy President William Ruto and yours truly are working together to look at the best options for Kenya,” Kalonzo said. “So, when Uganda gets bad publicity, and investment opportunities are negatively affected, it affects all of us in East Africa.” The Wiper leader urged the graduates to embrace servant leadership in their daily life as they enter the job market. “Whatever field you choose, if you operate from the paradigm of service, I know your life will have more value and you will be happy. Use your job as a platform to serve others,” Kalonzo said. Click here for
