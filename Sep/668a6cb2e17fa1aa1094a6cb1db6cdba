Nandi has asked multinational tea companies and gold mining investors to pay up Sh700 million owed to the county government failure to which it will storm the firms. Governor Stephen Sang yesterday said the tea firms have refused to pay dues amounting to Sh300 million owed to the county. He said Karebe Gold Mining Company which operates in Chemelil should pay Sh400 million and another Sh120 million owed to the local community. The firm also owes Sh60 million which should be paid to the owner of land on which the company is built. Sang said it was unfortunate that residents were living in poverty because the firms had refused to pay levies. “They have taken our land for free and for many years yet they decline to pay taxes when asked to do so. As a county government, we will not allow that to happen,” Sang said. He said the leases for the tea farms will not be renewed. The companies must pay the dues owed to residents. Sang was speaking in the Uasin Gishu county assembly in Eldoret where Nandi senator Samson Cherargei presented a petition to the Senate on the operations of Karebe Gold Mining Company. The Senate is currently holding sittings in Eldoret. The company operates in the Chemase area near Chemelil. It took  about 10acres of land belonging to Cheseret Arap Korir but has failed to pay him the Sh60 million compensation that was agreed. “We will push by all means to ensure the people of Nandi get their rights,” Cherargei said. Sang said Karebe has not paid the money it owes for the last 10 years yet the firm has been making more than Sh1.2 billion in annual profits. The two leaders said the investors will not be allowed relocate unless they paid the dues. They said investor are welcome to the area but asked them to follow the law.
