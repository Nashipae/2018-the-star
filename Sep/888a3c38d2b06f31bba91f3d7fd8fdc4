Felix Kipkemoi / Former Bomet governor Isaac Rutto has called for the arrest of Narok senator Ledama ole Kina and Narok North MP Moitalel ole Kenta, saying they are responsible for the ongoing fights between the Kipsigis and the Maasai in parts of the Mau Forest. Rutto also expressed his disappointment at what he termed as laxity by the National Cohesion and Integration Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions for failing to investigate and charge the duo. “The Kipsigis and the Maa people living in some sections of the Mau Forest land have been living in peace, and for many years you have not heard them fighting. What has precipitated the fighting are some leaders from Narok, who walk scot-free, even after making such harmful messages,” the former governor said. He said the recent public utterances from the two leaders to the effect that if the government fails to evict people living in the Mau forest, they would marshal their warriors to eject them on their own were inciting and had now created animosity between the two communities, hence the conflict.
