The Senate will summon Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa to explain why the government has again delayed paying farmers for produce delivered to the NCPB despite promising to do so. Speaking in Kitale during a tour to get feedback from farmers, Uasin Gishu senator Margret Kamar, who chairs the Senate ad hoc committee on the maize crisis, said the CS needs to provide information on why the government has delayed paying. She said, “When the Cabinet Secretary came before us, he had only Sh1.4 billion and we were even concerned that he is going to pay only 40 per cent of farmers and leave others out.It is our hope that the delays in payment are because he had less, but now that he has accumulated the amount, he is going to pay.” Kamar said payment should be made because some farmers might have borrowed money for other activities knowing they were going to be paid. “If you cannot return the maize, you must pay them,” she said. Kamar urged the government to pay according to what was supplied, adding some genuine farmers might be left out. “We discovered some of the traders were farmers who took that responsibility to help the small farmers. Queuing in Trans Nzoia was the same with other parts of the country where long queues of upto two to three kilometres. So if one was queuing for two kilometers hoping to sell 50 bags of maize, it was a complete waste of time,” she said. “There was danger of maize getting spoilt while on the queue. So small-scale farmers decided to give their produce to large-scale farmers.” Click here for the latest political news
