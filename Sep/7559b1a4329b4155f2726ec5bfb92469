Deputy President William Ruto has asked youths from Marsabit county to enroll for technical training to bridge the skills gaps in the country. He said the government will in September roll out a Sh30,000 loan, akin to HELB, to all eligible students in technical colleges. The DP said the skills obtained from the institution are vital efforts towards poverty eradication, economic recovery, and sustainable development. He also stated that trainer's capacity would also be strengthened so that the product quality is in tandem with the industry demands. Ruto spoke during the official opening Laisamis Technical and Vocational College on Friday. He said technical colleges have a vital role in the implementation of the government's Big 4 agenda on housing, health, industrialisation, and agriculture. "The Sh30,000 is part of the government's plan to attract youths to various technical training institutions across the county," the deputy president revealed. He urged parents to ensure that their children join technical training institutions to gain more knowledge that will help themselves to venture into business. Ruto also promised the construction of Ngurunet-Loiyangalani road adding that the national government has set aside Sh250 million for rural electrification in Laisamis. Marsabit governor Mohamud Ali, Senator Godana Hargura, MPs Musa Arbele (Laisamis), Dido Ali Raso (Saku), and Chachu Ganya (Northhorr) were present. Charles Rotich, the college's principal, said more than 100 students applied for the September intake. Currently, the number of students stands at 40. He said a large number of youths depend on employment, a trajectory that he said is set to change with advancement in technology. Ruto also promised that the construction of Marsabit Stadium would be complete in the next one year adding that the government has a plan to revive Badasa dam. Click here for the latest political news
