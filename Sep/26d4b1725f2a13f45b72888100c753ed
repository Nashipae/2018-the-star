Kanbis maintained their unbeaten record in the 2018 Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association (NPCA) Elite League with a seven-wicket win over arch rivals Swamibapa at Eastleigh High School on Sunday. Chasing 210 runs to win, the hosts were home and dry in the 38th over with the loss of only three wickets, thanks to skipper Rajesh Bhudia’s 64 from 65 balls. Swamibapa had earlier slipped to 13 for 2 in just 10 balls, thanks to Bhudia ( 2 for 40) before a half-centuries from Alex Obanda (59) and Deepak Pal (70) relieved the pressure in a third wicket stand of 86. However, the stand was broken in the 15th over when Obanda was eventually dismissed by off-spinner Rakep Patel (1-24) after facing 48 balls that had 10 boundaries. Pal’s run a ball 70 was brought to an end 11 overs later after becoming Bhudia’s third wicket. Maurice Ouma (15), James Ngoche (24) and Mayur Pindolia (17) also chipped in with double digits as the visitors ended on 210 with eight overs to play. Kanbis’ chase did not get off to the best of starts as they lost Dhiren Gondaria on 17 with only 29 on board in the 5th over. Rakep (33) joined Bhudia (64) at the crease and the two pushed the scoreboard to 107 after 19 overs before Rakep was bowled out by Pal. Ngoche finally got the wicket of Bhudia when he had the skipper trapped lbw in the 24th over after facing 65 balls that had 10 boundaries. Nelson Mandela (46) and Sachin Bhudia (32) scored the winning runs in an unbeaten fourth wicket stand of 78 runs as Kanbis cruised to victory with more than 20 overs remaining.
