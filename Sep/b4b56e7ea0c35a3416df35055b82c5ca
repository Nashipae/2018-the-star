The IMF standby facility expired on Thursday. Eurobond interest rates have risen and the Kenya shilling has depreciated. We need to urgently agree the $1.5 billion precautionary facility with the IMF to signal to the world that the Kenyan economy is being prudently managed. Government can be blamed for taking on too much infrastructure debt but Parliament caused this mini-crisis. The IMF had two key requirements before signing off on the new facility - ending bank interest rate caps and imposing VAT on fuel to raise an extra Sh75 billion annually. The government wanted to implement both of these measures - with or without the IMF - but was blocked by MPs who thought they hurt the common man. The populist line of the MPs actually hurts the people more than the government proposals. The interest rate caps stops small businesses and wananchi from accessing unsecured loans from banks. And without VAT on fuel, there will be big government cutbacks that will cost jobs and hurt the masses. The MPs are holding a joint kamukunji on Monday to consider the way forward. They now need to support government's efforts to stabilise the economy.  Quote of the day: "People who write a lot about poverty need to go and spend more time with poor people."
