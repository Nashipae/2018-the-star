There were protests in Meru on Tuesday to condemn the murder of Githongo law court magistrate Caroline Kemei's daughter. Rights activists, LSK, judges, magistrates and other judiciary officers, as well as locals, came out in their numbers to demand an overhaul of the police units in the region. The lot cited increased insecurity incidents in Imenti North, Meru county. Kemei's daughter Maribel Kapolon, 9, was found dead and her body dumped at Gitoro forest. She was abducted on September 6. The protesters accused the police of laxity in conducting operations to rid the region of criminals. LSK Meru chapter chairman Ken Muriuki led lawyers to demonstrate from the Meru High court to various police offices. "The police must tell us the progress of their investigation," he said. Operations at the Meru law court were hampered after judges and magistrates joined the demonstration. Meru county commissioner Wilfred Nyangwanga said two of the suspects have already been arrested in connection with the murder. "One of the suspects was with the girl a day before she died," the administrator said. Muriuki said they want an assurance from police of safety of lawyers judges and magistrates. "Such an act should be condemned with strongest terms possible," he said. Kapolon was heading home from Consolata Primary School in Meru at around 5pm when she was picked by a man known to her. Police said a member of the public, who found the body, informed the area assistant chief. The girl was in her school uniform. NGO based in Meru, including Ripples International and CREAW, have joined in seeking justice for the standard four pupil. Click here for the latest political news
