Just how much does the ordinary Kenyan know about the decisions of the government and their implications on their lives? Little, going by recent indications. Yet the Constitution mandates the government to inform citizens about all decisions and actions that will impact their lives. Whereas the Kenya Gazette is used to publish bills, notices and laws for the information of the public, it is inaccessible to many Kenyans who are ignorant about almost every important decision being taken on their behalf by both the Legislature and Executive. The government still treats its dealings with foreign governments, including loan agreements and commitments it enters, as confidential information. Only the curious elite who can read the fine print know what our debt obligations are. The details are hidden in annual budget estimates and go unnoticed even by MPs who are supposed to be the eyes and custodians of the public interest. As the recent debate on taxation has shown, MPs are also hapless in the face of a bullying Executive. Despite protestations, the Executive still rammed through the taxes it wanted in a farcical vote marked by intrigues. Notably, the MPs had protected their interests and their wailing was but crocodile tears. Now, the reality of the government’s excessive borrowing and taxation has begun to hit mwananchi hard. As the budget process for 2019-20 begins, it is time for the public to be more vigilant on how the government plans to raise and spend their money.
