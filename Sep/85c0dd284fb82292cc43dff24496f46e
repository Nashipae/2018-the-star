Cabinet has approved the sale of 900 acres of land belonging to East African Portland Cement Company to Kenya Railway for Standard Gauge Railway and building of a new Inland Container Depot. The struggling cement maker has been planning to sell part of its 16,000 acre idle land to raise Sh15 billion, a decision currently under the mercy of the courts. The funds are aimed at paying the firm’s debts including Sh1.4 billion owed to more than 400 workers covered under the 2013-2015 collective bargaining agreement as well as investment in new plants and upgrading the existing factory. “Since they are both government entities, an exchange has been agreed on and I want to assure all employees claiming money from the Company that their dues will be paid since the solution reached will help the Company make money for these payments as well as sort out other urgent financial needs,” Industry Cabinet secretary Peter Munya said during his visit to EAPCC. He assured former employees whose contracts had not been renewed and those whose dues had been granted by the court that they would be paid in due course. Last month the CBA was the subject of a dispute before the Labour Court and the Court of Appeal with the Kenya Chemical and Allied Workers Union having obtained the services of an auctioneer, to start attaching EAPCC property. EAPCC managing director Peter ole Nkeri said the proposed bailout plan is under is awaiting the court’s verdict. “We have all our land titles intact in the bank. They are under lock and key and those claiming share of Portland land assets need to understand this,” said Nkeri. The cash strapped firm’s majority shareholders are the National Social Security Fund, National Treasury and French cement and construction firm Lafarge.
