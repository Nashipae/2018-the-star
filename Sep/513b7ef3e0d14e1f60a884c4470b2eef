Kisii county faces a shortage of at least 56 million litres of milk. The county produces 222.5 million litres annually but
dairy farmers last year only managed 166 million litres, Deputy Governor
Joash Maangi said on Friday. “I am encouraging
farmers to venture into dairy farmers because what we are currently producing
is not enough. There us a deficit of millions of litres per annum,” he
said. Maangi spoke at the Agricultural Training College, where he distributed
cheques for Sh10.1 million to dairy farmers' groups. The money was a grant
from the IFAD, through the national government, aimed at improving the
dairy sector. It was channeled
through Smallholders Dairy Commercialisation Programme. The farmers' groups were invited to present proposals and the money was awarded to those with the best ideas. In
2016-17 the farmers received Sh16.8 million and Sh18 million in
2017-18. Maangi said farmers would generate Sh10.8 billion per year if they hit the target 222.5 million litres. He blamed the shortage on rising population in urban centres. Maangi, who was flanked with Agriculture executive Esman Onsarigo and director of Livestock Production
Johnstone Ndege, said the government will do all it can to
support the farmers' ventures. He said the
dairy sector employees 100,000 people and thus cannot be
ignored. “More than 200,000
people earn their daily bread from the dairy sector directly or indirectly,” Maangi said. The farmers
raised concerns over the shortage of extension officers who they
said play a critical role in advising them. Onsarigo admitted that there is a shortage but said that they will
soon embrace E-extension to enable farmers make calls for free to get services. Ndege said the county has 172,000 dairy cattle. He said the administration is looking for more dairy markets.
