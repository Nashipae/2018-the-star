Nyandarua Woman Representative Faith Gitau has decried increased carjackings targetting businessmen in the county for the past few months. She raised the concern during the burial of a prominent businessman John Mwaura who was murdered while delivering milk to Nairobi from Kinangop. Mwaura, popularly known as Good Man, was on his way to Nairobi to deliver milk when he was attacked by unknown people and murdered in cold blood. Gitau said the trend was worrying adding that no arrests are being made despite the killing of innocent Kenyans by criminals. She said that the trader's body was later found at City mortuary after ten days of agony and search by family members. The milkman's lorry is yet to be found even as the area leaders blamed police laxity in investigating the matter. "The incident was shocking. Many more businessmen from this area have been carjacked and their cargo stolen but no action taken," Gitau said. She promised to take the matter to Parliament and have the incident investigated so as the killers are brought to book. Click here for the latest political news
