Ongoing efforts to
restore the Mau Forest will not stop until the lost cover
is recovered, Water CS Simon Chelugui has said. “The efforts, which include resettlement of settlers in
alternative areas, will continue until forest boundaries
previously defined as Mau Complex, particularly the
gazetted forests, are recovered,” the CS said. Chelugui
spoke on Saturday at Kilgoris DEB Primary School during
celebrations to mark the seventh edition of Mara Day
Celebrations.
The celebrations were dominated by calls to protect
Mau Forest and other water towers. The event is held in
Kenya and Tanzania to celebrate progress being made
to sustainably manage the water resources of the Mara
River Basin. “We must do something as well with the
previously forested sections of the trust lands. The idea
is to ultimately ensure a predictable flow in all the rivers
that emanate from the Mau water tower,” Chelugui said. He said all water towers will be protected, conserved
and preserved. Chelugui also said the Mara Basin, which
forms part of the greater Mau Complex, is currently
under rehabilitation.
