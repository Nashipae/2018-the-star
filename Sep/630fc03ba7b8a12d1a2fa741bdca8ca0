Two students from Karima Girls High School in Kinangop, Nyandarua county, have been arrested in connection with a fire that burnt a dormitory on Saturday. The Form II students were yesterday held at Engineer police station. About 200 students spent the night in the cold following the fire incident. No student was injured. The national school is located a few kilometers from Ndunyu Njeru town near Kinangop. Nothing was salvaged during the fire. The burnt dormitory hosts Form IV students.

He said they only managed to prevent the fire from spreading to nearby dormitories. “The students were in class when the fire broke out. We managed put it out after three hours but the damage had been done,” Kimani said. A police source told the Star the students are believed to have played a major role in the fire. He said the suspects will face charges of arson. “We questioned several students during which the names of the two suspects were adversely mentioned,” the officer said.
