Kenyan King of Dancehall Redsan is set to launch his 17-track brand new album titled ‘The Baddest’ on September 15 at the Carnivore Grounds. Touted as the biggest album launch this year, the concert will feature Jamaican Dancehall artiste Demarco and special performances by Nigerian pop diva Tiwa Savage and Kenyan hip hop giant Khaligraph Jones. Ahead of the launch, Redsan says, “I am bringing my long-term friend Demarco, who I have also collaborated with in the album, as the event’s main feature. I have also worked with Khaligraph before and we happen to share a similar vision. His dream to take Kenyan music to the world is the same as mine from 24 years ago, when I started my career.” Adding on the reigning Nigerian Pop Queen: “Tiwa Savage was an easy choice for me because she is one of the ladies I really admire in the Afro Beats scene, and plans to work with her are already underway.”
