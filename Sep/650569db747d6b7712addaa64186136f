Chief Justice David Maraga and President Uhuru Kenyatta could have to meet to prevent possible disruption of operations at the Judicial Service Commission. According to the Judicial Service Act, 2011, the quorum for a JSC meeting is six commissioners. Its subcommittees have to attain a quorum of at least three members whenever they convene. Reports indicate Maraga will lead other JSC officials in meeting the President at State House this week to iron the tug-of-war between the two arms of government. Read: JSC nominees to wait longer for swearing-in Yesterday, acting director of Public Affairs and Communication at the Judiciary Catherine Wambui said formal communication will be issued on whether such a meeting will take place. “I’d rather you wait for official statement, instead of having different versions,” she said. Currently, the commission comprises Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu, Maraga, Emily Ominde (Magistrate’s Court), Justice Aggrey Muchelule (High Court) and lawyers Tom Ojienda and Mercy Deche representing the Law Society of Kenya. Mwilu is under probe for allegations of graft. Former National Assembly clerk Patrick Gichohi, former Kenyatta University VC Olive Mugenda and former Agriculture CS Felix Koskei have yet to be sworn in by the CJ despite having been approved by Parliament and gazetted. They were vetted by the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee on February 21 and approved on February 27. Attorney General Paul Kihara was to take over automatically from his predecessor Githu Muigai in the commission but has not been sworn in. Maraga declined to swear them in after Uhuru refused to gazette Justice Mohamed Warsame (Appeal Court). Click
