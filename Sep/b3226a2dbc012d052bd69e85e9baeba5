Ebola prevention activities have been suspended in the Democratic Republic of Congo city of Beni after a deadly rebel attack. Treatment centres will stay open but vaccinations and the tracing of people who have been in contact with suspected Ebola patients have stopped for now. One hundred people have died in the current outbreak in the east of the country, the health ministry says. It began in July and is the 10th to hit the country since 1976. The rebel attack in Beni started on Saturday afternoon and lasted for several hours. Eighteen people died including 14 civilians, the army says. Local sources say the Allied Democratic Forces, a Ugandan Islamist militant group active in the area since the 1990s, was behind the attack, but this has not been confirmed.
