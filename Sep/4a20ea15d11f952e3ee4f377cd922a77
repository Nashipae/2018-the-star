Four people died on Saturday in Mt Elgon, Bungoma, after allegedly consuming poisonous mushroom soup. The three, one reportedly a Ugandan, are all relatives from Chepkube village in Cheptais subcounty. A resident identified the Ugandan as Hezron Namusigae. They picked mushroom that grows on decayed trees from Mt Elgon Forest. The mushroom soup was served with Ugali. The victims are Elizabeth Samboror, her nine-month-old daughter Sarah Chemutai, her mother-in-law Beatrice Kirong and Namusigae. They had headache and stomach complaints. The four are also said to have had diarrhoea and vomited. The deceased might have consumed a poisonous species of mushroom known as amanita, which contains a toxic substance which leads to liver and kidney collapse, causing death.
