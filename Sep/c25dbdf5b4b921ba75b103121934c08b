An agency wants witnesses in the murder of university student Sharon Otieno to be protected. The Witness Protection Agency asked the media to protect the identities to ensure proper investigations. It argues that public exposure of confidential information will put the witnesses and their families at risk. The agency says it will play its role of offering protection services, when sought, as mandated in the Witness Protection Act 2006. Witnesses were also advised to seek protection in case they fear to report to police. Fears are rife that witnesses might be compromised into the murder. Sharon was abducted together with Nation journalist Barrack Oduor on Monday last week. Oduor escaped from his abductors by jumping off a moving car. The university student's body was found near Kodera. An autopsy revealed that the Rongo University student, who was seven months pregnant died of excessive bleeding. Sharon's family implicated Migori governor Okoth Obado. However, the governor has denied any wrong going. His personal assistant Michael Oyamo was arrested over the murder. Oyamo and former Kanyadoto MCA Lawrence Mula on Monday appeared in a in Homa Bay over the death of of the student. Oyamo is expected to take plea on Tuesday. Senior resident magistrate Lester Simiyu directed that he appears in the court at 9 am. She said it would be a violation of the suspect's rights should he continue being in custody since his arrest on Tuesday last week. Simiyu granted the state 24 hours to hold the suspect and draw charges against Oyamo for him to take the plea.
