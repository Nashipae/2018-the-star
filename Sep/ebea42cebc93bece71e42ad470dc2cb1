The Nairobi county will renovate the historic Kamukunji grounds, Governor Mike Sonko has said. Sonko on Saturday said the grounds will be given a major facelift to enable sporting activities to take place. Speaking during the Nairobi monthly clean-up day at the grounds, Sonko directed County Secretary Peter Kariuki, Finance CEC Allan Igambi and his Environment counterpart Larry Wambua to ensure funds are allocated for the renovation. “I want the renovation of Kamukunji grounds to include installation of recreational facilities. This must be done to give the youth in this area a chance to discover their talents. As we wait for the renovation, my government will fence off the grounds to keep off land grabbers who are eyeing the land,” Sonko  said.

Sonko also ordered for the demolition of a wall at Burma Market which is said to have been erected by a private developer. “Over the last three months, we have taken our monthly clean-up campaign to every ward in Nairobi, by decentralizing the initiative. Under the slogan ‘my waste, my responsibility’, members of my government every month join resident associations and elected leaders to clean up the city,” he said. The Governor took part in the clean-up exercise at, Mihang’o, Muthurwa market and Kamukunji before making his final address at the historic grounds. Click here for the latest political news
