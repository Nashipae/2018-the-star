A contractor has repairedÂ a gaping hole on the Port Reitz-Moi International Airport access road. The Sh5.2 billion road has been in use for less than a year. Part of road caved in last Sunday, causing residents to raise questions about quality. The road, co-funded by the British government through Trademark East Africa and the Kenyan government, was officially opened by President Uhuru last year. On Thursday, Kenya National Highway Authority (KeNHA) Coast regional direct Jared Makori said underground water had caused the collapse of the road built by Chinese contractor China Wu Yi. Makori said no extra cost was incurred as the road is still under defect liability period. "The road is still under observation for two years, anything happening on it will be repaired by the contractor," he said. Click here for the latest political news
