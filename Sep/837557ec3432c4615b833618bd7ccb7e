The Independence party Kanu has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to end looting and wastage of public funds instead of increasing taxes. Secretary general Nick Salat yesterday said top government officials were hoarding millions of dollars in their houses. The party spoke just a day after Uhuru and Opposition chief Raila Odinga whipped their troops to support the controversial eight per cent taxation on petroleum products. Kanu said it remains opposed to the tax. “We are opposed to any further taxation when some people are still carrying money in bags and walking scot-free. Some people are giving unexplained millions in fundraisers. In fact, Kenya does not need the World Bank because people have established the world bank in their houses,” Salat said.

Its not clear weather the Jubilee politician or his aide are under probe. Salat said he has come face-to-face with the suffering of many Kenyans and said the eight per cent taxation on petroleum products will completely make life unaffordable. “We have to find away to ensure everybody’s necessities are affordable. Many Kenyans are already crying they cant feed their children,” Salat said. The former lawmaker said crime is likely to increase as the poor will target the rich to make ends meet. “In the end, we will be forced to divert more resources to security in order to fight crime,” he said. The anti-taxation stance by Kanu presents the opposition Uhuru is likely to face in Parliament when the matter comes up for voting in the National Assembly. Last week, Uhuru proposed a reduction of the VAT from 16 per cent to 8 per cent following uproar. Read: Week of reckoning as MPs decide whether to back Uhuru VAT proposal Click here for
