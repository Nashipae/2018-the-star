Migori leaders have accused DP William Ruto of visiting to launch “fake projects” and driving a wedge between communities. Last Friday, Ruto toured the Kuria region in what critics say was vote-hunt for 2022 his presidential bid, but disguised as development tour. Ntimaru East MCA Mwera Mwise said residents expected much more than launching CDF projects and attending harambees. “Launching a police station was good, but we needed new roads, especially the completion of Taranganya-Ntimaru-Angata Barakoi-Lolgorian road as Jubilee promised us in the campaigns,” he said. On Tuesday, Migori woman representative Pamela Odhiambo (pictured) and Suna West MP Peter Masara said Ruto is hellbent on causing animosity through his frequent visits to one part of the county.
