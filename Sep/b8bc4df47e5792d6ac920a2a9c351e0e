Nairobi county secretary Peter Kariuki was arrested on Tuesday but later released unconditionally. Kariuki was arrested for disobeying court orders issued against the County by Justice John Mativo. He was taken to the holding cell at the Milimani law court and later arraigned before Justice Chacha Mwita. Confusion, however, emerged in the courtroom when the police officer who was guarding him told the court that he was not the one who arrested him. The officer said he found the suspect in the cells but did not know who arrested him. In December last year, Justice George Odunga issued a warrant of arrest against the County Secretary for disobeying orders that directed City Hall to pay a firm for services it rendered to the county. Proland Limited are seeking payment for services it gave to the county in the case filed in 2009. Lawyers representing Proland Ltd told the court that Kariuki's arrest followed the execution of the warrant issued by Justice Odunga. Kariuki's lawyers, however, said their client was not arrested but heÂ presented himself at the Central police station Tuesday morning.
