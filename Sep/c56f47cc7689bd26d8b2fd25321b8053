Likuyani MP Enoch Kibunguchy has said police are doing little to trace the killers of his driver, Douglas Wamakacha, three weeks ago. “The police have recorded statements from many people but made no arrests so far. When I ask they tell me they are awaiting forensics results and records from Safaricom. But I feel they have rested the case,” he said. Wamakacha was shot dead by unknown attackers on August 12. A week later, a gun drama ensued during his burial at Matunda village in Trans Nzoia county. Gunmen  opened fire and injured five people.
