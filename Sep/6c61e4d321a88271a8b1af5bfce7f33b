A pastor who raped a 17-year-old girl in Mwingi West has been granted a Sh200,000 bond. Steve Masila appeared in a Mwingi law court yesterday. The girl got pregnant and the court ordered a DNA test. The results showed Masila is the father. He is accused of raping the girl last year in church. She had gone on a Saturday afternoon to clean the rooms ahead of Sunday service. After the ordeal, the girl did not report Masila. She said he threatened her. When she had the baby, the girl told her mother Masila had raped her. When confronted, the pastor allegedly told the woman and her daughter they would die for accusing a man of God of rape. Masila, a pastor at Arising Christian Ministries, Nzawa, appeared before senior resident magistrate Grace Kirugumi. The case will be heard on Tuesday next week. Masila was excommunicated by Nzawa residents for his behaviour and threatening the community. He has been taken to Waita prison.
