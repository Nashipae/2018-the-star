The government has gazetted the Koitalel Samoei University College in Nandi which is to be developed at a cost of more than Sh 1.5 Billion. Nandi Governor Stephen Sang has welcomed the gazettement of the college named after the Nandi legendary leader Koitalel Samoei. Koitalel was the supreme chief of the Nandi and is revered all over Kalenjin land. Sang said the institution would have its main campus in Nandi Hills town. “The struggle for residents of the region to have an institution of higher education established in Nandi Hills and named after Koitalel has taken long but finally it is coming to fruition,” said Governor Sang in a statement. The County boss thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto for fulfilling their pledge to ensure the university is established to help grow quality university education in the region. The university college will start off as a constituent of the University of Nairobi. The college will also establish a sports academy to serve the region which is popularly known as the Source of Champions in athletics. President Uhuru laid the foundation stone of the University a year ago at the spot where Koitalel was killed in 1905. Click here for the latest political news
