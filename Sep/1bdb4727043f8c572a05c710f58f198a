President Uhuru Kenyatta has appointed Lyn Cherop Mengich as the Salaries and Remuneration Commission chairperson. Lyn takes over from current Kenya ambassador to China Sarah Serem, who left the office on December 15, 2017 after six years at the helm. Uhuru also appointed Dalmas Otieno, Leah Mumbua, John Monyoncho, Margaret Sawe, Amani Yuda Komora, Sophie Moturi, and Peris Ashubwe as SRC commissioners. The appointments, according to a September 11 gazette notice released on Thursday, will be effective September 11. The president earlier nominated former Kenya Power CEO Ben Chumo as chairperson before the latter was rejected by MPs owing to an ongoing corruption investigation. When exiting office, the former chair said Kenya's annual wage bill is expected to rise to Sh650 billion by the end of 2018, an issue that the new team is expected to take up. She further reported that for the last six years, SRC managed to develop a remuneration and benefits policy to ensure for fair pay consideration.
