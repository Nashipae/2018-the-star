The Bomet government has rejected claims it will remit Sh200million annually to the newly created regional economic bloc. Bomet is a member of the Lake Region Economic Bloc, which has 13 other member counties. Some residents and leaders had expressed concerns over what they called waste of county funds through unsustainable programmes. But yesterday, Deputy Governor Hillary Barchok said the allegations were “falsified and misleading”. He said the cash is only payable once and not yearly. Barchok said their critics are out to “paint us in bad light”. He defended the decision to remit the cash, which is meant for the establishment of a regional bank to be unveiled during the October 28 summit. Bomet will host the event. Barchok said residents will benefit greatly. “It’s meant to benefit residents of member counties. If it reaches a point we want to pull out of the bloc we’ll be given our money back,” he said. The deputy county chief said governors of the 14 member counties unanimously agreed to raise share capital to open a bank so residents can borrow funds for economic empowerment. “We found this thing having been started. It’s not something thought over and just joined.  The former governor, [Isaac Ruto], alongside other governors in the bloc started it,” Barchok said.
