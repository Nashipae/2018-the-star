Police are looking for a gang that shot and killed a mechanic in Nairobi's Lucky Summer estate in a robbery incident. The mechanic was walking home on Sunday night when three gunmen confronted him, prompting a fight. Police say the gang grabbed an unknown amount of money and other valuables from the victim before shooting him in the chest. He died on the spot. The body of the father of four was moved to the mortuary. Elsewhere, police said two suspected thugs were on Sunday night killed in two separate incidents in Nairobi. Two pistols were recovered from the suspects. The first incident happened in Mathare where a suspect who had been robbing residents was killed. Another suspect was shot dead along Lang'ata Road in a botched robbery. Police say other suspects escaped on motorbikes. Last month, police gunned down two suspected thugs at Kihunguro in Ruiru. Ruiru police boss James Ng’etich said they were part of a four-man gang that robbed an Uber taxi driver of his vehicle in Athi River.
