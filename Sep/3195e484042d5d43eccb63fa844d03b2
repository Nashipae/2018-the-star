Kenya’s Jorum Okombo and Alex Korio will be hoping to improve on their respective second and third finishes when they lead top guns to the 2018 Copenhagen Half Marathon on September 16. Organisers have assembled one of the deepest half marathon fields in history of the road race. “An elite field boasting 17 sub-60-minute men, including three of the four fastest half marathon runners over the past six years, is proof of an extremely high level,” says Jakob Larsen, director of the Danish Athletics Federation. Abraham Cheroben will be back to defend his title, having won last year in a world-leading 58:40. His main opposition looks set to come from Berlin Half Marathon champion Erick Kiptanui, Okombo and Korio. Kiptanui has announced that he will be attacking the world record in Copenhagen. Other top Kenyans lined up include Mangata Ndiwa, Daniel Wanjiru, Edwin Kiptoo, Abraham Kiptum, Morris Munene, James Rungaru, Meshack Koech, Felix Kibitok, Alexander Mutiso, and Leonard Komon while Timothy Ronoh and William Sitonik will be making their debuts. The women’s race also boasts superb depth as it contains seven runners with PBs faster than 68:00. Kenya’s Joan Melly, the fourth-fastest half marathon runner in history, will take on Ethiopia’s Netsanet Gudeta, who won the world half marathon title earlier this year in 1:06:11, a world record in a women-only race. Other Kenyans are Edith Chelimo, Ruth Chepngetich, Mary Wacera, Visiline Jepkesho, Naomi Jebet, Delvine Meringor, Stellah Barsosio, Monicah Ngige, Sylvia Medugu and Lilian Jelagat.
