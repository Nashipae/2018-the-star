A lobby wants the widow of former ICT manager Chris Msando to decline a state appointment as a way of fighting for justice for his murdered husband. The ex-IEBC officer was tortured and slain just days to the August 8 vote. His widow, Eva Buyu, was appointed on Friday to the EPZ Authority Board. Yesterday, the Kenya Independent Candidates said Msando’s killers have not been brought to book and appointing her widow is “laughable and ridiculous”. Chairperson Stephen Owoko said the appointment amounts to bribing Eva so she can forget about what happened. "Msando’s murderers have yet to be arrested.The people allegedly behind his demise are the same ones offering a job to the wife. Let the state clear the air before giving her this job," he said. Eva was among dozens of
Kenyans appointed to parastatals and State Departments in changes
unveiled on Friday. She was named alongside former Mbooni MP Kisoi Munyao, and John Masaba to
be members of the Export Processing Zones Authority board for a period of
three years. The appointments by Trade CS Peter Munya were effective September 20. More on this: Uhuru hands Msando's wife, Raila and Kalonzo allies parastatal jobs Click here for the latest political news
