MCAs in Makueni have denied budgeting Sh500 million for a family planning campaign. Some residents of Makueni took to social media to reject the plan following claims that the drive will be funded by county spearheaded by the MCAs' wives. An uproar greeted photos of Governor Kivutha Kibwana's wife Nazi, Deputy Governor Adelina Mwau, the Speaker's wife Purity Mbilu and MCAs' wives during the launch of the County First Ladies Association in Emali town on Saturday. Majority leader Kyalo Mumo said the assembly approved a five-year strategic plan for family planning and advocacy developed by the Health Department. He said it will be funded by government agencies, international partners and non-state actors. Nazi will head the programme under Shina Foundation, a Non-Governmental Organisation she runs. "The assembly budgeted Sh40 million to support the project and not Sh500 million as alleged," Mumo told reporters in his office on Wednesday. "Without a strategic plan, the programme cannot attract donor funding." MCAs denied that their wives will be part of the implementation team. Health committee chairman Jackson Mbalu said the campaign aims to expand access to family planning services by 2020. The plan was tabled in the county assembly on December 6, 2017, and adopted on June 20, 2018. Click here for the latest political news
