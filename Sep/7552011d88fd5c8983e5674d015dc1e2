The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has submitted 91 files to Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji for action. The anti-graft agency is required to prepare quarterly reports setting out the number of cases made to DPP. Out of the 91 files, 66 were recommended for prosecution. Seven were recommended for administrative action. Of the 66 approved for prosecution, only 15 have been lodged in court. Ten files were returned and the EACC directed to conduct further investigations. The cases range from high profile corruption cases involving billions of shillings, to petty offenders implicated in bribes as low as Sh10, 000. The files also include cases of abuse of office and unethical conduct by civil servants. Haji recommended closure of 18 files. Among the files returned is that of the 13-acre Ruaraka land, where taxpayers risk losing Sh1.5 billion paid as compensation to Afrison Export Import. Afrison is owned by businessman Francis Mburu. The EACC headed by retired Bishop Eliud Wabhukhala has been struggling to protect its turf in the face of incessant calls to have it disbanded for failure. In June, a bill was submitted to the National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi to disband the commission, saying it is a waste of money. The bill, sponsored by Aldai MP Cornelly Serem says the EACC has failed to effectively discharge its role. Related:Â Ruaraka land payout clean, says Swazuri Click here for
