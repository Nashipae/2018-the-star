A Kakamega resident has asked DPP Noordin Haji to order investigation of Masinde Muliro University VC Fred Otieno over professional misconduct. In the letter dated September 12, Amisi Omukanda wants Haji to order DCI George Kinoti to investigate Otieno over alleged abuse of office. Omukanda cited a case where Otieno’s house rent in Mumias was paid by the university, despite him being entitled to a house allowance. Omukanda accused the VC of defying a resolution by the university council in a letter dated December 18, 2017 which asked him to proceed on a two-month leave to pave the way for investigations by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. The agency’s CEO Halakhe Waqo had written to the council seeking Otieno’s suspension. Waqo cited Otieno’s attempts to frustrate investigations through intimidation and arbitrary demotion of staff involved in the probe. Otieno’s term ends on November 30 unless renewed by Education CS.
