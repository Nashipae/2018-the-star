A rights group has organised information forums for residents of 11 counties with minerals to enable them speak with one voice. Kenya Land Alliance on Monday said it will write to the government to advocate the rights of residents where minerals extractions is underway. The NGO’s legal officer David Achero said they have received grievances by communities living in the mining zones. “We’ll write to the Ministry of Mining about the expectations of residents upon the completion of the sensitisation forums on mineral rights,” Achero said. He spoke on Monday during a forum in Matuga, Kwale county. It was attended by residents of Nguluku and Maumba areas who were relocated to Bwiti to pave way for the Base Titanium mining site. The residents said a relocation agreement has not been honoured. Bwiti already had squatters. The government had promised to allocate 5.5 acres to relocated families. Swaleh Mwabakari ,who is among those relocated, asked the government to settle the dispute with the squatters. The squatters have grown hostile after they were left out in the land allocation. “This issue has adversely affected our livelihoods because we cannot invest in a disputed land,” Mwabariki said. “The squatters are furious because we were given title deeds. There is conflict but we have not escalated to war.” Mining PS John Omenge visited Bwiti on August 10. He said the government would set up a committee to resolved the dispute. The commitee was supposed to commence sittings on August 27.
