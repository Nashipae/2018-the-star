Kenya's rate of inflation shot up to 5.71 per cent in September up from 4.04 per cent in August. The rise is as a result of an increase in energy and transport prices signalling a possible effect of the new VAT on fuel products. The country's inflation rate has been below five per cent, which is the government's target, since November last year. The latest data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics shows that the Transport Index rose by 7.99 per cent between August and September. This also translated to a 17.29 per cent increase compared to September 2017. Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas and other fuels rose by 0.47 per cent in September compared to August and by 17.44 per cent compared to last year. This was due to increase in prices of some foodstuffs outweighing decreases recorded in respect of others, Director general James Gatungu said. Kenya National Bureau of Statistics data showed a kilo of sugar went up from 147.33 in August to 153.29 during the review period. A kilogramme of Irish potatoes rose from Sh73.62 to Sh77.60 while Sukuma wiki shot to Sh 57.03. One kilogramme of beef with bones moved from Sh442.95 to Sh443.21, the price of one kilogramme of carrots decreased from Sh61.19 in August to Sh59.35. Cabbages increased from Sh42.58 to Sh43.53 while a kilo of beans from Sh106.94 to 107.20. During the review period, tomato prices will cost Sh70.55 per kilogramme from  Sh72.88. Two kilogrammes of wheat flour moved from Sh119.04 to Sh120.83.
