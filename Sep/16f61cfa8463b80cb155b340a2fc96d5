Migori Governor Okoth Obado's PA Michael Oyamo and former Kanyadoto MCA Lawrence Mula were on Monday arraigned in Homa Bay over the death of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno. Mula was arrested on Sunday evening after he was allegedly mentioned by Oduor. Homa Bay police commander Marius Tum said Mula was arrested when he went to record a statement with police. "He is detained at Homa Bay police cells and expected to go in court today together with Oyamo," Tum told journalists on Monday. According to Nation Media journalist Barack Oduor who was abducted together with Sharon, it was Mula who introduced him to the late Sharon. On Saturday, Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji said no one linked to Sharon's death will be spared. Haji said any suspect, including Migori governor Okoth Obado, who has been adversely mentioned, will be charged if investigations link him to the murder of the 26-year-old woman. “Investigations are going on, and at the right time when we feel the governor needs to be arrested, that will definitely be done,” he said. He said they will only do so when they have watertight evidence. “No one is above the law, not even the governor. And no one mentioned will be spared,” he added.
