Fourteen trucks mistakenly loaded with water instead of petrol have been recalled by the Kenya Pipeline Company’s plant in Kisumu. Driver Abiud Jafar said he noticed the mistake following a leakage from one of the compartments of his truck. Kisumu Depot manager Herman Munga said all the trucks loaded since morning were recalled and the incident is being investigated. He said they are checking to establish what went wrong. “We have no reports of any truck that offloaded as they have all reported back,” he told the Star on the phone. The manager said the matter has been taken seriously to protect the public. Other products were not affected. Click here for the latest political news
