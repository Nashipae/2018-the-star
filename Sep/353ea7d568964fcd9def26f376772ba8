Bungoma senator Moses Wetang’ula has told opposition leader Raila Odinga not to speak on behalf of Nasa because he had joined the government. Wetang’ula faulted Raila for claiming to speak for Nasa and asked him to concentrate on his ODM party. “He should speak for ODM because Nasa has its summit body, which has not met to make any decisions that Raila speaks for us,” Wetang’ula said. He said Nasa leaders, including Musalia Mudavadi and Kalonzo Musyoka, have not and were unlikely to meet soon to discuss the future of the coalition. The Bungoma senator, speaking in Eldoret, faulted Raila’s remarks to the effect that the opposition had agreed to back President Uhuru Kenyatta on the eight per cent VAT on fuel ,yet the parties had not made such a decision. The Ford Kenya leader condemned events in the National Assembly, where chaos broke out as MPs they debated the Finance Bill. He said the chaos were shameful and an embarrassment to the country. “President Kenyatta and Jubilee should do more talking to Kenyans and consulting other leaders instead of forcing their wishes on the people,” Wetang’ula said. He said MPs were representatives of the people and their decisions in Parliament must be respected. Wetang’ula also praised the decision by the Senate to take its deliberations to the people through the ongoing sessions in Eldoret.
