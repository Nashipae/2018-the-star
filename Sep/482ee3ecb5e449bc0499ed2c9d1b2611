Governor Okoth Obado of Migori was yesterday charged with the murder of Sharon Otieno. Nevertheless, Obado can remain in office until he is convicted. The only way a governor can leave office is if he or she is impeached, runs mad or resigns. The MCAs of Migori must urgently ask if Obado is a fit person to be their governor. MCAs can impeach a governor. The Senate then sets up a special committee to accept or reject the impeachment. This is not necessarily sufficient to remove a governor. Governor Martin Wambora of Embu survived impeachment in 2015 after he successfully argued in court that the process in the county was flawed. Perhaps it is time to tighten up the ethics rule for governors. They are innocent until proven guilty and don’t have to stand aside until proven guilty. But the law should be amended so that governors must automatically stand aside, leaving the Deputy as Acting Governor, if they are charged with a capital offence — murder, treason or armed robbery.
