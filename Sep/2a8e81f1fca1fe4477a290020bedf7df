Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania have agreed to fast-track implementation of the Multinational Lake Victoria Maritime Communications and Transport project to reduce accidents in Lake Victoria. Lake Victoria Basin Commission executive secretary Ally-Said Matano said principal and permanent secretaries from the three countries met early this month in Kisumu and agreed to fast-track the review of the technical aspects prior to the construction of the Regional Maritime Rescue and Coordination Centres. The centers will be constructed in Mwanza, Tanzania, and sub-centres in Entebbe, Uganda, and Kisumu. The project is funded through a $25 million (Sh2.5 billon) loan from the African Development Bank. “The meeting resolved and constituted a team of experts from the three countries to review and provide technical feedback specifically on the designs and bill of quantities for the construction of Maritime Rescue and Coordination Centres,” Matano said. The project implementation was to start in May but the the delay has put the three countries on the spot as hundreds of people die in the lake.
