Muhuri, one of the most distinguished and effective NGOs in Kenya, celebrated its 21 anniversary on Friday last week in Mombasa. This coincided with the International Day of Peace, giving the platform to the youth. Ironically, as the world was celebrating peace, our police were doing the opposite. Their harassment of a young woman seeking help led to her death. In addition, the police and the GSU were accused of arbitrarily arresting and torturing locals, ignoring basic procedures of criminal investigation, and complacency in responding to attacks. Moreover, alleged interference from “above” is said to have prevented the police from seriously investigating several politicians, whose names were mentioned in connection with the violence. Their actions were completely outside the sphere of the law. Muhuri was established by Muslim coastal activists, as Muslims were the principal victims of state brutality. But their responsibility extended beyond Muslims: their title is Muslims for Human Rights, not Rights of Muslims. It was an excellent example of solidarity that some years later we tried to make the basis of a new constitution.

Since its inception, Muhuri has played a critical role in protecting people’s rights, a form of self-reliance since their enemies were officers of the state. Maintaining the rule of law became one of its leading tasks. The rights group has over the years responded to the changing circumstances. It became active politically from 2005 and fought for a fair and human-oriented political system. Muhuri has responded to the needs of the time through various policies. The protection of Muslims remains a major issue but there are others as well, such as the environment, political and economic reforms. A particular concern, common with other organisations, is human rights. At inception, Muhuri’s objectives included promoting human rights awareness and growth of a human rights culture; empower individuals and communities to advocate and mobilise for their inherent rights in all spheres of life; empower people and finding avenues of moving them to the centre of the struggle for a democratic and human rights culture, and promoting awareness on gender issues and equality. In recent years, Muhuri has demanded accountability for violence against, and indeed killing of, Muslim youth. The government harasses Muhuri on the pretext that it is prompting young Muslims to violence. What the government does not realise is that it is sustaining the threat of terrorism by alienating communities that provide a fertile ground for radicalisation and the so-called ‘self-defence’ among youths. It is antagonising locals through the war on terror, police brutality, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and execution of returnees who have surrendered to government agencies. Muhuri is not only about the human rights of Muslims; it is about the rights of all Kenyans, as their work, which includes litigation, shows. I suspect that on the pretext that Muhuri is an Islamic organisation, it has been subjected to greater harassment than most NGOs. For a period it was banned and its assets confiscated, without an iota of violation of the law, as the judiciary discovered. The harassment of Muhuri was obvious. Justice Emulu, in dismissing charges including from the Inspector General, said citizens (the ruled) and the rulers or governors are subject to the constitution and the rule of law. He said the fight against terrorism must be conducted in strict adherence to the letter and spirit of the constitution, and the law was made for man, and not man for law”. Read: Stop repressing civil societies in Kenya, HRW tells government STATUS OF NGOs This decision and several others (some involving Katiba Institute), which aim to disable or at least harass an NGO without the least bit of evidence or law, often remind me of my proposal as chair of the CKRC. I proposed that our new constitution recognise civil societies of the kind we call here NGOs, by giving them a constitutional status with which they should be free to conduct their work. They should not be subject to petty officers, as several NGOs (including Muhiri and Katiba Institute) have experienced in recent months, sometimes informing them of charges well after the media have been told and shortly before we have to go the state office. My inspiration for a constitutional recognition of NGOs came from my study of the constitution of the Philippines after the overthrow of its long-time dictator, Ferdinand Marcos. In fact, by chance, I was in Manila and was allowed to observe the proceeding of the Constituent Assembly when it adopted the chapter on civil society organisations, which had played the principal rule in overthrowing Marcos. In Kenya, too, civil society organisations, led among others by Willy Mutunga, were instrumental in the fight for a democratic constitution, which we adopted in 2010. Unfortunately my proposal was knocked out in Bomas without a proper discussion. The lack of a constitutional status (after following appropriate rules) has opened NGOs to considerable inconvenience, if not dissolution.

Muhuri has been one of the strongest champions of human rights. Perhaps it is thanks to its lobbying for human rights that the CKRC/Bomas draft provided such an extensive and strong Bill of Rights, one many experts rate as the best in the world. It is not merely, as our previous constitutions, a list of human rights. The constitution provides the rationale for human rights, defines the duties of state institutions to promote human rights, the rules for the (liberal) interpretation of human rights by the judiciary and other state institutions and indeed the public. The range of human and group rights is enormous. While there is wide respect for human rights, the government, particularly President Uhuru Kenyatta, has shown what amounts to contempt and disregard for rights. Many cases on human rights are due to his obstinacy and intolerance. Perhaps it is because of the orientation of Muhuri and Katiba Institute towards human rights that they have found themselves in courts — with good results. DISCUSSIONS IN MOMBASA The 21st anniversary came at a moment when there is much commotion and anxiety among Kenyans — handshake and all that. Participants came from various parts of Kenya and had differing interests in the state of the nation, but largely agreed on their broad outlook of pessimism. They cited acute inequality, a dangerous police force (though some police members were present and welcome), a declining economy, and continued corruption among politicians, public servants and the business community. Attention turned to the constitution — how far is our failure as a people and a nation (and to meet our promises to women and children) due to weaknesses in it. Lack of respect for the constitution by national and most county governments was noted as a major cause of our crises. Politicians showed little interest in the welfare of the people, merely their own greed. The great contempt of politicians, particularly of this government, was evident when news broke of how the state had managed to push through the vote for the much-criticised tax legislation. It was done through pure deceit, with the assistance of the speaker and its chief spokesperson. Many, for the above reasons, thought we have not really fully used the possibilities of the constitution. People should analyse it to understand the authority it gives them. Otherwise, the constitution would be eroded. I drew attention to the deliberations of Dialogue Reference Group, a largely religious group and some civil society members, for an assessment of the practice and record of the government. Its report, which is worth reading, constituted a huge condemnation of the government. More on this: Fazul bans Kura Yangu, We The People over Sh36m from Soros Foundation I entirely agreed with its critique of the government for its obvious telling of lies and unwillingness to make any real change. There are seven major themes, all critical of the government: economic recovery, corruption, constitutional and legal reforms, electoral reform, security reforms, strengthening devolution, and national cohesion (which I would have put first). I agreed with a substantial part of its analysis, but not its proposal for amending the constitution. It is somewhat naÃ¯ve, following naÃ¯ve but self-centred politicians. The constitution does need amendments, but of a different kind than effectively some politicians have cooked up. My concluding points were that the issues identified by the Reference Group were important but the approach we need is broader. A real challenge is to the civil society, primarily through its NGOs, as a nationwide enterprise. The civil society has to meet and discuss the problems faced and strategies needed, and co-operate across the country. I believe we are entering a period when the civil society has to play a key role, in conjunction with its various organisations. Joint action by them is critical. Here is yet another of many challenges that Muhiri has faced over 21 years, and has won. Also read: ODM condemns NGOs crackdown, blames 'dictatorial' Jubilee Click here for the latest political news
