The Assets Recovery Agency has filed a fresh application seeking an extension of orders that froze the accounts of former Youth Affairs PS Lilian Mbogo and 11 others over the NYS Scandal. ARA’s senior state counsel Jeniffer Gitari says owing to the huge number of suspects totaling to about 52, the agency has not been able to complete its investigations within the last 90 days granted by the chief magistrates criminal court thus the need for an extension. She explains that following the arrest and arraignment of senior officials of the National Youth Service, the institution had administrative challenges and therefore retrieving the documents for investigation was difficult hence the delay in the investigations of the case. The Investigations concerns funds that were fraudulently stolen from the NYS, with a view of recovering proceeds of crime against the listed 11 bank accounts held at the Equity Bank limited.
