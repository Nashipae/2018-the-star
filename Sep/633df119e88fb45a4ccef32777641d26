The National Police Service Commission has started educating officers on the new reforms. Commission chairman Johnston Kavuludi on Wednesday said officers will get information on promotions and moving upward in ranks. He spoke at the Red Cross Hall in Kanduyi constituency, where he addressed officers from Bungoma, Busia, Trans Nzoia and West Pokot. “Since the force was established in Kenya there has never been an organised way for officers to know how they are to rise in the ranks,” Kavuludi said. He added that the education will help them adapt to the reforms. They will be allowed back to school to qualify for promotions. The process has been established by the NPS and was commissioned by President Uhuru Kenyatta in February, but most of the officers do not understand the process. “We are talking to our officers about regulations being used by NPS on officers’ discipline, transfers and how they are to be assigned duties.” Kavuludi said the regulations will be in line with plans recently announced by the President on how the officers will be assigned work. The chairman denied speculation that the reforms will see some officers lose jobs. “No officer will be sacked. The only new thing is that we shall have leadership that will not lead to a clash in giving commands,” Kavuludi said. He said in the past, the force had three commanders.
