The vehicle was on Thursday dusted by forensic experts. Her fiancé Joe Irungu, who has been in custody since his arrest on Tuesday, is being held as the key suspect in the murder. Investigations revealed that he was the one driving Maribe’s Toyota Allion on the night of Monica’s murder. Irungu has since denied involvement in the gruesome murder. He told the police he was shot on his chest by thugs he believes may have committed the heinous crime. Kinoti, however, said investigations indicated that Irungu's gunshot wound was self-inflicted, pointing to a possible suicide attempt. On Saturday, the detectives working on the case said they had made major progress in their investigations after conducting a search at Maribe's apartment in Lang'ata. The detectives also arrested Brian Kasaine, a man believed to be the owner of a gun found in Irungu's possession. Monica’s lifeless body was found by her sister who came visiting in a bathtub in her Kilimani apartment with her throat slit.
