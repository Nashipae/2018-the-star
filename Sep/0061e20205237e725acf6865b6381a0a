Kenya is not ready for a woman President, even though giant strides have been made towards accepting women leadership in the country, Youth and Gender CS Margaret Kobia said yesterday. She said, however, the country is ready for women leadership in general. “That is for Kenyans to decide,” the CS said when asked if Kenya is ready for woman President. Kobia said it is not ‘as simple as it looks’ for Kenya to have a woman President. “There are social-cultural inhibitors preventing women from rising to that position. It is a journey and I’m sure one time Kenya will have a woman President. Why not?” she said.
