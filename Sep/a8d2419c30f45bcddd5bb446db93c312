Pressure continues to mount on the Director of Criminal Investigations to arrest the main suspects in the gruesome murder of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno. Politicians, civil society groups and activists want the culprits charged. Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi asked DCI George Kinoti and DPP Noordin Haji to give the case priority. In a video that has gone viral on social media, he wants police to investigate a governor named as a person of interest. He told Kenyans not to shy away from pushing for justice for Sharon. Homa Bay woman representative Gladys Wanga, Migori woman representative Pamela Odhiambo and nominated Senator Rose Nyamunga asked the government to go for the main suspect too.

If indeed it is true, this is shameful and unacceptable,” Odhiambo said. The Federation of the Women Lawyers chairperson Josephine Mong’are appealed to Kenyans to stop speculations. "The life of Sharon must be avenged through prosecution by authorities," Mong'are said. "Social media has already crucified her. No one should have taken her life, no matter what she might have committed. Life is an inalienable right as we say in law. It was a double murder and someone must be held to account.” Sharon's body was found near Kodera Forest on Wednesday. She was kidnapped on Monday together with Nation journalist Barrack Oduor from a hotel in Rongo. The journalist, however, managed to escape by jumping out of a moving vehicle. Oduor told reporters that they were lured into the abduction by Governor Obado’s personal assistant Michael Oyamo who is currently in custody. Oyamo will appear in court on Monday. An autopsy revealed the student died of excessive bleeding after being stabbed eight times, strangled and raped. Click here for the latest political news
