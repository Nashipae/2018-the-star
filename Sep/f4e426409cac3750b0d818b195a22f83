At least 12 Nairobi MCAs have sued the anti-corruption agency seeking to block investigations against their conduct. They are Anthony Karanja, Peter Imwatok, Elias Okumu, Ibrahim Hassan, Leah Supuka, Peter Wahinya and Sudan Kavaya. Others are Laura Mwololo, Mary Njambi, Nancy Muthami, Doris Ngoyo and Ruth Maingi. The lot was summoned by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to record statements over the chaotic impeachment proceedings against speaker Beatrice Elachi on September 10. "The County Assemblies Powers and Privileges Act forbids questioning of proceedings or decisions of the county assembly," the MCAs say. It also forbids criminal and civil cases against MCAs touching on anything they say in the assembly. Through lawyer Tom Ojienda, the ward representatives are asking the court to intervene and issue a temporary order stopping the EACC from investigating them. Also sought is an order to quash summonses already issued by the Commission. The agency summoned the MCAs on Wednesday following the dramatic attempt to eject the speaker from her office.
