A case on nude photos being posted on social media did not kick off at a Garissa court yesterday. A man from Madogo, Tana River, is accused of posting photos of his wife. They have three children. The case did not proceed as the DPP said the charge sheet had defects. The man runs a private chemist in Madogo. He allegedly committed the offence between August 25-31. The prosecutor said the charge sheet lacked details of crucial evidence to sustain the case. “The investigating officer should prove that the number that posted the pictures belongs to the accused and that the mobile phone service provider should issue a certificate to prove it.” The file has been returned to the investigating officer with footnotes of gaps noted. Addressing the press outside the court, Mohamed Dabaso, a Madogo volunteer activist, accused the investigating officer of delaying the case deliberately. Dabaso said a senior administration officer in Madogo, who presented the accused to the DCI’s office on Friday,helped to bail him out and is also trying to influence the case. “This officer and close family members have delayed the case. It was after we involved the media that the police started taking action,” Dabaso said. “The defects in the charge sheet and delay in presenting the case before court is deliberate and part of a wider scheme to deny the woman justice.” He urged the office of the DPP to follow up the case to its conclusion. “I also urge human rights activist and women leaders from Tana River to come out and put pressure on the police to hasten investigation. We demand a water tight case,” Dabaso said. “The police have all the evidence to convict the accused.” The woman’s relative said she is traumatised and cries all the time.
