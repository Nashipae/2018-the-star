Child refugees need to be included in the national education systems of their host countries, a recent report says. The report, ‘Turn the tide: Refugee education in crisis’, released in Nairobi last Friday, says there are currently four million refugee children who are out of school. The report calls on host governments to eliminate barriers that block access to education, such as requirements for birth and school certificates. “We cannot build a future by shunting refugee children into a parallel system of schooling that relies on outdated materials, makeshift classrooms or untrained teachers. We cannot improvise an education and imagine that this is good enough,” the report says.

Deaths from diarrhoea, for example, the third-most frequent cause of child mortality, would be reduced by eight per cent if all mothers completed primary education, or by 30 per cent if they had secondary education, the report says. It gives an example of Rihanna, 12, as one of the many students in Kakuma refugee camp, in northern Kenya. When she was nine, she and her younger sister, Ikra, were separated from their parents during their family’s journey to escape violence and persecution at home. She was enrolled in primary school, despite being overage, thanks to Educate A Child – a global programme of the Education Above All Foundation. The programme helps with teacher training, school infrastructure and equipment, innovative ways to make sure children can attend school. Today, more than 80,000 refugee children are enrolled in school in Kakuma refugee camp. The report calls on the donors to commit to predictable funding from the emergency phase onwards so that no refugee is excluded from schooling due to lack of funds. Click here for
