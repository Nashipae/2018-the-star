Kisumu senator Fred Outa wants Governor Anyang' Nyong’o to seal corruption loopholes. Outa said cartels are syphoning cash meant for development. He the county does not meet its revenue targets because corrupt officers are pocketing collections. Kisumu has introduced a cashless collection system so as to reach its Sh5 billion annual revenue target. The county has been struggling to collect Sh1 billion annually for five years. Outa said the thorny issue of boda bodas' taxation can only be implemented if the money is collected through sacco offices. Boda boda riders are required to pay Sh20 to the county daily. The riders have not been paying taxes since the inception of devolution. Outa spoke at Kolweny in Nyakach West where he donated two motorbikes to a boda boda group on Friday. He said the sector has at least 48,000 members who can make a major contribution to Kisumu's economy. The senator told riders to join saccos for easier management. Finance CEC Nerry Achar said Strathmore University and Cooperative Bank have been contracted to collect county revenue after River Bank’s contract expired. Kisumu has inadequate revenue collection officers, resulting in low collections. The county plans to recruit 500 new enforcement and revenue officers. Click here for the latest political news
