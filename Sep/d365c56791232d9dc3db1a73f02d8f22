Corrupt health workers in Meru who steal drugs or collude with private hospitals to exploit patients will be fired and charged, governor Kiraitu Murungi has said. “There are thieves in the health sector who tell patients there are no drugs in public hospitals or a certain machine is not working,” he said yesterday. “Then they instruct patients to buy drugs or go to their private or a friend’s private facility to enrich themselves. We will have zero tolerance of dishonest and corrupt staff,” he said. Kiraitu said such staff are criminals and he has set up a monitoring unit to expose them. Kiraitu said diseases are the modern-day “colonizer” and pledged to start free health services for residents. He said his administration will visit Makueni and Kitui counties to learn about healthcare programmes enabling residents to get treatment at nominal fees in any county health facility. The governor spoke at the launch of the county’s four-year health strategic and investment plan. He also introduced the Meru county family planning scheme. The county government of Meru has partnered with the German foundation DSW Kenya to improve health services and encourage family planning. DSW Kenya Evelyn Samba urged women and girls to adopt contraceptives. “Whether in school, formal or informal occupations, women are likely to do better in life if they have the benefit of choosing when to have children, how many to have and how to space each child,” she said. “Family planning (and access to contraceptives) enables girls and women to go to school, make better and higher incomes and participate in shared activities in their communities.” Samba said strategies like the ones launched in Meru will ensure sustainable services even when donors withdraw funding.
