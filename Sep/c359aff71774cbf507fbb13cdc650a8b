Nakuru chances of retaining their Kenya Hockey Union men’s Premier League status got another debilitating blow when they fell 2-1 to Strathmore University Gladiators at City Park yesterday. The match was destined to a one-all draw until Gladiators scored a controversial late goal through Edgar Juma . The strike saw Nakuru players walk out of the pitch in protest. Prior to the match Gladiators were seeking to avenge their 2-0 loss to Wazalendo on Saturday while Nakuru were also looking for total points after a 2-2 draw against USIU-A Mashujaa the previous day. Festus Onyango, the Gladiators skipper and a Kenyan international, opened the scoring for the winners in the 11th minute when he scythed the ball past a hapless Nakuru custodian Dennis Mageto from a short corner delivered by Job Ogaso. The visiting team mounted a fierce quest to restore parity driving long balls towards their lone forward Dolcan Mugaisi but his markers were on his radar, thwarting his attempts and those of his teammates to keep the lead till halftime. The Meshack Senge-coached Gladiators were better placed to put the result beyond doubt from a couple of open chances in the second half but could not convert them. Instead, John Rioba made them rue their wastefulness in front of goal with a 51 minute equaliser which came from Dennis Sisa’s short corner. However Juma plundered home the winner in the 59th minute although the final shot clearly hit his limp necessitating a foul in favour of Nakuru. The controversial goal was protested by Nakuru players, who cut a dejected figure as they walked off the pitch while hurling their grievances to the technical bench and the match-day umpires.
