National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has been accused by the minority side of “sitting on the Finance Bill” as millions of Kenyans suffer from the impact of VAT on petroleum products. Led by minority leader John Mbadi, the opposition MPs yesterday accused the House leadership of dragging its feet in forwarding the Bill to President Uhuru Kenyatta for assent. MPs Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay Woman Representative), Mark Nyamita (Uriri), Mathias Robi (Kuria West), Godfrey Osotsi (nominated) and nominated senator Rose Nyamunga separately protested against the delay which has made Kenyans pay more for essential goods and services even after Parliament voted to postpone the 16 per cent VAT on fuel. Mbadi said the minority side reads dishonesty in the delay in forwarding the Finance Bill and demanded that the speaker move with speed and have the Bill on Uhuru’s table. “We passed this Bill on August 30... even though Kenyans have been waiting for President Uhuru Kenyatta to return to sign the Finance Bill, the information I’m getting is that the Bill is yet to be taken to the President and that is worrying,” Mbadi said.
