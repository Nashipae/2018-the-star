A man has been arrested in Kisumu for allegedly defiling and impregnating his daughter who is in Standard Seven. The suspect is in custody at Akala police station as investigations continue. West Reru assistant chief Millicent Ajwang said the girl's mother is also being questioned at Riat patrol base. “The girl said her father has been defiling her for the last two years until she fell expectant,” Ajwang said. The administrator said she got reports from villagers and arrested the suspect. She said the girl, who has recorded a statement with the police, will undergo medical examinations. The suspect faces defilement charges when he will be taken to court after investigations are completed. Two months ago, anti-corruption police arrested a senior policeman in Kisumu for allegedly soliciting a Sh20,000 bribe to withdraw defilement charges against a suspect. Western regional Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission boss Ben Murei said OCS Kennedy Sania is based in Kombewa, Seme, where there is an increase in defilement cases. He said the officer asked for a bribe to withdraw charges against the complainant’s brother. The suspect was charged with defilement at the Maseno Law Courts. Murei said the commission dispatched detectives to probe the matter at the station. The complainant was given treated money to hand over to the officer. Sania was arrested immediately he received the cash. He was released on bail. Click here for the latest political news
