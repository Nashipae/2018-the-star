Two Kakamega MPs have told Nasa leader Raila Odinga to leave the Luhya community alone and focus on his Nyanza backyard. National Assembly chief whip Ben Washiali and Lurambi’s Titus Khamala on Monday said reports that Raila intends to lead a Western delegation to meet President Uhuru Kenyatta is an insult to Luhya leaders. They said they will only attend if the team is led by ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi. The two spoke at Ebuchinga Primary School. They presented a Sh2 million donation by DP William Ruto. “Raila is not our leader. He should forget about leading us to statehouse,” Khamala said. Washiali said Mudavadi should book an appointment with the President and lead the visit. “If he is not ready to do that, I will lead Luhyas in meeting the President,” Washiali said. On July 31, Raila met a section of elected leaders from the region in a meeting convened by Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya. Many issues, including the visit, was discussed. On Saturday, Kakamega senator Cleophas Malala said the state House meeting was on course and those opposed to being led by Raila will have to wait for their date.
