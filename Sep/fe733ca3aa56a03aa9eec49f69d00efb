"THE markets are never wrong," President Kagame said in an interview in Washington in 2014 at the USAfricaSummit and this statement is in fact a timeless one. There have been occasions too many to mention where Folks will rail against the market and the Point is this, always take the side of the market against the Demagogue. Always. The term "bear market" is named for the manner in which a bear tends to attack. A bear will usually swipe its paws in a downward motion upon its prey, and for this reason, markets laden with falling stock prices are called bear markets. A bear market is a condition in which securities prices fall and widespread pessimism causes the stock market's downward spiral to be self-sustaining. Although figures vary, a downturn of 20 percent or more from a peak is the widely accepted definition of a bear market. The Nairobi Securities Exchange has 3 Indices, The Nairobi All Share [market Capitalisation Index], the NSE 20 and the NSE 25 [which are equal weighting indices where each of the 20 or 25 stocks that comprise the Index carry an equal weight]. The NSE 20 is -23.697% in 2018, its at a 19 month low and entered a bear market at the end of August. The Nairobi All Share is -15.02% in 2018, at a 16 month low and entered a bear market on September 19th. Last week a whole series of share prices hit all time lows. This List which is not exhaustive includes the venerable Nation Media Group [-34.913% in 2018 on a Total Return Basis], Kenya Power [-48.9%] Deacons [-84.5% in 2018], Uchumi [-76.08%], Mumias Sugar [-50.00%]. The Question you need to ask yourself is which of these are ''zombies'' Economists have worried about “zombie companies” for decades. Timothy Taylor, editor of the Journal of Economic Perspectives, has followed a trail of references back to 1989, noting sightings of these zombies in Japan from the 1990s, and more recently in China. The fundamental concern is that there are companies which should be dead, yet continue to lumber on, ruining things for everyone [FT] The Big Cap stocks have also rolled over. Safaricom entered a bear market Friday having fallen 20% over the last 4 weeks. The Banks are getting slammed too. KCB has slumped into a bear market and is down 20% over the last four weeks. The stock Market is largely seen as a Leading Indicator. If this were the price performance in New York [which by the way closed at all time highs last week], there would be a Revolution and immediate remedial action. One of my first Bosses was the aptly named Mark Dearlove who said to me, ''You only get smelly fingers picking bottoms, Aly-Khan'' The market has further to fall.
