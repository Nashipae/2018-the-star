Three schools were closed in Baringo and over 100 families displaced after flash floods on Friday. Ng'ambo Girls' secondary school, Sintaan and Ilng'arua primary schools in Ilchamus ward were affected. The region experienced heavy rains since Thursday evening, paralysing businesses. "Three pupils nearly drowned while heading to school but they were fortunately rescued by teachers," Sammy Tunai of Sintaan primary school said. Hundreds of locals passed the night in the cold outside Ilng'arua dispensary after their houses got submerged. A number of learners expressed worries over the limited time left before the national examinations. In April, Baringo deputy governor Jacob Chepkwony said the county only budgeted Sh25 million for emergencies.
