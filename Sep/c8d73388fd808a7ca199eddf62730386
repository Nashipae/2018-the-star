Often, their main concern in not with the law that makes
certain behaviour a crime, but on the procedures of the courts and whether they
will deliver convictions for the guilty. What does this have to do with the Constitution? Readers are
probably aware that the Constitution guarantees “fair trial”, which is framed
mostly as a right of accused persons. But “A just outcome is not just a matter of fairness to the
accused and the victim. It is a matter of public importance. If the guilty are
not convicted, or the innocent are convicted, public confidence in the system
is likely to be undermined. Preventing impunity is an important purpose of the
system.” These words come from a book just launched by the Judiciary (on the basis
of a proposal originally developed by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative
and the Katiba Institute). The book is the Criminal
Procedure Bench Book, written particularly for those who (mostly
magistrates) try people for crimes or deal with appeals (mostly High Court
Judges, and occasionally higher courts). But all sorts of other people will
find it useful. The Chief Justice’s Foreword made clear the connection
between this and Transformation of the Judiciary, and the Constitution â€• and to
improving service delivery for “clients”. By “clients”, the Chief Justice means the people whom they
serve.  In a criminal case, the Judiciary
serves the people of Kenya, the individual victims of crime and the people
accused of crime, as well as witnesses, who are not either victims or accused. WHAT IS CRIMINAL PROCEDURE? Criminal procedure is a bit more of a mystery than the law
of crimes. The rules must cover all cases from the traffic offender to the
murder accused. They begin with investigation and arrest, and how the courts
can ensure the police behave properly. Many issues are quite complicated: When a person can be
refused bail (a very topical issue), what to do when a person charged seems not
to be sane, how to protect the rights of victims, and of children (whether
accused, victims or witnesses), what to do if the victim wants to reach an
agreement and not have the case continue, how to decide on the appropriate
sentence for a person convicted, how to deal with obstructive witnesses. As people have become aware of new social problems, or
attitudes have changed, new laws have been passed. Examples are the Sexual
Offences Act (increasing penalties), and the Victims’ Protection Act
(recognising that victims have a right to understand what is going on in a trial
about what was done to them, and even to explain how it affected them). Around
a dozen laws are relevant to procedure in criminal trials. No law is perfectly clear. It is useful for a court to know
how previous courts have understood a law â€• and, be able to apply the same law
in the same way in similar situations. 
So this small book refers to over 300 cases decided by the Kenyan courts
which either explain the meaning of the law, or give a good illustration of how
it works.  A NEW CONSTITUTION We may sometimes feel that the 2010 Constitution has had no
impact on the country, especially when we think about the politicians. But in
some areas it has had an impact, and one is the field of criminal justice.
Again, not yet enough. As a result of the Constitution we now have law on the
rights of people who are deprived of their liberty (arrested, awaiting trial or
serving sentences). We have the Victims Protection Act and recently the Legal
Aid Act (which will eventually provide more legal assistance to people charged
with crime). The Constitution separated the Director of Prosecutions from the
government’s lawyer â€• the Attorney General â€• making the office much more
independent. The country, taking its cue from the Constitution, is working out
ways in which criminal cases can more be settled by agreement, while
remembering that criminal law is a matter of public importance too, not just
for the individuals involved. Already this small book mentions at least five cases in
which courts have held existing criminal procedure law to be unconstitutional,
trying to achieve a more just system. Interesting examples are rules that
required courts to order that children who have committed crimes, or people who
are accused of crimes but are suffering from mental illnesses, are kept locked
up for an indefinite period â€• during the “pleasure of the President” in fact.  AN ARCHAIC CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE The Criminal Procedure Code â€• a systematic set of rules for
criminal justice â€• began not in Kenya, or even in England but in India, where
the colonial authorities reduced the rules developed by the courts over
centuries on topics like contract, evidence, criminal law and criminal
procedure to clear written laws. When the colony of Kenya adopted a new
Criminal Procedure Code in 1930, it actually took quite a lot of ideas from the
Indian Criminal Procedure Code, which it was formally abandoning. It may be centuries since England abandoned trial by battle
or ordeal (like putting the accused person’s hand in the fire to see if it
burned). But even in the last 80-plus years, a lot has changed: The court
system has changed, and the way trials are done has also changed. More
important, ideas of fair trial have developed enormously, plus, of course, we
have our new Constitution.  WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE? The report accompanying the Bench Book identifies a number
of changes needed. For example, the Criminal Procedure Code still suggests
people can automatically be refused bail, if charged with some offences; but
under the Constitution a person charged with any offence must be
released on bail unless there any compelling circumstances not to do so. The law reflects out-of-date and disrespectful ways of
referring to people with mental disabilities, such as “lunatics” and
“imbeciles”. Unfortunately, even the Constitution uses the expression “of
unsound mind”. And, now that courts have held that it unconstitutional to keep
people locked up “during the President’s pleasure”, we need to devise some
other fair way to protect both them and the public. Locking people up was not, of course, the way communities
dealt with offenders before the colonial period. And in recent years, Kenya,
like other countries, has tried to develop ways to keep offenders out of
prison, and encourage them by different methods to avoid committing offences in
future. Examples are community service, probation and suspended sentences
(where people are given a second chance: “We would usually have sentenced you
to two years in jail, but if you do not commit another crime for X years you
will not go to prison for this offence”). But the law does not say how long the
X years should be. Could a person be told they could be sentenced for the
original crime if they commit another one any time during the next 30 years? Occasionally people want to bring a criminal case as private
citizens. But there is no clear procedure for doing this. The report proposes that all these are looked at and the law
clarified. In truth, the whole Criminal Procedure Code needs to be reconsidered
and redrafted. It is full of formal and old-fashioned language (when did you
last use the word “ingress”?). It is full of long sentences; the one that uses
“ingress” is 126 words long. A number of provisions assume long gone ways of
prosecuting criminals. Even lawyers get confused, how much more the ordinary
citizen? But this law is for the trials of ordinary citizens, and for the protection
of ordinary citizens through effective enforcement of the law.  They should be able to understand it.  The
