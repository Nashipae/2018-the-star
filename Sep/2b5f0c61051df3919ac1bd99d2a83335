More than 50 African ministers will from today gather at the UN Environment headquarters, Nairobi, for the seventh special session of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN). Environment experts, representatives of African civil society, partners and media are expected to attend, UN Environment Africa office head of communication Mohamed Atani said yesterday. “It will consist of a meeting of the expert group to be held from September 17 to 18 and a ministerial segment to be held on September 19,” he said. The special session is jointly organised with NEPAD. The conference will be followed by the first meeting of the Africa Environment Partnership Platform from September 20 to 21. “The special session will consider key issues to be discussed at the fourth United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-4 ) and Africa’s common approach for engagement in the Assembly, scheduled to take place in March 2019,” Atani said. “It will focus on how environmental challenges can be addressed through innovative solutions and interventions and by promoting sustainable consumption and production.” During UNEA-3 on December 6, 2017, member states, businesses and civil society stakeholders signed the ‘beat pollution pledge’, committing to tackle global pollution. Some 2.4 million individuals and companies have joined the campaign so far. UNEA-3 adopted 11 non-binding resolutions urging accelerated action and reinforced partnerships. Each resolution addressed a specific dimension of pollution, including: combating the spread of marine plastic litter and micro plastics; eliminating exposure to lead paint; and promoting sound management of used lead-acid batteries.
