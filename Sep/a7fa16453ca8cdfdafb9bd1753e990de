It was early morning on a crisp, clear beautiful day in September 2014. I drove slowly through the park near the Kingfisher picnic site. I saw a dead kongoni lying in the open near the road. I waited to see if any predators claimed the kill, but nothing came. Then, just as I was about to drive away, a leopard suddenly appeared from within a small shrub and began to eat. Wow, what a special memory! There are nine known types of leopard in the world. The African leopard is scientifically known as Panthera pardus pardus, with at least 10 sub-species in Africa. Leopards are pound for pound the most powerful big cat species, able to pull heavy antelope kills up trees. They also have the ability to see about seven times more effectively at night than humans do. However, they do not see full colour. Leopards do not have typical spots. They have rosettes that help with their incredible camouflage when hunting. Leopards are rarely seen in the Nairobi Park, and are mostly nocturnal. It is “guestimated” that  their numbers are possibly about 20. They are secretive and elusive by nature. It is not very long ago that residents of Langata and Karen Estates told stories of leopards on their properties. They are known to even live relatively close to human habitation for some time, remaining undetected. Sadly the occasional leopard does stray into the city. I clearly remember an incident in 2002, when a leopard strayed into a home in Kilimani area and was shot. When looking for leopards, it is good to scan the trees with binoculars. Next time you are in the park, be on the lookout for the elusive and secretive Pathera pardus pardus.
