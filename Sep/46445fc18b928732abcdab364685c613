AFC Leopards set to hire Nakumatt coach Melis Medo to replace Rodolfo Zapata if he walks away at the close of an unsuccessful season at the den. A top Leopards’ official said they are yet to get any indication from the coach that he could be leaving but revealed they are already planning for life without the Argentine should he decide to hand in his resignation. “We have not heard anything from Zapata on his intentions to quit but as a club, we must also prepare ourselves to fill the void should he leave. We have not chased him away and it means if he goes, it is a decision from him not us,” said the official. “We are looking at the prospects of bringing in Nakumatt coach Melis Medo if Zapata decides to go but I strongly believe Zapata will stay for next season.” Zapata fueled his exit after he thanked the players for their support during his brief stay at The Den. The Argentine coach delivered the shock message to the players after the team was bundled out of the FKF Shield Cup by Sofapaka over the weekend. “It was nice working with you and wish you the best in your future endeavors,” Zapata told the players at Kasarani before walking away. Zapata and AFC Leopards’ players were held hostage by fans, who demanded that they walk from Kasarani to their homes after the defeat to Batoto Ba Mungu, which ended the club’s dream of winning any silverware this term. Goal.com also understands that Ingwe’s playing unit is rooting for the return of Tanzanian coach Dennis Kitambi to work with Tom Juma. A goal from Elli Asieche was enough to hand Sofapaka a 1-0 win and they will now face Kariobangi Sharks in the final. Sharks reached the final after registering an emphatic 4-1 win against Ulinzi Stars at the same venue.
