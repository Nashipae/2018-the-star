Speakers of the three Ukambani counties on Friday met in Machakos to discuss regional collaboration in legislation. Florence Mwangangi (Machakos), George Ndoto (Kitui) and Douglas Mbilu from Makueni their Mterpart held a closed-door meeting at Machakos County Assembly before they addressed the press. “We want to see how we can join hands in legislative matters so that we come up with laws which address issues in our three counties," Mwangangi said. Mwangangi said some of the problems facing residents in these counties include water and environmental degradation. She said the laws will allow for cleaning of River Athi which is majorly used by residents from Machakos, Makueni and Kitui Counties. Mbilu said the laws will help realize dreams and aspirations of the South Eastern Economic Block. He said the government should hasten the compensation of those displaced by the ongoing construction of Thwake Dam project in Makueni. “Thwake Dam is a major natural resource not only in Kenya but Africa, the contractor is taking too long due to compensation challenge,” said Mbilu.
