A Nakuru woman who attempted to sell her three-weeks-old baby at Sh1,200 has pleaded guilty of child trafficking. Ann Wangui, a 35-year-old mother of seven, was arrested at the Nakuru Level Five Hospital on Tuesday. She admitted to planning to sell the baby girl to another woman who hails from Rongai immediately after she was discharged from the facility. "I wanted to sell the girl to recover the money I had used to buy diapers used when she was in the incubator for three weeks," she told the court. Wangui, who hails from Njoro, had her baby put in the nursery since she was underweight and was due for discharge on Wednesday afternoon. She wanted to sell the baby to Dorcas Nanjala, who was also admitted to the hospital. The latter's baby died a few days after delivery. The suspect asked Nanjala for Sh1,200 in exchange for the baby and further directed her to come with clothes for the little girl. Nanjala was directed to arrive at the hospital gate at exactly 11am where the deal was to be sealed. The buyer first reported the proposed deal to Nakuru Central police station and was escorted by plainclothes officers to the hospital. Wangui walked into the nursery and after few minutes, emerged holding the child. The detectives pounced on her. Her husband Wilson Mungai arrived minutes later while armed with an assortment of baby clothes ready to walk home with his newborn. Mungai expressed his shock after learning that his wife had planned to give away their child without informing him. "My wife called me in the morning saying she would be discharged today and that is why I am here for them," Mungai said. Click here for the latest political news
