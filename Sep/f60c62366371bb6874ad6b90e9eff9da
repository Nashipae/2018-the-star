Nairobi governor Mike Sonko made an announced visit at Pumwani Maternity Hospital on Saturday at 2:45 am. The governor said he was impressed with the changes. Sonko said he wanted to see first hand how services are being rendered at the facility. On September 18, the governor found 12 bodies of infants stuffed in polythene bags and boxes. He suspended senior officials at the hospital. However, on Saturday he said he found smooth operations. At least 74 women had given birth. The women told the governor they received good treatment. Mwende Nzioki, a mother of two, said she was received well. "I have just given birth to my second kid. I had a normal delivery. I'm really grateful I have not been charged anything," she said. Waithera Kimani and Akinyi Auma, who had also delivered at the facility, said they are glad to have given birth safely. Sonko said he will not allow any woman to suffer while bringing life on earth. "Our mothers do a great job of bringing us to earth. Therefore, we should provide better facilities for them to deliver safely. We cannot afford to lose the mother or the child," Sonko said.
