The county government seeks to expand Kakamega municipality to include Khayega, Eshisiru and Lubao towns on its outskirts. The change is contained in a 10-year spatial plan. Mumias town has also been considered and will be expanded to cover 104,278 acres. The plan has been approved by the County Executive Committee and awaits MCAs’ approval. If consented by the assembly, the size of Kakamega municipality will increase from about 12,108 acres to 30,394 acres. The municipality was established in early 1970s to sustain about 500 households but the population has outstripped its infrastructure. Lands, Housing, Urban Areas and Physical Planning executive Alfred Matianyi yesterday said population growth prompted the expansion to ensure better services. “The rates won’t be high. We want those to be affected to see the benefits that will come with the change because the value of the land will definitely rise,” he said. The new Kakamega boundaries will move to Khayega township towards Kisumu, Eshisiru town towards Mumias, Lubao town towards Webuye and Shinyalu township. Mumias municipality boundaries will move to Harambee township towards Bungoma, Shianda township towards Kakamega and Matungu market towards Busia. The shifting of the boundaries will move thousands of freehold landowners into the brackets of ratepayers. Matianyi said they will benefit from better roads, sewerage services, street-lighting and piped water. He said residential houses in Jua Kali estate will be demolished to allow building of shades for artisans.
