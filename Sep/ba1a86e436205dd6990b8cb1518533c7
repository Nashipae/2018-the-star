Belgium have joined world champions
France as the joint leaders in the FIFA rankings published on
Thursday, the first time in the table's 25-year history that the
top spot has been shared. Kenya were the biggest movers as they earned 22 points to
move up five places to 107th. Those points came courtesy of a
1-0 victory over Ghana in 2019 African Nations Cup qualifier. Roberto Martinez's Belgium collected two wins, including
their first in the UEFA Nations League over Iceland earlier this
month, to bring them level with France on 1729 points. France, meanwhile, were held to a goalless draw by Germany
in Munich in their Nations League opener before beating the
Netherlands 2-1. The only other change in the top 10 saw Denmark slip down to
10th spot, below Spain. Following their disappointing group-stage exit at the World
Cup, Germany have climbed a further three positions and now sit
12th. Top 10 rankings: (previous positions in brackets) 1. France 1. Belgium (2) 3. Brazil 4. Croatia 5. Uruguay 6. England 7. Portugal 8. Switzerland 9. Spain 10. Denmark  Click here for the latest political news
