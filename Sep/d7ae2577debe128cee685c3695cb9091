A woman who stole a baby from Pumwani Maternity Hospital and carried him on a backpack on Friday has been arrested. Mercy Atieno took away the child belonging to 35-year-old Rebecca Kasaya Ayiro at about 5.30pm. Elkana Jacob of Governor Mike Sonko's press service said the child was stolen at the time the mother was processing her discharge. He said the baby’s mother sounded an alarm after she found the baby boy missing upon returning to her bed. Joseph Bitok, a guard who was manning the ground floor, said he heard the cry of a baby in a backpack carried by the suspect. "Mercy claimed it was her phone’s ring tone upon enquiry," Elkana said. "The security, upon searching, found the baby had been stuffed in the bag." The case was booked at Shauri Moyo police station under OB 66/31/8/2018. Pumwani has also denied reports on social media that another baby was stolen in the facility on Saturday. This followed reports of an infant who was found dumped in a linen with the label of Pumwani hospital. "All mothers in the hospital have their neonates with them," Elkana said adding that the hospital has put in place measures to ensure all clients are safe and secured. "Governor Sonko has assured that stern measures will be taken against the suspects and urged nursing mothers to be vigilant especially at county hospitals," he said.
