Sean Andrew is being featured in the most-anticipated Kenyan play this month, Money That Made Him Poor. Sean is playing the role of a villain in the play, which is produced by Tony Tini Tone Productions. “It’s a Kenyan play with a well-selected cast, good script and the message is also timely in this time in our country. The issues it covers include corruption, money, power and greed.It will be a theatrical experience to behold,” he told Word Is. Sean plays a character who is tenderpreneur, trying to sell as much tender as possible and make money from it. He partners with another character, Sofia, earning a lot of money. “I’ll probably be that character that people would love to hate: pushy and full of myself. I’ll do my best but that is something that I’m not.” Sean, who doubles up as a model and influencer, says it’s the first time he’s venturing into this line of art. “I’ve done plays before but this is my first time doing a professional theatre play. It’s very exciting being part of a positive story. Acting was one of my interests. In terms of my career, I go with the flow.” He is the son of former President Mwai Kibaki, but going into politics is not part of his interests. “We are all related to somebody, and to me the people I’m related to are just family. We grew up humble,” he said“ As I said, I don’t go with the part, I
go with the flow on how things are.”
Adding, “So politics is not something
I’m looking forward to. I can help Kenyan
people without going into politics,
and if that’s possible, I’ll really avoid that.” His advice to his over 90,000 followers?
“I want people to understand that
you can’t always be negative. There is
always a way to get through things.
