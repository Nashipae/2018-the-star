Senators visited the National Cereals and Produce Board in Eldoret and found the stores filled up with maize. Farmers have not been paid Sh3.5 billion for their maize deliveries last year. Farmers are preparing to harvest this year's crop in two months. The Senate ad-hoc committee on the maize crisis chaired by Uasin Gishu senator Margaret Kamar inspected the stores. Senators Moses Wetang'ula, Petronilla Were and Samson Cherargei said they will prepare a report after the tour. Kamar said they will make recommendations after getting views from farmers in how they want the board to be managed. The senators also held a second public hearing on the maize crisis in Kapsabet town. Farmers asked the senators to intervene for them to be paid. On Wednesday, farmers made an emotional appeal to the leaders to step in and help them get their cash. Hundreds of them gave their views to the Kamar team.
