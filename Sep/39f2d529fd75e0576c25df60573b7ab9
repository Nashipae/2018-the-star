Police in Kwale seized 300 bags of suspected contraband sugar as it was being offloaded at Bodo/Shirazi beach landing site in Msambweni on Wednesday night. Kenya Revenue Authority and Kenya Bureau of Standards officials accompanied the police during the operation. The consignment, estimated to cost Sh1.8 million, is suspected to have been imported illegally from Tanzania. Matuga police Joel Chesire told journalists in his Kwale office members of the public gave them a tip-off. “We got a report of a suspicious consignment of sugar. Officers impounded the cargo before it got to the market," he said. Chesire said a prominent businesswoman in Msambweni, who is the main suspect, was arrested. Two drivers and two loaders were also nabbed, but others escaped. He said the suspects will be taken to court. A week ago 104 bags of brown sugar was found hidden in Mlazani forest.
