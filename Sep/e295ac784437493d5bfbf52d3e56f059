Telecommunications PS Fatuma Hirsi has said the future of Posta Corporation is secure, despite technological advancements and innovations. She spoke on Friday during the flagging off of 22 official motor vehicles at Posta House Nairobi. The newly acquired fleet seeks to improve services and operations within the corporation offices countrywide. Hirsi said with new innovations riding on ICT platforms - Mpost, Posta Mobile Wallet, Tunza Nyumba na Posta, EMS2GO and E-njiwa - the corporation is secure, especially in the sectors of logistics, e-commerce, financial and social inclusion.
