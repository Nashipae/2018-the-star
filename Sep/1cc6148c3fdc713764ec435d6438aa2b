Kenya has recorded significant success in responding to attacks against persons with albinism and discrimination in the health sector but must do much more in other areas like access to justice, a UN expert has said. Presenting a statement at the end of a mission to Kenya on Monday, the UN Independent Expert on the enjoyment of human rights by persons with albinism, Ikponwosa Ero, welcomed some of Kenya’s unique achievements, saying the country was set to become one of the leaders on the issue in the region. “Kenya’s successes include the allocation of a substantial annual budget geared toward specific measures for persons with albinism, who had historically been left behind in the key sectors of health and education and had fallen prey to ritual attacks and the consequent insecurities,” she said. “However, much remains to be done including access to justice and judicial remedies for victims of attack as well as socio-economic support for victims and their families to help restore their lives,” the expert added. “There is also a great need for protection measures in border areas like Migori and Taita Taveta counties, where fear of attack remains high.” The Independent Expert will present a comprehensive report of her visit to the UN Human Rights Council in March 2019.
