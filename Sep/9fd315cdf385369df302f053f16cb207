The government has launched an affordable housing programme to be funded by a 1.5 per cent tax on employee salaries and a 1.5 per cent contribution from the employer. The goal is to build 500,000 affordable homes for low-income Kenyans. This programme is well meaning but poorly thought out. Firstly, when poor people are helped to own houses, they frequently sell them to raise money. It would be better for government to build blocks of flats that can be rented out to poor Kenyans but not owned by them. Secondly, government is promising to refund the money with interest if an employee is not given a house. This is unlikely to happen, judging by the huge arrears of VAT and other taxes that the government is not presently refunding. Thirdly, there is confusion whether all employees will be taxed, or only the 77,000 Kenyans earning over Sh100,000, which would raise just Sh3 billion a year. That might be enough to build 600 houses a year. We need to rethink the affordable housing programme. Quote of the day: "Life is a lot like jazz... it's best when you improvise."
