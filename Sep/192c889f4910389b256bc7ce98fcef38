County workers will receive a pay rise after their Collective Bargaining Agreement was registered with the labour court last Thursday. With the CBA, each of the more than 12, 800 employees will get between 15 and 50 per cent salary increase. The highest paid employees will get 15 per cent salary increment. The lowest paid will get a 50 per cent raise. The CBA was signed in May last year, but has not been implemented as it had not been registered with the court as required in law. With the registration, Nairobi becomes the first devolved unit to negotiate, sign and register a CBA with its workers. Kenya County Government Workers Union secretary general Roba Duba said the CBA will improve the welfare and working conditions of staff. “This CBA is not only about money. There are many other non-monetary benefits that our members will enjoy,” he said. Long overdue “Workers will, for instance, now get materials and tools to work and this will directly be felt by the residents who consume county services.” Duba has written to the county secretary to immediately implement the CBA, adding that it has been long overdue. On Friday, some workers paraded outside City Hall to compel governor Mike Sonko to implement the CBA.
