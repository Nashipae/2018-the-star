Gor Mahia will play English Premier League side
Everton at the Goodison Park in the UK in November. The 6 November match is part of Kenyan
betting firm SportPesa's sponsorship deal with Everton. "The historic fixture will kick-off at 7pm and will
mark the first occasion an East African club side has contested a match in the
UK," Everton said in a statement. The
match is part of the SportPesa Trophy, which is contested by clubs in
Kenya and Tanzania. Winners of the competition play Everton in the
final. Last
year, Everton travelled to Tanzania for the inaugural SportPesa Super
Cup and played Gor Mahia at the National Stadium in Tanzania. The
Kenyan betting company is Everton football club's main sponsor. It also
sponsors Torino FC in Italy as well as Hull City and Southampton FC in
England. Since its inception in 2014, it has supported various sporting disciplines and teams at home and abroad. Click here for the latest political news
