The Kenya Pipeline Company has directed all depots to ensure trucks are loaded with the right petroleum products. This follows an incident at the Kisumu plant on Tuesday, where 14 trucks were loaded with water instead. The country witnessed a similar incident in 1994. Petroleum CS John Munyes said depot managers have been instructed to put measures in place to prevent adulterated fuels in the market.

Munyes was with Kenya Pipeline MD Joe Sang and Petroleum CAS John Musonik. He said no adulterated fuel was offloaded in the market after the incident. They toured the Sh1.7 billion Kisumu oil jetty plant in Lake Victoria. Munyes said KPC recalled tankers that were mistakenly loaded with water before offloading in petrol stations. He denied claims that the incident could have been as a result of sabotage. The CS added that there is a team investigating the matter and pledged a comprehensive report.
