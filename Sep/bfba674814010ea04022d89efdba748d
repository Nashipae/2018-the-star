A man was killed by a tumbling rock in Malava, Kakamega, on Wednesday. Chitayi Ngaira, 25, and his two friends had been hired to remove the rock on someone's land in Kambi ya Mwanza market. They had dug a pit around it and were about to complete their three-day task when tragedy struck at 7 am. Ngaira's colleagues escaped death by a whisker when they swiftly jumped out of the pit. They sustained minor injuries while Ngaira was crushed to death. The owner of the plot, who lives in Nairobi, had asked them to remove the rock because he wants to build a house. Ngaira's ailing mother Evelyn Nanzala said her son and his friends were to be paid Sh10,000 and a sheep. The grief-stricken woman said he was the family's breadwinner and he bought medicine for her. Kakamega North police boss said investigations have been launched. The body was taken to Kakamega County Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary. Click here for the latest political news
