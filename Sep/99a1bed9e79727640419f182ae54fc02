Nakuru County government plans to harmonize tax imposed on flower farmers, a move aimed at end double taxation that has adversely affected them. Since devolution came into force, farmers have cited double taxation from by both arms of government as a key factor driving down production. Another challenge to industry players is poor infrastructure in the region, worsened by heavy rains. Bad roads have increased the farmers production costs with them constantly having to repair their vehicles. Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui, there is need to give players in the floriculture sub-sector the necessary support as it employs thousands directly and indirectly. “We shall be meeting the farmers and other players in this sector so that we can harmonize some of the issues they are complaining about,” he said. Data by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics shows the volume of cut flowers exported between January and March increased marginally by 7.42 per cent to 60,961 metric tonnes compared to 56,437 tonnes produced last year. The value of flower exports during the period increased to Sh42.59 billion from Sh30.22 billion the same period last year. For the first four months of the year, cut flowers accounted for 74.94 per cent of the country's horticulture exports valued at Sh56.83 billion. Kinyanjui was addressing the press at Naivasha Golf Club after attending the annual Naivasha Horticultural Trade Fair which attracted over 200 exhibitors. “Nakuru is emerging as the home of flower farms and we have new companies opening farms in areas of Subukia, Njoro and Mau Narok and hence the need to support them,” he said. Kinyanjui also announced the county would be holding an international investors conference on November 29th in Naivasha. “The conference will give the county a chance to showcase its talent from agriculture to tourism and we expect visitors from across the East Africa region,” he said.
