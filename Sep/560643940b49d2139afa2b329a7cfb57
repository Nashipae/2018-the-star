Several leaders on Saturday condemned the murder of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno. Nairobi woman representative Esther Passaris, Makueni senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr, Nairobi governor Mike Sonko, and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka said the main culprit must be arrested. They spoke during the commemoration of Sonko’s father, Gideon Kioko Kivanguli's third anniversary at Kathumani Primary School in Mua, Machakos. “Gender-based violence is on the rise, women in Kenya are not safe,” Passaris said. Passaris said men should start protecting girls, women and boys in the society. “The devil has citizenship in Kenya, we need it,” Passaris said. Kilonzo said those behind Sharon’s death should be arrested, shot dead and their bodies thrown into Nairobi National Park for wild animals animals to feast on them. “They do not deserve to live, the law should be changed for such people to be shot,” he said. Sonko said the main suspect has been mentioned. “People are afraid of talking about the suspect in Sharon’s murder. Shame on the culprit," Sonko said. Sonko said the DPP and DCI should not spare anyone connected to the brutal murder. Kalonzo said the matter should be dealt with swiftly. He said no stone should be left unturned in the pursuit of Sharon’s killers. “Why stab to death a child who is still in its mother’s womb?” Kalonzo asked.
