The examination council is monitoring 20 schools prone to malpractices as preparations for the national exams conclude. Kenya National Examinations Council chairman George Magoha said the institutions under close watch are top boys’ and girls’ national schools, county schools and day schools. Most of them are found in Kisii and West Pokot counties and Rift Valley and Nyanza regions. Magoha said the council and the Teachers Service Commission have received reports of threats to principals who have declined cheating advances.

A field coordinator said they were investigating the matter. “We’ve got tip offs from multiple principals who have received threats for not cooperating,” the coordinator told the Star. Magoha said they were monitoring some principals said to be keen on influencing the choice of supervisors and invigilators to coordinate cheating. “There are schools said to have favourable supervisors who will dance to their tune. Two school heads in Garissa have been implicated and we are investigating them,” Magoha said. A total of 1.6 million candidates have registered for this year’s national exams.
