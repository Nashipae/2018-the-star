Adelle Onyango on Tuesday attended the Gala Night in New York, which featured a performance from Ed Sheeran. What amazed the radio presenter was the fact that one of her baby pictures popped up on the screen while the performance was on. “I loved being part of the #Goalkeepers18 youth advisory group and being part of brainstorming on the structure of the sessions,” she told Word Is. She said she had earlier on been asked by the organisers to send a baby picture of herself but did not expect such a surprise. “So the GoalKeepers youth advisory group that I’m part of had asked me for my baby photos, I had no idea why. Then Ed Sheeran starts performing and... look! My picture pops up. I felt crazy because I never expected it. I was loving his performance and recording it for my best friend, who loves Ed Sheeran, and then my picture pops up and I was so shocked,” Adelle said. Adding, “What a nice surprise! That’s me and my favourite teddy (pun intended) called baby Margaret.” She is among the seven-team youth advisory group that will play an important role in shaping the conversation at the ongoing Goal Keepers’ Conference in New York. “It’s important for me because, as young Africans, we must be part of conversations that will affect us and part of building our own solutions that we can implement on the ground,” Adelle said.
