Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr says he is out of danger after a piece of meat that chocked him was removed at a Nairobi hospital. In an interview with the Star, he said, " I thank God the piece of meat was removed by doctors. I'm feeling better now." "I'm still feeling nauseated because I have just left the theatre. Let me rest a bit bro," Mutula said on the phone on Wednesday evening. The senator was briefly admitted to Kapsebet County Referral Hospital after he choked while having lunch at Eden Spring Hotel in Nandi. He had attended the morning session at the Nandi County Assembly. From the county hospital, Mutula was rushed to Eldoret International Airport for onward transfer to Nairobi in the afternoon.
