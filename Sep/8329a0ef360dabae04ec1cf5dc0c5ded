A man and a woman were charged on Thursday in a Kiambu Court with attempting to extort by use of threats. Hellen Mwachala and Mohamed Karim were charge with jointly conspiring to extort money from Musa Yarow by threatening to expose him in the newspapers for claiming to have won a tender. The two said Yarow won the tender fraudulently. They allegedly demanded Sh30 million. The offence was committed on September 12 at Panafric Hotel in Nairobi. The duo pleaded not guilty before Kiambu senior principal magistrate Stella Atambo and were released on a Sh1 million bond with a surety of a similar amount. There were also given a bail of Sh1 million each. The plea was however not admitted by the court after defence lawyers objected, saying the offence was vague and faulty. Lawyer Charles Midenga who is representing Karim pleaded with the court not to admit the plea, saying the charges did not disclose any offence. Earlier, there had been heated arguments as the lawyers representing the accused made an application seeking to have the case transferred to Milimani Law Court in Nairobi. They said the alleged crime was committed in Nairobi and that that is where the case ought to be heard. Prosecution lawyer Mary Ongaki opposed the application by saying the Serious Crimes Prevention Unit which was handling the case was at liberty to file the matter in Kiambu. Ongaki said it is within the officers administrative and legal scope. Atambo ruled that the allowed the suspects to be charged in the court. “There is no reason why this court cannot take the plea and the objection by the defence is overruled. The accused person will go ahead and take plea before this court,” Atambo said. The suspects were arrested after Yarow told detectives about the demand. The officers gave him treated money amounting to Sh3 million that had been demanded by Hellen. The money was to exchange hands at the hotel. “She was arrested as the transaction took place,” sources told the Star on Friday.
