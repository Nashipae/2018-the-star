The National Land Commission has revoked the title for Airgate Centre formerly known as Taj Mall. In a press statement on Monday, the commission said the land on which the mall sits was compulsorily acquired for road expansion. The commission dismissed reports that it had upheld the titles for Taj Mall LR 209/13938. NLC said it received a complaint on June 14, 2013, from Kenya Urban Roads Authority (Kura) about the legality or propriety of LR 209/13938 (Taj Mall). Kura stated that the road corridor from North Airport Road to Ngong River was acquired by the government in 1960, and the road survey was done in 1966. The authority said the portion LR 209/13938 was acquired for construction of Outering Road vide Gazette Notice No.1105 of 30th April 1971. "Whereas LR No 7075/13/1 that was amalgamated with LR 7075/24 to form LR 209/13938 is vested in Taj Mall, the title 209/13935 should be surrendered to the commission for regularisation and excision of 7075/13/1 which is vested in the national government for road expansion," read the statement. "This revocation is also confirmed in the Kenya Gazette of 22nd January 206. (Vol CXVIII- No.6)" Airgate Centre proprietor Ramesh Gorasia has said he will not vacate the building. All tenants have left in fear of looming demolition.  His Rams Supermarket is the only business still operating in the mall. Gorasia has pinned notices all around the building informing customers that the supermarket is still operating round the clock.

Chairman of the multi-sectoral committee on unsafe structures, MA Nyakiongora,  said the illegal building will be pulled down. "It has encroached on a road reserve and way-leave hindering the construction of Outering Road," he said in a notice seen by the Star. "Upon expiry of the notice, the illegal development will be demolished at the owner's cost." Other buildings demolished for being on riparian land are Southend Mall, Ukay Centre and part of Oshwal Centre.
