A lion that had been terrorising residents and mauling livestock in Igembe North has been killed by a cow. According to residents, the lion was strangled to death by a cow that was tethered to a tree by its owner. "We suspect the lion died of strangulation when the rope that had tethered the cow got entangled around its neck at Luciuti, the cow was trying to escape," a resident said. Kenya Wildlife Service officer Nathan Gatundu, however, said the lion may have died of exhaustion or hunger. Gatundu said they are conducting investigations to establish what killed the cat. He said the animal had killed several goats in homesteads around the Meru National Park. "We have been giving out forms to homesteads where the animal has attacked and killed their livestock. I can't state the number. It killed two goats on Wednesday and a cow in this week,‚Äù Gatundu told the Star by phone on Friday.
