AFC Leopards attempt to finish the 2018 SportPesa Premier League as runners up received another blow following their 3-1 loss to Kariobangi Sharks yesterday at Kenyatta Stadium Machakos. The third rooted Ingwe were pursuing to reduce the gap between them and second-placed Bandari to a point but Sharks thwarted their hopes to keep their unbeaten league run against Ingwe. Ugandan import George Abege put Sharks ahead in the 13th minute of the game to make it three goals in the last three matches after Patillah Omoto found him with a well executed cross which he nodded past Ezekiel Owade. However, his goal stood for only five minutes as Leopards leveled through Whyvonne Isuza, who capitalized on poor clearance by Sharks’ defence to put the ball past the line. The 1-1 result remained unchanged until half time although Leopards would have doubled the scores. Sharks resumed the final half, firing from all cylinders and their efforts to regain the lead paid off in the 53rd minute when Abege’s shot was parried into Duke Abuya’s path and the play-maker comfortably slotted past Owade. The ecstatic moment in the Sharks bench after the second goal would not dwindle as Harrison Mwendwa teed up Abege to complete his brace, taking his tally to six goals since crossing from Sony Sugar in June. Despite the win, Sharks remain sixth with 46 points — one shy of fifth-placed Sofapaka and six off their match day rivals. Leopards thumped Sharks 2-0 during last year’s final of SportPesa Shield Cup at Kasarani. Ingwe will hope to put the disappointing league result behind when they take on Sofapaka, while Sharks will play Ulinzi Stars in another semi final at the weekend.
