KMPDU on Tuesday took a swipe at Nairobi governor Mike Sonko
condemning him for "politicising" the management of Pumwani Maternity
Hospital. Samuel Oroko asked the governor to immediately reinstate the two doctors who were suspended after bodies of 12 babies were found stashed in a carton at the hospital. The chairman Kenya
Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union threatened to
call a strike if the doctors are not allowed to resume work. He
said Sonko should have handled the matter in a better way by involving
the existing structures for handling any grievances that arise from the
medics' work. "If there is a problem, we have a board to
address the issue," he told journalists at Pumwani hospital. Oroko said
the "board will not allow Sonko to walk around and sack people". "Pumwani has only one operating theatre. How can more than 50 mothers be served when an operation takes an hour. There is no ambulance to refer mothers anywhere." On Monday, the governor suspended the hospital's superintendent Catherine Mutinda following the babies saga which is now under a probe by state agencies. Also suspended were Dr James Kamau - the obstetrician gynaecologist, and the hospital's administrator Zadock Angahya. The
entire board of the facility was also dissolved hours amid Sonko's
claims that the hospital management attempted to cover up the deaths. See: [VIDEO] Sonko suspends Pumwani boss after 12 babies die in machine glitch The
governor said he was briefed that an unknown person had switched off a
generator serving the maternity wing resulting to the fatalities. The
power cut reportedly crippled operations at the central sterile
services department (CSSD). The DPP and DCI have taken up the
investigations. Related: Pumwani nurses air woes after death of 12 babies Click here for the latest political news
