A man committed suicide in Matanya village of Mpeketoni, Lamu West after a domestic tiff with his wife. Philip Ngugi, a 30-year-old father of two is said to have been angered after he found out that his wife was cheating on him. Villagers reported that the man had gone missing two months ago upon learning of his wife's infidelity. His body was found dangling on a tree, a few metres away from his home. Emmanuel Wanyoike, a village elder, said the man had repeatedly complained of his wife's wayward behaviour. "I think he just came back to commit suicide having left two months ago. We were aware of the issues between him and his wife." "We, however, feel he should have pursued other means to resolve the matter. We believe thatâ€™s why he committed suicide," Wanyoike said. Mpeketoni OCPD Christopher Limo said the suspect domestic issues. "Even then, we are still investigating if there is any foul play," Limo said. Area chief Philip Githinji said the man had torched his house and entire belongings before he disappeared. "He even posted his woes on Facebook and even hinted in the post that he was planning to take his life because of what his wife had done to him." Githinji said the man's body is at the Mpeketoni hospital mortuary. The elders asked young couples to learn to solve domestic issues without having to rush to extreme measures like suicide.
