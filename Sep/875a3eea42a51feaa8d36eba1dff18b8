The animosity and mistrust between police and the public often hurts the latter more than the former, a security official has said. Director of the Internal Affairs Unit of the National Police Service Charlton Murithi on Saturday said such a situation is not ideal for fighting crime and urged residents to cooperate with police. “The public are the ones who live with the criminals in their midst. If they do not share information about these criminals with the police because of animosity, then the criminals will continue hurting them,” Muriithi said. He called for better relationship between police and the communities in which the officers work. “As citizens, we need to cooperate. The citizens suffer more if they don't cooperate," he said. Muriithi was speaking at the Bomu Stadium in Mombasa during a sports even aimed at improving interactions between the public and the police. The event was organised by the United Nations Office against Drugs and Crime. “When there is animosity between two people, they cannot work effectively. We all know that unity is strength,” he said. He urged the public to volunteer information about suspicious people because criminal activities hinder growth of businesses. “If you have a shop, you will be forced to close at 7pm instead of 9pm because you will fear the criminals robbing you,” Muriithi said. The official said the service was keen on improving relations between its officers and the public. Two weeks ago, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced abolition of free housing for junior officers as part of reforms in the service. The officers will be required to stay among members of the public.
