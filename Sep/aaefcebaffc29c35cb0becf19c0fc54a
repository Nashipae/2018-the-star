Marakwet West MP William Kisang on Thursday said Kenyans have the power to slash the bloated wage bill through a referendum. He was referring to a proposal by Soy MP Caleb Kositany that the Senate be abolished. Kositany also wants the positions of nominated MPs and MCAs scrapped. Kipsang said: "It is not true that the National Assembly is competing with the Senate. We have worked well and consulted on issues including on the fuel levy. Should the referendum come, Kenyans have a chance to decide on reducing the wage bill." On several occasions, the Senate has accused the National Assembly of plotting to kill devolution. In July, Parliament took issue with the Senate for conducting parallel investigations on matters it was handling. The lawmakers asked senators to steer clear of issues of national concern and restrict themselves to oversight of county affairs. The Senate Committee on ICT vice chair Senator Halake Abshiro, however, dismissed the proposal. They said Kenyan politics is about money, and the people with money "buy democracy". "Women are disadvantaged because they don't have money to win in competitive elections," Abshiro said.
