Schools in the terror-prone Basuba ward in Lamu East have remained closed even as other schools across Kenya opened for the third term a week ago. Pupils and teachers of Basuba, Mararani, Mangai, Kiangwe and Milimani primary schools have stayed away since 2015 because of frequent al Shabaab attacks. The Linda Boni Operation has been ongoing since 2015 to flush out the militants from their hideouts. Residents say it has failed, but security officers say it is a success.

Children are taught by primary and secondary school dropouts. Parents say they are tired of keeping their children at home while their agemates are in school. Some parents have transferred their children to Mokowe Arid Zone Primary School. It is safe but overcrowded. “The number of pupils from the Boni area keeps growing yet we don’t have enough facilities to accommodate them. We’ve exceeded the required capacity and more are still coming. They want to learn. We understand that. We need these issues looked into so we can attend to them well. We need extra teachers and more facilities,” head teacher Omar Ile said yesterday. Basuba MCA Deko Barissa wants the TSC wants all teachers who fl ed to be posted to the Mokowe to fix the teacher shortage. Musa Musuo’s three sons now school at Mokowe. “The recent attacks left at least 11 KDF offi cers dead. They’ve dashed the little hope we had that something could still be done to have these schools opened,” he said. Read: Open Lamu schools, teachers lying about al Shabaab - elders Click
