An alleged impostor walked into Flying Squad offices at the Nairobi regional DCI offices yestersday. Cavin Khaemba attempted to hoodwink a senior detective that he is a military intelligence officer. He went into inspector Benson Musyoka’s office and introduced himself as a KDF spy. The exchange of intelligence information between military and police is procedural, which Khaemba’s move appeared to have breached. He said he holds the rank of a major based at the Kahawa Garrison. Musyoka detained Khaemba and military police officers were called to ascertain his identity. The sleuths escorted him to his home in Zimerman for a search. They recovered a set of military uniform. Khaemba, 29, was yesterday charged at the Milimani courts with forging a KDF identity card and posing as a KDF officer. It is an offence to illegally have items restricted for disciplined forces. Khaemba denied the charges before chief magistrate Francis Andayi. He was released on Sh200,000 bond. The case will be mentioned on October 3.
