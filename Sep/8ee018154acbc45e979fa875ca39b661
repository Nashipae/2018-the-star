The Ministry of Roads has set aside Sh1.2 billion to recarpet the Kiria-ini-Kangema road. Motorists last week blocked the road to protest against its dilapidated state. CS James Macharia on Saturday said the government is in the process of tendering for the reconstruction of the road and appealled for patience. He said the government will do spot patching to make the road passable as tendering continues. Residents said they were making losses and being forced to dig deeper into their pockets to buy spare parts because vehicles were frequently getting damaged. They also confronted a construction worker who was sealing potholes demanding to know which company he worked for. They said Deputy President William Ruto had said Sh700 million had been set aside for the road and wondered why it was being spot patched. But Macharia said the government has factored in the road that has been in a dire state for years. “We advertised the tender last month and the process is on-going,” he said. Last week, MP Peter Kimari asked residents to allow contractors to seal the potholes and assured them the road would be reconstructed. “The state of the road that we use on a daily basis has elongated a 20-minute journey to more than one hour,” he said.
