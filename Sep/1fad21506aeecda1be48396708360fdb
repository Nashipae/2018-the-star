A Mombasa tout arrested for drinking has died in Changamwe police station, causing rage and uproar. Caleb Otieno, 40, was arrested on Monday at 6pm by three officers in a Mikindani bar. He was nabbed alongside a friend, Enos Alubisi, and a woman. A witness told the Star that Otieno was handcuffed from the back and was pushed, hitting his head on a metal bar in a cell corridor and dying on the spot. Because Otieno was drunk, he couldn’t regain balance and fell hard, a source told the Star. He cannot be identified for security reasons. Otieno died at about 12am on Tuesday, a few minutes after the three were booked. After their arrest, the three officers allegedly kept demanding Sh10,000 to release them. Alubisi and the woman were to be charged at the High Court in Mombasa. Otieno’s body is at Coast Provincial General Hospital morgue. The Independent Policing Oversight Authority recorded statements from police who were on duty on that day as well as people in custody. Changamwe police boss Peter Omwana yesterday said Otieno appeared intoxicated and collapsed prior to his death. He said the death was natural. Omwana said Otieno was among four people arrested at an illicit brew den in Mikindani. He dismissed as “mere speculations” human rights, witnesses and family reports that Otieno was handcuffed, pushed and hit a metal bar, leading to his death. Muslims for Human Rights said police are trying to cover-up the death. Muhuri rapid-response officer Francis Auma said they will provide an independent pathologist to rule out foul play. “Killings in the hands of police have become too much. Ipoa is overwhelmed,” Auma said at the High Court in Mombasa. Muhuri chairman Khelef Khalifa said a police inquiry must be launched to unravel the truth. Otieno is survived by six children. His firstborn, Nelson Otieno, said, “My dad didn’t have to die this way.”
