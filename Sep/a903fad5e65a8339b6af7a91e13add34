Former Nairobi governor Evans Kidero has filed a case seeking to bar the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission from searching and seizing his property. Last Thursday, detectives from the EACC raided his home in Muthaiga and later took him to his office on Riverside Drive, Westlands, where they mounted a search for documents believed to be in relation to a criminal case he is facing.

Kidero argues that terms of the search warrant are vague, open-ended and have since been abused by EACC to go on a fishing expedition “in a desperate bid to look for incriminating evidence” against him, his family and employees. “Since I left the field of politics after the August 2017 General Election, I have been the recipient of continued threats, attacks, harassment, witch-hunt and intimidation by EACC,” he said. “I was shocked, scared, humiliated and severely traumatised when on September 20 my home in Muthaiga was raided and literally turned upside down by about 40 mean, vicious and gun-wielding officials of the EACC.” It is Kidero’s argument that the warrant dated September 19 was obtained without following due procedure as he was not granted any notice before the warrant was obtained to search his premises “There was no search warrant that was obtained against any of my properties. So by searching and seizing my properties without a warrant, the commission acted illegitimately,” Kidero said. Watch: [VIDEO] Kidero picked up by EACC at his Muthaiga home Click here for
