Commercial Banks will continue to offer loans at 13 per cent following a decision by the Monetary Policy Committee to retain the base lending rate at nine per cent. The decision was pegged on stronger economic growth and macroeconomic stability witnessed throughout the year. "The Committee noted that inflation expectations remained well anchored within the target range, but concluded that there was need to monitor the second-round inflationary effects arising from the VAT on petroleum products, and any perverse response to its previous decisions," CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge said yesterday. This means inflation is expected to increase in the short-term with implementation of the eight per cent tax on fuel taking effect. “However, it is expected to remain within the target range due to lower food prices reflecting favorable weather,” he said. Private sector credit grew to 4.3 per cent in the 12 months to august driven by increased lending to manufacturing, building and construction, consumer durables and trade sectors. Lending to the private sector is expected to increase gradually. The survey showed resilience in the banking sector backed by the transfer of assets and liabilities from Chase Bank (In Receivership) to SBM (Kenya) Limited on August 17, 2018.
