A 21-year-old Baringo woman was taken before the Kabarnet law court for throwing her three-weeks-old baby into a pit latrine. Elizabeth Lemojong appeared before resident magistrate Nerolin Idagwa. The magistrate ordered her to undergo a mental assessment before taking plea. "She should first be taken through mental examination. Maybe the accused could be suffering from post-natal depression" Idagwa said. Lemojong was accused of committing the heinous act at Logumgum village in Marigat, Baringo South sub-county on September 18 at around 9pm. "Neighbours who heard the child's cries rescued and rushed him to Marigat sub-county hospital. The baby survived," chief Zephaniah Lekachuma said. The administrator said he reported the matter to the police and county Children's Officers who acted fast to arrest the suspect. He said the woman borrowed the keys to the toilet from her landlord before plunging the baby, her second-born, into the toilet. However, Idagwa preferred the accused be examined by a psychiatrist at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) pending the mention on September 26. If found guilty, the accused shall face charges of acting contrary to Section 127(1) of the Children Act, No. 3 of 2001. The child is currently at a children's home in Kabarnet town while the mother is in police custody pending the determination. Click here for the latest political news
