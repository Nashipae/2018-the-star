At least six MPs have asked DCI George Kinoti and DPP Noordin Haji to speed up investigations into the murder of Sharon Otieno. They spoke on Monday at Kerugoya stadium when Kirinyaga woman rep Wangui Ngirici issued sanitary towels to school girls in her constituency. Ngirici also launched an initiative dubbed boy and girl empowerment on Monday. Bungoma woman rep Catherine Wambilyianga said the main suspects in the murder should now be in custody. "We are asking Kinoti and Haji to bring to book the main killers despite their position," she said. Sharon was abducted on Monday alongside Nation journalist Barack Oduor from a hotel in Rongo. The journalist, however, managed to escape by jumping out of the moving vehicle and seeking help.
