US Ambassador Robert Godec has called on Kenyans to support President Uhuru Kenyatta in the war against corruption. Godec said the war on corruption requires collective responsibility to succeed. Speaking in Malindi during the Inaugural Arid and Semi-Arid Lands conference, Godec asked the Director of Criminal investigations and the Director of Public Prosecutions to take the lead. He said corruption was slowing economic development. The ambassador said the US government was committed to increasing funding to help ASAL counties develop.
