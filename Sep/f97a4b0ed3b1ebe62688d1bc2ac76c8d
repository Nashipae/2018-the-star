Machakos county commissioner Abdullahi Galgalo has urged political leaders to work with government administrators in the best interests of residents. Galgalo said on Tuesday he has no interest in Machakos politics but is committed to protect residents and their property. He promised to work with all leaders. He spoke while meeting MCAs at the county assembly premises. The commissioner and his entire security team were hosted by speaker Florence Mwangangi. Last week, Machakos governor Alfred Mutua met Galgalo and accused assembly speaker Florence Mwangangi of engaging in politics instead of discharging her constitutional duties. The governor said Mwangangi should resign if she wants to engage in local politics. Galgalo told the MCAs he has no interest in local politics. “I don’t have any interest in your politics, I am out to effectively serve you as Machakos residents. If you see me with any leader, don’t say I belong to a certain politician. Zero, zero zero. I will work with all elected leaders,” he said. “One day I will be transferred or go to my rural home after my retirement but you will all remain here since it is your native home,” Galgalo told the MCAs.
