Dr Richard Muita, a lecturer at the Institute for Meteorological Training, said November will be the peak month for the rains, which will end in December. The weatherman said Nyanza, Western and North Rift counties will be among the first counties to receive rainfall. “The rain will be distributed well in most places,” he said.
