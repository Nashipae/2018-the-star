Every Bigpin track has always orbited around a certain theme: himself. He has been around for a long while and been quite impactful while at it. Bigpin began his career in a group called the Pirates, and if you recall, he actually featured on the late E-Sir’s “Jo”. He came with several admirable taglines, including “The Beast from the East”, as well as the “Luo Rap King”. Well, he lived up to this title by ensuring the his fans were entertained. Bigpin was truly the coolest artist to have on your track back in the day. He worked with top artistes like Nameless, Patonee, Amani, the late K-rupt and Sanaipei. He managed to release a couple of bangers, like “Natafuta” and “Bigpin”. His sound was so appealing it earned him a Kora Award in 2004 for Best Male Artiste in East Africa. After the longest dormant period of his career, Bigpin is back into the scene, looking sharper and refined. The music scene requires an artiste who can mould himself with the ever-changing trends, and now Jatelo seems to have mastered the art. When it comes to execution, Bigpin now plans to his strengths and comfortably fits into the group of artists who are producing club and radio-destined tunes. From his latest release, “Ginene (Google Me),” you can tell that he still maintains his old sense of pride, spitting verses that speak highly of himself. This time he ensures he maintains a sound that is more familiar and entertaining. His decision to work with Pacho Records on this track might be the most informed decision he has ever made since the outset of his career. It’s always a good thing to see pioneers and shapers of the music industry rejoin the scene. It even gets exciting when they prove that they still have what it takes to make good music. From what Bigpin is already doing, it’s already evident that he is back to stay. We can’t wait to see how this comeback goes.
