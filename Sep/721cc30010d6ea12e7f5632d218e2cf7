Pumwani Maternity Hospital superintendent Catherine Mutinda has been suspended following the death of 12 babies in unclear circumstances. The claim is that the babies died after machines in the sterile services department failed. Mutinda was suspended on Monday alongside Dr James Kamau - the obstetrician gynaecologist, and the hospital's administrator Zadock Angahya. The entire board of the facility was also dissolved hours after Nairobi governor Mike Sonko unearthed an attempt to cover up the deaths. The governor said he was briefed that an unknown person had switched off a generator serving the maternity wing resulting to the fatalities. The situation reportedly crippled operations at the central sterile services department (CSSD). Sonko, in a statement, said the matter was reported to the Pangani police station for further investigations. The county boss said he was told that only one child had died after he followed up a tip off by members of the public who learned of the situation. Riding on a motorbike, he conducted an impromptu visit at the hospital where the dead infants were discovered stashed in paper bags. "Stern action will be taken against anyone found to be sabotaging the good services offered to our mothers and sisters who come to deliver in this facility," Sonko said. "I want to categorically state that human life must be respected no matter the case." Sonko was flanked by area MCA Paul Irungu. The hospital, in its defence, told the governor that the bodies in the box were of children who had died last Friday. There are also claims the hospitalÂ only recorded six deaths of the 12 cases.
