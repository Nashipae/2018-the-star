Police on Tuesday seized bhang of Sh3.5 million in street value after a raid at Naivasha's Kayole estate. A woman believed to be the main distributor of the drug in the town escaped and is being hunted by the police. The officers, acting on a tip-off by members of the public, found 11 sacks of the drug parked ready for sale. Naivasha Deputy OCPD John Kwasa said cases of bhang use are on the rise in the area. Kwasa said the woman they are after distributes the drug in Gilgil, Mai Mahiu, and adjacent areas. He told journalists at the Naivasha police station that the discovery as a major win in the war against drugs and alcohol abuse. "We understand she operates within some parts of Naivasha, Kiambu, and Nairobi. We are tracking her down," he said. Kwasa described the woman as an accomplished peddler who for years has thrived in engaging in the outlawed business. He said police are also looking for her accomplices who assisted her in ferrying the contraband to other major towns. "Itâ€™s a cartel that we are keen on dismantling and bringing to book all those involved," he said. Kwasa hailed the cooperation by members of the community saying it will help reach the goal of a drug-free society. Click here for the latest political news
