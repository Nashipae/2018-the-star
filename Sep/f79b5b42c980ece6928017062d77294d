The Nairobi assembly plans to emulate the Senate and hold its sittings in the wards. Acting speaker Chege Mwaura said the aim of the mashinani sittings is for the electorate to appreciate the role of the MCAs. The leaders will listen to the problems that city residents face and come up with proper legislation to address them. “I'm working on a modality that will enable us have vikao vya mtaani [subcounty and ward sittings]. They won't necessarily be in formal settings, we want to reach wananchi or come up with a way for wananchi get to know what we are doing,” he said. Mwaura was elected acting Speaker on Tuesday last week after MCAs vowed that impeached Speaker Beatrice Elachi will not be allowed to do House business.

But she obtained a court order that reinstated her. Mwaura's plan was supported by Majority leader Abdi Guyo, who said it is long overdue. Guyo said he and his Minority counterpart Elias Otieno will support Mwaura in his endevour to unite the House. Guyo said the mashinani sittings will bring synergy between the MCAs and the electorate. It will help ward representatives to better understand the challenges that residents face. The two leaders spoke during a fundraising at St Monica Catholic Church in Njiru on Sunday. Education CEC Janet Ouko also attended the event. Last week, the Senate held its first sittings outside Nairobi in Uasin Gishu county. The lawmakers want to gauge the successes and failures of devolution in counties. They visited seven counties in the former Western and Rift Valley provinces. Click here for the latest political news
