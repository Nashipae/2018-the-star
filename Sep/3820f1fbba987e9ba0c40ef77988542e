City Hall has suspended issuing liquor licences until an audit of outlets next month is done. The Nairobi City County Alcoholic Drinks Control and Licensing Board issued the directive yesterday following complaints over the increase of bars within residential estates. The board said they will review licences for existing bars with the aim of reducing the number of bars and pubs in residential areas and near schools. The board’s chairman, Kennedy Odhiambo, said the audit will reveal pubs and bars operating illegally. “We have to know how many pubs are operating and their locations and decide which ones to shut down,” Odhiambo said. Odhiambo said parents had complained that their children were being lured into alcoholism because bars were opening from as early as 2pm. “Our children say they have a concert called afternoon jam sessions but they are held up in bars and we don’t know what happens there,” a Roysambu resident told the board when it met in the area yesterday. The board urged residents to form Nyumba Kumi groups through which they can identify and report pubs operating outside the law. The previous board said there were 12,500 licensed bars but last year’s audit showed some 14,593 outlets were operating in the city. Regional commissioner Kang’ethe Thuku said it was worrying that there were three times more pubs than schools in Kasarani subcounty. The constituency has 300 public schools and 959 liquor outlets. He attributed the high number of outlets to unemployment, poverty and dysfunctional families Thuku said they will revoke licences of those violating liquor laws. He directed officers to close bars that open earlier than 5pm and those located within 300 metres of schools and residential buildings.
