Naiboi has hit the Internet hard with his viral song, 2in1. Many Kenyan artistes take so much time and money investing in a good video but forget creativity. Speaking to Word Is, Naiboi said visuals play a big role, but creativity is king. “I respect those artistes who put up a budget on making a video because I do the same. But they should not forget that creativity comes a long way eventually,” he said. For his new trending track, Naiboi simply improvised. “There was no budget. Most of the videos were sent to me via phone or email, and even for the editor, I just bought him lunch. I would say it was a zero budget song.” Naiboi incorporated Kenyan artistes based on the inspiration from the hit song, Don’t You Need Somebody by Redone. After watching the video, he thought it was a good concept and he said, why not. His main idea was to have as many Kenyan artistes as possible, so that all fans can come together in support of Kenyan music. It’s a good feeling to have my song trending, though unexpected, because before I did the video, we had a conversation with Nyash and it was a concern that not many Kenyan songs were trending by then, and so I wanted as many artistes as possible to help push our music. Naiboi’s 2in1 is on Song By Safaricom, and he says it is a good platform for his music to reach as many fans as possible.
