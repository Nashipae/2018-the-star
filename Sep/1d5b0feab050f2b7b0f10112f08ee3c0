Chief Justice David Maraga has challenged the Independent Police Oversight Authority to consider the rights of the police as they discharged their duties. He cited the case where a police officer was attacked after seeking to stop a carjacking on Thika Road in April.

"The police must also be protected. I am happy that you have also said that you will be neutral in your activities and ensure that policies launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta a few days ago are well implemented," the CJ said. He spoke at the Supreme Court boardroom on Friday during the swearing in of the nine IPOA officials. The officials are Ann Makori (Chairperson), Doreen Nkatha, Fatuma Mohamud, Walter Owen, Jonathan Lodumpul, John Muriithi, Praxedes Tororey, and Jimmy Mutuku. Uhuru appointed the new Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) team after that led by Macharia Njeru left in May. The old team assumed office in 2011 following the police reforms after post Election Violence in 2018 where more than 3,000 people died. "Many people do not know what IPOA does and I challenge to go out and explain to Kenyans your role," Maraga said. "Under Article 1 of the Constitution, all the sovereign powers belong to the people. These are the people you will be serving." The incoming IPOA chair said they appreciate the police and the work they do. "We will also work with all the stakeholders to make Kenya a better place," Makori said. Makori said they will explain to the police and the public their role as stipulated in the Constitution. "IPOA will be accessible to the public and Kenyans," Makori said. Also read:Â Cop killed in Mt Elgon after sons attack father over plan to marry second wife Click here for the latest political news
