Governors have blamed the national government for poor services and stalled projects in the counties. They said Kenyans have failed to access good services at the counties following "unorthodox means" used by the national government to blackmail them. “We ask for goodwill from the National Government in dealing with the matters affecting our people,” CoG Chairman Josephat Nanok said. Nanok was speaking on behalf of governors after an extraordinary meeting at a Nairobi hotel. The county bosses said the slow disbursement of funds hampers implementation of development projects and service delivery to deny Kenyans basic needs. “On the delay of disbursements of funds from the National Treasury, we are concerned that three months into the Financial Year 2018/19 only twenty-five counties have received partial funds for the 1st quarter. And they only received Sh 4.3 billion,” they said. “We urge the National Treasury to hasten the process to enable Counties to optimally perform their functions and improve service delivery.” They want an extensive costing of all functions performed by both levels of governments and allocations made based on a formula where resources follow functions. They also asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to suspend the 16 per cent tax on petroleum products to bring down the cost of living since Kenya was facing inflation ahead.
