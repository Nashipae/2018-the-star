Boda boda passengers will now pay Sh100 for services within Nairobi, Kisumu, Nakuru and Mombasa following the fuel hike. Motorbike taxi users outside these cities will pay Sh200 after the 16% VAT tax kicked in on Saturday. On Monday, the Boda Boda Association said passengers in Busia, Nyeri, Naivasha and Bungoma will pay Sh50 within a town and Sh100 for services outside the town. In a statement on Monday, chairman Kevin Mubadi said they raised fares because of the fuel tax. "We wish to request our members to adjust to above fare rates with immediate effect. To our esteemed customers we apologize for any inconveniences caused," he said. Mubadi asked the president to revoke the implementation of the VAT and save Kenyans from the high cost of living. Their announcement comes just hours after Matatu saccos agreed to increase fares in Nairobi by Sh20 and 20% for long distances outside the city. During a meeting in Nairobi on Monday, leaders of at least 100 matatu saccos said they will not go to court to challenge the new fuel prices. Some members had suggested that matatus hold strikes until the government reduces fuel prices. Matatu Welfare Association Dickson Mbugua, who chaired the meeting, said they will engage their members to ensure fares are not exaggerated.
