The ODM Youth League wants the national executive council to take action against MPs who opposed President Uhuru Kenyatta’s fuel tax. President John Ketora said any leader against the March 9 handshake between the President and ODM leader Raila Odinga is an enemy of the country. Ketora was flanked by ODM executive director Oduor Ong’wen and the league's deputy treasurer Sheila Koskei. He was addressing journalists on Sunday at Greflow Hotel in Kitengela where a three-day youth workshop is being held. “The Treasury needs more money. The President and the former Prime Minister are striving to unite the country. They are being fought by MPs who have no clue about how the country should be run," Ketora said. He said some elected leaders do not love their country and that is why they opposed the tax yet they know there is a shortfall in the budget. “County governments' projects are being hampered because the Treasury has not released money. Our President proposed the eight per cent VAT on petroleum products to raise money for running the country,” Ketora said. Twenty-eight regional party leaders took issue with ODM lawmakers who rebelled against Raila on the tax vote. Koskei said they discussed the state of the nation, the two-thirds gender rule, unemployment and state appointments. “We are appealing to the judiciary to speed up the murder case of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno and others. We demand that our women and girls, who have become targets of murderers, be protected,” Koskei said. The workshop ends on Monday. Click here for the latest political news
