The victory of Eliud Kipchoge in Berlin Marathon continues to excite the nation as Nandi county has decided to dedicate an ultra modern athletics training facility under construction to him. Governor Stephen Sang while announcing the decision to change the name explained that it had been occasioned by the exemplary performance of the new world marathon record holder. But as the Sang made the announcement, Nandi sports chief officer, Kennedy Tanui, clarified that it is a new sports complex currently under construction adjacent to the Nandi Agricultural show ground that will be named after the marathoner. There was confusion following the
announcement by Sang on Monday
to re-name Kapsabet-based Kipchoge
Keino Stadium, Eliud Kipchoge
Sports Complex. The same sentiments were
repeated by Athletics Kenya (AK)
North Rift chairman Abraham Mutai,
who said the old stadium will remain
as Kipchoge Keino. Sang said Nandi County had lost
many opportunities to improve Kip
Keino Stadium to Uasin Gishu, who
have a facility with a similar name. He said his county government
had taken a deliberate step to
construct an ultra-modern athletics
training complex that would have
200-bed hostels for athletes. “We want to have a fully-fledged
training facility for our athletes
and we are dedicating it to Eliud
Kipchoge who hails from our
county,” Sang said. The old stadium will remain as
Kipchoge Keino and has been
handed over to Sports Kenya
to complete the renovations
started by former governor
Cleophas Lagat. The old stadium is named after
legendary athlete Kipchoge Keino,
who started his athletic prowess
at the stadium constructed by the
colonial government in 1958.
The stadium has, however, undergone
a total makeover, to a tune
of Sh120 million.
