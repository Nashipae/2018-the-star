Governor Okoth Obado's personal assistant Michael Oyamo will be detained for 14 days after the prosecution sought for more time to conclude investigations into the murder of Sharon Otieno. The charge of murder has also been read out to him but he has not pleaded to it. Justice Luka Kimaru said that it's not a formal charge but it's to inform him what he might be charged with. The prosecution through State Counsel Tom Mbali had asked the court for extra time saying that the case is very complex. Mbali also said the investigators are still pursuing other suspects. He said cellular devices of the suspects have to undergo forensic examinations and that they are also waiting for DNA results which have been extracted from the suspects.
