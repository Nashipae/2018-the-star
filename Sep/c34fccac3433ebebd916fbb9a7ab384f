Director of Immigration services Alexander Muteshi said the foreigners had travelled by bus to Kenya and were waiting for their passports to be stamped when officials realized the visas were not genuine. They include 59 Ugandans, seven Burundians and five Tanzanians. “We are planning to repatriate them to their respective countries.
