NASA Leaders Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka have lauded the move by President Uhuru Kenyatta to reduce the VAT on fuel by half. The president on Friday proposed the reduction of the levy from 16 per cent to 8 per cent and sent the Finance Bill to parliament for approval of the amendment. Raila and Kalonzo said if approved by parliament, the reduction will effectively reduce the already skyrocketing cost of living. The party leaders said it's now upon parliament to legislate the proposal and for service providers to reduce fuel prices accordingly. “After this [year's] budget, Kenyans cried because of 16% VAT, now it has been reduced. The ball is on parliament, we need to balance between development and affordable cost of living, but most importantly is the fight against corruption,” Raila said. Kalonzo urged traders who have increased the prices of commodities including fuel to follow the president's wish and lower the prices. He said fuel is the country's key economic driver so when the price is increased, all the other economies of scale are instantly affected. “I want to applaud President Kenyatta for listening to the cry of the common wananchi and reducing the VAT from 16 to 8 per cent. We now expect our business people to reduce the price of commodities which they had already increased to affordable prices,” Kalonzo said. The two leaders spoke on Saturday when they attended the wedding of Khalid Nadhif, son to former Garissa Governor Nadhif Jama at Memon Masjid in South C. They repeated the same message during the wedding of Faron Mwenda, son to Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi at Karen Blixen in Nairobi.
