ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi is rooting for the use of national IDs during voting, instead of a voter’s card. He said many Kenyans are disenfranchised by the twin process of ID and voter’s card registration. Mudavadi said the government needs to do away with voter’s cards to sanitise elections. “A single ID card acquisition is urgent and should be a compulsory component of comprehensive electoral reforms to achieve electoral justice,” he said in an interview on Saturday. During the National Stakeholders’ Post-Election Evaluation Forum in Nairobi on Wednesday, political party leaders and civil society organisations urged IEBC to either scrap the requirement or engage the registration bureau to issue the voter’s card together with IDs. They said millions of eligible voters — about five million in the last General Election — did not participate in the polls because they did not have voter’s cards. Mudavadi said the introduction of a single ID card for all electoral transactions, including voting, will enhance equality of the vote. He said a single identification document will also eliminate costs of an “unnecessarily bloated and expensive election”. “A single ID should be acquired at birth, which then translates into your school registration, ID upon attaining the mandatory age, personal pin number and driver’s licence among others,” Mudavadi said. “This will not be unique to Kenyans. The US and EU members use this system for easy identification and processing of their citizens,” he added. The government has previously recommended to the IEBC that it abandons voter registration and use national identity cards for voting. Mudavadi said the proposal will end electoral fraud.
