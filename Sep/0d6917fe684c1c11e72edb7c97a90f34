National team captain Mercy Moim has warned their opponents to underrate them at their own peril ahead of the FIVB World Championships in Tokyo, Japan later this month. The side coached by Japheth Munala is drawn in Pool ‘D’ alongside former world champions Brazil, Dominican Republic, Kazakhstan, Puerto Rico and Serbia at the September 29 to October 20 tournament. Moim said they are not going to Japan to add to the numbers but to rather to stand up and be counted. “We can even go all the way and reach the final, who knows,” quipped the left attacker, who turns up for former national league champions, Kenya Prisons. She added: “We know our opponents since we have played against them before and we know exactly what to do. Besides, they are just women like us and therefore we will be out to give a good account of ourselves.” Interestingly, Kenya’s opponents at the three-week event are all above them as per the 2017 FIVB ranking. The East Africans are placed 33rd while Serbia are third with Dominican Republic ninth, Puerto Rico (13) and Kazakhstan (21) . Kenya’s African compatriots, Cameroon, are placed 18th. Moim, who has had professional stints in Europe, said they have trained well ahead of the championship but was quick to lash at the government for not ignoring the sport despite recent successes regionally, in Africa and in the world. “The players are in good form right now and our fitness levels are impressive. However, we are still wondering why the government is not committed to developing the sport despite the achievements we have had in recent past,” said Moim. The team of 14 players are currently on residential training at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani ahead of their departure to the host nation on Tuesday.
