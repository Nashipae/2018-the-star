MPs from Kiambu county have applauded the government’s fight against corruption. MPs James Githua (Kabete), Patrick Wainaina (Thika Town) and Jonah Mburu (Lari) said the war has seen the senior government officials spend nights in police custody and answering charges in courts. Githua said development cannot be achieved when corrupt people occupy top offices. He praised President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto for the war on corruption. “We stand firm to support our leaders clear the public service from corruption so as to achieve the big four agenda smoothly,” he said. “The offences comes first, then your post. The office you hold did not commit the offences you are being accused, but you yourself,” Wainaina added. Read: No community targetted in corruption fight, just individuals - Ruto Click here for
