Cancer patients in Bungoma can breathe a sigh of relief after a private hospital opened a treatment centre. Bungoma West Hospital in Kanduyi that is located on the Eldoret-Malaba highway will save patients the trouble of travelling to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. The hospital’s compliance officer Dr Sunday Dennis told the Star on Friday the facility will serve patients from neighbouring counties such as Busia. He said patients who need dialysis will also receive care at the hospital. Dennis said the number of cancer patients being treated at the hospital in the last one month has increased from five to 10 per week. ‘We now offer chemotherapy and palliative care for cancer patients," he said. A former police officer from Tongaren, Richard Wawire, said he does not have to to make the long trip to Eldoret anymore. According to a World Health Organization report, cancer kills 8.8 million people globally per year. Related: 13 Kenyan MPs being treated in India for cancer Click here for the latest political news
