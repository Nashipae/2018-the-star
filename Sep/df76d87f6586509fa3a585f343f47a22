It's something millions of us do
every single day, but when the Duchess of Sussex closed her car door on
Tuesday, the internet was watching and had something to say. Arriving at the Royal Academy of Arts to attend her first solo event since becoming a royal, Meghan stepped out of her car - having had the door opened. She then shut it behind her. Some praised her "down to earth" and "humble" attitude, while others joked she may put someone out of a job. Etiquette expert William Hanson pointed out that this was not in fact a protocol breach. "Usually,
if you are a member of the royal family or a dignitary, you have a
member of staff to open and close a car door for you," he told Radio 1
Newsbeat. He said this was for security reasons rather than "airs and graces". It
appears the person who opened the door then stepped out of the way to
allow the Duchess, 37, to greet her host and then close the door behind
her. "A princess who still takes the time to shut her car door.
Well done Meghan," the Sun's royal correspondent Emily Andrews tweeted. Well
and truly over-shadowing the main event - which was an opening of an
exhibition of works from the Oceania region - the door soon became a
Twitter moment. The feminist and former UN advocate has form for this sort of behaviour. Last week, at the launch of a charity cookbook, the former Suits actress again closed her own car door. Earlier this month, one US journalist
even claimed to have seen Meghan in a London street clearing up after
her dog. However, it was not verified to have been the Duchess herself. There are, however, certain rules Meghan won't be breaking. "Now
that Meghan is a member of the royal family, there's no more selfies,
no more autographs, she can't vote and all public social media has to be
deleted," William Hanson told Newsbeat. Click here for the latest political news
