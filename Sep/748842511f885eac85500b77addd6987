ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi wants the anti-graft agency to probe the Kenya Pipeline Corporation for alleged misuse of public funds. Mudavadi said the energy sector and particularly the petroleum industry is "rotten" and responsible for the high taxation on poor Kenyans. He said the 16 per cent levy on petroleum products would have been unnecessary if the company managers had integrity and were accountable. “When Nairobians, for example, pay Sh127.80 for a litre of petrol, a whooping Sh55.19 goes to taxes and levies used to pay stolen loans,” Mudavadi said. Mudavadi said the cost of fuel including pipeline transport, losses and storage, as well as well dealers’ margins account for Sh14.79 per litre and the pump price should, therefore, be Sh72.61 only. “The levies are almost at par with the landed cost of the product! This is unheard of everywhere else in the world. It is simply unacceptable,” he added. He asked the EACC and DCI to investigate the company over the alleged construction of 10 pump station tanks worth Sh4.9 billion, KPC Line 5 project contract of Sh48.4 billion and Valve Automation Projects that was to cost Sh1.2 billion but rose to Sh 5.1 billion. “It will be interesting to know how much the country has lost in all these transactions and who the beneficiaries were,” he said.
