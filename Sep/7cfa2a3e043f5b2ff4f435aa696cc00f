A police source said the gold weighs 4.6kg. It arrived in the country in February, with plans of being legitimised and sold to the foreign market as if it originated from Kenya. The main smuggler is believed to be a multi-millionaire Turkish and American citizen based in Dubai. The smuggler has close ties with leaders in Congo and Kenya. The person in question supplies military equipment and construction material to different countries. The individual is believed to have visited Kenya severally, using four well-connected Congolese citizens living in Kenya, to help him smuggle gold out of mineral-rich Congo.
