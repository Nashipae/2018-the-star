The county government of Garissa has allocated Sh450 million towards skills training , entrepreneurship and home industries to empower youth and women. Deputy Governor Abdi Dagane said the government is taking a bolder step to empower youth by helping them acquire necessary technical and practical skills and curb high rates of unemployment. “Some Sh50 million has been set aside to have a modern vocational training centre and equip the existing centers in Garissa , Dadaab and Bura,’’ said Dagane. He spoke yesterday during the official launch of the Garissa County Youth Employment Compact. The USAID-led programme is aimed at empowering vulnerable youths by training them to acquire skills for self employment. It brings together youth employment stakeholders to advance development agenda in the county.
