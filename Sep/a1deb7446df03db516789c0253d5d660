Opposition leader Raila Odinga has reiterated the need to find a solution to the 16 per cent VAT on petroleum products. Raila said the government should balance between protecting vulnerable Kenyans and raising revenue. He spoke on Tuesday after a meet with former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth at his Capitol Hill. "The challenge now is to find ways of balancing between the two... A way out has to be found," he said. Noting that the increase will hurt employers, Raila said the government should find other means to raise funds.  "We discussed the legitimate concern that the rising cost of fuel will touch all other areas and could cause food inflation and demands for higher pay by workers," he said. Drawing from his Treasury background, Kenneth shared insights on what can be done to balance the need to raise money without raising the cost of fuel. Raila had earlier urged Kenyans not to panic over the hiked fuel prices saying it will soon be reversed. The ODM leader said he has faith that President Uhuru Kenyatta will shelve the increment once he assents to the bill as passed by Parliament.
