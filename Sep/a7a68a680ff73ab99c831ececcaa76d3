A suspected bandit surrendered to police in Marakwet after killing three members of a family for failing to share out cows stolen during a raid in Tiaty, Baringo county. Elijah Tolimo, 27, accosted the family of another suspected cattle rustler, only identified as Lortamuk, at Jelimo village killing the three. He presented himself to officers at Tot police station in the neighbouring Marakwet East constituency. Marakwet East police boss Lemmy Njiru said an AK-47 rifle and 15 rounds of ammunition were recovered from the suspect after he surrendered. "He confessed to the police that he shot the three after Lortamuk refused to give him two cows that he and others had stolen during a raid last year." "Tolimo said he went back to revenge by attacking the homestead. He killed two herders and a child in the midnight attack on Thursday," Njiru said. The name of the village Tolimo referred to was not immediately established but Kerio Valley has had incidents of cattle rustling for many years. Njiru said the suspect will be taken back to Tiaty where he will be interrogated further to disclose the name of the village they had raided. "Police in Tiaty will determine whether they will charge the suspect with cattle theft alongside murder." The suspect is said to have crossed the border to Tot police station for fear of being lynched by locals in Tiaty. "He [the suspect] decided to come here because his life was in danger in Baringo. We will return him back shortly," Njiru added. Peace has returned to Kerio Valley after the two years of deadly clashes triggered by livestock theft. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangâ€™i on February 19 toured Kerio Valley and ordered police to arrest banditry suspects. Click here for the latest political news
