Mainga said the building was hindering railway operations. "The building which has encroached about 15 m of the railway
reserve poses a great risk to railway operations since, it among others,
interfered with the drainage system along the line. On many occasions,
especially during the rainy season, Kenya Railways has had to suspend train
operations on the line due the poor drainage,"he said. Mainga said : "We will soon publicize all encroachers who have continued to
occupy the railway reserve through residential and commercial establishments’
owner occupied and tenant occupied buildings, religious, educational and health
institutions with no legal title or ownership rights." He informed the public who may be occupying cooperation's land with or without prior knowledge, that it is criminal. "Anyone found violating
this law is liable to imprisonment for a period of up to 10 years as per the
Kenya Railways Corporation Act. Being a transmission line, the Railway is
covered by the Way Leaves Act which forbids any businesses hindering operations
on the way leave,"he said. More: Flats, churches and charity home flattened in Dandora demolitions Click here for the latest political news
