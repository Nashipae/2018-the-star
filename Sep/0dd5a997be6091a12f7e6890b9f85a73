According to Margaret Kaboche, an aunt to the deceased, they were having lunch at around 4.00pm on Saturday when they heard the two men quarrelling outside. Kaboche said the deceased was questioning the suspect why he planted maize in the land the previous day despite an existing court case. “Mangala opened the bonnet of his car and took a gun and shot the deceased twice on the chest. He then shot in the air twice and sped off,” she said. Isukha South MCA, Farouk Machanje said no one has a right to kill another even when there is a dispute. Machanje asked police to investigate the matter and determine how the suspect was in possession of a firearm. “We are calling upon the police to revoke his license and take away the gun. Previously he has threatened the villagers with the same gun and time,” said Machanje Confirming the incident, Paul Gathara Kakamega East Sub County Criminal Investigations Officer (DCIO) said the suspect surrendered himself to the police after the incident.
