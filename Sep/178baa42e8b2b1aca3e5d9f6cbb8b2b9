The Kenya Red Cross Society has partnered with Safaricom to introduce an SMS based information tool to provide timely warnings. The SMS platform will be used to give information for disasters to lessen the adverse effects on communities. The platform duped M-Salama, will be available to all Safaricom subscribers. It will offer information on impending or upcoming natural disasters such as floods, famine and drought to enable users make early decisions on how to stay out of harm’s way. “During the recent floods, we sent out more than ten million early warning messages, information that guided many families to move to higher ground.
