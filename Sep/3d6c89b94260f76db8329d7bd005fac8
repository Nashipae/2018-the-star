Parliamentary leadership has raised concern over what is emerging to be pure ignorance of House procedures among members of the National Assembly.MPs have recently exhibited lack of knowledge on critical House businesses, something that has attracted the attention of Speaker Justin Muturi. Last week, Muturi reprimanded Finance and National Planning committee chairman Joseph Limo after the team approved former nominated Senator Halima Abdille, despite failing to meet qualification as spelt out in the Salaries and Remuneration Act.Abdille was the PSC nominee to the SRC.Muturi rejected the nomination raising questions on the competence of parliamentary committees and their membership. “If the person does not meet the qualifications, you are setting the person up for embarrassment because somebody is going to challenge this nominee in court and it is this House that is going to be made to look bad or be left with an egg on its face,” the Speaker said.Another front where some MPs have exposed their ignorance of law is impeachment threats issued against some government officials. Majority leader Aden Duale and his Minority counterpart John Mbadi said neither of the three censure threats that have been ‘sponsored’ by a section of the lawmakers in the 12th Parliament followed procedures of the House. “You don’t need to walk around parliamentary corridors, bar, cafeteria and the media centre to solicit signatures and issue press statements on the matter to state your position,” Duale said.
