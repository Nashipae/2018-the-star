Governor Jackson Mandago of Uasin Gishu has interdicted 17 employees over corruption. The 17 were involved in defrauding the county through the computer system. “They were defrauding the county using our computer system and we cannot allow such dishonest people to be among our staff,” said Mandago. He said some residents had formed the habit of colluding with staff to evade paying taxes to the county or engage in corruption. “We want to tell members of the public that it is very illegal to evade paying taxes or pay bribes in order to get services from the county government,” said Mandago. The governor said residents have a right to access services free of  charge except where they are required to pay and be issued with official receipts. “If any of our employees asks for bribe they should be reported so that we take action against them because I will not entertain graft under my administration,” Mandago who was speaking in Eldoret on Friday. Mandago said 42 others in the parking department had been sent home last year after they presented fake banking sleeps for money collected as parking fees. The sacked parking department workers diverted more than Sh 5 million which they had collected as parking fees. Click here for the latest political news
