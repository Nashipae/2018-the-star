Bungoma senator Moses Wetang’ula plans to lead Kenyans in civil disobedience to compel the government to abolish the 16 per cent tax on petroleum products. Speaking at his Kanduyi home, he said Kenyans are already overburdened and it is unfair to introduce new taxes. “As an opposition leader, I will rally Kenyans to ensure the President signs the amended 2018 Finance Bill by Parliament. Apparently, this is the language that the dictatorial Jubilee regime understands," he said. Wetang’ula said by implementing the fuel levy, the government has shown that it does not care about suffering Kenyans. He said it is time Kenyans stepped up and fought impunity. “People are suffering because of Jubilee’s disrespect for public resources, wanton corrupt and unrealistic taxes," he said. Wetang'ula wondered how the price of fuel is cheaper in Uganda yet it is a landlocked country. He said Parliament should scrap the levy and not postpone it. The senator said some of the decisions made by the government are wanting. He said a plan by the Ministry of Education to introduce a single uniform in all schools is ridiculous. Wetang'ula accused the government of borrowing heavily. He claimed there is a plan of changing the route of the standard gauge railway in some towns. “We are demanding that the new railway line to Uganda passes through Eldama Ravine, Webuye, Nakuru, Bungoma and Malaba," he said. He said it was not proper to develop some towns while killing the old ones. Related: Hard times ahead as Rotich effects 16% VAT on fuel Click here for the latest political news
