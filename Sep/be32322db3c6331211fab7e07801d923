Boda boda riders in Kwale have expressed concerns over a new directive by police restricting their work beyond 8pm. The group complained that they make more money at the said hours since most Matatu operators have usually closed their business. Led by Rashid Juma, the riders accused police of harassing them once they are found working past the set time. "Let the police at least extend the time to almost midnight otherwise we will be making less than Sh500 which is for the employer." "When I work up-to midnight, I can get the employer's money plus my share for the day," Juma said. "Let the police to kindly extend the time since it is at night where we have no competition with matatus." The police issued the directive in the wake of a wave of robberies executed by thugs on motorbikes. But the riders said there are many ways the police can work with them to identify the suspects other than hurt their business. Matuga OCPD Joel Chesire said that the riders are yet to file a complaint about the time they are allowed to operate. "They seem to be okay with the new development. We will send the area chief to meet them and find out a lasting solution over the whole issue." Nominated MCA Najma Mwandoto asked the police in the area to coexist peacefully with the riders who are also a good source of information. Click here for the latest political news
