Youths living with disability in Trans Nzoia have been introduced to farming to boost their earnings. The farmers will plant less labour-intensive crops. Farm Africa Company, which is spearheading the initiative, said it is targeting about 4,000 youths who have completed secondary school. The company will market the produce on their behalf. FAC senior project officer Julius Marete said they were assisting those living with disability to expand their scope of production. “This group has people with different disabilities. We are introducing a kind of farming that they are able to do even with those disabilities,” he said. Marete said the company had already signed a deal with VegPro Export Company, which will buy their produce for the export market He said the youths are provided with farm inputs, chemicals and technical advice every week to ensure the produce meets international standards. Marete asked well-wishers to assist the group with necessary facilities to conduct irrigation to maintain production throughout the year. Chairperson of Trans Nzoia Youth Living With Disability Odhiambo Odhis praised the initiative, saying it had revitalised their productivity. “The trainings have made farming easy. It is good for us to earn a living without relying on other people,” Odhis said. He asked the county government to provide them with more land for farming.
