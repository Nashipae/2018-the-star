The Mombasa county government has ordered a fresh registration of all Public Service Vehicles (PSVs) in the county within the next one month. The listing will be conducted in Kisauni, Mvita, Nyali, Likoni, Changamwe, and Jomvu sub-counties from September 17 to October 31. A statement from the county's Finance Department said the move is to pave way for full automation of revenue collection. PSV owners, including matatus and Tuktuks, were asked to present the vehicles' Log Books and national ID cards for the free registration. According to the department, the registration will usher in an era of mobile payment for monthly stickers. "It will also ensure we establish an accurate and secure database of the entire public transport sector in Mombasa county," the statement says. The main registration centre will be at the Mombasa Town Hall. Desks will be opened at Changamwe fire station, Mikindani Social Hall for Jomvu, and at the Mombasa Water and Sanitation Company offices in Kisauni. For Nyali, the exercise will be conducted at the office of the ward administrator in Kongowea market. The Shika Adabu Fire Station will be the venue for the listing in Likoni while operators from Mvita are expected to present their documents at the Tononoka Social Hall.
