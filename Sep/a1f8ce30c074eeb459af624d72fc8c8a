The government has been warned against overdependency on donors for ARVs. The joint United Nations Programme on HIV/Aids told the government to reduce overdependency on foreign aid, saying it is unsustainable. UNAids regional director Catherine Sozi yesterday said the country should think beyond the foreign aid, which she said may dry up. Sozi added that such a move will disrupt the country’s ongoing effort in combatting HIV/Aids. “When you rely on donor funds your future is not guaranteed because you don’t know when it will stop and at what point.” She urged Parliament to come with appropriate legislations to address ARVs funding. Sozi appeared before the National Assembly’s Committee on Health. Committee member and Tongaren MP Eseli Simuyu said there is a need to review the policies on foreign aid as the country adopts self sustainability. In 2017, the US, one of the major donors towards HIV/Aids, discontinued its support running into Sh2.1 billion over weak accounting procedures. Click here for the latest political news
