Kitui deputy governor Wathe Nzau's lorry was burnt by unknown people on Thursday night. He told the press in Mwingi that arsonists sneaked into his residence at around 2:30 am and poured petrol on the tyres and set the lorry ablaze. Nzau said he was not at home at the time of the incidence. His family called him in Kitui. "The flames attracted security guards of St Joseph’s Mwingi Boys Seminary School who rushed to the scene. My family learnt about our lorry burning when the guards banged on the gate and shouted for help," Wathe said. Neighbours helped put out the fire.

He has been parking the lorry at Mwingi police station but stopped recently because he thought the threats had ended. "I believe it the threats were from charcoal cartels who are unhappy with the ban. I have been in the frontline in fighting charcoal burning," he said. Nzau said the arson will not silence him. He said this could be a retaliatory attack for an incident in which a lorry ferrying charcoal was burnt at Kanyonyoo. Mwingi Central police boss John Nyamu said the incident is being probed. No arrests have been made, but he told residents the arsonists will be brought to book. Click here for the latest political news
