Former Nzoia Sugar hitman Elvis Rupia is confident of ending his long wait for a maiden goal in the Zambian Premier League. Rupia joined Kitwe-based Power Dynamos in July but he is yet to find his scoring touch five matches into his Southern Africa sojourn. The former Nakuru All Stars man was enjoying the form of his life prior to his switch, where he had netted 15 goals in the Kenyan Premier League and still remains a candidate to win the season’s Golden Boot should his challengers fail to match his tally. However, Rupia has found it turbulent in front of goal in Zambia but remains hopeful he will soon follow in the footsteps of his compatriot Jesse Were, who plies his trade with league leaders Zesco United. Were has scored 17 goals this season and he is in contention for the Golden Boot although he trails top scorer, Congolese Idris Mbombo of Nkana Red Devils, by two goals. Over the weekend, Rupia came too close when he recorded two assists as his side comfortably edged out Lusaka Dynamos 4-2 to scale to sixth on the standings. He believes the assists will inspire him to regain his scoring form. Speaking on phone from Zambia he said: “I am sure I will break the deadlock soon and maintain a scoring streak. I have only played five matches since I arrived here and I feel I have began to settle in the club and gelled well with my teammates. It’s been difficult but I know through hard work, I will regain my scoring form. I provided two assists over the weekend and I think that performance will inspire me to fight more for goals. I draw inspiration from Were who has been scoring at will and I believe if he has made it, I will also make it.”
