The Busia government is mapping tourism and cultural sites to market the county locally, regionally and internationally. Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi on Wednesday in Busia town released a drone to give location, direction coordinates, pictorial evidence and show that these sites actually exist. He said Busia has many tourism and cultural sites, which have not been highlighted over the years. “Local tourism has sustained the economies of many countries in Africa, including Zambia, where the annual Kwomboka movement of the King from wetlands to dry land has become an international event,” Mulomi said. The Culture and Tourism department has identified more than 100 sites across the seven subcounties of Teso North, Teso South, Nambale, Matayos, Butula, Samia and Bunyala. They include Alupe Leprosy Centre in Teso South, Siosteko Wetland in Matayos, Sango deltas and Beach Fish in Bunyala, Nahabuka Heritage in Samia, Emakina Hills in Nambale and Sango delta in Bunyala. The county hopes to market the Kakapel art rocks in Teso North, which contain paintings and inscriptions. The site was inhabited 4,000 years ago. Kakapel is a in a huge rock shelter in the Chelelemuk hills in Malaba town. The Kakapel Rock Site national monument was gazeted in 2005. It was opened in 2007 following rehabilitation by the Trust for African Rock Art in collaboration with the National Museums of Kenya between 2005 and 2006. In 2015, the county said it was spending more than Sh100 million to reconstruct heritage centres to market itself as the centre of the Western tourism circuit. Officials say tourists seek new experiences.
