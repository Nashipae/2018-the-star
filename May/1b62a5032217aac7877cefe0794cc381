Gospel musicians have not been receiving good reviews in the reputation sector. A popular VDJ is the talk of town after it was discovered that he facilitated an abortion. The DJ, who is known for his suave smooth look, lured one of his fans into a carnal relationship that resulted in the poor pretty young thing getting pregnant. It dawned on the damsel that the popular TV spin master is a rolling stone that gathers no moss nor does it stop for anyone, not even a bun in the oven. The poor lass could not seek help from her parent, and the DJ said he will not take responsibility for a child out of wedlock. So the only option presented to her by the gospel DJ was to abort the baby. The gospel personality paid for the procedure and moved on with his life.
