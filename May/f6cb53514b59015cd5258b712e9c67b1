Former councillors in Nyanza want the government to set aside Sh1.5 million for each of them as a send-off in the 2018-19 budget. The more than 1,200 former civic leaders served between 1960 and 2012. They are also demanding a monthly pension of Sh30,000. Kisumu County Councillors Forum chairman Joseph Ogut on Friday said they want free parking for their vehicles in the areas where they served. Ogut said during their tenure, the former councillors were only paid allowances without a salary, therefore, they deserve a send-off package. “We played a key role in the now-defunct local authority. We deserve pension like that given to the former MPs,” he said. Ogut told President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga to intervene and ensure their demands are addressed. “We are also asking governors, senators, MPs and MCAs to support the call,” he said. Further, the councillors accused MPs of not approving the petition for legislative intervention to address the welfare of former councillors, despite having been approved by the Senate. “It is unfortunate that the MPs are only concerned with their welfare. They seem to have forgotten us,” said George Weda, a former nominated councillor. In 2016, the Siaya county government said it will spend Sh372 million as a send-off package for 248 former councilors. Deputy Governor Ouma Onyango said each councillor will receive Sh1.5 million before the end of the year. “We must take care of retired politicians financially as they are considered heroes. We cannot allow them to starve,” Onyango said. The deputy governor said the county government is aware of the economic difficulties facing officials from the now-defunct structures.
