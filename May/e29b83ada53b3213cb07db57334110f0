Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi ordered Aaron Ochieng’ to post Sh550,000 bail instead after he failed to settle the dispute out of court. Ochieng’ is accused of stealing a Mercedes Benz valued at Sh2.8 million last year. The car belonged to anchor Joy Doreen Biira. The case was scheduled for mention yesterday. Ochieng’ initially accused Biira of collusion. He later recanted his statement and apologised.

Andayi was yesterday informed that Ochieng’ had only paid Sh350,000 of the Sh1 million he was to repay. The matter was referred to Andayi from senior principal magistrate Peter Ooko after the parties failed to agree on payment terms. Andayi directed Ochieng’ to remain in custody pending payment of the new bail. The accused requested the court to give him more time to raise the money. But Andayi dismissed the request and forfeited the Sh300,000 bail Ochieng had posted. “This file has been brought to me from a different court and it seems that the parties have failed to agree on settlement for almost a year. The accused should remain in custody until he pays the new bail,” Andayi said. In September last year, the dispute was scheduled to proceed to full hearing after the two journalists failed to settle the dispute out of court. Ooko granted them a last chance to settle the dispute. The case will be mentioned on June 5.
