Upcoming gospel artiste Keam Kym has found the going tough after doing a reggae cover of Nyashinski's song Hayawani. "I get a lot of challenges in the gospel industry after doing Hayawani cover, and most media do not want to play my songs," he said. "They think that because I did the song, which came from a secular artiste, I have also shifted to secular." However, Kym said he will continue doing what will inspire the lives of people. "Nyash congratulated me for the song and he loved it so much. He even sent me a video akijump to the song. He also has a positive response about it and I feel so good," he said.
