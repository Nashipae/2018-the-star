The Kenya Rural Roads Authority has been accused of shoddy work in Embu county. County assembly budget committee chairman Robert Ireri said on Thursday that work on the 8km Gichiche-Gichera-Kiringa road is substandard. The Sh3.2 million allocated for the work should be audited, he said. About Sh200,000 was budgeted for bush-clearing yet there were no bushes to clear, IIreri said. He also said the 1,200 cubic metres of murram Â­equivalent to 80 lorries could not cover a 1.5km stretch. He said the assembly would soon start inspecting all roads by Kerra.
