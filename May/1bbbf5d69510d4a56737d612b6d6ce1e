Childish Gambino's new music video, This Is America, broke the net early this week. It is full of symbolism and it gets better each time you press play. His signature dance throughout the music video was choreographed by Sherrie Silver, a Rwandan-born dancer, creative director, actress and philanthropist. "There are a lot of dark themes in it, so they wanted us to be the light of the video," Silver says in an interview with Complex.com music. "You know how kids are innocent and kind of unaware of what's going on? We were there to smile and bring joy to everyone watching it, because the background is bringing so much darkness and reality." Silver says her goal is to "take Afro dance and Afro culture to the world and then take the world to Africa," and this video gave her the platform to achieve that. Plus, the concept fit perfectly with her own background. Asked how she got connected with Donald Glover and his team for “This Is America?” she said, "I believe it was because of one of the little nieces or cousins of someone on his management team. Apparently she was, like, obsessed with me and she used to watch my videos. She showed the videos to one of them, and when the project came up, they thought I would be perfect to choreograph and portray the happiness that they needed with the happy African schoolchildren. "Me, working with kids, it was just perfect. I knew exactly how to go about it, because I grew up out in Rwanda. Then I moved to England, but I went back again. So I know how we are in school. I know that dance is everything to us. No matter how much is going on — even if it's the middle of a war or poverty or hunger — one thing Africans share is we dance our sorrows away. Not even professionally, it's just a part of our culture."
