The government cannot achieve the Big Four development agenda if it does not address human resource issues. Global Hope Foundation programmes director Edwin Kagiri (pictured) yesterday said it is useless to develop infrastructure when the professionals are lacking. “Education is important. We need to capture human resource development to achieve President Uhuru Kenyatta’s growth plan,” he said. Kagiri spoke at Kavingo Secondary School in Yatta, Machakos county.

Kagiri said the NGO set aside Sh100 million to support 10,000 orphans and vulnerable children in public secondary schools. The NGO implements development projects in education, bursaries, health, sports and talent development, women and youth empowerment and agriculture. It has branches in Kenya, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Uganda. Kagiri said, “We want the best for our people, this is why we are committed to improving residents’ lives and living standards.” He added that the government, private sector and all stakeholders should support the education of vulnerable children.
