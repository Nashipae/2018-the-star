Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana and his Machakos counterpart Alfred Mutua have buried their hatchet after years of Ukambani supremacy battle. Kibwana who merged his Muungano party with Kalonzo Musyoka`s dominant party, Wiper, has been at loggerheads with Mutua, terming him as a Jubilee mole. Kibwana has severally accused Mutua of selling the government agenda in the Wiper`s backyard through his Maendeleo Chap Chap movement However, the handshake between Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga has extended to the two, with Kibwana assuring Mutua that no more grudges between them. The two met on Saturday during a funds drive in aid of Shinestar secondary school in Makindu, Makueni County.

Mutua said time was ripe for Kenya to have a different set of leaders, saying those who ruled the country after independence had set sufficient foundation for others to propel the country to the next level.
