The ban on plastic carrier bags effected last August has largely been successful. Seldom do you see shoppers, whether in a supermarket, kiosk or market, using plastic carrier bags. The ban has not been 100 per cent successful, however. Some people are still secretly selling or using the bags. Plastics are being sneaked in from neighbouring countries. Reluctance by individual East African Community countries to enact proper laws on plastics has greatly hurt Kenya’s war on plastic bags, which pollute the environment. Apart from Rwanda, which has clear policies and enforcement strategies, neighbouring countries have none. It is important the EAC countries cooperate on this pressing issue. The protection of our environment should be a collective responsibility. The community must speak with one voice against the manufacturing, sale, importation and use of polythene materials. All community members should enact the EAC Polythene Materials Control Bill providing a legal framework to promote a clean and healthy environment. Only by cooperating and adopting common regulations, incentives and standards will this ban be effective.
