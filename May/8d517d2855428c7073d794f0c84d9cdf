A teenage mother is in pain at the Bungoma Referral Hospital two weeks after giving birth because a needle was left in her body.Macklin Amunga, 18, gave birth at Bulondo Dispensary on May 10, but during the process, a minor operation – episiotomy – was carried out because the baby could not pass through her birth canal.She delivered, but during the stitching, a needle was left inside her genitals.This resulted in a lot of pain and she was transferred to the Bungoma Referral Hospital.At the Bungoma Referral Hospital, an X-ray showed a needle was stuck in her genitals.The medics at the institution have, however, not removed the needle because the machines in the theatre are out of order.“I have been in pain since then. Every time they tell me I should wait until the machines are repaired,” she told the Star from her hospital bed.
