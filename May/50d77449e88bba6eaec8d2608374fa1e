Harmonize is taking after his boss Diamond Platimunz in all manners, including cheating on his girlfriends. Since he left Kenya over the weekend, after dropping the bomb that he is single and dumping his Italian girlfriend, Sarah, rumours have been going round that Kenyan gospel artiste Nicah is pregnant by him. Nicah has vehemently denied the rumours. Away from that, Harmonize’s current girlfriend, Sarah, and ex, Wolper, are on a war path. They’ve been airing each other’s dirty linen in public, and who knows how all this is going to end. It was also rumoured that Harmonize’s girlfriend was sleeping with Diamond Platnumz bodyguard, Mwarabu Fighter, and that is why Harmonize declared he was single when he came to Kenya. Jacqueline Wolper was among those who commented on Sarah’s cheating allegations, and she in turn referred to her as a "cougar". This did not go well with Harmonize and he published, on his Instagram, a list of young men Wolper has bedded to prove that she is the real cougar. Wolper retaliated by publishing a list of men she claims Sarah has been messing around with. She ranted on Snapchat, calling out Harmonize and his Italian girlfriend. Wolper said the Tanzanian singer is lying to the public that she wants him back, yet he’s the one who wants to reignite their love. But Wolper said she can never go back to him. "Dear Sarah, sikuchukii ulipo ila simufwati bwana yako. Sina muda naye na namwogopa kama ukoma. Ata iweje, sitomrudia na ata anipe Bilion alizochuma kwako ili nirudi kamwe sitoweza kuwa na amani naye," she said.
