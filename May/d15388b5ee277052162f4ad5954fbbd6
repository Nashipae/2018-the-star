Machakos county assembly speaker Florence Mwangangi has announced plans to rollout ‘Bunge Mashinani’ to promote public participation. She said the initiative is aimed at taking information and services closer to residents. Mwangangi on Tuesday said the rollout is in line with the Machakos County Public Participation Act, which was passed in 2014. She addressed the press at a hotel in Machakos town. The assembly, Mwangangi said, has reached out to the county’s executive for mutual cooperation between the two institutions. “We want to work with the executive so residents can get services. If residents are consulted, then the county will achieve [its] development goals. This has never been the case,” she said. Mwangangi said the assembly will use the ‘Bunge Mashinani’ forums to educate residents about laws and regulations that directly affect them. “The assembly has passed Bills banning forest destruction and sand harvesting. It has also passed a motion proposing to address rampant gambling and chewing of miraa, which have hurt our youth,” she said. “Residents have to understand the assembly’s operations [as well as] the Bills and motions.” Mwangangi also urged Governor Alfred Mutua to swiftly nominate and present to the assembly names of county executives for approval, as required by the law. She said the governor’s failure to set up a county executive committee has derailed development. Mwangangi said the assembly approved a supplementary budget to enable the executive to function effectively. “We are making all the approvals to help the executive get funds to serve the locals,” she said.
