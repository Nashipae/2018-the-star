The Migori government and farmers in Kuria East have been baffled by an unidentified disease that has killed more than 300 cows and other livestock in three weeks. On Tuesday a team visited Wangirabose but was unable to identify the disease. It included Agriculture executive Valentine Ogongo, director of Livestock Eric Were and two veterinary officers. "At first we thought it was black quarter but after visiting we ruled it out," Livestock chief Were said. However, the team plans a vaccination for black quarter, which has similar symptoms. They said a quarantine would be declared. "This can be anything from a skin ailment caused by tsetse fly, lack of nutrition or even a worm infection," Ogongo said. During the visit, two calves belonging to two farmers, Joseph Range and Samuel Rioba, died as the team looked on helplessly. The animals started developing weakness in the limbs, lost weight and became agitated. They died in days. "I have lost three cows, two goats and two sheep to this strange disease," Range said. Dogs that eat the carcasses sicken, attacking chicken and people. "We have buried two dogs after we gave them the carcasses and they became wild. We are scared of even touching the dead animals," Range said. Wangirabose sub-location assistant chief Philip Rioba said over 300 cattle have died. Activist Samuel Werema said county vets have been asking bribes of Sh1,000- Sh2,000 to treat the cattle, which later die. "On we witnessed incompetence by county staff . The vets have been asking for bribes to treat our animals that keep dying. They havenâ€™t helped us at all," Werema said. Farmer Ibrahim Chacha in Tagare said he had 15 cows but has lost seven. "The Migori county government has failed farmers in Kuria," he said. Click here for the latest political news
