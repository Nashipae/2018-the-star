Central Bank Governor Patrick Njoroge on Tuesday announced the release of new 50-shilling notes following a public outcry over their shortage. "We expect that they will circulate to the citizens," the CBK boss said in a tweet. He further revealed that the banks' regulator is pushing a clean-note policy "with the aim to withdraw from circulation, notes beyond a certain level of usage." Early this year, Kenyans protested the low circulation of Sh50 notes and raised concern over the state of dilapidation of the existing ones.
