Ruth Kamande, the woman who stabbed her boyfriend 22 times following a domestic fight, has been found guilty of murder. Justice Jessie Lesiit ruled that the Miss Langata Prison 2016 killed Farid Mohammed. The judge held that Kamande acted in malice adding that her actions proved the same. Lesiit further said that the prosecution had proven beyond all reasonable doubt that Kamande committed the offence. "It is clear from the prosecution evidence that the stabs were not done at ago. They were done in intervals," Lesiit ruled. The judge further noted that Kamande's rape allegations were false since the doctor's medical reports did not prove the claims. The prison beauty queen had defended herself by telling the court that she had discovered that her boyfriend was undergoing HIV treatment and threatened her when she confronted him over the matter. She claimed that Mohammed had said that they rather died than have her expose his status and it was in self-defence that the boyfriend was stabbed. The woman had also told the court that the knife which was used in the murder fell on her boyfriend when they were struggling on the ground. Kamande, who has been in custody since 2015 when she was arrested, will be sentenced on July 11. More on this: An HIV card, quarrel and 22 stabs, Miss Lang'ata Prison confesses
