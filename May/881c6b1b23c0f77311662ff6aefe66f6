The doctors union has threatened a mass withdrawal of its members over the government’s move to import 100 Cuban doctors. The more than 7,000 doctors allege the cost to import and cater for the doctors would cost the taxpayer Sh2 billion. Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union (KMPDU) secretary general Ouma Oluga said the decision to import the doctors was made in haste. “It had no regard to the more than 2,000 local doctors, including 171 specialists who are available for employment and deployment to counties,” he said in a statement. Oluga added that the amount to pay the Cuban doctors can employ and pay 1,000 Kenyan doctors for a year. He criticised the importation of doctors while the skills are available locally. Out of the 12,636 doctors and dentists registered in the country, only 7,077 are practising. The move to import the doctors was made on March 17, when President Uhuru Kenyatta visited the Caribbean country. Fifty Kenyan doctors will also be taken to Cuba for further studies. Oluga said the movement of doctors from one country to another must be done transparently, ethically and voluntarily, in adherence to the World Medical Association and WHO’s Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel. “The training and practice of medicine by doctors all over the world is standard, evidence based and professional. Variations from different countries is determined by the strength of the healthcare system and socio-economic-cultural realities.” The first batch of the Caribbean doctors will arrive in July. Health CS Sicily Kariuki said they will be deployed to rural areas to improve access to specialised services.
