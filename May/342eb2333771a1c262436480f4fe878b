Families displaced by floods in Garissa will this week be vetted for compensation. Garissa county Agriculture executive Issa Yarrow said they will constitute a team to assess the damage on farms and determine how villagers will be compensated. Nearly all the expenses will be footed by the national government. The flooding worsened this month following the overflow of Masinga Dam. Speaking in Garissa Town yesterday, Issa thanked the national government saying the county lacked enough resources to assist the farmers. “As a county there is very little we can do assist, considering the meager resources we have. but if we pull our resources together and also the get the help of NGOs like the Kenya red cross, then the whole thing will be easy,” said Issa. Last week, area county commissioner Joshua Chepchieng’ said the government will soon start distributing free seeds and other inputs to the farmers. At least 2,000 families have been displaced by floods. Garissa is one of the counties worst hit by flooding since the rains began in March. Crops that have been destroyed include maize, cow peas, onions, tomatoes, kale, paw paws, watermelons and bananas. Last week, Kenya Farmers Federation vice chairman Dubat Amey urged KenGen to construct canals and dams to divert water spillage from the Seven Forks dams. Other affected areas include Malindi, Lamu and Tana River counties. In Western Kenya, nearly all counties around Lake Victoria have been affected. Countywide, more than 200,000 people have been displaced by floods while at least 160 have been killed. The Kenya Meteorological department says the rains will end this week across the country except in Western Kenya. Click here for the latest political news
