Ford Kenya tomorrow will start a three-day retreat to discuss the party’s future in NASA and plans to merge with Amani National Congress. Party leader Moses Wetang’ula will chair the Naivasha meeting. Insiders yesterday told the Star the National Executive Committee will decide whether the party remains in NASA or not. There has been disquiet in the party ranks following the removal of Wetang’ula as the Senate Minority leader. The Bungoma senator was replaced by his Siaya counterpart James Orengo. Ford Kenya has accused ODM of mistreating its coalition partners.

Ford-K is in talks with Musalia Mudavadi’s ANC over a merger. Wetang’ula has previously said they want to form a single party to unite Luhyas and end ODM’s political dominance in Western. A committee tasked with the merger will brief the meeting about progress made so far. Deputy party leader Boni Khalwale, Eseli, Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa, Wetang’ula’s aide Bramwel Simiyu and lawyer Eunice Lumallas represent Ford Kenya in the committee. ANC is represented by MPs Sakwa Bunyasi (Nambale) and Alfred Agoi (Sabatia), Mudavadi’s aide Godfrey Kanoti, party secretary general Barack Muluka and Eric Wafukho. “The NEC will hear what the team has done so that they can also have an input. Merger is not for a few and has to involve the whole party machinery,” Eseli said. Details: Ford Kenya, ANC merger plan signals NASA collapse Click here for the latest political news
