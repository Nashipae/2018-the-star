Disaster management committee in Msambweni
sub-county has given a clean bill of health on the dams operated in the area
saying they meet all the required standards. Dams in Msambweni are safe, the subcounty disaster management committee has said. Chairperson Ronald Enyakasi said engineers had toured the five reservoirs and declared them safe. Three of the dams are owned by Kwale International Sugar Company Limited (KISCOL) and the other two by Base Titanium Company and the Coast Water Services Board. KISCOL public relations manager Mathius Mutua said they had relocated 145 families as a precautionary measure. "Should any dam burst, the waters will flow into empty fields and the ocean," Mutua said.
