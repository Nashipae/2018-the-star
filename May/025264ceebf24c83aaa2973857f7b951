Others are Peterso Gathiru (66kg), John Nderitu (66kg) and Milton Kuloba (60kg). The four will be using the event set for June 12-20 and organised by All Japan Judo Federation through the government of Japan as a build up ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games. The team’s coach Joseph Mburu welcomed the new development. “Although Kenya Judo Association have participated in the International Training Camp before, this is the first time we are going for training under sponsorship,” observed Mburu. He added: “We hope to advance our techniques to increase our chances of being considered for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. After new leaders were elected in the year 2017 at the KJA, there is renewed hope for a better future for thes Judokas.” Commenting on the upcoming training, Jaona Embassy Information and Culture Centre director, Seiji Tashiro said: “With Judo being a martial art born in Japan, our embassy here in Kenya is happy to have a close working relationship with the KJA. It is my hope that the young players, who have been carefully chosen by KJA will advance themselves well and be ready to qualify for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.” He continued: “We have recently started judo classes, which are held at our premises on a weekly basis. The Embassy has over the years offered other martial arts including karate and Aikido. To advance and popularise the judo sport in Kenya, the Embassy of Japan will hold the Ambassador’s Cup in August.” The International training camp in 2017 brought together over 500 players from 30 countries. The Government of Japan, through its programme, Sport for Tomorrow, which is an international contribution through sport initiative, is promoting sport to more than 10 million people in over 100 nations until 2020, the year when Tokyo will host the Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games.
