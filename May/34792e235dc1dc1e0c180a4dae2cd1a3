After seeing his side fail to win for a fifth successive time, Mathare United coach Francis kimanzi has laid his frustrations bare, pointing a finger of blame on their opponents’ tactics to stifle them. After a goalless draw with Bandari over the weekend, Kimanzi insists it was increasingly difficult to play against a side that was keen on avoiding defeat rather than taking the initiative to go for all three points. “Of course, it is the nature of our league here. Every team wants to stay behind and sometimes you have to look for a way to entertain the fans. I am happy that the fans saw some good football. I don’t care if they stay behind. They can stay behind the rest of the matches in the league. It’s their plan anyway,” lamented Kimanz on the Slum Boys official portal. The draw against Bandari means that Mathare have picked only three points from their last five matches and have seen their title aspirations torn part as they are now four points behind leaders Gor Mahia, who have three matches in hand. “I am not disappointed. We played marvelous football apart from getting the final goal. The process is still on. If you keep creating a lot of chances and you don’t score, then you know you are getting closer,” he pointed out. “We were playing against a team that is three points behind us and they are actually there by merit. We are happy with the point,” he added in mitigation. Despite the recent slump, Kimaniz will take confidence form the fact that his side are unbeaten in their last three outings, against with Kariobangi Sharks, Gor as well as Bandari. “We had a target which was to remain as competitive as possible in the first leg. We are still within that achievement. We don’t need to panic,” asserted Kimanzi. Next up for Kimanzi is a tricky away trip to face Kakamega Homeboyz in Bukhungu on Sunday.
