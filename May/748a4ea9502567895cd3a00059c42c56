A lobby group in Nairobi has asked the national government to reinstate Governor Mike Sonko’s security detail. The bodyguards were withdrawn in what Interior CS Fred Matiang'i said was a major review of VIP security deployment.

They defended the governor's decision to operate from his Mua farm in Machakos citing grounds of "cartels after Sonko’s life". "We want to tell the cartels, who are after Sonko day and night, that they should stop trailing the governor." "They are the reason Sonko has temporarily relocated to Machakos," Akech said during a press conference at Chester House. The group comprises members of hawker groups, boda boda riders, matatu operators, and Jua Kali artisans. During the Thursday briefing, they defended Sonko saying he is on the right track in restoring Nairobi back to its days of glory. "We have seen the Governor being criticised over his work. A lot of blame game is in play too," Akech said. "It will be unjust to push the governor to deliver all his pledges in eight months. He needs time," the former mayor said. Matatu Welfare Association chairman Dickson Mbugua said: "We assure the Governor of our support as he puts the city back to order." "No man is an island. Sonko needs guidance and our support," Mbugua added. United Boda Boda Association chairman Ken Onyango said they are hopeful the city will change in the next two years. The sentiments came in the wake of concerns that Sonko's administration has not lived to the promise it made to voters. Potholed roads, poor garbage disposal, beggar and hawker menace have remained a challenge for the county.
