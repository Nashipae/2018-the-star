Kirinyaga leaders yesterday said they will try to break the lease of a 73-acre coffee plantation to a company from another county. Kirinyaga University is understood to have leased the land for 12 years at Sh4 million a year. The company was not identified. Assembly leaders said they will mobilise youths to ensure the company does not move in. County leaders — and the governor, senator, MPs, MCAs and others — will meet on Saturday to discuss how to break the lease. They said the lease should have gone to a Kirinyaga company. County youth will be denied employment, the county will lose revenue and the value of the lease is too low, they said. Assembly majority leader Kamau Murango and 12 MCAs yesterday said they will not allow university vice chancellor Mary Ndungu give away Kirinyaga coffee. Ndungu could not be reached for comment as her phone was off and she was said to be out of her office. Speaking at the plantation at Kutus, Murango said, “The university even never bothered to tender for the 12-year lease.” He said coffee from Baragwi ward is ranked number four in the world. “We have the Kenya Coffee Plantation Union in Kirinyaga — why wasn’t it considered for the lease?” he asked. Baragwi ward MCA David Mathenge said they will block the company from taking over. Mathenge, the budget committee chairman, said the assembly had factored in Sh50 million in the coming financial year for coffee value addition. Murango said they will mobilise youths to block the company from taking over if the university does not reverse the move. Kirinyaga resources should benefit residents, not outsiders, he said. Murango said the weekend meeting will “deliberate on this illegal move meant to defraud Kirinyaga residents.”
