A 68-year-old man is feared dead after he was swept away by floods in Tana Delta yesterday. Abdulahi Nur was crossing a flooded section in Kiembeni village when the incident happened. His home has been marooned by water. He was reportedly crossing to Garsen to buy breakfast when he drowned near a dyke at about 7am. Area chief Peter Jillo said a search was underway. "Volunteers have joined the Red Cross team in the search mission. He has not yet been spotted," Jillo told the Star on phone. Ibrahim Dola, who witnessed the incident, said Nur decided to cross the flooded section because there was no boat in sight. Residents often use canoes to cross the floods. Last month, two girls drowned as they crossed flooded sections in Tana Delta. the body of one of the girls, an eight-year old, is yet to be retrieved. Residents have also raised fears of crocodile attacks. Most of Tana Delta has been flooded after River Tana burst its banks due to heavy rain. The rive is infested with crocodiles. "Crossing the floods on canoes is risky because the crocodiles can attack anytime. We fear for our school children who have to cross in the morning and evening," a resident said. More than 32 villages have been flooded with 72,000 families displaced. Residents have been warned to expect more floods with water to be released from Masinga Dam.
