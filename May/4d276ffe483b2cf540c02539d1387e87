The 200 families displaced by floods in Kisumu will be supplied with relief food. Cabinet Secretary Raphael Tuju announced yesterday food and blankets have been dispatched to the county. All will be evacuated to schools and churches on high ground. About 100 homes have been subsubmerged in flooewaters since heavy rain hit the area in the past six weeks. County commissioner Maalim Mohammed said a majority of the affected are in Nyando subcounty. He will coordinate with the county government to ensure families food, blankets and medicine. Residents in flood-prone areas were asked to move to higher ground. Tuju launched the drive at Ahero on Monday. He called for collaboration between the national and county governments to deal with the emergency. More than 2,000 people have been displaced after River Nyando bursts its banks. Major roads, including Ahero-Ombeyi, were rendered impassable. Rescue efforts had to rely on tractors to move the affected people to safer ground. A majority of those affected now live in schools and churches. Some institutions, including Obiayo Primary School, are flooded. Distressed villagers have called for a permanent solutions, saying they are fed up of instructions to move to higher ground. “The government should invest in building dykes, water pans, and desiltation of rivers to control the floods and channel the water for irrigation,” Joyce Adhiambo, a peasant farmer, told the Star. Rescue centres have been established across the affected areas. Families fear there could be an outbreak of malaria and cholera. Tuju said this year’s flood disaster is the worst since 1969. “The national government is exploring long-term options to end the menace. This will include desilting of rivers, erection of dykes and construction of dams,” he said. Such initiatives will be rolled out following the unity pact between NASA leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta. Click here for the latest political news
