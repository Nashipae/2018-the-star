The government has been ordered to pay Sh7 million in compensation to a former KDF officer for unlawful detention. Justice Chacha Mwita yesterday ruled that Muruge Mbogo’s rights were violated. “A declaration is hereby issued that the petitioner’s human rights and fundamental freedoms were violated by agents of the state,” Mwita said. Mbogo sued the Chief of Defence Forces and the Attorney General. He told the court he was enlisted with the Kenya Air force on February 12, 1976.

Mbogo was arrested on August 8, 1982 after surrendering to officers at Kerugoya police station. He was accused of involvement in the aborted 1982 coup. ”I was tortured, subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. I was also stripped naked in public and made to walk on my knees on concrete floors,” Mbogo said.

Mbogo said he was interrogated for five months, contrary to the Armed Forces Act and that he was never charged with any offence. “I was detained without trial for four years,” He said. The KDF, through Colonel Paul Kindochimu, denied Mbogo was  arrested and subjected to torture and cruel treatment. Kindochimu absolved KDF from blamed for Mbogo’s woes in detention at Naivasha and Kamiti maximum security prisons. He said Mbogo’s dismissal from the army was justified given his for his involvement in the coup. Also read: Court stops case on 27 ex-soldiers Click here for the latest political news
