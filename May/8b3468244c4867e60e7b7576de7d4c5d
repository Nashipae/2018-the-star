The Media Council of Kenya has claimed some partners are using the organisation’s name to swindle donors. Council CEO David Omwoyo on Tuesday said some civil society groups have written to donors, requesting funds to facilitate media training through MCK. “We have learnt that several organisation sent proposals seeking funding from donors indicating MCK as a partner, yet we are not aware of such. We have since cancelled some MoUs,” he said. Omwoyo spoke during a retreat by the MCK Board and the Complaints Commission at Elementaita Country Lodge, Naivasha. The CEO said the proposals arein the name of several embassies, which he did not name. “Only Sh50,000 has been used in such trainings, yet the amount requested runs into millions,” Omwoyo said. “The German Embassy decided to engage us directly upon learning that five organisations had partnered with us and were seeking funding for their activities.” He said during a recent workshop in Kisumu town, they learnt there were three other trainings by other organisations “without  our knowledge”. “This trend has to end,” Omwoyo said. He said they are working on various measures to restore the reputation of the media industry. MCK has proposed stringent measures to train journalists by universities and colleges, including a standardised curriculum. Omwoyo said lecturers without newsroom experience should not be allowed to teach. Click here for the latest political news
