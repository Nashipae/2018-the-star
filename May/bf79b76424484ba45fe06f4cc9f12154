EACC detectives on Thursday raided the offices and residences of Kenya Pipeline Company officials who handled the Sh600 million flawed procurement of aircraft fuelling gadgets. EACC chief executive Halakhe Waqo said, in a statement, that the officers managed to retrieve several documents and records that are crucial to the investigations. "The investigations, which extends to other jurisdictions that include United States and Canada, is at an advanced stage and is expected to be completed soon," Waqo said. He noted that recommendations will be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions soon after the probe is concluded. In 2014, KPC tendered to deliver 60 hydrant pit valves – the equipment used for refuelling aircrafts – for Jomo Kenyatta International Airport at a cost of Sh600 million. This means a single hydrant pit valve was supplied at a cost of Sh10 million, almost ten times the actual price of Sh1.5 million. The EACC froze their use and stopped further payment to Aero Dispenser Valves Ltd - the company that won the tender to supply them. Records, however, indicate that the firm had already received a down payment of Sh200 million. Related: How Kenya Pipeline bought spare parts at inflated price Click here for the latest political news
