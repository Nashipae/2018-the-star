Teachers unions are at loggerheads with the state over failure to remit Sh170 million dues. The Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers is demanding Sh35 million, while the Kenya National Union of Teachers wants Sh135 million. Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion says the union’s operations have been paralysed following the delay that has entered the third month. ‘’The TSC is expected to remit teachers dues in the first nine days of the month. Some union branches are being evicted because they have not paid rent for their premises,’’ Sossion said. Sossion has asked TSC to resume remittance of the dues, so as to end the cash flow crisis. Knut collects Sh135 million and Kuppet receives about Sh35 million per month from members.
