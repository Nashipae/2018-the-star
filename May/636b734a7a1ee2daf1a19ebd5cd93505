Elizabeth Lulu, on probation for the remainder of her prison term, has been tasked with cleaning the Tanzanian Interior ministry building. Lulu is a celebrated actress and multi-award winning fashion icon. She was jailed for manslaughter following the death of fellow actor Steven Kanumba. At the court hearing in November last year, Lulu said the deceased wanted to attack her with a Panga after which he fell down, hit his head and was unconscious. She then ran for her life only to get the news that Kanumba was no more. “Mara nyingi alikuwa ananipiga kila akilewa na sio kwa akili zake, alipoona simu yangu inaita akahisi ni simu ya mwanaume akasema kwanini naongea na simu ya mwanaume mbele yake?” she told the court.
