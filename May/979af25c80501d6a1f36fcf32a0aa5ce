Embakasi East MP Babu Owino has distanced himself from a Facebook page by the name 'Vijana Tibim' - his trademark political slogan. A message posted on the page urges loyal fans to comment with their location and phone number, and share to as many groups as possible in exchange for Sh1,000. The message says the more one shares the more they stand a chance to win. The page contains the flamboyant MP's photos. Asked if he was aware of the page, Owino said, "No, I don't know it." The MP urged his supporters not to fall prey to people using his images and slogan for extortion. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has been a victim of a similar stunt. He
has repeatedly warned the public against sending any money to a Facebook
user claiming to be Sonko and purporting to sell motorcycles at a low
price. Last week President Uhuru Kenyatta signed the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act. It criminalises a plethora of social media activities, spelling doom for Kenyans fond of sharing fake news, propagating
hate speech and besmirching the reputations of others.
