Interior CS Fred Matiang’i was on Thursday infuriated when he found a foreigner renewing his work permit to work at a construction site. Matiangi'i who was seemingly pissed-off said it was wrong for a foreigner to be issued with a work permit to undertake a job that can be done by locals. The CS had visited the Nyayo house immigration centre for an official function. In a video that has gone viral, Matiang'i raised concern over the number of aliens undertaking jobs that should be given to jobless Kenyans. “You are given a work permit to be a mere site manager? You think no Kenyan can manage a site? just a site manager of a construction site? that I will not agree to,” Matiang'i tells two men of Asian origin.

How many Kenyans can work on a construction site? Tunapea Mhindi akuje kufanya kazi kwa construction site, kukaa tu chini na kuangalia mjengo?.....Why should we hire Asian at a construction site as if there are no Kenyans to do such work? Matiangi posed. According to the 2015/16 Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey, at least 1.4 million Kenyans who make up the country's labour force are unemployed. At the time of the survey, Kenya had a labour force of 19.3 million with 17.9 million in gainful employment.
