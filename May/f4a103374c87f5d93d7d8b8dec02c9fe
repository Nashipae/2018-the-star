A city hotel has moved to court challenging the move by the Tourism Fund to demand and collect a tourism levy. “Pending the hearing and determination of this application, this court is pleased to issue conservatory orders restraining the Tourism Fund from demanding, distressing, assessing and collecting tourism levy from them,” the court said. The Red Roof Inn’s petition says the Tourism Fund has been storming their premises to assess the tourism levy, causing them “great distress and inconvenience”. The hotel says the Tourism Fund spent an entire day on May 10 counting the number of number of people in the hotel and assessed their levy at Sh423,886, which they demanded. “I also believe the action by the Tourism Fund in determining the levy due, through counting customers, contravenes Article 47 of the Constitution,” an affidavit in the petition reads. Through lawyer Duncan Okubasu, the hotel said assessing a levy through speculation and without reliance on documentation is unlawful, unreasonable and unfair.
