Olympian Nick Okoth has revealed that his long term goal would be to turn professional in near future. In the meantime, however, the Beijing Olympian said he will still continue playing for Kenya Defence Forces. “I still have five more years to play amateur boxing but if good offers come up, I will be ready to embrace them,” said Okoth. The younger sibling of Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games 1998 silver medallist, Absalom ‘Diblo’ Okinyi, said he is still in the game for the long haul. “I have talked to my bosses at work and they have supported the idea of turning professional. However, this will depend on offers that come up,” said the long standing national team mainstay, now playing at lightweight division. Okoth is a product of coaches Musa Benjamin and Kenneth ‘Valdez’ Ochieng at Undugu St Teresa’s where he honed his skills at a young age before joining the army. He started his career as a featherweight division and won bronze at the All Africa Games in Brazzaville in 2015 and the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi in bantamweight. “It would be good to try out the next dream of going pro,” said Okoth, who is one of the best boxers of his generation. Should his pro aspirations come to fruition, he will join US-based Prisons national team boxer Rayton Okwiri who has since turned professional. “International Amateur Boxing Association rules stipulate that a boxer can hang on to amateur rank up till 40. So I guest I have a few years to accomplish my goal,” said Okoth.
