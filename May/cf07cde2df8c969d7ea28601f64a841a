Kisumu speaker Onyango Oloo yesterday defended plans to buy iPads for MCAs at a cost of Sh8 million. The county assembly has advertised the tender for the supply and delivery of the gadgets. ICT committee chairman George Olwal said they recommended the purchase of the iPads to reduce paper consumption. Residents have opposed the plan and asked the county to direct MCAs in the previous assembly to return the iPads that were given to them. “We know residents have raised concern and we owe them an explanation on why we must buy the gadgets,” Oloo said. The speaker said the gadgets are crucial for the smooth running of the House. He said the iPads are the cheapest way to digitise the assembly’s operations. Thirty-two of 35 MCAs in the first assembly were defeated in last year’s general election. Most nominated MCAs were also kicked out. None has returned the iPads they were issued with, which cost Sh5 million. Oloo said the former MCAs considered the iPads their personal property. Some are already worn out, he said. “That is why we need to buy new ones. We’re asking the former MCAs to return the iPads so they can be disposed of to them,” Oloo said.  Paper transaction IPads retail for Sh47,000 to Sh120,000. The county will spend between Sh2.3 million and Sh5.8 million to buy the gadgets for all the 49 MCAs. Oloo said the cost will not exceed Sh8 million. County assembly operations largely remained manual, despite MCAs having iPads. Olwal said they will train members on how to use them. “We want to minimise on paper transaction. The committee will help members access reports, house business calendar, standing orders, order papers and other assembly activities,” Olwal told the Star on the phone. A community initiative development group said the plan was a waste of money. It wants the cash channelled to another project.
