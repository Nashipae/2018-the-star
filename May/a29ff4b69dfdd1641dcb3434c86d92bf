Sixteen surgeons from Nairobi are performing free operations in Malindi on poor people with chronic illnesses. The members of the Kenya Society of Endoscopic Surgeons are using technology that eliminates the need for major cutting. Their camp began on Wednesday and will end on Saturday, the goal being the performance of 60 surgeries. Dr Ephantus Njagi, who is leading the team, explained that modern equipment is inserted into the patient’s body and connected to a screen, facilitating quicker procedures. The technology sees them use a monitor, processor and a light source connected to a camera. “The patient is normally allowed to go home on the same day,’" he said on Friday, adding such surgeries cost between Sh400,000 and Sh500,000. It usually takes at least a month of a lot of pain for patients who undergo major cuts to recover. The doctors partnered with Star hospital in Malindi, Olympus Company, Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson. The participants includes consultants and students. Fredrick Amasinde from Olympus Company said the partnership was for minimal access surgeries. For instance, doctors make a small hole in the abdomen to access the cavity. “The main advantages of the equipment are hospitalisation for shorter periods and reduced charges," Amasinde said. He urged counties to supply hospitals with such equipment. “We can agree on better mode of payments to make it easier for hospitals that are not able to raise capital one-off," he said. Dr Francis Were, a consultant gynecologist said they help the camp as part of social responsibility. Similar camps have been held int he past.
