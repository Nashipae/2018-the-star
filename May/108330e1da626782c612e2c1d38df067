Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has defended the move to reduce Governor Mike Sonko's bodyguards saying; "no politician deserves to be protected by 26 policemen." "Let us learn to use common sense as well. We can't move a police station to your office," Matiang'i said on Monday in reference to officers attached to Sonko. He made the remarks during an event by IPOA where it was handing over its end of term report. Matiang'i urged politicians to support the radical changes that are being made by the police service. His remarks come just days after Sonko's security detail was reduced to 5 from 26. The withdrawal is part of a plan to recall 5,000 officers "irregularly" attached to VIPs.

Officers will be withdrawn from other county chiefs, senators, parastatals and others VIPs as well and assigned general duties. Senators will be left with one bodyguard and an armed driver.
