Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o sneaked into the country on Saturday for a hush hush meting with her father and some investors. The Black Panther actress met Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o over matters concerning the creative industry in Kenya. Present were entertainment bigwigs of Kisumu county, including comedians Jalang'o and Eric Omondi, musicians Winyo and Nina Ogot. The discussions are said to be about funding art projects to help boost talent from the region. Nina Ogot wrote on her social media, "Guess who's in Kisumu city, too? Today, thanks to the Kisumu County Governor, we discussed how to take arts to the next level with the likes of Eric Omondi." In 2016, Lupita also sneaked into the country for her cousin's wedding, and the year before that for her sister's wedding.
