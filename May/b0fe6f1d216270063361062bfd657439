MP Alice Wahome is concerned about secondary school students being recruited into criminal gangs in Kandara, Murang’s county. The Kandara legislator said the Gaza gang that is notorious for its violent attacks in some Nairobi estates was now spreading its tentacles to rural areas. Wahome said security organs in Murang’a need to take swift action or the gang would destroy the lives of many teenagers. “I know this group exists in other parts of Murang’a, but let the gang know it is not welcome in Kandara. I will work with other MPs to ensure it is crushed. We won’t let the lives of our youth be destroyed,” Wahome said. She said previously, the outlawed Mungiki sect terrorised and extorted money from residents. Wahome said she won’t fold her arms and watch the Gaza gang drag people back to those dark days. Many shopping centres in Murang’a have been abandoned, while others have barely recovered after traders closed down their businesses due to Mungiki harassment especially in Kahuro. Wahome urged parents to be keen and to watch out for behaviour change in their children. “I am appealing the county commissioner and police commander to move quickly and flush out this gang from our schools,” Wahome said. The MP also asked education stakeholders to find ways of improving academic standards in Murang’a schools. She said as the three-year tem of boards of management in schools was coming to an end, performance should be evaluated to gauge progress . “Education stakeholders have discussed the challenges hampering performance in schools. Proposals have been made to ensure Kandara leads in the region,” Wahome. The MP urged parents to be involved in the education of their children. She says it is wrong to leave the responsibility to teachers. “Parents have become lazy because of the free education offered by the government. Many of them do not take interest in  their children’s studies,” Wahome said. Click here for the latest political news
