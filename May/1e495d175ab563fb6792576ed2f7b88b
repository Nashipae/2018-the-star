Anglican church of Kenya archbishop Jackson ole Sapit has told politicians and church leaders not to ride on their predecessors’ achievements. Sapit said he does not regret his stand of defending Kenyans and members of the church in the run-up to the 2017 General Election. He called for dialogue before the presidential rerun on October 26 last year. “The move earned me the wrath of Central and Nyanza regions. I can’t afford to be held by one region, but I’m happy that normalcy has returned to Kenya,” he said. Sapit spoke at St Mark’s Hoito Anglican Church in Mt Elgon Archdeaconry of the Katakwa Diocese on Saturday during the sixth anniversary of Katakwa Diocese first Bishop Eliud Okiring. “The late bishop built a foundation for the diocese. His immediate successor Bishop Emeritus Zakayo Epus made a significant contribution. I implore the third Bishop, John Okude, to create another empire and make history,” he said. Sapit later toured Chamasiri and Albert Ekirapa secondary schools in Teso North, where he talked to students. He then opened St Philip’s Aukot Anglican Church in Angurai Sapit has been on a pastoral tour of the diocese since Wednesday. His tour ended yesterday, when he was to preside over the 26th anniversary celebration of the Diocese at St John’s Cathedral in Katakwa. Katakwa acquired autonomy as a diocese in 1994, when it was split from Nambale Diocese. The archbishop said he has taken two years to visit and get to know members of his church across the country. He said he has made pastoral visits to 35 dioceses out of 39.
