National Super League side KCB wrapped the first leg of the 2018 season with a 1-0 win over FC Talanta yesterday at Camp Toyoyo. It was a moment of reunion for coaches John Kamau (KCB) and Abdallah Juma (Talanta) having worked together at Thika United for three years(2006-2009). Interestingly Juma served as KCB’s head coach in 2012-2013 season while Kamau was in charge of Talanta last season. The bankers seemed lethal from onset and broke the deadlock in the second minute of the game through Dennis Ng’ang’a who wittingly struck a foul from outside the box after Erick Shikono had brought Kennedy Owino down. As players from both sides awaited for Ng’ang’a to float in the ball, the former Nakuru All Stars left-back had other thoughts as had spotted Talanta’s stopper Joel Bataro poor positioning and curled the ball to the far post to hand his side the opening goal. Despite taking an early lead KCB pressed for more but Michael Osundwa and Rodgers Omondi missed the target. The presence of the experienced Congolese Ousmane Luiz and Zachary Gathu in the bankers’ midfield was a plus as the two bulldozed the centre, thanks to their physical might and passing artistry. However, Talanta managed a number of counterattacks which nearly caught KCB’s defence flat-footed. Job Tinyo would have handed Talanta the equaliser in the 15th minute with only the goalkeeper to beat but hit wide. Kamau said “I am happy with the win although we wasted a number of chances. It was a like a derby to me and I am happy for the win. Our focus shifts to the break and we want to use the opportunity to analyse our first leg performance and see where we made mistakes.”
