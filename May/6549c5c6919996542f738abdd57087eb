Two senators from Nyanza have urged leaders across the political divide to support the 14-member ‘handshake’ peace team to realise its mandate. They are Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang’ and his Kisumu counterpart Fred Outa. They said one of the agendas of the team spearheaded by President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga is to end graft. A 14-member team to steer Uhuru and Raila’s unity deal was unveiled in April.  The committee is co-chaired by lawyer Paul Mwangi (representing Raila) and Martin Mwangi (representing Uhuru). They included Adams Oloo, Agnes Kavindu, Busia Senator Amos Wako, Florence Omose, Saeed Mwanguni, James Matundura, Maj (Rtd) John Seii, Bishop Lawi Imathiu and Samburu Woman Representative Maison Leshomo. Others are Garissa Senator Yusuf Haji, Morompi ole Ronkai, Bishop Peter Njenga and Zecheus Okoth who went on board as advisers. Kajwang’ yesterday urged leaders to show commitment for the team to succeed. He said the handshake deal gives Kenyans a platform to build bridges and deal with corruption and ethnicity. “Kenya neither lacks laws nor adequate institutions that can fight graft. What the country lacks is leadership commitment in eradicating the vice,” Kajwang’ said. He said corruption is a threat to national values and urged the peace deal team to make the war on graft a priority. “A thrive in corruption is a breakdown in national values and Kenya shouldn’t go that direction,” he said. Kajwang’ said the war on corruption should not be made a NASA or Jubilee affair. “In the past, leaders implicated in graft could take cover under political party positions. But this time round, we should embrace the team to tackle the issue of corruption wholesomely as Kenyans and not from the political approach,” Kajwang’ said. Outa warned against early campaigns for 2022, saying this would divert attention from achieving the handshake pact objectives. Click here for the latest political news
