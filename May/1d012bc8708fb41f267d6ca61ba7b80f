A church official has called for the prosecution and jailing of corrupt state officials to tame runaway graft. The head of the eastern territory of Salvation Army Church Henry Nyaga said the church supports the effort by the government to fight corruption. “The only way to end corruption is to jail those implicated and confiscate their property, regardless of their positions in society,” he said. Nyaga spoke on Sunday at Makueni Boys’ Secondary School. Kaiti MP Joshua Kimilu accused the EACC of doing little in the war on corruption.
