Kenya Power employees will now sign a three-year contract in a move that the company says will help it win the war against corruption. The company has been engaging its employees on a permanent basis. In a press briefing on Monday, KPLC chairman Mahboub Mohamed said the new structure will be tested until 2023, thereafter, the company will review the same. The structure, divided into four segments, will see all contracted staff subjected to a performance appraisal to gauge their suitability. "As a board, we have approved that an individual will have three years term limit subject to performance appraisal that will be carried out every year." "This is to make the employees much more involved and responsive in their specific sectors," Mohamed said.
