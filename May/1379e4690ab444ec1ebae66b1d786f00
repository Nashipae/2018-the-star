President Uhuru Kenyatta acknowledged challenges in the use of public resources in his State of the Nation Address on Wednesday. In a speech delivered at Parliament, he noted that some individuals continue to fraudulently and corruptly divert these resources for their own gain. But he issued a stern warning, in his first national address of the second term, saying gone are the days when people enjoyed public goods without fear of action.

He added that tools to prevent the vice were being built and that there will also be ways for citizens to get more involved in reporting graft. Uhuru announced that a stricter system has seen the recovery of irregularly acquired public assets worth Sh500 million. He also said that civil proceedings were initiated for the preservation and recovery of another share of assets worth at least Sh6 billion. The President asked the Judiciary and the public to play their roles. To leaders he said: "Give us the legal tools we need to win the war against the lords of graft. " While urging concerted efforts against corruption, Uhuru noted that the public must report the crimes they come across. "Families must feel ashamed by one of their members becoming involved in corruption; they must insist on the upholding of their name as a family." He added that teachers and parents should explicitly teach children the value of honesty and the concept of honour.
