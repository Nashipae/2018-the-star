Adelle Onyango is making boss moves. After the success of the Anyango Capsule Collection, dedicated to her late mother, Mary Onyango, the Kiss FM breakfast host has decided to take the collection to a new level. The lipline was part of the limitless collection by Adelle that has received rave reviews and will now be available in shops. "The collection did remarkably well with most items selling out, which is a blessing, as this was the first rollout! So, the Anyango Lipstick is now being stocked in stores. It did remarkably well and many people asked for more accessible points to buy it." This is a huge milestone for Adelle, who started out selling the lippie online. The product is already doing remarkably well and and it has already received endorsements from South Sudanese beauty queen, Atong Dong. "Atong tried the Anyango Lipstick and loved how well it felt, the moisturising element, the sheen and how well it worked with her skin tone. She is a gorgeous lady with a lot of exposure to different beauty products as an international model. The Anyango lipstick works so well with different skin tones, it’s quite magical." If Adelle's mum was to use the lippie, what would she like about it? "That it was my project for her. That would be paramount. It’s also a shade of a nail polish she always rocked, so I’m sure she’d love it." The product will be available all over Kenya. The rollout started at Greenhouse Mall on Ngong Road.
