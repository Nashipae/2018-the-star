Kiambu Governor Ferdinard Waititu has sacked the county's Water CEC John Mugwe on grounds he has failed to discharge his roles as required. The official had been suspended in April with the governor alleging that he was addicted to Facebook. "I have observed that you are neither keen on delivering on your
responsibilities nor making service delivery to the people of Kiambu your immediate focus," the May 8 letter reads in part. "You are also not a good team player hence affecting the overall performance of your responsibilities and that of the county government as a whole." "Therefore, within the powers set out in Section 31(a) of the County Government Act, 2012,I hereby relieve you of your responsibilities as a CEC and from any other portfolio which you may be holding," Waititu said. He asked the official to hand over all county assets in his possession and prepare a handover report to be submitted to the county secretary.

instead of executing his mandate to serve the people of Kiambu." "If your work is taking pictures and posting them on Facebook and
WhatsApp, then we shall not allow that," Waititu said as quoted by other media outlets. In November last year, Mugwe was transferred from the Roads docket. The sacked CEC shelved his ambitions for Kiambu governor after consultative meeting with Jubilee Party leadership. The suspension came in the wake of the resignation of Agriculture CEC Jeremiah Nyori following 'frustration by senior county government officials'.
