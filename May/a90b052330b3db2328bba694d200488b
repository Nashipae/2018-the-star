Meanwhile, William Yegon of Kenya and Amelework Fekadu of Ethiopia took their respective titles at the Harmony Geneva Marathon for Unicef over the weekend.Yegon, winner of February’s Lagos Marathon and the Geneva defending champion, broke from compatriot Joseph Aperumoi with two kilometres to go to win by more than a minute in 2:12:10.“It was really warm today so it wasn’t possible to beat my course record,” said Yegon, who clocked 2:10:31 last year. “I didn’t lead the race for long, I overtook my friend just 2km from the finish. I’m really happy to defend my title here in Geneva.”Running together with Aperumoi until the 28th kilometre, Yegon drifted back preferring to run alone. He came even with his compatriot with six kilometres remaining before pouncing four kilometres later.Aperumoi was second, clocking 2:13:54 with a third Kenyan, Wycliff Biwott, rounding out the podium in 2:17:40. Fikadu, 31, clocked 2:38:05 to win the women’s race by nearly a minute-and-a-half over Hisae Yoshimatsu of Japan, who clocked 2:39:30. Further back, Alemitu Lemu of Ethiopia finished third in 2:43:01.
