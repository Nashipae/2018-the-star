Five people have been killed and several injured in fresh attacks in Kapedo. Police said the attacks are between the warring Pokot and Turkana communities. The first incident occurred around 10 am at Chesitet in Tiaty when suspected Pokot bandits ambushed a vehicle and attacked passengers heading to Kapedo town, killing two Turkanas. “It is not yet ascertained the number of deaths and the injured but my officers are already on the ground and will give full details in a short while,” Baringo commander Smallets Munyanzi said. The second attack happened in Marigat town when the angry Turkana residents became rowdy upon hearing of the Tiaty attack. They killed three Pokot businessmen in retaliation attacks. Police were forced to shoot in the air to disperse the charged residents. “Tension is high and most people have closed their shops and run for dear lives,” a trader Ann Chelimo said. Last week on Sunday suspected Turkana bandits shot dead an 80-year old man at Ameyan in Tiaty Sub-county. The deceased Lonyangatepa Lo’kyateta brings the toll to over 20 Pokot resident so far killed in a span of one year amid Turkana and Pokot tribal clashes in Kapedo.
