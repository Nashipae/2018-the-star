County governments should empower communities by investing in civic education to promote informed public participation in development. Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana said this yesterday at the 3rd Annual Legislative Summit in Mombasa attended by senators and MCAs. Kibwana said poverty and dependency cannot be overcome without changing people’s mindsets. “Counties need to invest in civic education, community capacity-building and mindset-change programs,” the governor said. Legislators should devolve power to communities so residents can plan about the issues that affect them. County governments should allow development committees to design local priority projects and assist in implementing them to eradicate poverty, Kibwana said. The governor said public participation is not just about forums in a town hall but a development process to identify people’s needs for appropriate projects. Governor Kibwana said communities have the solutions to their problems. What they lack is the capacity and opportunity to plan for themselves, he said. “Let us devolve the powers of participation to the communities and watch self-governance take over this country through our counties,” he said. More than 2,000 members MCAs and senators attended the forum that started on Monday. It ended yesterday.
