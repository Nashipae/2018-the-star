More than 6,000 residents were displaced on Friday after Lake Baringo burst its banks on Friday. Five schools Sintaan, Lorobil, Leswa, Ng’ambo primary and Ng’ambo secondary were flooded owing to heavy rain. Resident Benson Sauroki said their houses were flooded, but no one was injured. The Kenya Red Cross Society pitched tents at Sintaan Health Centre. At least 300 displaced families are sheltering at the clinic. Lake Baringo, which has no outlets is the second largest lake in the Rift Valley after Lake Turkana. Others are Lake 94, Kamnarok and Lake Bogoria. Water levels are rising. Marigat-based human rights activist Amos Olempaka told the media on Friday schoolchildren are among the displaced. He appealed to the national government to release part of the Sh2 billion disaster budget to resettle, shelter and feed flood victims. Olempaka said 800 Ilchamus displaced at Mukutani by bandit attacks in March last year are also suffering. The IDPs are staying at a camp in Eldume, Marigat, in worn-out tents. On Monday, the Star published a story about an NGO warning residents living on the shores of Lake Baringo to move. Water Safety International chairman Joshua Chepsergon had said they feared the lake would overflow. “The water level is high. If the rain persists, it could result in floods and destruction,” he said. He said a storm wrecked several boats belonging fishermen last Saturday. They lost Sh20,000 fish they had caught. Chesergon said there were signs of water overflow in the lake that does not have a single outlet. “A similar incident occurred in 2004 when eight people were killed. We are cautioning our people to be careful,” he said. In the 2004 case, hotels such as Lake Baringo Club, Soi Safari Lodge and Tumbili were flooded. Chepsergon said since then there has been calm, however, now the weather is erratic. He told residents it is better to be safe than sorry.
