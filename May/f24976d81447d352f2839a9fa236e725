In a gazette notice dated May 24, Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua said the committee has a year to prepare a comprehensive report on the issues affecting Kenyans, although it shall make periodically written recommendations for action by the government. The team was appointed on April 30 by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga. This followed their March 9 unity pact which they said was aimed at uniting the country.
