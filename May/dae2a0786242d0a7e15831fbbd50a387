IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati has called for the replacement of four commissioners who recently resigned from the commission to enable it to carry out its duties. Chebukati said the commission is unable to hold plenary meetings since it lacks a quorum. Accompanied by commissioners Professor Abdi Guliye and Mboya Molu, the electoral body chairman said the law is clear on replacement of commissioners. Chebukati addressed the press shortly after holding a meeting with IEBC officials from Machakos County at a Machakos hotel on Wednesday. "The appointing authorities should go ahead and replace the commissioners so that we can carry on with our normal duties," Chebukati said. Chebukati, however, added that the commission was going on with its 'other' administrative duties.

Chebukati ruled out the possibility of resigning on his part saying resignation is an individual's choice. He said the commission was on a tour of all the counties to meet its staff in the branches and ensure the offices function as required. Chebukati said the commission had toured 16 counties so far. "Last year when we came into office, we set up 47 county offices. As a commission, we are committed to ensuring that these offices function," Chebukati said. He said the county staff are also tasked to network and build trust among the residents for the sake of ensuring smooth-running of future elections. The commissioners were hosted by Machakos County Elections Manager Joyce Wamalwa. Chebukati said they are ready for a referendum in the event that it is called stating that the commission has all the required materials. He said a referendum is just one election and its process is clearly outlined in the constitution.  Click here for the latest political news
