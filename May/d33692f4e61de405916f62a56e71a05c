A Coat of Arms has been created
for U.S. actress Meghan Markle, who married Britain's Prince
Harry in a lavish ceremony watched by millions last weekend,
featuring California's state flower and a blue background to
represent the Pacific Ocean. Meghan, who is now officially the Duchess of Sussex, joined
Britain's royal family when she wed Harry at Queen Elizabeth's
Windsor Castle home last Saturday. Harry's office said on Friday the design for her Coat Of
Arms had been approved by his grandmother Queen Elizabeth and
Thomas Woodcock, the Senior Herald in England based at London's
College of Arms. "Her Royal Highness worked closely with the College of Arms
throughout the design process to create a Coat of Arms that was
both personal and representative," Kensington Palace said in a
statement. Meghan was born and raised in Los Angeles and the statement
said the blue background of the shield on her arms represented
the Pacific Ocean off California's coast while two golden rays
were symbolic of the state's sunshine. It also features three quills which represent communication
and the power of words while beneath the shield are a collection
of golden poppies, California's state flower, and wintersweet,
which grows at Kensington Palace where she now lives with her
new husband, the palace said. Next to the shield are two "Supporters", one for her husband
and one relating to her - a songbird with an open beak which
also represents the power of communication. "Good heraldic design is nearly always simple and the Arms
of The Duchess of Sussex stand well beside the historic beauty
of the quartered British Royal Arms," Woodcock said. The technical description of the arms is "Azure a Feather
bendwise Argent quilled between two Bendlets Or all between two
like Feathers Argent quilled Or". Click here for the latest political news
