President Uhuru
Kenyatta has appointed former Rift Valley regional coordinator
Wanyama Musiambu to lead efforts to rid the country of counterfeit
goods. The president made
the declaration during a round table at State House on May 10. Musiambu, who is now deputy Head of
Public Service, has been handed the Herculean responsibility of curtailing
corruption which is the key facilitator of illicit trade in Kenya. Apart from
counterfeits, he will also deal with fake business stickers, dumping
and entry of fake goods through all ports of entry, mainly through
the port of Mombasa. The move is likely
to come as a relief to consumers who are concerned about an uncontrolled
influx of fake products being sold in Kenya lately. Recently, the
anti-counterfeit agency, together with security agencies, seized a consignment of emergency
contraceptives at the Inland Container Depot in Embakasi in Nairobi. Corruption in
authorities tasked to control import or dumping of fakes in the
country is blamed for the infiltration of such goods. On this, the
president has emphasised the need for a multi-sectoral approach to deal
with corruption incorporating the private and public sectors; the
judiciary and legislature. "We must say
enough is enough because the vice has the potential to undermine the
Big Four and completely destroy Kenya," he said at the event. Counterfeits have
become commonplace in Kenya in the wake of citizens not being in a
position to tell the difference between the fakes and the original
goods. Industrialisation CS
Adan Mohamed, during the recent Embakasi ICD raid, said: "The goods
may sometimes achieve the set standards but they are still
counterfeit by the fact that the manufacturers are not the IP owners
of the brand." Pirated goods that
find their way into Kenya most times include electronics among them
phones, leather products and medical items, whose trade costs manufactures losses amounting in billions of shillings. Click here for the latest political news
