The EACC has denied claims it is holding a Malindi magistrate whose colleagues reported as missing on Thursday. The Kenya Magistrate and Judges Association wrote to the anti-graft agency demanding to know Corilus Osero's whereabouts. The claim is that he was arrested at his workplace on Wednesday and is yet to be traced. EACC boss Halakhe Waqo said in a statement that the Malindi senior resident magistrate is not in the agency's custody. "Corilus Osero Nyawira is not in the custody of the Commission, and neither has he
been summoned to appear for questioning at any of the Commissionâ€™s
offices." This was after he received a request for
information on the whereabouts of the missing magistrate. Waqo decried the negative and false
impression created by circulation of the letter from the magistrates' association before it was received at the
EACC offices. Read: Judges write to EACC after Malindi magistrate 'goes missing' Click here for the latest political news
