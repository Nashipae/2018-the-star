Residents living near Masinga dam have been urged to move to higher grounds following fears that the dam might burst its banks. Energy CS Charles Keter says the residents have until Friday to move to safer grounds. Keter also urged those living near River Tana to also move as they will be affected in case the dam breaks its banks. The warning comes just days after the Patel Dam in Solai Nakuru burst its banks killing 46 people. The privately owned Patel Dam broke its banks at around 9 pm on Wednesday last week. It’s owned by Mansukul Patel, a horticulture farmer who uses the water to irrigate his flower farms. The water swept through three villages stretching about seven kilometres. The villages are mostly inhabited by about 3,000 people most of whom are casual labourers on the flower farms. Click here for the latest political news
