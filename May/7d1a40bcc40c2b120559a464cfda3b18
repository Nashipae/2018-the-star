Grabbed public land in Mavoko will be repossessed. Athi River deputy county commissioner David Juma on Saturday put on notice cartels grabbing land and selling it to private developers. Juma said the government will not entertain land grabbing. He spoke at a public baraza in Mlolongo. Residents have complained of grabbing of school playgrounds and public land meant for markets and hospitals. “They have grabbed parcels of land meant for public utilities in Mlolongo. Some former political leaders are part of the syndicate,” Mlolongo chief Peter Ndunda said. Ndunda said grabbers had taken over all public land in the area. Among the plots grabbed is land set aside for the building of an AP post. Juma said the government will repossess the plots.
