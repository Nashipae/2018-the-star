The European Union has pledged to align its development assistance to Kenya's Big Four agenda of housing, security, healthcare and manufacturing. Speaking during the celebrations of the European Union Day in Muthaiga, EU Ambassador to Kenya Stefano Dejak endorsed the agenda and vowed to continue supporting the devolution process at all government levels. Through the Instrument for Devolution Advice and Support (IDEAS) program, the Union has provided grants of Sh11.2 Billion ($112 Dollars million) to 15 counties for local development. In addition to supporting the development projects and programs, the EU also launched the "She Is We" campaign, a call for gender equality around the world which aims to promote women and girls at the forefront of sustainable development. The "She Is We" campaign aims to highlight the vital role that women and girls can play in society and the importance of their participation and leadership in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. As part of the campaign, Stefan said the European Union is publicising the work of individuals around the world whose efforts are helping, empowering and protecting women and girls in their communities. Their stories will also be shared through both social media (#SheIsWe) and the traditional mass media. “Here in Kenya, short clips about such individuals are being screened as part of the ongoing European Film Festival, bringing European cinema to a broad range of audiences until the final Sunday of this month free of charge,” he said.
