Televangelist Gilbert Deya has been released on Sh10 million cash bail or Sh10 million bond by High Court judge Luka Kimaru. The preacher was deported to Kenya from the UK to face child theft charges. Deya is charged with five counts of stealing five children, all aged under 14 years, between 2002 and 2004, at Mountain View Estate, Nairobi. In his ruling on Tuesday, Kimaru said stringent conditions should be set so the accused does not abscond. "The accused has a history of absconding and maligning the courts. He should follow terms to make sure he attends court." The matter will be mentioned on May 29 for confirmation of whether Deya paid the cash bail or bond. In January, the High Court quashed the Sh1 million bond Deya had been granted after the DPP sought orders to cancel the release term. Magistrate Francis Andayi had granted Deya bond on grounds that the DPP failed to conclude the case in 120 days as earlier directed by the High Court. At that time, Kimaru ordered that Deya remain in custody until the case is concluded.
