Two West Pokot leaders on Monday accused security organs of laxity in fighting crime in Laikipia and the Kapedo border point between Baringo and Turkana counties. Governor John Lonyangapuo and Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto criticised the security team for not responding to recent attacks. They spoke in Kapenguria and Sewero respectively. The two called for the sacking of top security officers following persistent attacks. Lonyangapuo accused the government of victimising the Pokot community. “We don’t want blanket community condemnation. There are few criminals causing havoc and killing people, forcing others to revenge,” he said.
