One of the five suspects accused of attacking former Nairobi Central Business District Association chairman Timothy Muriuki has been charged with violent robbery. Brian Owino (pictured) is accused of violently robbing Muriuki of Sh100,000 on April 30 at Boulevard Hotel in Nairobi. Through his lawyers, Owino asked the court for lenient bond. He denied the charges before Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi and was released on Sh200,000 bail. Police said Owino surrendered himself on Monday, two weeks after the authorities placed a Sh500,000 bounty on him and four others. The rest are still wanted for assault and violent robbery charges. Last week, East African Legislative Assembly MP Simon Mbugua and two others were charged with the same offence. They denied the charges and are out on a similar bond. Mbugua was charged alongside Benjamin Odhiambo, alias Solo, and Anthony Ombok, alias Jamal. Magistrate Martha Mutuku said the prosecution failed to table documents indicating the relationship between the accused and the witnesses. "The prosecution did not provide enough evidence to show that the accused will interfere with the witnesses,‚Äù she said. Mutuku said the accused have a right to be released on bail.
