A team investigating the loss of Sh9 billion at the National Youth Service has been unable to obtain crucial documents. Officials at the Gender and Youth ministry are said to be holding on to key documents relating to the scam. The multi-agency team has written to the head of finance at the ministry and asked him to deliver all documents immediately. In a letter by John Kariuki on behalf of the director of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, George Kinoti, the investigators have demanded all processed original vouchers, both paid and unpaid, from January 1, 2014, to April 2 this year. The team has asked for all tender committee minutes, both ministerial and departmental, for January 1, 2011 to date. Meanwhile, Public Service CS Margaret Kobia in a memo yesterday sent procurement, finance and accounting officers under investigation on leave. She directed the officers to proceed on compulsory leave immediately, pending investigations. Kobia has appointed James Tembur as acting officer in charge of the service, pending administrative reorganisation. “To ensure the continued and smooth running of the day-to-day affairs of the service, Tembur is required to exercise his new role with immediate effect and keep the Cabinet Secretary updated on a weekly basis,” a notice stated. PS Lillian Omollo and NYS director general Richard Ndubai last week stepped aside to allow investigations into the scandal. Omollo has denied claims that Sh9 billion was lost. She disputed a report by the director general of the National Intelligence Service that 13 vouchers totalling Sh8 billion were paid to “ghost” companies for non-existent supplies to the NYS.
