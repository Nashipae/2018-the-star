Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua has been barred from cross-examining a court’s deputy registrar in her petition against Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru. Kerugoya High Court Judge Lucy Gitari ruled that a report on the scrutiny of the KIEMs kits be part of evidence in Karua’s case. The scrutiny was led by deputy registrar Wambu Otieno. Gitari said Karua could not cross-examine a court officer. Karua’s lawyer Charles Kihara wanted to interrogate Otieno to clarify parts of the report. Waiguru’s lawyer Paul Nyamodi opposed Kihara’s request, saying it was against procedure to interrogate a witness who had not filed an affidavit. Nyamodi also opposed Karua’s application to refer to form 37A and 37B, saying they were not part of the petition. Allowing Karua to refer to the forms would be admitting new evidence, Nyamodi said. ‘’The petitioner wants to bring new evidence through the back door because she has reached a hard corner in this petition. Such evidence must not be admitted,” Nyamodi said.
