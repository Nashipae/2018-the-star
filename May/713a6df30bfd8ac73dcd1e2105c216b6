Kitui Tourism and Sports executive Patrick Musau is upbeat the county will make up to Sh150 million by hosting the Kitui Rugby 7s extravaganza this weekend. Musau said on Tuesday preparations for the three-day sporting event set for June 1-3 at the Ithookwe Showground in the outskirts of Kitui town had been finalized and it was all system go. ''Hotel and accommodation business is expected to pick during the three-day event. We expect to host up to 20,000 guests, who will conservatively bring in between Sh100 million to Sh150 million in spending during the rugby jamboree,” Musau said during a media briefing at the Ithookwe grounds. He said Daniel Ndambuki’s Churchill Live event will also be hosted on stage during the rugby event to entertain participants. Musau said out of 32 teams, which had expressed interest to participate in the games, 18 teams have been cleared, two of them from Uganda.
