Organisers of the Cutchi Leva six-a-side tournament have to reduced the number of teams to 18 for this year’s edition due to unavailability of playing grounds. The tournament which is used as a curtain raiser for the Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association (NPCA) league is set to bowl off on Friday at Samaj School in Nairobi West. With most of the grounds not ready to host any cricket match due to the recent rains, the organizers have opted to use only one ground out of the usual four. “We were not able to get most of the grounds ready for the event. All the grounds we had in mind were waterlogged,” said Lalji Bhudia, a member of the organising committee. With clubs like Ngara Sports Club, Nairobi Club and Sikh Union Nairobi unavailable to host the matches, the organisers have opted to reduce the number of teams for this year’s event by 15 with Super League clubs only required to send one team. However, Super League sides like Sir Ali Muslim and Obuya Academy are not able to field a team. In the past, clubs were allowed to field more than one side for the event but with the difficulty in acquiring more grounds, each club has been limited to one team. Defending champions Kanbis open their campaign against the winner of the opening match between their rivals Swamipaba and SCLPS Mombasa. Another super league side Nairobi Gymkhana will open their campaign with a fixture against Sai Silver while Stray Lions will battle it out with hosts SCLPS School. Kongonis will play Basco with Ruaraka taking on Risingat.
