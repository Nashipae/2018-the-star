Of course, when Prezzo started to construct the framework of his music career, we all watched, knowing amazing things lay ahead. To most, he was like an assurance that we could have our very own hip hop stars. In the years that followed, we knew he had the command to release tracks that would do well commercially and dominate the airwaves. In spite of the harsh criticism that was regularly directed at his borrowed style back in the day, he always had a few hours to spare in the studio. For him, one of motifs of his rap career was money and wealth, which he represented pretty well. And we all fell in love with the act he constantly put out. One of the most memorable moments was when he flew a chopper from Wilson Airport to the Carnivore Grounds simply to cause a stir at an awards show. His exploits were integral to his survival in the entertainment scene. He needed to be felt and constantly gave us something to discuss. His fervent claim for “king of bling” was an intentional move to articulate the emotion of his presence, and maybe was his interview with Betty Kyalo. Thanks to his braggadocio, people believe he deserved to win Big Brother 7. However, now, he seems to have slacked musically. The last time he gave as a proper hit was like five years ago. He still holds on to his rap-cellency title, but unfortunately the game has already been turned sideways by fellow hip hop comrades. He’s completely lost touch with his creative freedom or maybe the industry has simply outgrown him. His recent release with his long-time rival Jaguar can be considered as a step forward towards behavioural maturation, but doesn’t really elevate his contribution to the music industry. The same can be said about all other tracks he has recently been part of. At least we still have the ardent entertainer willing to do anything for a trending hashtag.
