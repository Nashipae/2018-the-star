An MP yesterday said residents will not move from their land to make way for coal mining in the Mui Basin. Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi said land was greatly undervalued. He rejected the benefit-sharing agreement signed in 2014 by Kitui leaders and a Chinese coal mining company. Mulyungi said the agreement shortchanges residents and only benefits the county government. Mui Basin is in his constituency. The Fenxi Industry Mining Company is to start mining in six months but growing resistance might delay operations. Mulyungi told Governor Charity Ngilu to stay away from the project. He spoke at Mathuki Shopping Centre where he addressed villagers occupying blocks A, B, C and D. “Locals are very comfortable in their land without the trillions promised, which they are not sure they will benefit from,” Mulyungi said. Recently, Ngilu told residents they will be paid and relocated to places like Kanyoonyoo, Engamba and Sosama. Mining will help end poverty, she said. “No one is willing to leave their homes to go and live in the promised flats. My people are not relocating,” Mulyungi said. He said that according to Kamba tradition, people are buried at their family homes, not in cemeteries. “The at [relocation] is something disturbing the locals and they cannot exhume their deceased and carry their skeletons to go and bury them elsewhere.” Click here for the latest political news
