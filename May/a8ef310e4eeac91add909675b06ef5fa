The Salaries and Remuneration Commission is one of the
independent commissions and independent offices established under the Constitution.
However, since its creation slightly over six years ago, it has encountered increasing
resistance in executing its mandate of independently setting salaries for
public servants and state officers. The challenges have multiplied in recent days,
with petitions for judicial review mounted by diverse groups disaffected by its
decisions â€” from MPs to MCAs and, this week, the Judicial Service Commission. At a time when its authority is being challenged and its
decisions suspended by courts, Parliament has also amended the SRC Act to provide
a window for Executive discretion in the appointment of the chair. That flies
in the face of the intended autonomy from the State that the Constitution confers
on independent bodies. As the amendments
to the National Police Service Act have shown, every time the State gets involved
in the formation of a commission, its independence is eroded or so perceived. It is noteworthy that amendments to the SRC Act are
coming ahead of the recruitment of the second crop of commissioners to succeed
the Sarah Serem team, whose terms expired in December. Most of the independent bodies are suffocating from
inadequate funding and state manipulation. They need space to perform their functions,
which are critical ventilation against the repressive tendencies of the State. More
so the SRC.
