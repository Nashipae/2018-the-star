The StarTimes terrestrial technology platform offers four bouquets. Subscribers can now pay a daily fee of as low as Sh22 on Nyota bouquet, Sh50 on Basic bouquet, Sh83 for Classic bouquet or Sh125 for Unique bouquet. The company also launched a mobile app to enable provision of television viewing on mobile. StarTimes Mobile Application will see over 60 premium television channels available on mobile devices.
