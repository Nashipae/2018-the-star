At least 130 families in Garissa have received food from Muslims as part of Ramadhan donations. The Sh1.6 million donation was made by the Northeastern Youth for Development (NEYD). CEO Adhan Awle said the charity is sponsored by America’s Zakat Foundation. “We also collected contributions from residents. We expect the families to have enough food for the next 15 days,” he said. The NEYD will also make donations to families at the Hagadera refugee camp. Awle said the refugees need support as food supplies from humanitarian agencies are not enough. “We want to ease their suff ering. Every less fortunate member of the society needs our support,” he said. Food items donated included wheat fl our, sugar, tea leaves and oil. Awle said they carry out rigorous vetting to ensure only the genuinely needy people get the donations. “We don’t have too much to give. That’s why we are focussing on those with the greatest need for assistance. Residents should contribute for more people to get supplies,” he said. Last month, the government said it will pay tax imposed on imported dates for use during Ramadhan as a goodwill gesture. Ramadhan runs from May 15 to June 14.
