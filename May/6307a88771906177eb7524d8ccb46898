The son of a former government pathologist was yesterday charged with stealing a heart from a corpse. Moses Njue’s son, Lemuel Mureithi, was accused of stealing Timothy Muumba’s heart on June 25, 2015. Mureithi was also charged with destroying evidence during the postmortem conducted at Lee Funeral Home in Nairobi. He is accused of destroying the heart between June 25 and September 21 the same year, knowing that it could be used as evidence in court. Mureithi denied the charges before Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi. He was released on a bail of Sh300,000 or a Sh1 million bond. His lawyer Kennedy Wanyanga asked the court for lenient bond terms, saying the accused were a father and his son Njue was charged with the same offences on May 15. Njue committed the offence at Lee Funeral Home on the same date. Apart from the count of destroying evidence, Njue also faced another charge of illegal removal of the heart from Muumba's body. Mureithi had initially failed to appear in court before he was summoned for plea-taking yesterday. Wanyanga asked the court to defer the plea-taking saying the charges were related to a case filed by Muumba's family filed at the High Court. Njue is out on a bail of Sh300,000. The cases were consolidated. It will be heard on July 17. Andayi warned Njue against interfering with witnesses.
