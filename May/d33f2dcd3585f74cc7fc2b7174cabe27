The Communication Authority has issued a fresh warning on the resurgence of an international phone calls scam. 'Wangiri fraud' hit Kenya in January when residents complained about receiving phone calls from strange numbers. People receive very brief calls, or find notifications for missed calls, from unknown numbers whose prefixes include +41 (Switzerland), +963 (Syria), +252 (Somalia) and +37 (Latvia). Those who fall for the scheme usually call back and are unknowingly redirected to premium numbers that drain lines of credit. Wangiri is a Japanese word that means 'one ring and cut'. In a statement on Thursday, CA Director General Francis Wangusi said the National Kenya Computer Incidence Response Team Coordination Centre had confirmed fresh reports of Wangiri. Wangusi noted that postpaid customers lose more as their billing is at the end of the month. He warned the public against returning the calls. “If you happen to be a victim, report the number to your service provider so it is blocked," he said.
