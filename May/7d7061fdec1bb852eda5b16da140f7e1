The Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital  seeks to align its strategic plan with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s call for universal health care in the Big Four agenda. The board, chaired by Mark Bor, will strengthen partnership with counties through training medical officers and the registrar. CEO Dr Wilson Aruasa on Saturday said, "The President has a noble and clear vision, especially for healthcare, and as a national hospital, we will work to ensure we implement related programmes."
