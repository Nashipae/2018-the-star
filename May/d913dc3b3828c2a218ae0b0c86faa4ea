Three people perished and one was critically injured when a quarry collapsed on them as they shielded from rains in Juja, Kiambu County. The tragedy occurred at Juja Farm area as the four who work in local mining quarries sought shelter from heavy rains that pounded the area on Wednesday. Police with the help of residents and administration officials retrieved the bodies from the debris and took them to General Kago Funeral Home in Thika. The injured was rushed to Thika level Five Hospital. Confirming the incident, Juja police commander Patrick Manyasi said that two of the dead hailed from Gatundu while one was a resident of Gachororo village in Juja. The police boss warned locals and quarry workers against taking shelter in areas prone to landslides especially in the quarries to avoid loss of lives. “We don’t want to lose more lives due to the effects of the ongoing rains. We must be very cautious. It’s better you get rained on than taking shelter in a place likely to cave in,” Manyasi said. Kalimoni Chief Sarah Waigwe who helped in rescue efforts also asked residents to avoid sheltering under quarries in the prevailing weather conditions. Heavy rains have left large parts of the area submerged in water and rendered roads impassable.
