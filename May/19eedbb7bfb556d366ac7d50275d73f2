The intended constitutional reforms would be an empty exercise unless its processes are fixed first and relevant institutions cleaned up, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has said. He termed as dangerous the ongoing debate of Yes and No camps of the proposed referendum even before the poll question is framed. ANC supports a three-tier government with a hybrid Executive tailored along the French model, Mudavadi told journalists at his rural home on Saturday. The hybrid system was contained in the original Bomas draft that was later changed in Kilifi and rejected in the 2005 referendum. Mudavadi proposed restructuring of the Executive, strengthening devolution, electoral reforms and implementation of the one-third gender rule. “We demand that President Uhuru Kenyatta must now provide leadership and get IEBC, which is in tatters, back on its feet because the reforms may require a referendum and the commission in its current state cannot be trusted to deliver a credible by-election, let alone a national referendum,” he said. He said it is critical to enlighten Kenyans on what needs to be changed so they can engage in an informed debate and make the right decision at the referendum. “We don’t was a repeat of 1992 when section 2A of the Constitution was removed reintroducing multiparty in Kenya but loopholes were not sealed leaving the Kanu men to say Moi’s first term would begin in 1997,” he said. The ANC leader said Kenyans need well-thought out constitutional amendments for posterity. On next year’s census, he said institutions must ensure the exercise is not “rigged.” Click here for the latest political news
