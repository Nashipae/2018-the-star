It was a sorrowful day in Kianjugu village, Kirinyaga county, on Tuesday afternoon as University of Nairobi law student Dennis Munene Gichangi was laid to rest. Munene went missing on May 8 and was found dead at Mtwapa’s Marina Beach, 600 kilometres away, after nearly two weeks. Mourners eulogised him as the family’s hope. “Although there is so much that you have left bare, things we will never do, thoughts we will never share... I have hope that those sleeping will rise,” his sister Mercy Gichangi said in her tribute on behalf of the family. Before joining the university, Munene graduated with a diploma in journalism from the Kenya Institute of Mass Communication. Former classmates from KIMC eulogised him as a perfect example of a principled person. The college eulogised him as the only student who managed to balance drama, academics and Christian Union activities. The family said it chose to bury him soon after he was found to enable them recover from the trauma they have suffered since he went missing. But even as he was interred, the cause and circumstances under which Munene died remained a mystery. Mourners urged the government to investigate how the body ended up in the ocean. “Munene did not know how to swim. He has been a close friend for long and every time we visited Mombasa together, he would take photographs. He loved photography but not swimming,” a close friend said. A post-mortem showed Munene drowned. Records say the body was delivered by a police officer after it was collected on the shores. Investigations are going on. Click here for the latest political news
