Former Likoni MP Masoud Mwahima has
withdrawn his appeal in the case against Mishi Mboko's election. Mwahima had appealed judge Erick
Ogola's March decision to dismiss his petition for failure to prove his case.

The Jubilee Party politician did not give an explanation. The petition was withdrawn by appellate judges Alvishram Nassir, Martha Koome and Wanjiru Karanja. In his judgement, judge Ogola
validated Mishi's election saying the petitioner failed to prove his
case. He said though the court had noted some minor irregularities, they did not affect the outcome of the vote. Ogola further said the scrutiny and recount of votes at 10 polling
stations revealed Mishi's decreased by seven while Mwahima's
increased by one. As such, the judge noted that the margin of votes between the petitioner and the
MP was huge. Ogola acknowledged thatÂ form 35A was filled
with information meant for form 35B but said the mistake was an unintentional mathematical error and a minor miscalculation. "These officers worked for more than 24 hours without sleep. It is possible for someone to make such mistakes due to fatigue,"
he said. The judge further said the petitioner failed to prove how a power blackout during the counting of votes affected him to the point of losing his votes through theft. Ogola further said the former legislator did not specify the polling stations where votes were counted without electricity. Click here for the latest political news
