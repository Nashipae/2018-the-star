The government must explain to electricity consumers how their bills are calculated and justified. The average consumer has no idea what the regulator does and what it means to pay an extra 35 per cent to a vendor. Tax-paying Kenyans want to understand why a prepaid token, costing for instance Sh1,000, will first cover other charges up to Sh700 — but only buy Sh300 power, or less. The least the government can do is harmonise taxes levied on consumers so Kenyans enjoy what their money buys. And why hasn't the cost of electricity come down, despite geothermal electricity being added to the grid? Last year, electricity costs hit a five-year high. We could attribute that partly to drought, but now there's plenty of rain and hydro-power should be cheap. It makes no sense to levy a fixed charge on consumers who don't use power. Why would a prepaid meter user pay Sh174 monthly if they don't spend power? We are told fixed charges cater for services such as meter reading and customer care. What customer care? Come clean. End the hide-and-seek games. Shed light on the murky billing problem.
