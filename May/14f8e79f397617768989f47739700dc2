Wrangles by Knut officials have affected financial
flow so branches should brace for doldrums, a National Executive
Council member has said. Dan Aloo noted on Tuesday that Deputy Secretary General
Hesbon Otieno's team did not remove SG Willson Sossion as a signatory of the union's bank accounts. "Simply put, â€‹Knut accounts are now inactive as no money can be withdrawn without the
signature of Sossion, (Acting Chairman) Wycliff Omucheyi and (National Treasurer) John Matiang'i," he said. Sossion
and Omucheyi are feuding - Sossion says he is pushing for his ouster but the chair has denied these allegations. Aloo claimed Otieno's plan is to have himself as a signatory. "The is illegal," he said on phone. "â€‹Standard
procedure on removing the name of person from a joint account requires a
consent letter from the person or a death certificate.  Sossion is yet
to consent. Union branches should brace for financial doldrums." Aloo further said Sossion, a Nominated ODM MP, will not be ejected as he is in office legally and there is a stay order. A section of members say the trouble SG is biased and does not serve teachers' interests, so they want Otieno to take over But Aloo noted: â€‹"â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹Sosion
is the legal and legitimate SG of Knut as per the 2010 Constitution, Labour Relations Act, 2007, the Knut Constitution of
2013 the and ADC of 2017 held at Wild Waters in Mombasa. Whatever is going on is illegal. There is a court order. One is innocent until proven guilty." On the hiring of people to block the SG from accessing his office, the council member said delegates and workers are with him. "Read our walls; teachers are also with Sossion," he said. More on this: Sossion locked out of Knut headquarters, to file contempt case During
the Annual Delegates Conference, a fight broke out over Sossion's stay. Teachers were
divided and Central delegates were angry. Rift
Valley and Nyanza ganged up to fight Central, ultimately defeating them. A resolution was passed for Sossion was to continue serving as the SG. This, the delegates averred, was in the interest of teachers. Details: [VIDEO] Chaos at KNUT meeting as officials demand Sossion exit Aloo
said the NEC must unconditionally â€‹respect resolutions of the ADC and the  National Advisory Council, which recongise Sossion. "â€‹National Steering Committee members must obey court orders. â€‹Goons who blocked the
SG from accessing his office must face the rule of law," he said. Aloo wants â€‹NEC and steering members "behind the coup to withdraw and apologise
or else they'll meet the wrath of teachers through the delegates". Alternatively, he said, coup plotters will be recalled. Click here for the latest political news
