The political shelf life of leading Western politicians will come to an end in 2022, Lugari MP Ayub Savula has said. Savula said ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetang’ula, Cyrus Jirongo (UDP) and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya risk being irrelevant unless they unite to deliver the presidency in the next election. “Our big brothers must shape up. They should rally  their support and resources behind one of them in the next election. The new generation will prepare to take over in 2032,” Savula said. The ANC deputy party leader spoke on Monday at Chimoi Catholic Church in Lugari during a fundraiser. Mudavadi and Wetang’ula are working to merge their parties, but Oparanya wants to run for President on an ODM ticket. Savula said the 2032 presidential race will be a different ball game. He  said Wetang’ula will be 78, Oparanya, 75, Jirongo, 73 and Mudavadi 72 years. “Let’s tell each other the truth. These leaders should see reason and unite. It is difficult to beat a sitting President in an election in Africa,” Savula said. Mudavadi ran for the top seat in 2013 on a UDF ticket and came a distant third. Jirongo preformed dismally in the polls last year, while Wetang’ula has supported ODM leader Raila Odinga  in the last two elections. Savula took a swipe at unnamed Luhya leaders for criticising each other at funerals and political gatherings. Disrespectful talk fans division within the Luhya community, he said.
