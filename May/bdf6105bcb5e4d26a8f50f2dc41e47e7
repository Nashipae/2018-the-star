A woman accused of cutting her husband’s private parts in Eldoret has been charged with causing grievous harm. Erika Shitenda denied the charge before chief magistrate Charles Obulutsa. She was released on Sh20,000 bail. Shitenda is accused of causing grievous harm to John Igumala on May 22 at Huruma Estate in Eldoret. The case will be heard on June 11. The man is still admitted at the Moi Referral Hospital, where doctors have restored his private parts. Obulutsa asked the accused if she knew the complainant in the case to which she responded he was her husband. The man had told police he woke up at night because of pain and found his private parts bleeding. “I woke up in deep pain at 2am on that day and when I switched on the light to see what was happening, my wife ran away. When I checked, I found my private parts had been cut,” he said. He said neighbours rushed him to hospital. Igumala said his wife did not return until she was arrested by the police the following day.
