The 14-member handshake committee should come up with a ways for meaningful reconciliation, a commissioner with the national cohesion agency has said. The framework should also address structural issues dividing Kenyans, Roba Sharamo of the National Cohesion and Integration Commission said. He was addressing an interfaith workshop in Garissa on Friday. Sharamo said the NCIC is keen to strengthen interfaith institutions as a way of bringing Kenyans together. Interfath groups should work with the government to promote unity. He urged politicians to tone down their rhetoric that threatens national harmony. Politics that could tear the country apart in every election period should end, he said. The Constitution has improved the lives of Kenyans through devolution, Sharamo said. But there is still room for improvement. Any review of it should be done without political bias, the commissioner said. The commissioner said Kenya should borrow a leaf from Rwanda where the speaker of the National Assembly or the Senate does not necessarily come from the ruling party to promoting exclusivity.
