Children’s rights organisations have opposed amendment to the Children’s Act giving the Child Welfare Society of Kenya a decisive say in their affairs. Opponents say the amendment will make other institutions irrelevant and could kill them. The amendment is contained in the Statute Miscellaneous Bill of 2018. It also would create a national adoption society and give the Cabinet Secretary powers over charitable children’s institutions and adoption societies. The bill would also establish committees and working groups. The organisations opposed include the The National Council of Children’s Services, the Department of Children Services and The National Adoption Committee. “There was no public participation in the amendments. What will happen to the existing structures that have developed policies on how children matters are handled?” an official, who did not wish to be named, asked. The amendments follow a new children’s bill yet to be tabled in Parliament. The drafters of the bill argue that children were not consulted in the previous Act. A statute miscellaneous bill usually introduces minor changes to existing Acts but according to the official, these changes being called for are major. “If it was changing the name of the organisation, that is minor. But we may be looking at changing how the entire system works. This is really bad,” the official said. The organisations have come up with hashtags on social media aimed at getting MPs and the public to stop amendments to the Act. They include #IfikieParliament #Stoptheamendment #bringthenewchildrenlaw, #childrensbillKE. They want Parliament to delete all nine proposals which they say are problematic. They include Sections 2, 147, 156,157,163, 177,179, 183A and 197A. The new bill recognises intersex children. It also gives more guidance on how to handle children in conflict with the law.
