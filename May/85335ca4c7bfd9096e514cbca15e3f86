Massive growth of new construction projects within Kilimani area is continuously contributing to global warming. Kilimani Project Foundation Programme Assistant Martha Wamuyu said concrete absorbs a lot of heat during a sunny day, which takes time to cool. "So many apartments are coming up within Kilimani. This means a lot of trees are cleared to pave way for roads and buildings,"she said. Wamuyu, who was peaking during a tree planting initiative on Friday, said the trees that have been cut down need to be replaced if the impact of climate change is to be mitigated. A report by UNEP revealed that buildings are responsible for 40 per cent of theglobal annual energy consumption and up to 30 percent of all energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. This sector is also responsible for one-third of humanities resource consumption, including 12 percent of all fresh-water use, and produces up to 40 percent of annual solid waste. The Foundation partnered with Nairobi county, Hurlingham's Four Points hotel staff, Organic Farmers , Kilimani Chiefs office representative and NIC bank during the launch of the "Grey2Green" tree planting initiative at Milimani Primary School. The drive is under an initiative dubbed "Grey2Green" and was started in 2016 by the Kilimani Project Foundation. It seeks to conserve, green and beautify the environment by planting trees and flowers around Kilimani neighborhood. Wamuyu said Kilimani was once a very green neighborhood.
