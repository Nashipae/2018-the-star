North Korea has said it is still willing to talk "at any time in any form" after US President Donald Trump abruptly cancelled his meeting with Kim Jong-un. Vice-foreign minister Kim Kye-gwan said Trump's decision was "extremely regrettable". President Trump blamed the North's "open hostility" for the cancellation. The summit would have been the first time a sitting US president had met a North Korean leader. The details of the meeting in Singapore on 12 June were unclear. But talks would have focused on ways of denuclearising the Korean peninsula and reducing tensions. Media captionTrump: "US military is ready if necessary" Trump announced the cancellation in the form of a letter personally addressed to Kim. A senior administration official in the US later gave further details, saying North Korea had shown "a profound lack of good faith". There were a series of "broken promises" from Pyongyang, the official told reporters, including when the White House sent the deputy chief of staff to Singapore to meet North Korean diplomats ahead of the summit. "The North Koreans didn't show up. They simply stood us up." The official also said President Trump had "dictated every word" of his letter to Kim Jong-un after talking with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Click here for the latest political news
