The first-ever national census for street families is nearing completion, five months after it started, CEO of Street Families Rehabilitation Trust Fund Robert Njogu has said. The official said lack of data has partly obstructed rescue operations and rehabilitation. He said street families have been increasing, posing security threats. There are reports they are involved in muggings, stabbing and stealing. In January, a survey was started by Special Programmes ministry with support from Unicef and the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. The count cost Sh50 million, with the government footing Sh35 million and Unicef settling the rest. Njogu said they have partnered with 39 institutions to improve the conditions of street children. Speaking in Mombasa yesterday, he said the number of street urchins in Nairobi is at an all-time high, while in Mombasa it has been reducing. The CEO denied the country has a population of about 300,000 street families as “widely reported”. “Data cleaning and analysis is almost done, so is the national policy. With new records, we shall segregate them in terms of gender for proper aid,” Njogu said. He said the Devolution ministry is forming county chapters for the fund. Njogu said more than Sh270 million has been disbursed for the mandate. The chapters will be co-chaired by county commissioners and county governments. The board will also have one representative from the Children’s department, faith-based organisation, community leadership and Kenya Police. The chapters will be responsible for â€‹coordinating rehabilitation and conducting public education on street families issues.
