Police killed three suspected gangsters in a shootout in Nairobi's Dandora area on Friday. They recovered three pistols with four bullets, an AK 47 magazine with four bullets, crude weapons, a pair of police boots and a jungle hat. Two of the pistols were homemade and the third a Ceska. A police report states that officers on patrol were informed that four suspected criminals had been spotted at their hideout in Ongopa area along Komarock road. The report filed at Mowlem police post in Dandora said residents claimed the gang had carried out a series of robberies in the area. The police officers pursued the criminals but upon finding them, they started firing while escaping on foot. Three were killed, while the fourth one fled towards Maili Saba, in the incident that took place at about 4pm. Buruburu OCPD Geoffrey Maiyek said nobody was injured in the incident. Maiyek said investigations will establish whether the gang committed any of the crimes that have been reported. "We have taken fingerprints for analysis to determine if they match those of suspects in courts," he told the Star by phone. The bodies were taken to City Mortuary.
