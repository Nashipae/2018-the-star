Long-suffering Kenyans used to police harassment and extrajudicial killings thought the days of impunity were numbered when IPOA was formed in 2011. The first commissioners of the Independent Policing Oversight Authority took office in June 2012. Kenyans hoped the authority would transform the much-maligned police force and make it efficient, law-abiding, humane and accountable. But six years down the line, only four convictions have been secured out of more than 9,000 cases lodged with the authority. This is despite the authority spending Sh3 billion from the National Treasury to run the secretariat and Sh34 million in remuneration to the eight commissioners. The expenditure does not include donor funding from the international community. Victims of police brutality say IPOA’s performance has been dismal, emboldening police impunity. Mathare resident Sarah Wangari, 40, sees IPOA as a formation designed to excuse police excesses and give victims false hope. “My son (Alex Mwangi) was killed by cops along Juja Road around 3.30pm on November 18 last year. They pumped 10 bullets into his body. He was walking home from his workplace,” she said. Informed by IPOA inaction on previous cases from her neighbourhood, Wangari had opted not to report, but after being convinced by Mathare Social Justice, she filed a complaint. “I was hopeful justice would be served. But my fears have been confirmed as my case, just like those I had heard about, is ending with IPOA's promise of 'we are investigating',” Wangari said. MORE TESTIMONIES Lucy Wambui, 25, says her husband was killed by infamous killer cop Ahmed Rashid, who was accompanied by a fellow cop known as Mkisii. In statements backed by MSJ, Wambui said her husband Christopher Maina, 27, was with his friends at an abandoned National Youth Service project. They were erecting pillars for a structure and water tank used by Pirates youth group. “They ordered him to come down and put on his vest. They walked him a few metres away at Wanjas (open space), then opened fire as he pleaded for his life. His friends tried to beg the two officers to save him but to no avail,” Wambui said, adding that they made several follow-ups on the case at IPOA's town office until they gave up. “He left me pregnant and despite constant follow-up, the killer cops kept threatening us, warning us that 'risasi sio ya ng’ombe lakini ni ya wale wanajifanya wajuaji wa sheria kama nyinyi (bullets are not meant for cows but for fellows like you who pretend to know the law),” she said amid sobs, adding that they chose to give up the chase after IPOA officers started dodging them. She feared they would never get justice because they are ghetto residents. “Those elites assume our living is an unnecessary bother to their existence, so we deserve death. This explains the reluctance by official government agencies to even visit the crime scenes or reprimand well known killer cops,” Wambui said. Kawangware resident Mary Mbone said his son Milton Abika, 21, and a friend were killed by Kabete police in June last year at a carwash. “We reported the case to all relevant authorities. Buried our son. Since then, we have been repeatedly tossed around. As a family, we remain with bitter memories as we search for answers on why he was killed and why the authorities keep recoiling in silence instead of helping us find closure,” she said. We also spoke to over 15 families that have fallen victim to police killings or enforced disappearances who didn’t want to go on record for fear of reprisal. They are from Baba Ndogo, Dandora, Huruma, Kayole, Kibera, Korogocho and Mukuru slums. CASE PILE-UP Their individual voices of anger and frustrations are echoed by some of the grassroot organisations that work in informal settlements. At Mathare Social Justice Centre, field coordinator Kennedy Chindi combs through old files that seem to be a constant point of reference. He shows us files of 50 cases that they compiled through first-hand victims, families and witness accounts and forwarded to IPOA for further investigation and action.

The case of Nura Boru, killed in 2015 in Kimaiko, has resulted in an inquest, whereas that of Martin Koome, killed in 2013 by Ruaraka OCS, is in court. “IPOA seems uninterested to even just follow up. MSJ is the first point of reference community members troop to for solace after numerous unsuccessful trips to IPOA. It’s unfortunate we are unable to give progress reports on the cases because IPOA has remained unresponsive,” he said. “This reluctance from IPOA has inculcated a culture of silence in the community, with witnesses of these killings no longer willing to come out, because those who have previously come out some have been threatened, disappeared and others killed by same untouchable police officers.” Unlike in some cases where witnesses shy to come forward for Christopher Maina, who was killed at the abandoned NYS field, colleagues who witnessed the killing vowed to come out and speak. Unfortunately, JJ said, it cost them their lives, too. “Joseph Kariuki, commonly known as Johnte, and his friend Lucas, who opted to stand out against the injustices, recorded witness statements of the killings of Maina, but this year in January, they were killed by some Rashid at Mlango Kubwa. Jonde’s body had six bullets,” he said. MSJ has also lodged complaints of cases of witness tampering and elimination, faulting the commission and the witness protection agency for failing to protect witnesses. But IPOA has its proponents. Peter Kiama, the executive director of Independent Medico-Legal Unit, says the pioneer team did well by building an institution and giving it identity. From 2013-17, IMLU has conducted post-mortems and carried out investigation on 764 cases of extrajudicial killings, which they have referred to IPOA. Kiama also praised IPOA for setting performance targets and professionally investigating, prosecuting and securing convictions in Kwekwe Mwandaza cases in Kwale, where a police inspector and a constable were jailed for seven years, and the Katito case, where the officer was jailed for 15 years. “But I believe that their feedback mechanism to intermediaries who refer cases to them could be improved. Currently once a civil society or other third party refers a case, including providing critical evidence and contact with the victims and witnesses, the case is treated as confidential, meaning the intermediary can no longer give updates to the victim who first reported to them. While I respect the need for confidentiality, I believe the intermediaries could be given briefings on the progress of the cases,” he said. “They definitely should have put more effort in prosecuting those who contravened the statutory obligation to promptly report all cases where police had used violence or lethal force. This has meant that police have continued with business as usual, with many cases unreported to IPOA.” To end the pervasive police violence and impunity, Kiama called on Interior CS Matiang’i to draw a red line for police where the law has been violated. Secondly, to make police accountable, he said, the CS and the ministry should give maximum support to IPOA in the first instance and Internal Affairs Unit on the other, providing the IAU with an independent, separate budget from the IG’s office budgets and appointment of the officers to IAU on permanent terms. Thirdly, he said, the CS must ensure there is no lacuna during the transition by initiating the process of appointment of new board members before the pioneer board leaves office, he said. ‘DYSFUNCTIONAL SYSTEM’ Irungu Houghton, director of Amnesty International Kenya, said having less than five convictions out of over 9,000 cases is a source of alarm and points to a dysfunctional system. Last year, AI Kenya documented 252 cases of police executions and 216 cases in 2016. “For us who work in the area of human rights protection and safety, we are worried that we can’t produce many convictions, despite thousands of complaints. The recent conviction of Titus Musila is an example of a system working but in many other cases it hasn’t worked,” he said. “But we have to recognise that law enforcement and human rights protection is an ecosystem. It doesn’t help to apportion blame at one entity at the expense of the others.” Irungu said IPOA's internal problems and quality of investigation are to blame for unsuccessful prosecution of cases, apportioning the bulk of the blame on police failure to cooperate. “Officers’ notorious laxity to attend courts or provide evidence primarily explains the poor record of human rights investigations, affecting conclusion of cases,” he said, adding that they have been reluctant to give duty rosters, ballistic records, weapons registers to IPOA and IAU, compromising prosecution of cases. Irungu said many commissioners will not look back at their tenure with pride. “There were high expectations when they were appointed that lack of police accountability would be dealt with. Sadly what we have seen is stalled reforms, whose consequences have seen increased police impunity and dented police credibility. I think many commissioners will leave feeling disappointed they never reversed that culture, which could have generated a more accountable, effective and responsive policing service,” he said. ‘LACKED COURAGE’ A source familiar with IPOA’s theoretical and technical operations said the commission failed to meet expectations largely because it lacked the courage to confront its tasks. “At times they cherry-picked cases and the individuals they recommended for prosecution,” the source said, explaining that they chose to follow up on less intricate cases with “low risks”. They also failed to work well with corresponding organisations like IAU, ODPP and scene of crime officers, who would have helped them mount water-tight investigations to sustain a prosecution. “They chased away many partners in what they said was protecting their own independence. They have had zero connection and engagement with the communities, too,” the source said, adding that they should have gone to the public not tell the public to come to them, because the victims in police abuse cases are usually poor people who cannot even afford transport to their Upper Hill office. “We shouldn’t just be having occasional celebrations on one or two cases. We should be celebrating many times of successful convictions,” the source said. Other than prosecuting cases of police killings and rights abuses, the source called on the authority to also hold accountable officers who fail to carry out their duties effectively. Hussein Khalid, executive director of Mombasa-based Haki Africa, said they have presented over 81 cases to IPOA since its formation. The cases are related to extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearance and police excesses in counter-terrorism operations at the Coast region. Most of the cases remain unresolved, and Haki Africa has never received any feedback on them. “However, there are some cases where they have investigated and even sent officers to us. In our opinion, the cases presented are overwhelming, whereas IPOA lack the capacity to deal with them,” he said. “For obvious reasons, their capacity has deliberately been minimised so that they don't effectively do their work. Impunity remains to be a big problem in Kenya and this is primarily because IPOA has not been capacitated to do their work.” However, Interior PS Karanja Kibicho said the outgoing team has done well, denying accusations that the ministry has been at the centre of frustrating their work and shielding errant officers. “They do their work, which is holding us accountable on behalf of citizens. This at times may bring conflicts, but we always abide by their recommendations and we are in good working relationship,” Kibicho said. He said the unease that has existed in the past will be ironed out in a forum that brings together members of the civil society, Interior ministry, police and IPOA, which is a culmination of the National Policing Conference held on April 17 last year. "We are creating avenues so as we can talk together as opposed to talking at each other. We are also strengthening and giving independence to IAU, which will not only promote police accountability but also enable greater cooperation with IPOA,” he said. IPOA chairman Macharia Njeru was unavailable for comment, despite acknowledging receipt of emailed inquiries and assurances he would grant us an interview.
