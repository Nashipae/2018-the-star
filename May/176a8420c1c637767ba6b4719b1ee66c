Coast leaders will not allow themselves to be wooed, exploited and deserted by those seeking top offices, Kaloleni MP Paul Katana has said. Katana on Monday said the region is tired of being in the opposition. "We won’t accept any leader who comes for our support, only to desert us later. We’ll not be used as a ladder,” he said at Kaloleni Social Hall. Although he did not mention any leader, the ODM MP in January led Kilifi lawmakers in protesting against their exclusion from leadership positions in Parliament. Katana has expressed reservations about President Kenyatta’s handshake with Raila Odinga, saying it was meaningless if it would not bring justice to those killed in last year’s poll chaos. "If this doesn’t happen, I will not support it,” he said in March. Katana said leaders were consulting and would give directions on their 2022 game plan.
