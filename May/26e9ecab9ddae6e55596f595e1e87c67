Madaraka Express launched in June last year has made more than Sh1 billion in passenger sales, Kenya Railways managing director Atanas Maina said yesterday. He said the train service which marks its first anniversary today, has within the period ferried 1.3 million passengers. In an interview with the Star, the MD said the overall seat occupancy stands at 96.7 per cent since the train started operations. The train has shortened the travel time to Mombasa which used to take about 15 hours on the old train to four-and-a-half hours. Road travel to Mombasa by bus takes an average of eight hours. ECONOMIC SURVEY “We had challenges in ticketing, access roads, restaurants at the terminal where some people wanted the terminal to be near towns. We also had challenges to do with vandalism,” Maina said. He said several people have so far been arrested and prosecuted, a move that has made vandalism cases drop drastically. “We have also ensured that the challenges to do with ticketing are resolved. We now have 60 percent of tickets being transacted on line,” he said. Maina said plans to introduce a commuter rail service in Nairobi are on course which will be followed by similar services in Mombasa One. Transport CS James Macharia said the inter-county train has revolutionised the way passengers travel after waiting for over 100 years. “It has spurred developments in various counties, a move that has seen things change dramatically. We have seen a lot of development,”Macharia said. Macharia said 25,000 containers have been moved by cargo train in five months. He said the cargo movement is ahead of its target and has so far moved 20,000 for imported goods and 2,500 for exports. TRAFFIC Economic Survey 2018 indicates passenger journeys increased by 10.8 per cent from 2,793,000 in 2016 to 3,096,000 in 2017. Earnings from passenger traffic increased more than five times from Sh134 million in 2016 to Sh700 million in 2017, the economic survey says. The overall increase in passenger journeys and revenue from passenger service is mainly due to the standard gauge railway passenger service that started in the second half of 2017. The number of passengers handled by the SGR was 689,205 while revenue earned from the SGR passenger service stood at Sh590.2 million at the end of 2017. Click here for the latest political news
