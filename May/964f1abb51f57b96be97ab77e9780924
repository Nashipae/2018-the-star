Polls agency chairman Wafula Chebukati and two commissioners yesterday told a Parliamentary committee they will not resign. Speaking when he appeared before the National Assembly’s Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, Chebukati said those calling for his resignation should focus on how to transform the IEBC. He was with commissioners Abdi Guliye and Boya Molu at Parliament Buildings. “We will not resign because some people have resigned. We came to the commission as individuals,” the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chairman said. “The conversation has to be bigger than the replacement of a chairman, commissioners or even the secretariat. The conversation should centre on objective transformation.” Read:I will not resign, Chebukati says after three quit The committee was chaired by Kandara MP Alice Wahome. The chairman said, “The commission has dedicated men and women. We call for the committee’s support in accountability and other reforms. With the support of the August Houses and the Kenyan people, the mission to transform management of elections in Kenya is attainable”. Buret MP Japheth Mutai asked if the three commissioners will leave office if they are offered a sendoff package for the balance of their terms. They refused to comment. Last month, Consolata Nkatha (vice chairperson), commissioner Paul Kurgat and Margaret Mwachanya resigned. They cited Chebukati’s poor leadership. Since then, there has been mounting pressure, including from National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale, for the remaining commissioners to quit.
