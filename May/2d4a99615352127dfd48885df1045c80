A police officer who had been suspended over terror-related charges committed suicide on Saturday in his house in Shauri Moyo. The body of constable Waiss Abdulaziz Mohammed was found dangling on the frame of a door at his bedroom. He was alone at the time of the incident. Prior to his suspension, MohammedÂ was attached to the National Disaster Management Unit. He was arraigned on July 3, 2017, after posting that he would commit a suicide attack on his Facebook wall. His wife Agnes Muthoni Wanjiku told the court that the husband needed psychiatric help and not incarceration. Wanjiku claimed her husband had exhibited suicidal tendencies before.
