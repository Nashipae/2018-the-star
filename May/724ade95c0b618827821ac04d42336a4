Kuria East MP Marwa Kitayama has asked for creation of a new county for the community to ensure devolved funds reach their villages. Speaking in Rongo on Saturday, Kitayama said devolved funds for Migori were stuck at the county headquarters. He said a three-man cartel was suffocating development in the county. He did not name the three. “The cartel is so powerful that even executives and chief officers have lost their control of county finances. Kuria people are not comfortable with the graft and would like to have their own county,” Kitayama said. Governor Okoth Obado termed the claims “pure incitement”.
