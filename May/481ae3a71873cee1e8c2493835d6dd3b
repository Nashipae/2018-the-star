Post-graduate students at the Kenyatta National Hospital are demanding Sh360 million pay every year.The 780 students, referred to as registrars, are qualified doctors on study leave. They are pursuing post-graduate specialisation in medicine. Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) secretary general Ouma Oluga said the money will be paid to 400 registrars who are not on a salary.“KNH is now a shell. The hospital is losing Sh800 million every month. We want them to pay registrars Sh360 million a year,” KMPDU said. Read: Registrars withdraw services after doctor lecturers' strike The demand is likely to be rejected by KNH and the Ministry of Health because the registrars only work at KNH as part of their curriculum. Government employed doctors continue drawing their salaries when on study leave. Oluga spoke after the KMPDU officials  met their counterparts from the Universities Academic Staff Union at the University of Nairobi’s College of Health Sciences at KNH. They said the registrars do 70 per cent of surgical work at KNH, and therefore require compensation.“Kidney transplants and other major surgeries at KNH have stopped because they are conducted by post-graduate students,” KMPDU chairman Samuel Oroko said.The students are currently not working because their lecturers are on strike.
