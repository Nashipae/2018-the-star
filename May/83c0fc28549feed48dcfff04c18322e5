A police officer is among suspects held over carjackings, murder and robberies on public service vehicles. The officer, based at the Sagana police station, was arrested on Saturday. He is being held at the Parklands police station. The cop is suspected to be part of a gang that has been hijacking public service vehicles and robbing passengers. He denied the claim in statements recorded at the police station. The arrest came barely a week after a former RECCE unit officer was stabbed to death inside a bus and his pistol stolen. Corporal Martin Korir was based at the Ruaraka police station. Two other officers from the RECCE Company survived the April 28 bus attack. They were travelling home on a NEO Kenya MPYA bus that was heading to Thika. Passengers were robbed of cash and other valuables. The thugs disappeared. The driver and his conductor were arrested and questioned by police. "The officer is linked to the incident and we will be going for his accomplices," a source told the Star yesterday. Last week, three officers were named in a case of robbery with violence in Machakos. The officers were accused of robbing a trader of Sh390,000. Click here for the latest political news
