A rift is emerging among the leadership of the National Youth Council over a petition filed in Parliament to investigate the conduct of Interior PS Karanja Kibicho. While one team is pushing for Kibicho's removal from office, another says it is not part of the petition filed on Thursday. In a four-page petition to the Clerk of the National Assembly and signed by the NYC national chair Edward Githaiga and secretary general Juliana Olayo, the youth said Kibicho is unfit to hold a public office. But on Friday, NYC CEO Raymond Ouma rejected the petition saying that it is not the position of the Council but rather that of "individual masquerading as and purporting to speak on behalf of the National Youth Council".

In the spirit of free speech and right to the personal opinion we advise Edward Githage, NYC delegate from Nairobi county to express his opinion without referencing the NYC as an entity,” Ouma said. He added that the NYC was not part of any political divide and it lobbies for the interest and benefit of youth as mandated by NYC act. The Githaiga and Olago team cited four grounds to push Kibicho out of office among them; serious violation of the Constitution, serious violation of the law, gross misconduct in the performance of functions, and incompetence. "It has been reported in the mainstream media that Kibicho has by act and omission been actively abusing the office of the Principal Secretary in an effort to undermine the work of various leaders, including Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko," the petition reads in part. "PS Kibicho is accused of openly threatening the life of Governor Sonko in a widely circulated clip, which is now on the public domain," the youth said in the petition.
