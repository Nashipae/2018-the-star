Mt Elgon MP Fred Kapondi (pictured) has asked the state to prosecute two suspects arrested over a wave of killings in the area swiftly. Addressing the press on Saturday in his constituency, Kapondi said the two should be prosecuted for families to get justice. “I want them charged in Bungoma so people can attend court sessions,” he said. Timothy Kiptai, alias, Cheparakach and his brother Andrew Ngeiwyo are being detained by DCI officers in Nairobi. Police say they are still investigating and they will take them to court soon. Cheparakach, who previously escaped from a police vehicle while being taken to the Kimilili law courts, was arrested by Flying Squad officers in Eldoret a week ago. His younger brother Ngeiywo surrendered at Kericho police station a few days later. Police had placed a Sh1 million bounty on their heads. At least 30 people were in Mt Elgon before the suspects were arrested. Residents fled to the neighbouring Uganda. Others sought refuge in Chwele, Kimilili, Kamukuywa and Sirisia towns.
