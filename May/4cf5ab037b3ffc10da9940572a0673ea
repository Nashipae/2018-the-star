A clan in Kerio Valley has opposed the resettlement of 1,300 families to pave way for fluorspar mining. Elders from Kapterik clan in Elgeyo Marakwet county, led by Samuel Seii, said their culture prohibits the sale of ancestral land. At least 4,000 landowners are set to be compensated to surrender their land as the state plans to revive fluorspar mining. Kenya Fluorspar Company ceased fluorite mining in the area after 49 years, citing declining demand for the mineral in key markets in Asia and Europe.
