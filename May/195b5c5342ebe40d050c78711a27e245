Former government pathologist Moses Njue was charged on Tuesday with stealing a heart. The charge sheet states that Njue committed the offence at Lee Funeral Home in Nairobi on June 25, 2015 while performing a postmortem on the body of Timothy Mwandi. The ex-pathologist faced a second count of destroying evidence - he is accused of damaging the heart, knowing it might be required as evidence.  The court heard that Njue committed this crime between June 25 and September 21 that year. The third count concerned the illegal removal of the heart from Mwandi's body. The former pathologist was charged alongside his assistant pathologist Lemuel Anasha who was not in court. Summons were issued for Anasha to appear in court for plea-taking. This was after prosecutor Catherine Mwaniki noted the accused were father and son. Njue denied the charges before Nairobi Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi. He had asked the court to defer the plea-taking, his lawyers saying the charges were related to a case that the deceased's family filed at the High Court. The magistrate granted the accused Sh1 million bond or Sh300,000 cash bail and set a hearing for July 3. Andayi warned Njue against interfering with witnesses. Click here for the latest political news
