Road running specialist, Vedick Cheruiyot, cruised to victory in the men’s 10,000m final, nailing a slow time of 30:18.8 seconds. Kipsang Temoi returned 30:20.5 for second place ahead of joint-third place finishers Mike Boit (30:43.5) and Edmond Kipngetich (30:43.5). A former winner in this meeting, Stephen Arita of Kenya Defence Forces placed fifth in a time of 30:48.7. Kericho-based Josephine Chelangat was a surprise winner in the women’s 1,500m race as she edged pre-race favourite and 2017 Iten cross country champion Gloria Kite. Chelangat delivered the goods in 4:16.1 to beat Kite in a photo-finish after stopping the clock in 4:16.6. Rookie Qualine Kiprop timed 4:22.8 for third place followed by Loise Chemining (4:23.8) and Naomi Chepkemoi (4:26.9). The 2008 world junior 5000m bronze medallist, Nelly Chebet dominated her specialty to win in 16:30.0, relegating Nyahahuru’s Cynthia Njeri to second in 16:31.0 while Beatrice Begi (16:34.2) completed the podium places in 16:34.2. Lorna Nyagochwa was fourth in 16:35.9 while Mercy Njoroge was fifth after timing 16:39.4. KDF hurdler Willy Mbevi won the men’s 400m hurdles race in 52.5 ahead of Kenya Prisons’ Erick Kiptoo (53.3), Stephen Rotich (53.5) and Aron Ruto (54.8). His compatriot, Jane Chege romped to victory in the women’s edition of the event after timing 62.9. Gladys Ngure was second in 65.3 ahead of Emily Gesare who timed 65.7. Winnie Boinet and Betty Chelangat were fourth and fifth in respective times of 65:9 and 68.1. The meet concludes today with the rest of the track and field finals lined up as the organisers hope for better conditions as opposed to yesterday’s muddy affair. Participants are also keen to gauge themselves ahead of the national championships/trials for the 21st African Senior Athletics Championships. Meanwhile, the national championships have been brought forward from July 5-7 to June 21- 23 as the national governing body seek to accommodate runners who wish to compete at the Zurich Diamond League on July 5.
