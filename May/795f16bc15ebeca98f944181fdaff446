Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has shifted cabinet meetings to his home Machakos county for fear of his life ( see Page 2). Last week government reduced his detail of police bodyguards from 26 to 5. Sonko did not need that many guards to protect him. A large retinue of guards was much more a display of status that would publicly demonstrate how powerful he was. He has retreated to Machakos in a huff. 'If I can't have my bodyguards, I won't stay in Nairobi.' Nairobi county executives and officers now have to travel to Machakos for meetings. This is childish. He was elected to run the most important county in Kenya. He cannot run away when the going gets tough ( if it indeed is tough). Sonko is widely believed to have presidential ambitions. What would he do if Kenya went to war? Would he run away to the safety of a neighbouring country? Sonko should return to Nairobi and get back to the important business of running Kenya's capital city. Quote of the day: "Sometimes, if you wear suits for too long, it changes your ideology."
