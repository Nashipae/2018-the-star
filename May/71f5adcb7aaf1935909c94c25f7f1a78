Nominated MP Geoffrey Osotsi has lost his bid to stop the appointment of Barrack Muluka as the ANC secretary general. This is after the High Court extended orders suspending the Political Parties Tribunal’s decision that nullified the appointment of Muluka. Justice Cecilia Githua said she had granted stay orders pending hearing and determination of the appeal. “I’m persuaded that tilt of scales of justice lies more in granting the orders sought to ensure stability in the functions of the party,” she said. The court further allowed the application by Muluka and party leader Musalia Mudavadi that challenged the tribunal decision. She directed the matter to be mentioned on June 16 for further direction.

Through lawyer Dan Ameyo, Musalia argued PPDT lacked jurisdiction in hearing the case. “PPDT had no jurisdiction to handle the matter because it relied on its own jurisprudence and under statutory, the procedure should be strictly followed,” Ameyo said. Ameyo dismissed claims in the judgement of PPDT that Osotsi was coerced into resigning. He said the only evidence was that he was stressed and it was insufficient to nullify Muluka as the SG. “If it’s true that Osotsi was coerced, what step did he take as there was no complaint,” he said.
