Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi was yesterday heckled and shouted down by angry maize farmers during a meeting in Eldoret. The farmers blamed the MP for failing to advocate for their payment which has delayed for months. Sudi was booed when he rose to address the fully packed Teachers Advisory Center where maize farmers had gathered. Farmers accused Sudi of opposing lawmakers who were fighting for the release of their cash. Farmers are owed Sh2.6 billion for maize delivered to the National Cereals and Produce Board. Sudi’s pleas for patience with the government fell on deaf ears as the farmers demanded that he cut down his speech. Sudi said the hecklers were sponsored to malign him. "You should know that the same government you are talking ill about is the one that will pay you," an angry Sudi said. The meeting was attended by Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, Senator Margaret Kamar, MPs Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills) Silas Tiren (Moiben), Caleb Kositany (Soy), William Chepkut (Ainabkoi) and Vincent Tuwei (Mosop). "It is sad that MPs have decided to remain silent on the plight of farmers who have not been paid for months," said Kenya Federation of Farmers chairman Musa Barno.
