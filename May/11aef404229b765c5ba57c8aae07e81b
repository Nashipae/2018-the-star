MPs from Migori have pledged to support a constitutional referendum, despite President Uhuru Kenyatta’s decision to distance himself from any law change. “The amendments are necessary because even the Kuria community needs its own county. We’ll continue talking with other Kenyans as we realise the Big Four agenda,” MP Marwa Kitayama (Kuria East) said. He was speaking on Saturday at Misadhi SDA Church in Rongo. He was with MPs Paul Abuor (Rongo), Mark Nyamita (Uriri), Tom Odege (Nyatike) and Woman Representative Pamela Odhiambo. They said a referendum would not detract from Uhuru’s Big Four.  MISQUOTED On Friday Uhuru said he was focusing on the Big Four and had “no time to go round the country campaigning for a referendum”. The President said a referendum will not solve Kenyans’ problems. But the lawmakers, four from ODM and one from Jubilee, said Uhuru was misquoted. “What we understood from the President’s statement is the need to concentrate on the Big Four agenda. When time for politics and referenum come, we will support it [referendum],” Kitayama said. Kitayama, who was elected on a Jubilee Party ticket, said the Kuria community will join other minority tribes, like Tiaty and Teso, to back constitutional amendments. “The media misquoted Uhuru because I’m sure he knows a referendum will happen,” Nyamita said. Abuor, Odhiambo and Odege said the referendum was not about individual interests but for the benefit of all Kenyans. “A referendum is a demand coming from the people. It is clear that Kenyans want some changes. It doesn’t matter what other people are saying,” Abuor said. Many of those pushing for a referendum want a parliamentary system of government with an expanded Executive.
