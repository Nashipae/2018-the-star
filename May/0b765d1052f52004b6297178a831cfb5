The Garissa government has threatened to sue power generating company KenGen for compensation for property ruined by dam spills. Governor Ali Korane yesterday said families in Garissa town have been displaced after Kindaruma Dam spilled over following heavy rains. “This is not public relations. We have a watertight case against the company. We have concrete evidence,” he said. Korane said the county’s lawyers will call agriculture and environmental experts to the stand to explain the extent of the damage. The governor said they are collecting evidence and he is optimistic residents will be compensated. “This time round there is no escape for KenGen. It must be held accountable for the losses people have incurred,” Korane said. Housing crisis The governor spoke after flagging off a consignment of food and learning materials to early childhood development centres. He later received non-food items from the UNHCR in Garissa. Korane said as much as the company is doing a commendable job, it should be mindful of residents’ welfare. The Kenya Red Cross Society said at least 15,000 people have been displaced by floods in the past week. Hundreds of families spent the night in the cold last week after Tana River burst its banks. The most affected areas were Windsor and Bula Sheikh in Garissa town, and Bakuyu, Ziwani and Mororo in Tana River county. Many residents were forced to leave their homes and farms were submerged. This was a blow to farmers who were preparing to harvest their crops. Most families are trying to salvage their belongings. Residents fear an outbreak of waterborne diseases and the threat of being attacked by crocodiles and snakes. The flooding has led to a housing crisis.
