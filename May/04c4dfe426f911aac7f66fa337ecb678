The National Youth Council wants withdrawal of petition filed in Parliament by a section of its members to investigate the conduct of Interior PS Karanja Kibicho. Chief executive officer Raymond Ochieng said they have written to Youth CS Margaret Kobia to withdraw the petition on its behalf. “NYC is a creation of Parliament, so it is part of the government. What our colleagues did was not right, because what is coming out is that there is an inter-ministerial war,” he said. Last Thursday, a council faction led by Edward Githaiga, who said he was the group’s national chairman, petitioned Parliament to investigate the conduct of the PS. They said the aim was his removal from office. Githaiga faulted Kibicho over claims he was frustrating Governor Mike Sonko and his administration. “It has been reported in the mainstream media that Kibicho has by act and omission been actively abusing the office of the Principal Secretary in an effort to undermine the work of various leaders, including Sonko,” the petition reads. But Ochieng said Githaiga is a youth delegate in Nairobi and has no power to speak on behalf of NYC. “Supporting Sonko means having a political stand. But as the council, we have members from across the country and political divide,” he said. Ochieng said the NYC is not part of any political grouping and it lobbies for the interests and benefit of the youth as mandated by the NYC Act 2009.
