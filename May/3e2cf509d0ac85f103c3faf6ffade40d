Innovators from Embu have accused the government of neglecting local ideas. They said they have developed new innovations, including solutions to the armyworm menace. Speaking during a forum at the Embu University on Thursday, the innovators said they government had overlooked their ideas. "We have even come up with great innovations that can solve the armyworm invasion, but the state prefers spending millions on importing weak pesticides," a contributor said. The forum was organised by the university in conjunction with US-based International Development Innovation Network. The experts said residents have often appreciated their innovations. They want both the county and the national governments to support their work for large scale production. Other innovations include effective ways of waste management, better housing methods, improved farming techniques among others. "We also want protection against exploiters who steal our ideas," they said. The university promised to work with the innovators to boost research. Head of the university's psychology department Milka Nyaga said the five-day forum brought together 16 innovators from the county. Nyaga said the university was planning to establish an innovation centre. Embu director of tourism Virginia Ngugi said the county had not neglected its innovators. "We have been organising exhibitions to promote their work," Ngugi said. The county has previously sponsored innovators to exhibitions in Uganda and Tanzania She said the county was ready to help innovators open factories for mass production of their products. She said the County government will continue assisting the innovators in marketing their goods by where possible opening factories for mass production of the beneficial products. Ngugi said the county government has in the past sponsored innovators for such forums in Uganda and Tanzania where they greatly benefitted.
