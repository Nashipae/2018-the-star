A voter has sued Nairobi governor Mike Sonko for nominating Lawyer Miguna Miguna as his deputy. In an application filed under a certificate of urgency, John Waigi Migwi claims that Sonko has sent the name of Miguna for vetting when he doesn't qualify to be the deputy governor. "The nominee does not meet the relevant qualifications for vetting and approval to fill the vacancy in the office of deputy governor as he, not a Kenyan citizen nor a member of Jubilee party on which Sonko was elected," Migwi says.

Sonko’s surprise nomination of the NASA activist as his deputy has exposed the vicious battle over 2022 succession in the Jubilee Party. His unexpected choice of Miguna, a man twice deported by his bosses, was the clearest indication of the bitter split in President Kenyatta’s party. Sonko reportedly made the cheeky nomination without consulting the party’s top leadership to rebuff his detractors. It was also a show of contempt for those who had suggested a deputy that he has rejected.
