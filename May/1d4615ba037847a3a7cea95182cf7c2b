Akothee has no chills. The Sweet Love singer has savagely responded to a fan during a Q&A question session with her followers. The fan asked her, "How do you get these rich men you have?" Akothee responded, "Just the same way you meet the poor ones. There is no formula." The singer said no woman owes any man a flat tummy and they should embrace their bodies. "You don't owe any man an explanation as to how you look! I never heard ostrich complaining to God as to why she can't fly yet she is in the bird category. She is a bird, period. You are a woman and you know all women have what it takes to be a woman, you have something men die for and get weak as soon as they think about it."
