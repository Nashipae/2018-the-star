Accordingly we support free medical camps in different places each month to help needy people,” said Simpson Osiemo, the Head of Marketing of Menengai Oil Refineries said. Patients with serious medical conditions were referred for further treatment at hospitals. “Holding medical care camps regularly in regions where there is limited healthcare has saved a number of lives. Frequent health follow ups are carried out for expectant mothers and patients who require further treatment,” he said. He added that counselling sessions on health and hygiene awareness were among the highlights of the camp as there are many cases of acute diarrhoea due to the poor sanitation. “Before the end of the medical camp participants received gifts of soap and cooking oil manufactured by Menengai Oil Refineries”,said Osiemo. Menengai Oil Refineries is one of the leading manufacturers of quality home products in East Africa. “The organisation started in 1988 from humble beginnings in the upholstery business before venturing into soap making in 1990 and later into the manufacture of edible cooking oil and fats,” said Osiemo. The company has since diversified into other home products including detergents, baking powder, dishwashing liquid, sponges, scouring pads, stainless steel scourers, scouring powder and milking jelly.
