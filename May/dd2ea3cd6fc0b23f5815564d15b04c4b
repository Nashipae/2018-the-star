Kenyans have been urged to attend in large numbers this year’s Madaraka Day celebrations at the Kinoru Stadium in Meru. Interior PS Karanja Kibicho on Saturday said all Kenyans are welcome to the ceremony to be led by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Kibicho spoke when he visited the stadium. Preparations are in top gear for the celebrations. “The county commissioner’s residence will act as the State House for that day. It is ready to host all guests for the state lunch,” Kibicho said.
