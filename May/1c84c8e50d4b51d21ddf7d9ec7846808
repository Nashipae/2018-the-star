Politicians in Nyanza should stop early campaigns for 2022 and give room to development, ODM director of elections Junet Mohamed has said. The majority of residents suffered during the 2017 electioneering period because of violence, he said at Koduogo Catholic Church on Sunday. Junet told leaders in Migori, Homa Bay, Kisumu and Siaya counties to deliver on their promises instead of focusing on future elections. “It’s barely eight months since the last poll. But I see 2022 politics is taking centre-stage as if another election is taking place tomorrow. Early campaigns would derail the region’s development,” he said.
