Lecturers have maintained that they will continue with their strike despite universities recalling students to resume their classes today. In a statement on Monday, the Universities Staff Academic Union asked its members to stay away as the boycott entered the 67th day. This is despite a meeting called by the Education ministry and the university councils (IPUCCF) in an attempt to reach a settlement with the dons. "All our members should intensify the strike to strengthen our bargaining position," Secretary General Constantine Wasonga said. "Please ignore all entreaties, propaganda or fake news from management." The lecturers said they are waiting for the lapse of the 60-day deadline issued by the courts for the matter to be resolved to chart the next course of action. "Let's do the 10-day count down. On Day 0, either the CBA will be
concluded, or we shall reload, relaunch and escalate the strike to
levels not yet seen before." The lecturers have been on strike three times over the 2017-2021 Comprehensive Bargaining Agreement, a situation which has disrupted learning in public universities.

This strike is also about quality education and a better future for the students," Wasonga said. He asked parents to keep their sons and daughters at home. "As there is no learning taking place in the universities, let parents protect their children from the bad schemes of a minority," he said. Uasu said they have respected court orders regarding the strike further accusing IPUCCF of being non-compliant.
