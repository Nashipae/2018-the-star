Only two vehicles per Sacco will be allowed into the CBD from today. This is in the latest move by the Nairobi county to decongest the city and also end the perennial traffic snarl-up. "The directive has already started and we are working to ensure there is sustainable implementation,' City Hall director of operations Peter Mbaya has said. Mbaya said they will be sensitizing the operators over the weekend but start a major crackdown on Monday. “We are now implementing the two vehicles per Sacco rule but since it takes effect today, we are not making any arrests. From Monday those who defy will be arrested,” Mbaya said. He added that the matatu saccos will look for their own holding spaces as the county provision is to provide picking and dropping spots.

A spot check by the Star on Saturday revealed that passengers were being dropped in various holding points with the Kenya Bus service dropping passengers at the Bus Station. “Actually its true we are not being dropped in commercial like before but at the Bus Station,” a passenger said. On April 25th, City Hall demolished all illegal structures in various bus termini to pave way for the ban of the matatus in the CBD.
