One of North Korea's most senior officials is travelling to New York, as preparations for a planned summit gather pace. Former intelligence chief Gen Kim Yong-chol is the most senior North Korean official to visit the US since 2000. US President Donald Trump confirmed the news on Tuesday, saying he had put "a great team together" for the talks. The proposed meeting with Kim Jong-un was thrown into doubt after Trump announced he was pulling out last week. But both sides have been working to get the summit - scheduled for 12 June in Singapore - back on track. It would be the first time a North Korean leader has met a sitting US president. The introduction of Gen Kim to negotiations is significant, as it underlines North Korea's desire to ensure the talks go ahead. A former spy chief, he has been part of recent high-profile diplomatic overtures by the North. South Korean news agency Yonhap had reported earlier on Tuesday that Gen Kim was due to fly to New York on Wednesday, after speaking with Chinese officials in Beijing. Confirming the news, Trump said that meetings were under way about the summit "and more". Gen Kim, 72, is a controversial figure in neighbouring South Korea, and previously served as a negotiator in inter-Korean talks. Click here for the latest political news
