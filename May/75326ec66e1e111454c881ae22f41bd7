Kenya’s most populous primary school faces closure as its toilets (pictured) are on the verge of collapsing following heavy rains. Schools reopened starting Monday this week. Bungoma DEB Primary School head teacher Tobias Khisa yesterday told the Star the institution might be closed if they fail to get immediate help. “We cannot manage a population of 3,429 without toilets. This will be a health hazard,” he said. Khisa said they have requested the government and other agencies to come to their rescue, failing which pupils will be told to go home. He said they urgently require Sh3 million to build new toilets. The school was closed two years ago after toilets collapsed. Kanduyi CDF provided Sh800,000 to rebuild the facilities. Khisa urged the Kenya Red Cross Society to give them a temporary remedy as they seek intervention from the government. According to Education ministry regulations, 25 boys should use one toilet, while 30 girls should use one toilet. Khisa said he has unsuccessfully tried to get assistance from both the Bungoma government and the Kanduyi CDF. County director of communications Timothy Machi yesterday said Governor Wycliffe Wangati was in a meeting to finds ways of using the emergency kitty to help the school. The second most populous school is Bidii Primary School in Nairobi East, with a population of 2,700 pupils. Click here for the latest political news
