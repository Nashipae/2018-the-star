A section of Baringo MCAs have claimed their lives are in danger after police summoned two of their colleagues for inciting bandit attacks. Saimo-Soi MCA Richard Cheserem and Nelson Lotela (Silale) recorded statements at the Kabarnet police station on Thursday. "Our security is under threat. Police officers who are supposed to protect our lives and property are now turning to arrest us," deputy speaker Ameja Zelemoi lamented. The Churo-Amaya MCA recalled similar incident in May last year where his late predecessor Thomas Minito was summoned by police after which his lifeless body found dumped in River Ol Donyo-Sabuk, Machakos county. Majority Leader Lawi Kipchumba (Lembus-Kwen), Kipruto Kimosop (Mochongoi), John Aengwo (Saimo-Kipsaraman) and Silas Tochim (Tenges) backed calls to enhance the legislator's security. The two MCAs were summoned a week after the Star highlighted a story which quoted Lotela accusing the police officers of laxity saying. Baringo North DCI boss Andolo Munga linked the summons to the insecurity menace in the area. "It is just an issue to do with security, nothing else," Munga assured the legislators adding that investigation into the claims of incitement is still ongoing. Even after being summoned, Lotela maintained that the police should arrest and apprehend the bandits other than "take pride in intimidating leaders and harming innocent people". Cheserem, for his part, said there is no clear reason as to why police have failed to act or deal with the criminals whose details were shared with them.
