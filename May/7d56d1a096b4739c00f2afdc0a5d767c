Otile Brown and Vera Sidika are the talk of town. Everyone is fascinated by their whirlwind romance. Otile is spending many nights at Vera's home in Spring Valley, and posting Insta Stories driving Vera's Range Rover. Defending himself, Otile dispelled rumours that he is a kept man. "Vera Sidika is a rich woman. She is probably doing much better (financially) than some politicians. She has her money. I have my money. I am one of the most sought-after artistes in Kenya currently. Despite that, Ms Sidika knows she is getting into a relationship with a hustler. She also hustled hard to be where she is today. So, she knows our relationship won’t be founded on luxury and such-like things," he said, adding that they're not in a rush to get married.
