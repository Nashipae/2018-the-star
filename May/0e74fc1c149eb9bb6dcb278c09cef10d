As they seek to eventually survive another relegation dogfight, Thika United will look back at this gritty 1-0 win against Wazito, as the moment they took initiative over their destiny. Yes, Nicholas Muyoti, the man who ensured they remained among the elite may have been frustrated out of a job but many like Eugene Mukangula continue to show why they have been sorely missed. Heads and shoulders above his peers he masterminded a victory that many will savour. Despite their hardships, the goal five minutes from full time will be savoured for a long time when Thika do hold onto their top flight status and the recourses start flowing in. Like Thika, Tusker are finding a new lease of life under the indefatigable Robert Matano and a win away at the sea level town of Mombasa courtesy of a Brian Osumba double, which downed hosts Bandari shows the Lion is the real deal. AFC Leopardsâ€™ goalless draw against Chemelil shows they will not change their spots soon.
