Lamu Public Service Board has raised concerns about the high number of job applicants to vacancy announcements and advertisements in the region. The PSB chairman Ali Mbwarali said its becoming a very hard to go through thousands of job applications and narrow down to the required number of positions, which is normally in tens. Speaking in his Lamu office on Tuesday, Mbwarali attributed the situation to the lack of industries and other openings that can create opportunities for the youth and other skilled residents. He said every time they advertise for a few vacancies, they receive immense number of applications, some from other counties.
