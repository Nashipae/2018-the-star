The time has come for youthful leaders to take over from the older generation, Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has said. He spoke in Kisii county during a two-day visit to drum up support for his 2022 presidential bid. Mutua visited the county on Thursday and Friday. The governor said he has what it takes to be President and his development record shows it. "I am in this beautiful county today to ask residents to support me in 2022 in ascending to the country’s top seat. The Maendeleo Chap Chap party is ready to take over the top leadership,” Mutua said "We have reached a time when we say bye to elderly leaders and [ask them to] pave the way for the youthful ones.” He said Machakos is ahead because he employed a winning formula that all counties should adopt. Mutua proposed that all accounts and assets of individuals involved in corruption be frozen. He spoke out against mega corruption, saying it has impoverished the country. Last weekend it emerged that around Sh9 billion may have been lost at the National Youth Service. The Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs says only Sh900 million was lost. Mutua was with Governor James Ongwae, Deputy Governor Joash Maangi and speaker David Kombo, among other county leaders. Ongwae said the county has upgraded sports and hospitality facilities in preparation for the sixth Inter-County Sports and Cultural Association event to be hosted by Kisii on August 12 to 18.
