Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa has said truck drivers from the West Kenya Sugar Company have killed 20 people from his constituency in one year. He on Thursday wrote to the firm management asking why it allows “reckless” drivers on the road. Barasa gave the firm 24 hours to respond, lest he leads residents to take an unspecified action. The company responded and invited the MP to the factory last Friday. An official from the firm, who did not want to be named, said they have instructed the drivers to be careful.
