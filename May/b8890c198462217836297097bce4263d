World 1,500m silver medallist champion Timothy Cheruiyot shook off a strong challenge to run away with the mile at the Prefontaine Classic on Saturday. Cheruiyot clocked 3:49.87 to beat Ethiopia’s Samuel Tefera to second place in 3:51.26 while world and Commonwealth games champion Elijah Manangoi settled for third position in 3:52.18. “I like Eugene! Every time I come here, I improve my time,” said a delighted Cheruiyot. “My goal for the season is to run under 3:28 in Monaco.” Norwegian wunderkind Jakob Ingebrigtsen stole the show to finish fourth in World U-18 and European U-20 record of 3:52.28. The previous world U-18 best was held by Kenya’s Isaac Songok at 3:54.56, and early in the race, it looked like Ingebrigtsen may be struggling among the best milers in the world as he ran at the back of the pack. However, the 17-year-old crept through the field on the penultimate lap, charging up the home straight to challenge world champion Elijah Manangoi for third with the Kenyan just about holding him off with 3:52.18. Ingebrigtsen’s mark carved four seconds off his previous best, and the teenager is now looking forward to competing on home soil at the Oslo Diamond League next month. There was a shock result in the men’s 3,000m steeplechase as unheralded Kenyan Benjamin Kigen stunned Olympic and world champion Conseslus Kipruto and Olympic silver medallist Evan Jager of USA. After a slow early pace of 2:43 at 1000m and 5:30 at 2000m, Kipruto appeared in cruise control at the front with the race apparently playing into the hands of the lightning-fast Olympic and world champion. However, as Kipruto began to wind up the pace in the final lap, he had unwanted company in the shape of Kigen, who blasted by him entering the back straight and swiftly opened a gaping advantage. Kipruto simply had no answer, and it was soon clear that he would taste defeat in his specialist event for the first time since 2016, leaving aside his drop-out in Rabat last summer. Kigen was awkward off the last barrier but by then, the damage had been done with the 24-year-old hitting the finish all alone in 8:09.07. Kipruto edged a photo finish with Jager for second, both credited with 8:11.71. World and Commonwealth Games 5000m  champion Helen Obiriplaced  third in the 12-lap race in 14:35.03. Olympic 1500 silver medallist Genezebe Dibaba carried the day by posting 14:26.89 with compatriot Ethiopian Letesenbet Gidey second in 14:30.29. Click here for the latest political news
