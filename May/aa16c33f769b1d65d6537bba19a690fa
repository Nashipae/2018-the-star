Narok Woman Representative Soipan Kudate has declared war on men who impregnate schoolgirls. She said there is an upsurge in school dropouts because of pregnancies. Kudate called for concerted efforts to protect girls so they can finish their education. “About 40 per cent of our girls in Narok drop out of school each year due to early pregnancies and marriages. We should be ashamed. I will not tire from fighting for the girlchild even if it costs me my seat,” she said in Narok town. Kudate issued Sh1.3 million bursary cheques to 33 students. The cash was from the National Government Affirmative Action Fund. She wants parents, teachers, the children’s office, chiefs, security officers and the Education ministry to work together to ensure culprits are punished. “We need to retain girls in schools. We have had many girls drop out at primary school level due to early pregnancies,” Kudate said. “These social vices hurt girls’ schooling and limit their capacity to reach their potential.” Click here for the latest political news
