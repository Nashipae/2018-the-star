Public Service, Youth and Gender CS Margaret Kobia and her predecessor and Health CS Sicily Kariuki have been summoned by the National Assembly Public Accounts Committee on Friday. The committee chaired by Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi yesterday also summoned Richard Ndubai and Lillian Omollo. The two last week resigned as National Youth Service director general and Public Service PS respectively. The committee dismissed a letter from the department of Public Service and Youth seeking postponement of the probe into Sh9 billion loss at the NYS.

The letter is contemptuous and amounts to belittling the work of the committee,” Wandayi said. Planning PS Julius Muia appeared before the committee. He asked for more time to shed light on queries raised by Auditor General Edward Ouko in 2014-15 amd 2015-16. But Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro said the committee would zero in on all individuals linked to the scam. “They have nowhere to hide. Even if they run away from this committee or any other, they cannot run away from the youths of this country,” Nyoro said.
