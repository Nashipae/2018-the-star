Narok has the country’s highest rate of children with intestinal worms — 43 per cent, a survey by the Health and Education ministries has indicated. The National School-based Deworming Programme survey shows 580,849 schoolchildren were dewormed between 2012-17 in Narok. Vihiga comes second with 32.8 per cent of children with worms, followed by Kisii at 23.7 per cent. The results show Coast counties performed well owing to sanitation. Taita Taveta’s prevalence rate was below one per cent, followed by Mombasa at 1.5 per cent. Migori had a prevalence of 2.2 per cent. Nairobi, which was not in the deworming programme, now shows an alarming manifestation of worms. The rate was not immediately known. In 2012 Nairobi had been considered worm-free but compelling evidence from Kemri and CDC shows cases of worms are increasing, particularly in Kibera slum. Speaking while releasing the deworming results on Tuesday, Kemri’s Dr Charles Mwandawiro said plans are underway to break transmission in Nairobi after mapping by the World Health Organization. He said intestinal parasites indicates lack of proper sanitation, inadequate housing, unclean water and open defaecation. Mwandawiro urged communities to eliminate open defaecation and educate others on preventing worms. The deworming programme was piloted in 2009, when 3.6 million children were treated in schools across areas endemic for parasitic worms. Dr Osman Warfa, head of Neonatal Child and Adolescent Health Unit, said teachers administer the drugs to schoolchildren. In 2017, he said, the programme treated more than 5.9 million children in more than 16,000 schools across 27 counties. The children aged two to 14 years were treated for two types of parasitic worm infections — soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomiasis. The two are among the world’s 10 most neglected tropical diseases. Click here for the latest political news
