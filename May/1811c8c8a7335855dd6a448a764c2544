Governor Mike Sonko has reiterated that he will not succumb to pressure to change his decision on picking controversial lawyer Miguna Miguna as his deputy. Sonko said he has played his role and it is now up to the county assembly to either approve or reject the nominee. "I have chosen Miguna as my deputy and it is the assembly which will decide," said Sonko at A.I.P.C.A church service on Sunday. Sonko's surprise choice of Miguna two weeks ago elicited reactions from different quarters with some of the Jubilee party members calling for his impeachment. The governor's choice was rejected by the city senator Johnson Sakaja, JP vice chairman David Murathe and MCAs. But while the ward representatives have opposed Miguna as Sonko's deputy, they have maintained that they will not impeach him. We will never ever impeach Sonko, take it to the bank. Cartels have no role in Sonkoâ€™s leadership," majority leader Abdi Guyo said. Guyo appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene and have the governor's body guards, who were two weeks ago scaled down to five from 26, restored. "Let the Governor be respected and given enough security. President Uhuru should move in and ensure that this issue is solved," he said. Sonko maintained that he focused on delivering services to Nairobians, adding his vision and plans will not be derailed by cartels fighting him. "I will not give room to those who want to derail my vision. My focus is service delivery to the Nairobians," said Sonko. The Governor was accompanied by more than 100 MCAs.
