Operations at the port of Mombasa have resumed and evacuation of cargo is moving on smoothly contrary to reports that there is a crisis. KPA management on Tuesday said the congestion witnessed on Monday had been caused by KRA Manifest Management System that failed over the weekend. It was however rectified on Monday. "We are not experiencing any congestion at the port. We are very fluid as cargo is moving out smoothly," KPA head of corporate affairs Bernard Osero said. The Authority also dismissed reports of inefficiency and graft as attributed to congestion.

Osero said five Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) trains, carrying over 500 containers from Mombasa to Nairobi were also operational. "Cargo evacuation by SGR train is moving on well. We have five trains daily," he said. Hundreds of other containers are also being taken to local Container Freight Stations (CFSs). On Monday, KPA management directed that all unnominated cargo be taken to local CFSs. KPA General Manager in charge of Operations Captain William Ruto said the list of containers nominated to various CFSs will be posted on KPA official website for importers to know where each container has been nominated to.
