Embattled former Transport Cabinet Secretary Michael Kamau wants five state officers jailed for unlawfully searching his home.They are from the DPP, Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, Attorney General’s office, National Police Service and the chief magistrate’s court in Milimani.Kamau wants the five officers to be committed to civil jail for six months for disobeying orders issued by the Court of Appeal that terminated charges against him.“Summons be issued and are hereby issued to Noordin Haji, Archbishop Eliud Wabukala, Sophia Lepuchirit, Dabar Maalim, Micheal Mubea, Joseph Boinnet to appear before this court to show why they should not be punished for contempt of court,” his application reads.Through lawyer Nelson Havi, Kamau says the Court of Appeal terminated the proceedings in the anti-corruption case of 2016. It prohibited further investigations and prosecution.He alleges that on July 28 last year, the chief magistrate declined his request for an acquittal and instead ordered that he be discharged.The CS says the chief magistrate’s decision was based on a non-binding statement in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which said the parties are at liberty to proceed as they deem necessary on the basis of a properly constituted EACC and within the dictates of the law.
