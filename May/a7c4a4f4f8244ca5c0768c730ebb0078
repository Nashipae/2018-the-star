The Kenya Red Cross Society has initiated a process of distilling raw water from River Tana in a bid to prevent possible waterborne disease outbreak in camps hosting displaced persons by the recent floods. According to Red Cross Northeastern Regional Manager Abdulakim Otula, the more than 2000 affected households were at risk of contracting the diseases following the collapse of the sewerage system in addition to 100 sunken toilets. Otula said virtually all the garbage in dump sites in both Garissa and Tana River counties have been washed away and scattered all over posing danger especially to children. He said they will put up quick measures such as construction of temporary toilets within the camps to ensure there was no spread of diseases. The regional manager added that they were targeting to erect 10 temporary toilets with a population of 14905 camps in both counties where their trained staff were promoting hygiene through education on the ideals safer ways. Amina Abdala a displaced mother in Ziwani camp said they afraid of the disease because of using raw water from the river. She said already some children had started to diarrhea but was hopeful all will be well. Her sentiments were echoed by Daudi Shora, an elder, who said despite using crude ways of distilling the water they draw from the river nothing was different. He suggested that a storage tank was necessary for more sustainability.
