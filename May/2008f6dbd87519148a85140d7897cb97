Most political analysts might not have given Charles Kanyi Njagua (better known as Jaguar) a chance, especially when he decided to vie for Starehe MP. We can all recall what he had to go through just to earn the Jubilee ticket and how he emerged top of his closest rivals Steve Mbogo and activist Boniface Mwangi in the general election. These is a yet another story of an individual who started at the bottom, earned his spot in the music scene, and now he’s representing his people in Parliament. In this transition, he has earned both fans of his music and supporters of his political ambition. Not long ago, Jaguar released his latest track “Timika,” a reconciliation attempt with his longtime rival Prezzo. With 2018 being the year of handshakes and making amends in the political arena, Jaguar borrows that gesture and applies it in his musical side. Earlier this year, we witnessed the artiste restore friendly relations with Babu Owino over a brawl they had a while back. In an attempt to buttress his musical career while still serving the people who elected him, the artiste still seems to be on a mission of recording and releasing new tracks. He maintains his basic style and sound and doesn’t seem likely to evolve any time soon. It is this very music, not politics, that made him a household name in Kenya and earned him major collaborations with Mafikizolo and Iyanya. In the past, he has been criticised for his typical delivery, with many claiming there’s an undeniable similarity in all his tracks. But on the contrary, his music positions him as an entertainer, merging party tunes with aspirational tracks. Now he has a more demanding obligation of ensuring his people are served accordingly. How he juggles both ventures during his term in office will be interesting to watch.
