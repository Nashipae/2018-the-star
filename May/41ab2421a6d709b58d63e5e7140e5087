University lecturers’ unions yesterday said they will not call off their strike until the government presents a counter-offer to their demands.The University Academic Staff Union and Kenya Universities Staff Union said they will escalate, intensify and upscale their strike.The strike enters day 70 today.Kusu secretary general Constantine Wasonga said though they empathise with the more than 600,000 students hurt by the strike, they will not back down unless the inter-ministerial committee tables an offer.He said the unions are ready to engage the ministry in a fruitful dialogue.“We are not going to accept the global figures on our payslips. These figures have been distorted over the years. We’d rather have the longest strike that will see all our issues sorted than call it off and embark on the streets after a month,” Wasonga said.He was speaking to journalists at their Uniafric offices.

Please parents and students do not ignore our warning. Students should stay at home until the strike is called off”.Wasonga said labour issues do not need police involvement, but dialogue.Uasu chairman Muga K’Olale said the move by vice chancellors to incite students against lecturers might have dire consequences in future.He said it is ill-advised and if not stopped, it might degenerate into animosity between students and lecturers.Kusu secretary general Charles Mukhwaya said it is unfortunate government has resorted to using the VC’s to incite students amid efforts to intimidate them.“One is left wondering who will teach these students, mentor them, mark their exams and prepare them for graduation,” he said.Mukhwaya said campuses are hallowed grounds of study, learning, mentoring, inquiry, research and innovation, not police guns and teargas.
