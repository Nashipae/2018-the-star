Stylish pastor, motivational speaker and relationship expert Robert Burale has warned men against dating their friends’ ex-lovers. He says men should never wine and dine their friends’ lovers. The outspoken Burale has also shared the Dos and Don’ts of hanging out with your fellow men. “Unwritten laws for gentlemen—be each other’s keeper. NEVER ever go behind your friend’s back and talk to his wife/girlfriend. The joke will eventually be on you. NEVER hug a fellow man tightly unless ABSOLUTELY necessary. Never hold a fellow man’s hand when talking casually.” Adding, “NEVER Ever place your hand on a man’s thighs when stressing a point during conversation...If you want to grab anything ..look for a stone...(if you do THAT to me I will shoot you). Never ever try and get with your fellow man’s EX. Bro CODE. Leave no man behind.”
