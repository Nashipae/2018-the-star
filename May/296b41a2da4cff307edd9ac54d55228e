A violent argument between a man and his wife turned tragic in Huruma yesterday after the furious father stabbed his son to death. Dennis Mwema, 18, had tried to intervene when Euticus Githinji stabbed him twice in the chest. He bled to death. His mother, Eunice Wanza, sustained minor injuries during the morning fight. Githinji has since fled. Wanza, 37, reported the matter to officers at the Huruma police station. She said Dennis was stabbed with a kitchen knife. Wanza said Githinji returned home at around 3am. He was drunk. They got into a verbal altercation which turned into a fist fight. The son, who was asleepin his bedroom, woke up and attempted to stop Githinji from beating his mother.

Neighbours heard Wanza scream for help. They were unable to access the court because Githinjihad locked the door from inside. Wanza said Githinji disappeared after realising he had killed Denis. The death is the latest in a new wave of domestic murders in Nairobi. On Monday night, a 46-yearold hawker killed his wife and chopped off her hands in their Dandora home. Humprey Maina killed Lucy Njeri, 48, following a quarrel. Maina then committed suicide by drinking a pesticide. Yesterday, Buru Buru DCI boss Jeremiah Ikiao said the couple had fought over money. Last week, a 22-year-old college student committed suicide and left a note blaming his father for his death. Duncan Mwangi said he could not withstand the mistreatment of his mother.
