It’s no small milestone that the disputes surrounding the production
of Kenya’s petroleum have been resolved. The investor, national government and local
community have amicably agreed on their interests in the Turkana oil fields,
setting the stage for the first test tanker to depart from Lokichar to Mombasa
in the next 10 days. It is a moment of celebration for the community, and the
country no less, as we join the tiny league of oil producers. Negotiations over
the exploitation of natural resources are normally protracted. In some
instances, they end in stalemates, while intended beneficiaries wallow in poverty.
And so it is laudable that we have avoided such a fate in our first attempt. Expectations are indeed high that once full exports
commence, revenues will radically jerk up our GDP and thence the transformation
of the livelihoods of many Kenyans will begin. But caution is advised. As the
analysis here shows, there are many unanswered questions over the oil
exploration and exploitation, whose agreements are shrouded in secrecy. Turkana is just the first find and many prospectors are
still scouring for oil in numerous designated exploration blocks. They reveal
varying deposits that could be commercially viable. Which begs two questions — do
we have the policy and legal framework for the profitable exploitation of our
natural resources, and should agreements be standard or specific to each case, such
as Turkana?
