A Maryland man was sentenced on
Tuesday to 35 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to
conspiring to support the Islamist militant group al Shabaab by
traveling to Somalia to receive military training from the
group, federal prosecutors said. Maalik Alim Jones, 33, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge
Paul Gardephe in Manhattan. A lawyer for Jones could not
immediately be reached for comment. Jones pleaded guilty in September, admitting that he carried
an AK-47 automatic assault rifle for al Shabaab, which is allied
with al Qaeda. Al Shabaab, which seeks to overthrow Somaliaâ€™s
Western-backed government and impose a strict version of sharia,
or Islamic law, has carried out violent attacks in Kenya and
Ethiopia. Jones was charged in January 2016. Prosecutors said at the
time that Jones, who was born and lived in Maryland, traveled in
2011 to Kenya and then to Somalia, where he was brought to an al
Shabaab training camp. Authorities said Jones trained with the group for three
months, reading and interpreting the Koran and learning how to
handle weapons, including an AK-47 and rocket-propelled
grenades. He then became a member of a specialized fighting force
within al Shabaab known as Jaysh Ayman that carried out attacks
and raids across the border in Kenya and participated in a
battle against Kenyan soldiers in the Somali town of Afmadow,
prosecutors said. Jones was taken into custody by Somali authorities on Dec.
7, 2015, while he was attempting to procure a boat to depart for
Yemen, according to prosecutors. Click here for the latest political news
