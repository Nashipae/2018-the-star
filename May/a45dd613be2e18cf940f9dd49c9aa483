The family of Swedish dance music star Avicii (real name Tim Bergling), who died of an apparent suicide on April 20 at age 28, has released a statement regarding their funeral plans. “The funeral will be private, in the presence of the people who were closest to Tim. They kindly ask media to respect this. There is no additional information forthcoming.” Avicii was found dead in his hotel room in Oman, the Middle Eastern country bordering Saudi Arabia. A statement issued late last month by the family seemingly confirms that Avicii took his own life. “He really struggled with thoughts about meaning, life, happiness. He could not go on any longer. He wanted to find peace," the family said.
