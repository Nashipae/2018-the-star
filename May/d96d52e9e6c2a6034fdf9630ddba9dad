Nasa leader Raila Odinga has today announced the end of the opposition's civil disobedience and product boycott imposed on several companies after the disputed October 26 repeat elections. Speaking during this year's labour day celebrations at Uhuru Park, Raila said he had forgiven Bidco, Safaricom, Brookside and Hako industries. "I did that because I was bitter with the outcome of the elections. We have agreed to work together with my brother Uhuru Kenyatta for the betterment of the nation," Raila said: Last year, Raila urged his supporters to boycott products from corporations he claimed were part of the August election rigging scheme. He accused Safaricom of abetting rigging through its network. "Big corporations are part and parcel of killing democracy in Kenya. We have the power and if they want to stifle our democracy, we can retaliate," Raila said at the time.
