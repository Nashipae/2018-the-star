More than 15 chemists in Eldoret and elsewhere in the North Rift are being investigated by the Anti-Doping Agency, the DCI and the Pharmacy and Poisons Board on suspicion of selling banned drugs and substances to athletes. This follows revelations that many athletes in the region may have been engaging in doping using drugs bought from the chemists. Adak chief executive Japhter Rugut led a raid on one of the chemists last month and the probe has now been extended. He indicated that several chemists are under investigation. Those found engaging in the illegal business will be arrested and prosecuted, Rugut said. An athlete confessed he was injected with a banned performance-enhancing substance, blood-booster EPO, purchased from the Eldoret chemist. The owner was arrested. Uasin Gishu Deputy Governor  Daniel Chemno said they would support investigating agencies to ensure those involved in the illegal business are arrested. “Reports of increased doping among our athletes are worrying,” Chemno said.
