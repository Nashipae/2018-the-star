Some lawyers withhold their clients’ cash and fail to account for reparations. A report by the Advocates Complaints Commission indicates 234 complaints were reported against lawyers in just three months. The report shows three lawyers were struck off the roll of advocates and five suspended between January and March this year. The finding shows rogue advocates are on the prowl. During the same period, eight lawyers were fined, one admonished, but 32 other disputes were resolved. "The commission received 234 new complaints out of which 44 were classified and files opened. One-ninety were submitted for further inquiry." the quarterly report states. Of the cases settled, 19 relate to complaints against advocates withholding clients’ funds, five were about failure to account while 14 relate to failure to offer professional services. There was also one case of a lawyer acting without instruction from the client. During th same period last year, three lawyers were struck off the roll of advocates, eight were suspended and one was acquitted, while 26 cases were settled. These were some of the 376 grievances reported then. ACC chairperson Beauttah Siganga had raised the red flag about the rise of complaints lodged by the public against lawyers. The commission is a statutory body mandated to investigate complaints against any advocate, law firm, or their employees. In February, Siganga urged the public to have due diligence when hiring lawyers to avoid being swindled. He said fraudsters have infiltrated the profession. "The commission advises people to engage advocates who can offer high quality services. This will see a reduction of public complaints." Siganga said during a meeting at the Deaf Centre in Godoni, Kwale town. He urged lawyers to serve well to protect the dignity of the legal profession. Click here for the latest political news
