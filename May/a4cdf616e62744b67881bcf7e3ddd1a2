Nyandarua contractors are going through untold suffering, as the county has yet to pay their dues, Finance executive Mary Mugwanja said yesterday. This comes eight months into the administration of Governor Francis Kimemia. Mugwanja blamed the problem on lack of proper and clear records. She said some claims could not be easily authenticated. An audit team is verifying details of the suppliers and Sh77 million has been approved for remittance in the next two weeks, she said. A further Sh215 million is still being audited. “I receive people in my office telling me they are going to be auctioned. It is so painful to see people cry in my office. I do not enjoy it,” Mugwanja told the county assembly General Oversight Committee. She said settling the bills is one of her priorities but asked for the assembly’s support. “I don’t know why we should be crippling SMEs for mistakes they never committed — it’s the county’s fault,” she said. “Going forward, let’s collectively ensure what needs to be done when [ensuring] some work is done properly. You are the oversight authority. Support us so the payment process becomes easy.” The head of the county exchequer said they will put in place measures to have a properly managed records system so documents are easily retrieved. This will prevent confusion, she said. “I don’t want you to call me here again asking me why I paid without the right documents,” she said Other CEC members who faced the MCAs were Stephen Mbugua (Energy and Transport), Faith Mbugua (Education, Gender Affairs and Culture) and Simon Ng’ang’a (Water and Environment).
