Luo elders allied to Chairman Opiyo Otondi have dismissed self-proclaimed splinter group leader Nyandiko Og’adi. Otondi claimed on Friday that the splinter is being used by politicians to undermine Nasa principal and Opposition leader Raila Odinga. Charles Omolo, who is Chairman of the council's Ugenya branch, said they were privy to information that "a lot of money has been dished out to the rebelling faction to divide the Luo community". "It is shameful for people to be used by external forces, through cheap handouts, to vilify Raila, the patron of the council." The Chairman said the elders unanimously supported the conciliatory meeting that was held at Raila's Opoda home in Bondo constituency two weeks ago. He said Og’adi was invited but snubbed it, and that he cannot make claims to the contrary as his Secretary Adera Osawa attended and was given a position. Omolo addressed the press on behalf of the council after their meeting in Siaya town on Thursday. He was with Jame Onjoma (county Organizing Secretary), Samson Oyuda (Bondo branch Secretary) and Mzee Lubalo (Siaya Secretary). The members termed Otondi their bonafide leader and said Og'adi was being disobedient. They asked him to wait until the Chairman post is declared vacant and contest, instead of engaging in "unnecessary sideshows". Omolo said: “Otondi was elected by most of the elders from the region. Who elected Og’adi?” He called on the Luo community to remain united behind Raila as he has played a major role in uniting Kenya through the handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta.
