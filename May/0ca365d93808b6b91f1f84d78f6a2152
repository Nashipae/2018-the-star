Nairobi MCAs have rejected Governor Mike Sonko's nominees for two Chief Officer positions. Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital Medical Superintendent Musa Mohamed had been selected for medical services and Mary Nyambura for finance. A report tabled by Health committee chairman Peter Warutere, whose panel vetted Mohamed, says he was dropped due to queries by the Auditor General on the financial operations at Mama Lucy hospital. “The financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2016 could not confirm the propriety and validity of expenditure on goods and services amounting to Sh165,852,531." The team also said the nominee did not meet requirements in the Public Appointments Act. Mohamed faced challenges immediately after he was nominated. Embakasi Central MP Benjamin Mwangi, in whose constituency the hospital is located, opposed his nomination in a letter to the Governor, saying he was unfit for public office. The legislator claimed residents had complained about poor services at the facility. Finance committee chairman Robert Mbatia, whose panel vetted Nyambura, said the nominee did not understand the department she was nominated to and had no supervisory and leadership skills. Nyambura is an accounts officer at Kenya Power. “She has never been in charge of an institution with near equivalence to Nairobi. She has no knowledge of the government’s budgeting procedures, practices, terms and legal requirements," stated the report presented on Thursday.
