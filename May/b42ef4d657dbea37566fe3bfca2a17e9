I sat for some time at the Hyena dam, patiently
watching and waiting. Everything looked so much greener and the dam was very
full and overflowing due to heavy rains. There were so many birds around the
area, all looking very busy as they actively searched the murky waters for their
version of delicious aquatic meals to feast on. Different species of birds have preferred food
sources, from the vegetarian purple swamp hens, to smaller birds like black
crakes and African rails, who catch smaller, live, wriggly prey. The various duck
species searched for whatever special treats they could find. A family of
crested cranes walked in the long grass nearby, also enjoying the increased abundance
of food. The larger raptors like fish eagles sit perched and ready to swoop and
catch a fish. The herons, spoonbills and storks search the shallows for crunchy
crustacean meals. A yellow-billed stork seemed to be an expert at
catching aquatic prey, while some birds seemingly struggled. This stork had an
excellent technique and caught a number of crunchy crustaceans in a short
period of time for dinner. Just sitting peacefully in this serene setting has
a very calming effect on me. There are
places and creatures on earth that God has put there so that our very souls
will be restored. Next time you are feeling a bit stressed or just
need time out, it is a very good idea to spend some quality time in a national
park and slow down to the pace of nature. So why not visit a dam and watch
the creatures enjoying their aquatic feasts? Then perhaps you can also enjoy
your own packed food, while watching nature around you.  The
park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00. For more information on the
park, you can link to the following websites: www.kws.org or www.nairobigreenline.com or on Facebook at Nairobi National Park
