More than 23 employees of two firms in Eldoret have been charged with defrauding the National Social Security Fund. Staff of Eldoret Water and Sanitation Company and the Rai Plywood Company are accused of receiving retirement benefits irregularly while still working. Six employees appeared before chief magistrate Charles Obulutsa, on Friday, but did not take a plea. They will take a plea on May 28. Police asked for more time to arrest a former NSSF employee Vitalis Odiop who is a prime suspect in the scam that may have cost the fund Sh5 million. The suspects are accused of committing the offence between March 2013 and January 28, 2016. Some of the suspects facing charges have gone into hiding. Police are hunting for them.
