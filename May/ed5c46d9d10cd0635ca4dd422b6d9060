Hotels and restaurants
in several parts of Kerio Valley have been closed indefinitely following fears
of a cholera outbreak in the area. Two people
died on Friday in what health officials in Elgeyo Marakwet confirmed were cases of cholera. County Health executive Kiprono Chepkok said on Monday that the 60-year-old woman and four-year-old child died at their homes in Marakwet East. It was reported that the two relied on traditional herbs to cure their diarrhea and
vomiting. Chepkok said cases have been reported in Mogil, Chugor, Chesoi and Chesongoch areas in Marakwet East and Arror in Marakwet West. He said two out of four people who were admitted at Mogil health centre in Kerio Valley on Sunday were found to be suffering from cholera. Chepkok said the disease may have spread from Kolowa areas of neighbouring Baringo county. To prevent more cases, he said, all food joints were closed and the hawking of items such as milk and fruits banned. Cooking at ceremonies has also been prohibited. Chepkok announced that the county deployed community health workers for a
house-to-house campaign against the disease. The medics were trained on testing for cholera and treating those infected. “We have asked locals to rush to the nearest health facilities whenever they suffer from diarrhea and vomiting. We have made them aware that cholera kills within three hours if treatment is not sought on time," the executive said. “The
situation has been stabilised. I assure residents that our facilities
have been adequate drugs to treat the disease." Click here for the latest political news
