The election date should not be changed from August to December, Mombasa residents said on Friday. The majority of speakers at a public hearing on the two-thirds gender rule opposed the proposed changes. They said December polls bring back bad memories of previous elections. Members of the National Assembly Justice and Legal Affairs Committee were collecting views at School of Government in Mombasa. United Green Movement Coast regional coordinator Hamisa Zaja said December elections are usually marred by violence because most of institutions are closed for the holiday season. But resident Michael Barasa said a December date means prolonged campaign period.
