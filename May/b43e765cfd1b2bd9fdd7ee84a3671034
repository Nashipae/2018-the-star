A few weeks ago, news went viral that Romy Jons cheated on his wife with Baraka The Prince’s girlfriend. The issue left fans confused because of the different posts they put on their social media platforms. Romy and Baraka have a song called Bora Iwe. During an interview with Word Is, Romy finally addressed the matter. “I texted Baraka’s girlfriend nikitaka nipate connection ya my career. Hapo ndipo yule girlfriend alituma ile message kwa Baraka ati nimemtongoza, lakini at the end of the day nilikaa na Baraka nikamwelezea na akanielewa. Nilikua na project naye,” he said. What most people believed was that he was cheating on his wife, so what did he feel about that? “Ilikua tu utani. Nilikua naifanya kama utani lakini yeye akaona kama ni serious.” Well, being that he is married, how did his wife receive that information? “I had to explain, nikamwambia kuwa Najma nimemjua muda mrefu na nikamwambia kuwa sikua namtongoza. Yeye alinielewa nikamwomba msamaha, though there were ups and downs. Adding that it is not hard for a woman to leave her husband for cheating. It is better you sit down and talk to him. “I married the girl who I used to live with. Tuliishi pamoja kwa miaka mitano ndio tukaja kuoana juzi, sasa tuko na miezi minne. Kikubwa zaidi mkioana mkosane, mnapaswa kuita watu, lakini kabla hamjaoana mnasort vitu zenyu wawili.”
