Every day, six-year-old Binyamin Ibrahim hobbles, stumbles or crawls 700 metres to school. Binyamin has no hands and his feet have no toes. But he wants to learn. The boy from Darusalam IDP camp in Rhamu, Mandera county, was injured horribly by burns. But that hasn’t stopped him from pursuing his dream of becoming a teacher. “This child has gone to school alone. He was not taken by his parents,” Rhamu MCA Kula Aliow told reporters. “He has the will and the energy. He wants to pursue his education, but he is only capable in a limited sway. What he needs are prosthetic devices so he can write, walk and eat properly.” Aliow and other MCAs visited Ibrahim and his mother Sadia. Ibrahim is in pre-unit in Darusalam Primary School. “He came this term with his peers. He’s determined to learn,” head teacher Hashim Mamo said. The MCAs promised to donate cash to help his mother start a business. They will also buy her furniture. They described the family situation as heartbreaking. Nominated MCA Abass Abdille said the disabled child is very vulnerable, as the parents, especially his father, have not been supportive. “I shared this story with several orthopaedic specialists. They said the child needs to have artificial limbs for him to meet his basic and daily requirements as a human being,” he said. Aliow said the team had heard about Ibrahim’s story on social media and had come especially to have his problems fixed. “We appeal to well-wishers and the county government, so together, we can help Binyamin pursue his education to the highest level,” he said. Human rights activist Noor Abdow said Ibrahim is “very courageous” about reading. “We asked him what he wants to be and he said he wants to be a teacher. He’s a clever guy.”
