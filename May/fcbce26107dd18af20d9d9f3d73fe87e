Msupa S is indeed the latest sensation to emerge ever since Githeri Man. Kenyans on social media just have a way of turning everything into a proper laugh, and indeed we now have a new star who believes she can "rap like Beyonce". Look at how we discover music and talent now. There were literally hundreds of social network users making fun of the latest self-proclaimed queen of hip hop, and she seems to be enjoying the attention. Despite this huge boost in exposure, Msupa S has been making music for some time now. At first glance, her music doesn't sound appealing enough for the mainstream market, but somehow, she's managed to spiral to fame. In actual sense, her personality, especially the confidence, has done it for her. While struggling with eloquence and articulation, she has carved a niche for herself. She was so determined to make herself relevant she decided to launch an attack on artistes like Femi One, Sosuun, Noti Flow and Kyki. She managed to grab the attention of rapper Khaligraph Jones, who has since tapped her idiosyncrasy on the instant hit "Watajua Hawajui". Whether it was an attempt to get Msupa S' career going or simply a gimmick aimed at maintaining relevance, only time will tell. What we know is that Msupa S is truly determined to exhibit her rap-sung Kalenjin and English tunes. Whether she is truly the best or even the "Kenyan Cardi B" is dependent upon how her fans feel about her art. What we know is that she's been granted an opportunity not many in her league have been lucky to enjoy. Perhaps she's now on the right track, maybe not. Chances are she will drop a couple of tracks and realise people have moved on from her unremarkably unusual style, and it will be hard to maintain the traction. Also there's a possibility she will seek the right advice and develop her delivery and keep entertaining her fans. Whichever approach she takes is dependent on how fast she realises what she's dealing with.
