We
sat quietly at the hyena dam. After about 10 minutes of waiting, the wildlife
began to behave naturally. A pair of African Jacanas (Actophilornis africanus) emerged from the reeds and trotted
easily over the water lilies in search of food. Jacanas
have several nicknames — lily trotter, water walker and even Jesus bird — because
they look like they are walking on water. Why would a bird have such funny-looking
feet? If he walked on land, those long toes would get in the way. However, the
jacana walks on water lily pads and other plants that grow in the water. The
long toes hold him up, the way snowshoes hold up a person walking on soft snow.
These birds can fly but rarely do so. When they land, they always flip up their
wings. No one knows why. Jacanas
live on the surface of ponds, where water lilies and other plants grow. They
eat some plant food, little water animals and the insect larvae that fasten
themselves to plant stems and the underside of lily pads. They always seem
hungry. Amazingly,
it is the male jacanas that raise the young, and they can actually carry them
under their wings. They live in warm countries, mainly in southern and central
Africa, parts of Asia, Australia and parts of the Americas. I
always find it a joy to see birds when driving in the park. God has created such
amazing diversity. So remember, when you go into the Nairobi National Park with
the attitude of “bird watching”, why not take some time to sit quietly at a dam
and encounter nature in a wonderfully different way, by letting nature come to
you, instead of trying to chase after it?  The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00. For more information on the park, you can
