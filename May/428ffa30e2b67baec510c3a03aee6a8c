NASA leader Raila Odinga has defended the exclusion of the youth from the handshake team saying they needed experienced persons. “The old people were once young and young people have never been old,” Raila told Gikuyu, Embu and Meru leaders in Nairobi. He, however, said the youth would play a crucial role in bringing communities together. Raila reiterated that his agreement to work with President Kenyatta has nothing to do with 2022 politics as claimed by a section of Jubilee leaders. The former PM briefed the group on the handshake, dismissing claims that the unity is meant to create positions to benefit individuals.

Raila was accompanied by MPs Thomas Kajwang’ (Ruaraka) and Jared Okelo (Nyando) during the two hours meeting. The peace initiative will start from Nairobi and rolled out to other parts of the country. “The gist of our meeting was to re-examine ourselves and see when the rain started beating us, “ said Nyando MP Jared Okelo.
