Sports CS Rashid Echesa has told Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya to stop undermining other Luhya leaders in his quest for the presidency. Echesa said Oparanya should focus on, the job voters gave him as governor, and development, rather than belittling and branding some Luhyas outsiders. “Now I hear he is declaring himself Kakamega spokesman and profiling other Luhya leaders as outsiders. Spokesman for who? When was he installed and by who? Since when did Mudavadi [Musalia] and Wetang’ula [Moses] become outsiders in Luhyaland?” Echesa said. Echesa said Oparanya should declare whether he wants to become the President of Kakamega or Kenya. Oparanya has many times said he will lead Kakamega in political negotiations come 2022. On Saturday, he accused former Senator Boni Khalwale of interfering with the unity of Kakamega county by “bringing in outsiders” [Mudavadi and Wetang’ula] into affairs of the people of Kakamega. “I want to tell off Khalwale and let him know that I cannot allow outsiders to speak for us and purport to unite us,” he said. Echesa spoke during a fundraiser for Ebuyonga Church of God in Khwisero subcounty where he was chief quest on Sunday. Echesa termed as unfortunate Oparanya’s reference to Mudavadi and Wetang’ula as outsiders. “We cannot be talking about Luhya unity and you go out demonising fellow leaders, calling them outsiders. Oparanya should know that no one will take him seriously when he publicly undermines fellow Luhyas,” he said. “If Oparanya sees Mudavadi and Wetang’ula as outsiders and we’re talking about uniting Kenya, how will he see other tribes? How can Kenyans trust him?”
