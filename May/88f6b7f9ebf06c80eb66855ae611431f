The government has been asked to enforce the food and nutrition law that requires millers to fortify maize and wheat flour with vitamins and minerals. Embu chambers of commerce chairman Samuel Kanyi yesterday said the move will fight malnutrition. He said the move will also create a ready market for farmers of products rich in vitamins and minerals. Kanyi said ugali is the staple food for most Kenyans and that fortifying the maize flour will reduce cases of malnutrition, especially among children in rural areas. He wants the millers to be forced to add vitamins and minerals in flours manufactured from sorghum, green grams, bananas, cassava among others. “Such a move will also eliminate middlemen who exploit hardworking farmers,” Kanyi said. He asked Embu MCAs to pass a law for value addition in all agricultural products. The nutrition law was passed in 2012 in a move to improve health. Majority of Kenyans consume wheat and maize flour. Manufacturers are required to fortify them with iron, folic acid, zinc and Vitamin B. According to the 2009 demographic statistics, 35 per cent of children under five years are stunted due to malnutrition.
