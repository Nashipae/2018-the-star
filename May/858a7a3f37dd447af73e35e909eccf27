Zari Hassan is the boss lady, indeed. Last weekend, she attended The Colour Purple concert at the Uhuru Gardens, bringing Nairobi to a standstill. Before the event, she and gospel singer Size 8 had visited women at the Kayole Women’s Health Centre. The next day, she spent time with Governor Mike Sonko's family at a posh hotel in town. Word Is has found out that she walked away with Ush37.3 million, which translates to a cool million Kenya shillings. A confidential source said: "Zari was paid Sh1 million. Let me tell you something else, the accommodation and transport costs were over Sh500,000, so that is Sh1.5 million." This means her expenses plus what she was paid totalled Ush56 million, which is Ksh1.5 million. The boss lady has said she will not sue Diamond Platnumz for child support because she makes her own moolah. “Why should I sue? From my point of view I feel like it’s his responsibility to take care of his kids if he really believes he has to. I don’t see why I should drag him to court to see his kids. For me, I’m not in that space. "I loved him so much and everyone knows about that. You can go cheat there as a man but when it comes in with madharau, that is when it becomes too much. I felt that my integrity was so low. Like, when my big boys see Diamond misbehaving on social media, they will not have respect for women when they grow up. "I asked myself, why do I have to settle for this? My children were insulted on social media. Being the fact that they do not have a father, they will know that in future they need to respect women, and that is why I left," Zari said, adding that she still loves Diamond despite leaving him.
