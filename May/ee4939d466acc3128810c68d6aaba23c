Daddy Owen and his wife are expecting a bundle of joy in two months. The singer disclosed the news to Word Is, explaining how happy he is. Owen married Farida three years ago, and the two have kept their private life secret. Over the weekend, Daddy Owen organised a baby shower for his beautiful wife at a private location in Karen, Nairobi. The couple is expecting a baby boy in July, Owen's first baby with his wife. Asked if he will name him after his dad, he said: "We have not yet discussed about the name because we want my mum to be there to help us unveil the name of our son." He said his mum will be there during the birth to help in shaving and naming her grandchild. "We have to follow our culture because we are Africans." Since the wedding day, the singer has kept his wife on the down low, and since she got pregnant, he has kept it private. He said: "The difference between my wife and I is that I am in the limelight and she not. I understand her so well because even me, who has been in the industry for over 15 years, there are things I still find tough as a celebrity, so I found it is necessary to keep it a secret." We all know baby showers are planned by women, but Owen took matters in his own hands. "I planned the baby shower myself and invited her workmates and a few of my relatives. That has not happened before. It is always the other way round, but I chose to organise it myself because I wanted it to be private. "I did even call our friends because I knew, atajua ata before the day itself." That is odd, right? He said, "I am the one who knows her. I know what she likes and what she does not like."
