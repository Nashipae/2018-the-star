The Homa Bay county government on Tuesday signed an MoU with a Chinese company to promote agriculture and build infrastructure. Governor Cyprian Awiti inked the deal with Wenke Chen, the director of One Belt and One Road. The Chinese firm will invest in cassava farming and processing. One Belt One Road will improve roads, electricity and water supply. "We are ready to work with Homa Bay government to undertake development projects. This partnership will ensure Homa Bay realises its development goals," Chen said. The director said the county has many resources for the projects. "The feasibility study we did revealed that we can undertake development projects fast. That’s because China was in a similar situation as Homa Bay," Chen said. While China is now famous for its industry, it began as underdeveloped agricultural economy. Governor Awiti said the Chinese company will begin work in four months. He said his administration will create an enabling environment for investors. "The Homa Bay government’s duty in this deal is to collaborate with the national government in creating enabling environment for
investors to undertake their projects," the governor said. BE PATIENT Awiti, who was with members of the county cabinet, expressed confidence the projects will transform lives. Industrialisation in Homa Bay will add value to agricultural produce and create jobs, Awiti said. He asked residents to be patient while the projects are implemented. "These development projects cannot be started and completed at once. They need time," the governor said.
