Former NTV presenter Larry Madowo is living the good life, and his weekend shenanigans are proof of this. The outspoken media personality is in London and is making sure things are poppin'. What
we have to wonder if this is his favourite drink. Louis XIII is a cognac
produced by Rémy Martin, a company headquartered in Cognac, France, and
owned by the Rémy Cointreau Group. It was served to Queen Elizabeth II in the Versailles Palace to celebrate her visit of 1957. So why is this Cognac so expensive? All Remy Martin is made with grapes from the Grande Champagne vineyards in the Cognac region of France. The brandies are blended and aged in oak barrels, some of them dating back centuries, to make Remy Martin's famous Cognac.
