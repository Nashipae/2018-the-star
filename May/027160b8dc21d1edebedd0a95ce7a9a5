Twenty two bodies have been identified following the Patel Dam tragedy that saw raging waters cause massive destruction in Solai, Nakuru. One body was found on Friday morning, raising the toll to 45 since search and rescue operations began after the dam burst on Wednesday night. The toll, the highest in a single flood-related incident, brings to 162 the number of people who have died countrywide as a result of floods since heavy rains started in March.

Regarding safety measures to prevent another tragedy, Chimwanga said: "Water is being discharged from the second dam to reduce the level to 30-40 percent." Red Cross reported that 39 people had been rescued in a joint operation with the county and the national government, as rains continue pounding the area. They were taken to Bahati Sub-county and Nakuru County Referral Hospitals. Among villages affected are those in the farmlands of Nyakinyua, Endao, and Arutani where hundreds of people were displaced. A centre has been set up near the scene for relatives to register missing family members while the government and well-wishers have provided food and other items for the victims. The government will conduct investigations on all water dams in the country to ensure they are safe.
