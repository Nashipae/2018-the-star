Medical colleges have been asked to respect religious freedom and be tolerant of diverse faith. The chairman of the Kenya Medical Training Colleges Board, Philip Kaloko, made the call following the ejection of Muslim students from class at the Mwingi campus. The female students were, two weeks ago, barred from attending classes because they wore hijabs. Speaking when he toured the institution on Wednesday, Kaloki condemned the incident, saying it was discriminatory and illegal. “No student should be harassed on the basis of their faith. This institution belongs to Kenyans whether they are Hindus, Muslims or Christians,” Kaloki said. The dress code dispute began two months ago after a new deputy principal ordered the students to drop the hijabs when in class. Male Muslim students also claimed they had been discriminated against during security searches. Kaloki said he was happy the institution had resolved the disputes. There are 300 students at the campus. “The administration should now hold the approved dress code to guarantee smooth studies and improve cohesion,” he said. Parents had called on Kaloki’s board to resolve the dispute. Kaloki asked the management to allow the students attend classes as they resolved the matter. He had promised to visit the college. On Wednesday, Kaloki said there were plans to upgrade the curriculum and infrastructure of the 65 medical colleges countrywide. “The move is in line with the 2022 universal healthcare target,” Kaloki said. The former MP said he was happy with the growth of the institution.
