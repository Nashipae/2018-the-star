Lillian Muli is expecting her second child. Speaking to Word Is, she said she's in her third trimester, so she is expecting the baby soon "Pregnancy is so good and I thank God I have not had any complications so far, neither have I had morning sickness," she said. The sexy TV lass has been a common face loved by many and hated by some. Many girls who are in the industry are yearning to get to where she is today. Lillian said, "You can be better than Lillian, follow your dreams and always look for mentors, especially women who have made it in life. Surround yourself with prayer partners, people who will pray for you." Adding that, "It is very important to be spiritual and go for your dreams. It might take a long time before you get to where your want, but you will get there some day." Despite the bright face we see on our TVs, Lillian has some regrets in life. "I regret doubting myself so much. I used to doubt myself so much about my potential. I never thought I was good enough for a long time. I used to question a lot of my ability in terms of whether I was able to do certain things as well as other people. Had I never doubted myself, I would have achieved so much more than I have achieved today. However, I am happy that today, I am in that level that I am not afraid to try. That is what hinders many. I would rather fail than fail to try. Lillian went on, saying, "Having the wrong friends, and having the wrong company, people who did not build me along my journey, people who we spent a lot of time doing things that were really not constructive. I regret the company I kept in the past, but now I know the value of keeping solid friendship, who will guide you, support you at your worst moments. If you keep the wrong people around you, that will be a reflection of who you are."
