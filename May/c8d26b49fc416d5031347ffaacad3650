Soon, there will be no grass-thatched house in Machakos. Governor Alfred Mutua has launched a Sh 50 million program to roof all grass thatched houses with iron sheets in the next four months. The initiative dubbed the "Machakos comprehensive roofing program" is already ongoing. Mutua said his office has already mapped out the county and identified houses that needed to be roofed . "It is a shame that more than 500 years since modern roofing was done in Europe we still have grass thatched houses in Africa. I want to change that in Machakos," Mutua said. The Maendeleo chap chap leader said the roofing program was part of his re-election promise where he pledged to provide free iron sheets. He commended President Uhuru Kenyatta for making housing one of his Big Four Agenda.
