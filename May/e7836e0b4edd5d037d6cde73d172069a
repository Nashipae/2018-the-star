Passengers of the ill-fated Condor plane that failed to take off on Tuesday after a bird strike got a relieve after the airline provided an alternative plane to Zanzibar. A Condor Boeing 767-300, registration D-ABUM performing flight DE-2282 from Mombasa to Zanzibar with 230 passengers and 10 crew failed to take off at Moi International Airport after the left engine ingested a crow, an aggressive bird popular in Mombasa city on Tuesday at 08.09 hours. Condor is a German airline named after a species of vultures, the largest land flying birds.

The plane pulled from the runway to the parking area where it is being inspected by technicians for damages. Condor head of communications Johannes Winter said that a replacement aircraft flying from Frankfurt to Mombasa was immediately provided to bring the passengers to Frankfurt via Zanzibar. “On the runway, a bird was ingested in the left engine before take-off. The captain applied the brakes according to procedures and brought the aircraft to a complete stop,” Winter said through an email. “The passengers and the crew are in good health,” he added. The airline reintroduced charter flights in the Germany- Mombasa-Zanzibar route in June 2016 after pulling out in 2014 over insecurity concerns. Click here for the latest political news
