Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia on Friday dismissed suggestion that the Constitution be amended to accommodate President Uhuru Kenyatta after his second term expires. During the Labour Day celebrations in Uhuru Park on Tuesday, Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli said Uhuru is still young to quit elective politics. He proposed that the supreme law be changed to create a new system of government. But Kimemia said the executive should not be expanded to suit an individual. “I don’t think they consulted Uhuru on whether he would be interested to continue serving in a different capacity after his tenure expires,” he said. The county boss said leaving the State House does not mean Uhuru will have nothing else to do. He urged Uhuru to pursue a global or continental agenda or position once he leaves office. “At no time will he ever be irrelevant,” he said. If African states unite to form one country, the President can go for its leadership, Kimemia added. He faulted those unhappy with the unity team recently formed by the President and NASA leader Raila Odinga. Kenyans must learn to appreciate positive moves, Kimemia said. He said the committee can be expanded to accommodate those with different experiences.
