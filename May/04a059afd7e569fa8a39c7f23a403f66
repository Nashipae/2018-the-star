The national government yesterday was urged to swiftly prosecute the developer who allegedly grabbed Garissa High School land. Garissa activist Khalif Abdi also urged the National Land Commission to protect public property from powerful individuals using government means to encroach on public utilities. He was addressed the press in Garissa and called on police to investigate. On Wednesday last week, hundreds of Garissa High School students took to the streets to protest against the alleged grabbing of their school land. Students in uniform destroyed what they called private developer’s stalls erected in the school compound. Then they marched to the officers of the governor and regional commissioner. Education director Aden Sheikh said the matter was being investigated and no property would be stolen. Students said a private developer took advantage of the April holiday to destroy the school fence and build stalls. Khalif, the Northern Forum for Democracy (NFD) coordinator, said individuals are taking advantage of weak officials to acquire property. He accused county leaders, including MPs, of silence. The school is the region’s biggest national school and should be protected, he said. Former students also defended the school.  “Whoever removed the fence should immediately be forced to restore it,”  Ibrahim Mursal said.
