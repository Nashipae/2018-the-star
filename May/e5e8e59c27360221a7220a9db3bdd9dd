President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a message of condolence to the families of eight KDF soldiers who were killed in an IED attack in Dhobley, Somalia. The soldiers died on Sunday evening after their vehicle ran over an improvised explosive device as they returned from a routine patrol. The President said he was saddened by the loss of the lives of the soldiers who gave their lives for the country. “These men gave their lives for their country, and for peace; we must, and we will honour their service, their sacrifice and their valour,” Uhuru said in a tweet on Monday. “The mission for which they gave everything will continue until the evil terrorists of al Shabaab are defeated, and the people of Somalia are safe once more. We owe victory to the fallen. You may be sure we will win, for we have right and might on our side,” he said.

Police said Yassin Abdille Hussein, alias Abu Sumeiya, and his wife Fartun Mohammed Guleid are suspected to be al Shabaab financiers and operatives. They were among six Al Shabaab terror suspects whose photos were circulated by police a week ago, describing them as armed and dangerous. The couple is believed to be accomplices of a key al Shabaab operative in Mandera, Abdiweli Mohamed Guleid, alias Abdiweli Kamaure. Kamaure is said to have masterminded the November 2014 Mandera bus attack where militants killed non-Muslims on the Mandera-bound bus.  Click  here for the latest political news
