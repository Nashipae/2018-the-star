A little over a year ago, rapper Kristoff dropped a new song Below, then we never heard from him. He is back with a bang and has released Candy Bar and Handle it. In an interview with Word Is, Kristoff said he does not want people speculating about his life. “I am the one to reveal [details] about my life.” He was rumoured to be dating Yvonne Darcq and it was said she was his ‘sponsor’. But Kristoff said, “We were friends with Vera Sidika and Yvonne Darcq and nothing else was going on between us.” He added, “Talk to me about dating when you see me doing a wedding. How do I have a younger sponsor? I would have gone for an older mama if I wanted a sponsor. I will get married in two years and my ideal woman is light-skinned and hardworking.”
