Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter wants to meet the President to reveal cartels that have been fleecing the cereals board. They are responsible for the mess at the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB), which owes farmers Sh5 billion, he said. Keter said the same group is behind the removal of Silas Tiren (Moiben MP) as chairman of the parliamentary Committee on Agriculture. The MP, who was addressing farmers on Monday in Eldoret during meeting with leaders from the Rift Valley, was cheered wildly. Keter told Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri to name the cartels responsible for filling NCPB depots with imported maize to the disadvantage of local farmers. Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and eight MPs asked the state to pay farmers quickly. Mandago, Uasin Gishu Senator Margaret Kamar and Mosop MP Vincent Tuwei said the Sh1.9 billion NCPB probe should not delay payment for farmers. The government should use emergency funds clear the debt, Kamar said. Ainabkoi MP William Chepkut, Soy MP Caleb Kostany and businessman Hezekiah Bundotich (Buzeki) were also present. Mandago wants the government to reopen the cereals board for farmers to deliver their maize. In March the NCPB turned away hundreds of farmers in the North Rift saying its silos are full. Imported cheap maize had flooded the market. Meanwhile, the state has started registering farmers countrywide to weed out cartels and brokers. Agriculture Chief Administrative Secretary Andrew Tuimur said the ministry is liaising with the ICT ministry. The plan to list farmers was mooted two years ago. There was a previous attempt in 2009, which did not take off. On May 12, Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri said the state wants to modernise agriculture. He spoke at a meeting with 15 governors in Naivasha. Click here for the latest political news
