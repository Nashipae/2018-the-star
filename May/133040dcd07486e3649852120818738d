The Kerio Valley Development Authority will proceed with the construction work on two mega dams in Elgeyo Marakwet. The project will cost Sh63 billion. More than 1,000 families will be resettled and compensated after leaders from Elgeyo Marakwet county approved the construction of the Arror and Kimwarer hydro-power projects. The National Land Commission (NLC) has said more than Sh80 billion will be spent on compensation. The projects had been disrupted  by compensation rows for one year. The KVDA chief executive David Kimosop yesterday said the authority is working with the communities to finalise compensation. He said the contractors have started the initial work after meeting the key county leaders and community representatives. They resolved that the projects should be implemented by KVDA immediately. One of the foreign experts working on the Arror project was last week attacked by villagers opposed to the projects. They cited lack of compensation. However, Kimosop said all pending issues have been ironed out. Governor Alex Tolgos, Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and all MPs from the county, together with Kimosop, said they agreed on how the families to be displaced will be paid. “I am happy that as leaders we are in full support of the two projects for the benefit of the people of Elgeyo Marakwet,” Kimosop said. Tolgos said the projects will be implemented according to the  law and considering the communities’ input. “We will go to the ground to talk to our communities and discuss the need to support the projects,” Tolgos said. MPs Julius Murgor of Keiyo North and his Keiyo South counterpart Daniel Rono, along with county assembly speaker Phillemon Sabulei, said they agreed with the resolution at the meeting to support the projects. Kimosop said the project contractors have been asked to start work.
