Students of Gitugi Girls Secondary on Tuesday walked for 12 kilometres to raise fees for the needy at the school. They walked from Kiria-ini town in Mathioya subcounty to their school. Their target was Sh1 million. It wasn’t immediately established how much was collected. Principal Esther Kirira said students formed the ‘Girl Save Girl’ initiative in 2011. They have been contributing pocket money to assist poor students. A similar walk last year raised Sh500,000, she said. Many bright students were dropping out of school due to lack of school fees, she said. Kirira said the board of management, teachers, willling parents and local leaders also contribute to the kitty, which has benefited many students. “Last year 240 students benefited. We hope more students in need get help this year,” the principal said. Orphans are given first priority when the money is shared. Mathioya MP Peter Kimari, who participated in the walk, praised the students and the school. He said it is a noble idea that gives hope to disadvantaged students. He pledged to support the kitty. Kimari said the initiative complements the CDF kitty, which is not enough for all needy students. “I’m encouraging more schools to start similar initiatives to help other students. The CDF kitty may not help everyone,” he said. Kimari said Sh25 million bursary has been distributed to 4,500 students, however,  some students were left out because the cash was inadequate.
