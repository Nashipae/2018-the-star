Residents of the Kerio escarpment in Elgeyo Marakwet are fearful after cracks opened up following heavy rain. The fault lines formed on Monday night and have cut off several access roads. Security agencies ordered residents living in the rocky escarpment area to move. Elgeyo Marakwet Environment executive Abraham Barsosio said the fault lines stretch for several kilometres, putting lives at risk. He said the situation might worsen if the rain continues. “We are asking residents to move to avoid an imminent disaster,” Barsosio said. “A county inter-departmental team is looking into ways of helping residents to stay safe.” He said some houses in Kapsegut village on the escarpment are on the verge of collapsing due to the earth cracks. “The cracks are similar to those that emerged in Mai Mahiu recently. We are appealing to humanitarian agencies and the national government to help in evacuation,” Barsosio said. County Meteorological Department director Simon Cheptot yesterday said the rain will continue through June. Click here for the latest political news
