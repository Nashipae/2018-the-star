Lawyer Miguna Miguna and Embakasi East MP Babu Owino have clashed over NASA's call to end product boycott. During the Labour Day celebration at Uhuru Park, ODM leader Raila Odinga called off the boycott of Safaricom, Brookside Dairy, and Bidco products. NASA asked its supporters not to use products from the companies citing their alleged roles in last year's disputed general election.

"Patriots, ignore purported "lifting" of the boycott against companies that are were involved in the electoral theft of 2017, the subversion of the rule of law and the Constitution." "He [Raila] doesn't own the movement! Continue the RESISTANCE!," Miguna, who was deported to Canada on February 6 and later on March 28, said.

However, Babu Owino, in his response to Miguna's tweet, dismissed the self-declared NRMKe general calling him "a sad man who is unhappy with the Uhuru-Raila unity". "Miguna Miguna is a sad man. Uhuru-Raila peace agreement put a drastic stop to his foreign public lectures which was a booming business," he tweeted on Wednesday. He further accused Miguna saying the latter is not interested in coming back to Kenya but is using his deportation as an excuse to be on the limelight. "We all know on whose payroll Miguna Miguna rants. He was never interested in coming back to Kenya in the first place. He wanted the drama and limelight." Click here for the latest political news
