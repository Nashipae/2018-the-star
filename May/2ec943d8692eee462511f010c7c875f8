Hotels and restaurants in parts of Kerio Valley have been closed indefinitely following fears of a cholera outbreak. Two people died on Friday in what health officials in Elgeyo Marakwet confirmed as cholera. County health executive Kiprono Chepkok on Monday said the two victims - a 60-year-old woman and a four-year-old child died in their homes in the Kerio Valley. He said diarrhea cases have been reported in Mogil, Chugor, Chesoi and Chesongoch in Marakwet East and Arror in Marakwet West. The CEC member said all food joints have been closed and hawking of food including milk and fruits have been banned in the affected areas to stop further spread of the killer disease.
