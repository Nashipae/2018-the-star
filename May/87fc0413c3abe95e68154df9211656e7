Two police reservists were shot dead, while two others sustained injuries after suspected Pokot bandits attacked the Kapedo Catholic church on Sunday. Area chief Mercy Asmit said the police reservists had been hired to provide security during a mass at the church. "The church hired four police reservists to provide them with security." "Unfortunately, the bandits who were hiding in the church compound ambushed them, shot two dead and injured one man on the leg," she said. Asmit said the bandits managed to make away with two rifles belonging to the reservists. The suspected Pokot bandits had tried ambush students headed to fetch water at Kapedo on Saturday, an incident where a boy, 13, was shot in the hand. "We want security personnel to intensify patrols as the fresh attacks may escalate and lead to many casualties." "We are under siege at the moment as we cannot travel to Marigat town in Baringo to buy food supplies or to Lokori in Turkana," the chief said. "The bandits are targeting vehicles carrying food supplies to Kapedo."
