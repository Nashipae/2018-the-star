Saboti MP Caleb Amisi yesterday promised to table a Bill in Parliament requiring the state to set up a social protection fund for unemployed youth. “I know the government is capable of creating jobs. The Bill gives the state two options, either to hire the youth or give them a stipend,” he said. Amisi said young people are vulnerable and can easily be swayed to join criminal gangs. He spoke at Tuwan Girls Secondary School where he unveiled a website for the constituency. “All information on jobs and scholarships will be posted on the website. Unemployed youth should apply for advertised vacancies,” he said The MP warned youth against falling prey to fraudsters who ask for money in the pretence of offering jobs. He said they would vet advertisements to ensure people are not conned over non-existence jobs. Amisi told the youth not to be selective. Preferred jobs may not be available, but young people should learn to be flexible. The MP promised to be a referee for every youth who applies for a job. Saboti residents will also be able to access information on services, bursary funds, agriculture, education and developments projects on the website, Amisi said. CEO of Elite group of companies Arafat Ikumu pledged to hire some youth.
