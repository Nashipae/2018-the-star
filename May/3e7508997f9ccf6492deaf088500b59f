Senator Gideon Moi has appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta to crack the whip on the cartels behind National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) maize scandal. In a statement, the Baringo legislator said "Kenyans cannot watch the farmers crying while cartels smile away with billions of shillings." "The President should now hold to account all those who are culpable of the maize scandal," Moi said reiterating that farmers should not suffer because of the cartels that benefited through unscrupulous ways. He said this is the only way the government can restore its faith to the common Kenyan. "It will be manifested clearly that President Uhuru is serious in the fight against corruption if he deals with the maize cartels attempting to soil his administration's name," the Senator added. He said the corrupt individuals where threatening to derail president Kenyatta's Big Four agenda and aimed at leaving behind a lasting legacy at the end of his tenure. "Now that reports confirming our fears have been tabled in parliamentary committees, I besiege the president to move faster and address the matter and pay the genuine farmers their dues." He further said as investigations are being carried out to establish those culpable, he requested the President to ensure that his government sorts out the genuine farmers and release their payments. "For months, we as leaders from Rift Valley have raised issues over the manner in which farmers were suffering to sell their maize, receive payments and release of the governmentâ€™s subsidised fertiliser," he said. He said the government through Agricultural Finance Corporation should also consider extending the grace period for the genuine farmers who took loans and are servicing until such a time when NCPB and the National Treasury finishes processing the payments.
