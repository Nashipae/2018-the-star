The panel kicked out lawyer Nicholas Nyamai, who appeared in the session, on behalf of the directors. Senators ordered the Sergent-at-Arms to eject Nyamai. The panel said it had invited the directors and not a representative. Nyamai attempted to table the court order, but was pushed him out of the committee room. “This is a disorderly person who shouts at the chair. We do not want to wrestle in the mud because you want to reduce us to that level. I order the Sergent-at-Arms to eject the gentleman,” Kajwang’ said. As he was being whisked away, Nyamai said, “Chair, before you throw me out, I want to serve you with a court order. You should also listen to me. I must serve the court order then you eject us”. The committee had invited Francis Mburu (managing director) and directors Justin Mburu and Mark Mburu of the two firms.
