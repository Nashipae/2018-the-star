Kisii county government yesterday launched a headcount of employees to weed out ghost workers. The administration says it will help cut the wage bill, as a large percentage of revenue in the county is used to pay salaries. Governor James Ongwae said the staff audit will also establish if dead workers’ names are still on the payroll. He spoke at his office where he launched the drive. Deputy Governor Joash Maangi and county commissioner Godfrey Kigochi were present. The governor, deputy governor, executives, chief officers and heads of departments will not be exempted, Ongwae said. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has raised concern over the high number of employees in the counties. Ongwae said his administration wants to know if there are people who have reached retirement age, but are still on a salary. However, he said there are no plans to stop their salaries. Employees’ qualifications will be evaluated to see if they match the work they do, he said. The governor said depending on the assessment, workers who merit will be promoted. Ongwae said workers with questionable papers must explain how they obtained them, he said.  GAUGE COMPETENCY After the headcount, employees will be trained to enhance delivery of services, the county head said. “Residents should not look at this negatively. We mean well for the county. We want to gauge the ability of staff and encourage people to work hard. The people have given us a mandate, we don’t want to let them down,” he said. Kigochi said the national and county governments will continue working in harmony for the sake of development. Ongwae later launched the 2km Makutano-Getare road. He said it would help decongest Kisii town.
