Public Service and Youth Affairs PS Lillian Mbogo-Omollo has surrendered to the police amid the crackdown on masterminds of the Sh9 billion NYS scandal. She surrendered to the DCI headquarters in Kiambu accompanied by her lawyers. This was after DCI officers who went to her Kitisuru home where she refused to leave the house demanding the presence of her lawyers. On Friday, the PS told the National Assembly's Public Accounts Committee that the auditor general's 2016/17 report did not flag off fraudulent transactions. "The loss of Sh9 billion as alleged would mean that NYS is technically closed," she told MPs then. The PS surrendered hours after detectives arrested NYS director general Richard Dubai, deputy director Sam Michuki, and senior finance managers at the agency. Police said they have 17 people in custody following a mass swoop on the suspected masterminds of the graft. They are Ndubai, Michuki, Peter Muchui, Matano Odoyo, James Thuita Nderitu - a businessman, Yvonne Wanjiku Ngugi - a businesswoman, Sammy Mbugua, Timothy Kiplangat Rotich, Wellanalo Mulupi, David Kirui, Ferdinard Matavo, Keziah Mwangi, Duba Galgalo, and Isaiah Adalo Chopia.
