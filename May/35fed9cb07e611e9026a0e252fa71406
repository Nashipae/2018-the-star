The wrangles in the Kenya National Union of Teachers have hampered remittance to branches. National Executive Council member Dan Aloo yesterday told branches to brace themselves for â€‹a financial dry spell. He said deputy secretary general Hesbon Otieno’s team failed to remove SG Wilson Sossion as a signatory to the union’s bank accounts. “Knut accounts are now inactive, as no money can be withdrawn without the signature of Sossion, [acting chairman] Wycliff Omucheyi and [national treasurer] John Matiang’i,” Aloo said. Sossion and Omucheyi are involved in a tussle. Sossion says Omucheyi is behind the push to have him removed from office, a claim Omucheyi denies. Aloo said Otieno’s plan to impose himself as a signatory is illegal. “â€‹Standard procedures about removing the name of a person from a joint account require a consent letter from the person or a death certificate. Sossion has yet to consent,” he told the Star on the phone. â€‹â€‹Aloo backed Sossion. He said the ODM-nominated MP is in office legally and a court order protects him. A group of NEC members wants Otieno to take over. The faction says Sossion is biased and does not serve teachers’ interests. Aloo disagrees. â€‹“â€‹â€‹â€‹Whatever is going on is illegal. One is innocent until proved guilty,” he said.
