Thika MP Patrick Wainaina has dismissed calls for a referendum, saying it’s a waste of public resources. The legislator said it is selfish for politicians to call for a referendum to create positions in government at the taxpayers expense. Th country’s economy is yet to stabilise following the prolonged electioneering period, Wainaina said. Opposition leader Raila Odinga last week proposed the adoption of a three-tier government to enhance devolution. He made the statement in Kakamega during the Devolution Conference.
