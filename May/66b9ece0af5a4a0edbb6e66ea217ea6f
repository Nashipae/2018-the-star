Baringo Senator Gideon Moi does not pose a serious threat to Deputy President William Ruto’s 2022 presidential ambitions. Nandi Governor Stephen Sang says this is since DP Ruto is strong nationally. He said Ruto’s feud with Gideon will not in any way weaken the DP’s plans to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta. “As a region, we stand with Ruto and we see no threat in those being used to undermine him. The DP also enjoys support countrywide,” Sang said on Sunday in Mosoriot. Tinderet MP Julius Melly said on Sunday the Kalenjin community fully backs Ruto and will ignore rivals being used by outsiders to divide them. “There is no way people not known in the entire Rift Valley will challenge the strength and following that Ruto has in many parts of the country,” the MP said. Sang and Melly, who were speaking at separate functions in Nandi, said wrangles in Rift Valley were being instigated by external forces to make Kenyans think the DP is weak in the region. Meanwhile, Kesses MP Swarrup Mishra said the obsession with 2022 politics is derailing development programmes in many regions. He said although the handshake between President Uhuru and Nasa leader Raila Odinga was welcomed to help unite the country, it had kicked off too much politics and caused leaders to deviate from the development agenda. “It’s less than a year since we finished elections, yet it’s like we have another election soon. We need to get back on track and focus on development matters,” he said. Click here for the latest political news
