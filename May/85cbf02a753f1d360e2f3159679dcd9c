Woman representatives want the National Government Affirmative Action Fund allocation increased. They said on Saturday that the NGAAF allocation of Sh6.5 million they receive every financial year cannot sustain residents’ needs. The women spoke at Wangunyu Primary School, Kiambu, during the opening of Mamacare Recovery Centre. Gathoni Wamuchomba of Kiambu is patron of the centre. The legislators included Catherine Waruguru of Laikipia, Lydia Haika of Taita Taveta and Elgeyo Marakwet’s Jane Chebaibai. They urged MPs to support their request in Parliament. Wamuchomba said they support women’s groups, the elderly and people living with disability. “We urge the government not to ignore our request. We don’t want society to misunderstand us,” she said. Waruguru said some counties have a lot of constituencies and others have few, but the MPs get more than Sh100 million for the CDF. “A woman representative who has only Sh6 million is surrounded by five MPs, who have Sh100 million, which translates to Sh500 million. We need NGAAF management to support our projects and analyse what we are talking about,” she said.
