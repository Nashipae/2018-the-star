Word has been going around that Harmonize is dating a Kenyan gospel artiste, and it was rumored to be Nicah. Last year on April 1, Mpasho published the screenshots of Nicah (who had just parted ways with Ofweneke) flirting with Harmonize. We called her yesterday for comment and she denied all the claims, saying she has never met the Tanzanian singer but they just talk on social media. After the phone call, we were convinced that there was nothing between the two, only for a source close to Nicah to burst the bubble. According to our source, she has been dating Harmonize for quite some time, and she is currently expecting a baby by him. One month to be exact. We called her for comment and she denied that she was pregnant by the singer before hanging up. “I’m not pregnant! And I
don’t want to talk more about this,” she said. Considering that she is a gospel artiste, she is expected by society to live a Christian life. Having a baby out of marriage is frowned on by the Bible. Just as Nicah was coming up as a gospel artiste, she opened up, saying life had become too hard for her that she opted to become a barmaid, a housegirl or a prostitute.
