The ongoing rain has disrupted many
activities around the country, not least of which is education. Many schools in
flood-hit areas have closed while in other cases individual students have been
forced to miss classes because of the vagaries of the precarious weather. Some schools remain inaccessible while others
have been turned into camps for displaced people. In other cases teachers
cannot reach their workstations. In other parts of the country, however,
learning has continued with minimal or no disruption at all since schools
opened on April 30. The disparities in the learning environment
will have far-reaching consequences on the learners when they sit their exams.
Despite the hardships learners in flooded areas are going through, the Kenya
National Examination Council will assume candidates had equal opportunity to
cover the syllabus and prepare adequately for exams. But this is certainly not the case. Many
students have lost valuable class time. How will they recover it? The Education ministry ought to address this matter urgently. The solutions should not add to the burden of the parent who is already strained by the vengeance of nature and the strained economic circumstances.Â  Now is the time for the Education ministry to draw up
remedial arrangements for learners who will certainly be disadvantaged in national
exams that are highly competitive.
