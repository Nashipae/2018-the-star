Kenya Defence Forces women’s volleyball team will make their debut at the 19th World Inter-Military Championship set for May 26 to June 4 in Canada. KDF qualified for the championship after they won the East African Community Games title in Bujumbura, Burundi last on their debut. The team, under the stewardship of former national team setter and Nairobi branch gender vice chairman, Alisha Aliwa, will start their week-long indoor training sessions at the Makande Hall, Mombasa next Tuesday. The Kenya Volleyball Federation national league newcomers will again train for another week at the Kasarani indoor before their scheduled travel on May 23. Team manager, Alfred Ruto, acknowledged the event as one of the kind and remained positive of a good show. Ruto said this will be the first time the team from the Defence Forces will feature in tournament of such calibre and said they intend to make a good account of themselves. “For the two weeks, we will have 18 players in the camp and the technical bench will pick the final squad of 14 players who will travel. Therefore it’s upon the players to prove their worth. Our sponsors are committed to ensure we have good preparations and we are thankfully,” said the official who was recently elected KVF committee member. “If our performance at the recently concluded KVF second leg in Bomet County is anything to by, then we are sure of a good show in Canada. At the same time, we will be seeking to pick lessons here and there for the sake of our league campaign.” KDF recorded win against DCI before they saw off Kenya Pipeline ‘B’ 3-0 in the Bomet County Open tournament. They however, succumbed to Kenya Pipeline 3-2 in the semi-finals of the tournament. The official was, however, wary of the winter season in Canada. “We are aware of the weather in Canada and we hope the few days we will be there prior to the event, will help us acclimatise,” said Ruto.
