Former IEBC commissioner Paul Kurgat has been linked to Sh186.6 million lost by the Foreign Affair ministry when he served as Kenya’s ambassador to Russia. The ministry wants the IEBC to stop any payment to Kurgat, pending the outcome of investigations into the theft. The National Assembly Public Accounts Committee, chaired by Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi, and a ministry team are probing. Auditor General Edward Ouko’s report for 2015-16 revealed loss of public funds in the ministry. The report says there was financial impropriety relating to overpayment of foreign service allowances to officers in the mission in Moscow amounting to Sh8.5 million and a possible loss of Sh178.1 million.

Kurgat served as ambassador from August 11, 2010 to December 21, 2015. On April 16, IEBC vice chairperson Consolata Maina led Kurgat and Margaret Mwachanya in quitting the commission as divisions boiled over.
