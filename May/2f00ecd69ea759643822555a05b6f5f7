The government on Saturday distributed relief food to more than 3,000 flood victims in Lamu. Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa distributed 560 bags of rice to families displaced by floods in Chalaluma, Moa, Dide Waride and Witu villages. Most of the families are living in camps after their homes were flooded. Several schools have also been flooded in the region. Wamalwa said the government will support for all flood victims countrywide. He said they had put in place measures to mitigate floods. “We have made arrangements for humanitarian aid for all the affected families. The government will ensure they live their normal lives despite the floods," Wamalwa said in Chalaluma. The CS said they will use KDF and police helicopters to supply aid to areas that can't be accessed by road. “Their is no cause for worry. We shall reach everyone," he said. Wamalwa asked those living in vulnerable areas to move to safer regions to avoid further disaster. Last week, the government set up a camp for victims at Nagele in Witu after the Red Cross failed to reach families marooned by floods. By Saturday, no victims had arrived at the camp. The aid agency said they were unable to navigate flood waters. Wamalwa asked the victims to report to the camp for assistance. The CS was accompanied by the ministry's Chief Administrative Secretary Hussein Dado, Lamu Deputy Governor Abdulhakim Aboud and Woman Representative Ruweida Obbo. "I'm glad the ministry has responded to our request for aid," Obbo said. She said they had written to Wamalwa asking for assistance to those affected by floods. "We are the voices of our people especially in times of need," the MP said.
