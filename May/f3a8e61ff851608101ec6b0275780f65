There is little that can be said any more in defence of the country against its global ranking as the bastion of corruption in the world. The scandals popping out of every state and semi-state corporation clearly show that corruption is a byword for Kenya’s public service. The NYS scandal, maize scam and the wanton pilferage revealed in the internal audit at the Kenya Power and Lighting Company amount to pure rape of our motherland. Let’s face it: The main incentive for people joining public service in Kenya today is the opportunity to steal or peddle influence. How else do you explain the craving by people who are worth millions to take up modestly paying jobs in the public sector? We must call this by its correct name — a national disaster. And someone must halt this, even if it is at great personal or political risk. And that person is the President. Nothing done in the name of development — Big Four or Building Bridges — will leave a lasting legacy unless the immoral theft of public resources is halted. We believe the President has set the right tenor for clamping down on corruption. The institutions for enforcing the law are in place. Now he must issue an ultimatum to those who have been implicated or are involved in this plunder to step down, and demand their merciless prosecution.
