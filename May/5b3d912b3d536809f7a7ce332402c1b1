Kenyan taxpayers will cough up to
Sh45.1 billion  in state officers' gratuity in the year starting
July, a figure that is expected to rise to Sh58 billion in 2020. With the country’s population
currently in the margins of 45 million people, it means that each Kenyan will
have to pay Sh1000 to thank civil servants, MPs and military existing workforce. According to 2018/19 budget summary, Treasury projects gratuity to state officers will rise by Sh20 billion from the current Sh37.7 billion to Sh57.8 billion in 2020. The gratuity is in addition to increased monthly pension that is expected to rise from current
Sh33.8 billion to 40.8 billion next year. The figure will rise by 106 per cent
to Sh68.3 billion in 2020. Cumulatively, taxpayers are expected to shoulder a public pension bill of Sh86.2 billion next year up from the current Sh71.8 billion. Treasury projects the figure to grew to Sh126.4 billion in the next four years. This is expected to exert more
pressure on the country’s ballooning wage bill that has since forced Treasury
to trim development budget for the coming year by Sh40.8
billion, defying persistent warning by International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cut
on recurrent expenditure. Kenya’s wage bill has been
increasing since 2013 from Sh465 billion to Sh627 billion in 2015/16
and Sh650 billion in the current financial year. It is expected to grow further
in the coming financial year. While Kenya's appetite for recurrent expenditure has been on upwards trend, it is not matching revenue collection. According to Economic Survey 2018, KRA is likely to miss its revenue collection target by a wider margin in the current financial year. It has been given a target of Sh1.68 trillion in the year starting July 1. It remains to be seen how the country will manage its Sh2.5 trillion budget with a deficit of 5.7 per cent of GDP, service its huge public debt that reached 4.5 trillion in October lest year as well as fund President Uhuru Kenyatta's Big Four budget of Sh460 billion.
