Embu Woman Representative Jane Wanjuki has urged residents to stop hiding women who suffer from urinary incontinence. Urinary incontinence refers to the loss of bladder control, leading to uncontrolled leakage of urine. Its severity ranges from leaking urine when one sneezes or coughs to having a strong and sudden urge to pass water. Wanjuki said many families have patients suffering from this condition but hide them at home “to avoid shame”. “These are our sisters, mothers and grandmothers who should be helped to lead normal and dignified lives, instead of having them remain at home to be taken care of by other family members,” she said. Wanjuki spoke on Monday during a stopover in Mbeere North. She distributed relief food to victims of the drought that preceded the ongoing rains. Wanjuki urged urinary incontinence patients to seek help. Some patients cannot afford treatment and helplessly watch the condition determine their fate, she said. Wanjuki urged chiefs and assistant chiefs to trace women with the condition for treatment. She said confining patients undermines nation building because family members have to take care of them, instead of engaging in productive economic activities. The legislator also warned parents against keeping their disabled children, including the mentally challenged, at home. She urged parents to liaise with her office for help so the children can be enroled in schools.
