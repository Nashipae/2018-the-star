A 24-year-old woman who was jailed 15 years for having sex with a 16-year-old boy in Kisumu has appealed the judgement. Judith Wandera was on Wednesday found guilty of defilement and performing an indecent act with a minor. She admitted having a sexual relationship with the boy saying she didn't know he was a minor. In a notice of appeal, Wandera, through her lawyer, says she is dissatisfied with principal magistrate Joan Wambilyanga's ruling. "The appellant intends to appeal to the High court of Kenya against the whole of the said judgement," reads the notice signed by Dome and Kedogo Advocates. The particular offence occurred on July 15, 2017, at Kicomi area in Kisumu county. In her decision, Wambliyanga found that it was not in dispute that the accused person and complainant knew each other and also had sexual intercourse a couple of times. The court had to, therefore, determine whether the complainant was defiled and whether the accused person knew that the complainant was a minor. The other question before the court was whether the case had been proven to the required standards. Wandera, in her sworn affidavit, stated that she met the said boy at a nightclub in Kisumu where he bought her drink. She said that from there, they developed a relationship and that she even realised that the complainant was operating a boda boda. The woman said that one could not tell that the complainant was minor by looking at him. Wandera, however, asked the court for forgiveness saying she has a son, a brother and a mother to take care of. "I am the breadwinner of the family. Please forgive me. I will never repeat the offence again," she pleaded with the judge. However, the magistrate sentenced her to 15 years in jail, allowing her 14 days to file an appeal.
