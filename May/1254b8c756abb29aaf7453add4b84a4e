The Kamba community is ready to join Government, Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana has said. The Wiper Party chairman was speaking at Kwakathoka Agricultural Training Center on Friday when he hosted Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa who had visited to distribute relief food to persons affected by floods in the county. "Go and tell Uhuru (President) that we are knocking, we want to be in the government. We are willing to join other Kenyans who want to take this country forward," Kibwana told the CS. He said the party had discussed with its leader Kalonzo Musyoka so that the community joins the government. "We know that 2022 is not that far, and so we don't want again to be locked out of the government," he said. Kibwana said the region has been underdeveloped because the leaders have been in opposition for la ong time. "Even though all Kenyans are entitled to be served equally by the government, we know those who are closer are easily reachable," the former presidential advisor said. However, Kibwana urged  his party leader Kalonzo Musyoka  to be a man of his own. "Kalonzo should now move foward without depending on anybody. But I will be keen by virtue of my experience in politics to help him join the leadership that will be after Uhuru's term," Kibwana said. Wamalwa welcomed the idea saying Kenyans needed to be united for the sake of development. He said there was only one government in place that was dedicated to serving all Kenyans. "Let us forget the past and join hands to fulfill the four agendas set out by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Unity is the only way we will be able to eradication property and fight hunger in this country," he said. Click here for the latest political news
