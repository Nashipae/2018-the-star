Nairobi county government has denied claims reported by a section of the media that there are plans to import ten doctors from India. This came at a time Interior CS Fred Matiang'i raising concerns over the number of foreigners taking up local jobs. Health CEC Hitan Majevdia, in a statement on Friday, denied having called a press conference or talked to the media over the matter. "Following some media reports that the county government plans to import doctors from India, I wish to categorically state that this is not the position of Nairobi county government."

There is no need to outsource more doctors," Majevdia said. In March, there was a public uproar when Governor Mike Sonko invited Indian doctors to conduct a kidney transplant at Mbagathi hospital. The first transplant is yet to be done at the hospital due to paperwork problem. The governor had then announced that the lead surgeons from India will train local doctors so that they can carry on with the operations. In another facet of doctor importation, the national government will spend at least Sh470 million annually on salaries on 100 Cuban doctors.
