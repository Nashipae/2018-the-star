Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri has urged leaders supporting President Uhuru Kenyatta not to allow politics to eclipse his development agenda. Speaking in Wamagana in Tetu, Nyeri county yesterday Kiunjuri urged them to instead balance politics with development. He reminded them that voters will judge them based on their development record come 2022. “If you spend most of your time politicking, even the little work you have done will not be noticed,” he said. “In the fifth year, as usual, we will come back to you and tell you to gauge our development projects. If there is somebody to be credited, then they should be re-elected,” he added. Tetu MP James Gichuhi also called on politicians to shelve the 2022 succession political debate and concentrate on working for Kenyans. He said president Uhuru will give political direction in 2021. “We must give the president and our leaders time to deliver. We cannot be talking issues of politics from the first year to the last year,” Gichuhi said.
