Kenya’s plan to increase forest cover to 10 per cent by 2022 now hangs in balance following a shortage of tree seedlings. Acting Kenya Forest Service chief conservator Monica Kalenda yesterday told the Star on the phone the 25 million seedlings it had in nurseries have been exhausted. KFS is now appealing for help from the private sector. “Private nurseries had 120 million seedlings that have been planted. We are satisfied with the progress, but that is not enough,” she said.

Kenya’s forest cover stands at 7.4 per cent of the total land area. This falls short of the recommended global minimum of 10 per cent. Illegal logging of indigenous trees threatens Kenya’s forests. On the other hand, Kenya’s closed canopy forest cover currently stands at about 2 percent of the total land area, compared to the African average of 9.3 per cent and a world average of 21.4 per cent. In recent years, Kenya’s forests have been depleted at an alarming rate of about 5,000 hectares a year. This is estimated to lead to an annual reduction in water availability of approximately 62 million cubic metres. If not addressed urgently, the depletion has the potential to roll back strides towards achieving Vision 2030 and the state’s Big Four agenda. They include food and nutritional security, affordable and decent housing, universal healthcare and manufacturing.
