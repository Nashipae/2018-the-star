Kwale Woman Representative Zuleikha Juma has urged schoolgirls to focus on their studies and avoid romantic relationships. She said this will help the girls avoid early pregnancies. “People like Kwale governor’s wife Christine Mvurya and Gender PS Safina Kwekwe, Kwale Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani are good examples of the importance of a girl’s education,” Juma said on Sunday. She spoke at Bang’a Primary School when she distributed sanitary towels to girls (pictured). The Woman Rep said she will ensure equal distribution of sanitary towels to targetted girls as mandated by the President. “All girls from Standard Six to Form One in government schools will be getting pads every month for the next five years. My task is to ensure all beneficiaries get the pads as planned,” Juma said.
