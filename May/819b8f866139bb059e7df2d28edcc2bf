The Kenya Association of Tour Operators (KATO) has expressed its concern over the high number of foreign operators in the industry. KATO said most of the foreigners are from Asian countries. According to KATO CEO Fred Kaigua, weak policies by the government had given the foreign tour operators the leeway to work in the country. Kaigua said the government had allowed full ownership of companies involved in the tour business unlike in other counties. He said the laws had even allowed them to register one director in a company noting that it was not the best for the industry. “You cannot allow 100 per cent ownership of companies to foreigners and it does not even happen in our neighbouring countries”. Kaigua was speaking to the press during a stakeholders conference on tourism opportunities in counties at Sawela Lodge in Naivasha. He at the same time said the sector has grown by 30 per cent this year compared to last year. Kaigua said the sector looked bright with the recent handshake by the President and opposition leader contributing to the growth. “Some have reported an increase in the number of bookings of up to 50 per cent, however, this may change; we are looking at a sector that has already picked up”. His sentiments were echoed by Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui who said they will work together with the Kenya Tourism Board and other stakeholders in order to market Kenya as the best destination in Africa. “We should also seek ways on training all those involved across the value chain to ensure that we reap the benefits of tourism in totality”.
