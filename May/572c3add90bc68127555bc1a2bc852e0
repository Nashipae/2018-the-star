The Kenya National Examinations Council has warned parents and candidates against fraudsters selling materials purported to be genuine 2018 KCPE and KCSE papers. Acting chief executive officer Mercy Karogo said unscrupulous people out to fleece parents and candidates are already selling fake examination papers. “Parents are advised not to fall prey to schemes used by unscrupulous people to fleece unsuspecting Kenyans,” Karogo said in a statement yesterday. The chief executive officer said the council’s preparation for the forthcoming exams is on track, adding a multi-agency approach of administration of the exams will be scaled-up.

Karogo said all measures have been put in place to ensure credible examinations. Cases of cheating in both KCPE and KCSE have declined in the last two years following strict measures employed by Knec and the Ministry of Education in the administration of the exams. In last year’s exam, KCSE results for 10 schools, affecting 1,205 candidates, were withheld following suspected cases of malpractice. About 40 teachers were involved in the malpractice. Knec chairman George Magoha said 11 students were found with mobile phones and nine others with unauthorized materials in examination rooms.
