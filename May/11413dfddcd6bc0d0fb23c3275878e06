Three million textbooks are stuck in publishing houses after distribution was halted due to heavy rain. The books were bought by the government under the textbook distribution policy and are to be distributed by publishers. At least 34 million books are to be distributed to schools before next month when phase one of the exercise ends. Speaking to the Star yesterday, Kenya Publishers Association chairman Lawrence Njagi said parts of Rift Valley and northern Kenya were the most affected. He said 28 million textbooks have been published. “The rains have caused logistical challenges. Roads have been cut-off ,” Njagi said. The publishers had contracted the Postal Corporation of Kenya to deliver the books to primary and secondary schools. The first phase consisted of sciences, mathematics and languages. Textbooks for social sciences and religious education will be published in the second phase. “Publishing is ongoing after the second phase was commissioned a week ago,’’ Njagi said. The books are for students in primary and secondary schools. Read: Book distribution to continue despite multiple errors, says PS Click here for the latest political news
