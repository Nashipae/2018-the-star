Ekirapa said the new approach of giving residents oversight powers should put an end to complaints. Contractors have complained about political interference and lack of cooperation from residents. “We always follow the Bill of Quantity to the letter. There is a misconception among residents and leaders who lack technical know-how. The only person who understands us is the roads engineer,” one contractor said. “We are always on the receiving end with hardly any support from any quarter. Road engineers who understand us cannot raise objections when we are being lambasted for fear of losing their jobs.”
