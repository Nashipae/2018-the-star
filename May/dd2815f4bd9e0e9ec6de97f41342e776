Two Garissa subcounties have been cut off after roads were destroyed by heavy rains. Transportation of essential supplies, food and drugs to Ijara and Hulugho subcounties has been disrupted. Schools have reopened for second term but classes are yet to begin as most teachers are stranded in Masalani and Garissa town. Two bus companies, Kilas Express and Dek Express, have suspended trips from Garissa to Masalani, Ijara and Hulugho since the rains started one month ago. The teachers are hiring Land Cruisers for Sh2,000 to travel to Hulugho. The trip usually costs Sh500 from Masalani and Sh800 from Garissa town. The road from Wema in Garsen to Masalani and Hulugho has been submerged after the River Tana burst its banks and destroyed crops and farmland. Meanwhile, residents of Bothai, Hulugho, have appealed for relief food and drugs after their homes were submerged. “Our leaders should visit flooded areas and see for themselves how dire our situation is,” Abdikadir Sheikh from Hulugho said. Garissa operation and security officer Abdi Rashid promised to conduct a needs assessment with Kenya Red Cross Society officials. Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa two weeks ago toured Garissa and promised national government assistance to all flood victims.
