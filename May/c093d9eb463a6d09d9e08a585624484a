Tanzanian star Jacqueline Wolper is about to launch her business in Kenya. The House of Stylish CEO is in the country ahead of the launch of her fashion house later this year. “Kenya is my second home, that’s why I’m here, for the sake of my fans who have been struggling to reach me in Tanzania. I’m here as I plan on how and where my business will be located.” Wolper, who commands more than three millions followers on social media, says she started off as a hawker. “I carried things on my back looking for customers from place to place. It wasn’t easy. I struggled to be where I am. I worked hard. Later, I got into acting bongo movies courtesy of the late Steven Kanumba. I later went back to my dream of designing the best clothes.” Adding “You should be aware of the many people that claim to be me on Facebook. I have no Facebook account and when I get one, I will let you know.” So, what is the current situation with ex-boyfriend Harmonize? “Rajab [Harmonize] and I are done. I have moved on but I know he still loves me. I don’t love him back. He is just my ex. Forget all the things he has posted about me on social media.” “About his current girlfriend Sarah, I don’t have any problem or beef with her.” Wolper refused to comment on Kanumba’s death. “The late Kanumba and Elizabeth Micheal know what happened. As a believer I’ll just say God knows the truth.”
