NCBDA chairman Timothy Muriuki has said he will pursue justice after a gang, suspected to be hired goons, on Monday disrupted his press conference. Muriuki spoke today, a day after Police placed a Sh500,000 bounty on each of the five suspects recorded on camera assaulting him. “No amount of intimidation shall make me negotiate or back off in my quest for justice following the assault meted out on me on the material day in reference,” Muriuki said on Sunday in a statement addressed to Sonko. The suspected hired goons alleged that Muriuki had organized the press briefing to mudsling Governor Mike Sonko’s administration. Sonko has however distanced himself from the five.
