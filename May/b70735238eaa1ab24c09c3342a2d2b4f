The rains will stop in the last week of this month in most parts of the country. Northern and southeastern Kenya will be first to go dry as early as next week. This region comprises Garissa, Wajir, Mandera, Kitui, Machakos, Makueni, Tana River and Taita Taveta counties. Head of meteorological services director Peter Ambenje said Central Kenya and southern parts of central Rift Valley will go dry in the third to fourth week of May. This region consists of Nairobi, Nyandarua, Embu, Nyeri, Murang’a, Kiambu, Kirinyaga, Meru and Tharaka Nithi counties. Others are Narok, Kajiado and Magadi counties. “May marks the cessation of the long rains for the north western, northeastern and southeastern parts of the country," Ambenje said. But until the various cessation times, heavy showers will pound the whole country and could exceed the average amount for May in some places. In Western, Rift Valley highlands and parts of the Coast, heavy rains will continue into June. Ambenje said there will be improved water availability this month, leading to large prospects for crop and livestock. “The situation is, however, likely to improve in the agriculturally high-potential areas of Kitale, Eldoret, Kakamega, Kericho, Kisii and Nandi Hills. Near-average to above-average rainfall is forecast and also expected to continue into the June-July-August period,” he said. Ambenje said parts of Western Kenya might still experience flooding and lightning strikes. An assessment for April showed the rainfall was characterised by heavy storms in most parts of Kenya.
