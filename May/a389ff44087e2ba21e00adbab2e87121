Kenya’s Bornes Kitur and Olympic bronze medallist Galen Rupp are the winners of the 2018 Prague Marathon. Kitur won in a personal best time of 2:24:19 while Rupp also improved on his personal best to 2:06:07. Kitur, the 2017 Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon winner, beat Ethiopian duo of Belaynesh Oljira and Amane Gobena to second and third places in respective times of 2:25:12 and 2:27:43. Jepkirui ran a well calculated first half of the race to take leadership from Amane Gobena of Ethiopia who had crossed the 25km marker in 1:24.40. Rupp, the Boston Marathon champion was almost a minute ahead of Ethiopian Sisay Lemma (2:07.02) while Kenyan Stephen Chelemany was a further back in 2:09.42 for third. Chelamany ran the first 15km behind the chasing pack at his own pace before joining the leading pack of six steered by Chicago Marathon champion Galen Rupp near the 20km marker which they cruised past in 1:07.45. Rupp took over from the pacemaker after the 25 km marker though the Ethiopian (Sisay Lemma) followed him for second place as Chelamany dropped 20 seconds off to the back heading for third place. Lemma challenged Rupp and took leadership briefly after the 30km which they passed in 1:29:47. Meanwhile, the IAAF has announced the creation of IAAF Run 24:1, a series of 24 one-mile runs that will be contested around the world to celebrate Global Running Day on June 6. Partnering with sports ministries, city governments, race organisers and member federations around the world, the IAAF initiative incorporates races to be held in two dozen cities across 15 time zones that will each start at the same local time to create a ‘simultaneous’ worldwide celebration of running. IAAF Run 24:1 will commence in Auckland, New Zealand, then, cross Oceania to Sydney, enter Asia in Tokyo, move to Europe in Minsk, into Africa in Addis Ababa, and cross the Atlantic to the Americas in Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires before the day’s final race in Vancouver on Canada’s west coast. In all, IAAF Run 24:1 will include stops in 23 countries, uniting tens of thousands of runners around the world.
