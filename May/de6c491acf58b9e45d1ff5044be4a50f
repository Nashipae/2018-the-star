The Ministry of Health will develop a teachers' handbook to improve the level of awareness on menstruation hygiene. Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki revealed this in her message for the Menstruation Hygiene Day marked on Monday. The topic is already incorporated into the new school curriculum, but there was no teachers guide. The ministry has now engaged various experts from Unicef, NGOs, and the private sector to develop the National Menstrual Hygiene Management Policy and Strategy. "Since its inception, the national initiative of free sanitary towel distribution has reached more than 11 million primary schools," Sicily said. "Most recently, the First Lady Margaret Kenyatta launched the Menstrual Health Management Programme with support from the Red Cross. All 47 county governments and the County First Ladies Association have committed to allocate Sh500,000 to address menstrual hygiene," she said. She spoke amid concerns that many countries, including Kenya, do not educate girls when they get their first period. This is because menstruation is often viewed as a sign of maturity meaning girls have reached a potentially marriageable or child bearing age. "With the momentum increasing in Kenya, more practical, holistic and cost-effective solutions should be realised by involving different ministries, multi-sectoral partners, private sectors and civil society from national, county to community level," Sicily said. She called upon all Kenyans to engage and actively participate in the initiative. Click here for the latest political news
