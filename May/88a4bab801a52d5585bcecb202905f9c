The Health ministry will kick off a one-week polio vaccination campaign in Nairobi next week. The exercise follows the recent case of a rare strand of polio discovered in sewage samples in Eastleigh Estate. The campaign targets all children under five years. It will run from May 9 to 12. The discovery came as a major blow to the country. It has dashed Kenya’s hopes of being declared polio-free this year by the World Health Organization. “As you may be aware, the Ministry of Health plans to conduct a polio campaign after the detection of polio virus by our surveillance team within the sewerage system of Nairobi, hence posing a risk of disease transmission to our children,” a statement to newsrooms read. “There’s not a single case of polio transmission among our children, but we remain vigilant on the potential risk of infection.” The ministry said the dangers are because of regular crossborder movements of people from Kenya to neighbouring countries currently experiencing polio transmission. The campaign will ensure our children remain polio-free.” Last week, the government called upon medical practitioners to be on high alert to respond swiftly in case of emergency.
