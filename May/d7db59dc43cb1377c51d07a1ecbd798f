In the bustling busy madness of a large megacity like Nairobi, it is so easy to become overwhelmed with some of the multiple issues and events constantly happening. Overload happens and people behave in ways that are definitely not normal. I call this the “busy buzz” syndrome. We all get infected with “Busy Buzz” syndrome at times. The cure remedy I often take is not ingested through the mouth, but rather through the eyes, nose, ears and touch, as our natural senses are influenced by experiencing the created wonders of nature. I then choose to let go and experience the flora and fauna around me, so that my innermost being is touched supernaturally, especially when I ask God for peace, joy and love. I call the cure remedy my “ Bush Buzz”. The Nairobi National Park is situated near the city, allowing people to “escape” quite easily to this living green cathedral. There are times when I slow down to look for the really small things, or just sit quietly at a place of beauty. I am often rewarded with unusual and special sightings. A while ago I sat quietly at the East gate and watched as sunbirds and bees gathered nectar from aloe flowers right next to me. It was fascinating to watch how bees can control flight with such tiny wings. Remember this, “when we look for the smallest, we also see the largest”, from bees to buffalos, and so on. Bring your family and come explore the wonders of the Nairobi National Park. It is so special when you come to the park with a serious case of “Busy Buzz”, and return home with the warm healing feeling of the “Bush Buzz”. It’s definitely a Soul Tonic.  The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00. For more information, visit www.kws.org or www.nairobigreenline.org
