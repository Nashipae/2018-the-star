The 100 Cuban doctors will arrive in the country on June 7, 2018. Health CS Sicily Kariuki said the arrival date was arrived at after a MoU was signed last week between them and the council of governors. They were slated to arrive in the country today. Once in the country, each county will get at least two specialists. Counties are expected to cater for their housing and transportation costs to and from the hospitals. The plan to import the doctors has received a lot of criticism from the doctors union who argue that the government should employ local jobless doctors.

Health CS Sicily Kariuki, the council of governors, Directorate of Immigration and the attorney general are the respondents of the case.
