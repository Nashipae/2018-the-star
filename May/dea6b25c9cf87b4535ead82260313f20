Nairobi Governor Sonko calls for immediate arrest of suspended county legal officer Violet Oyagi. The governor wants her held over 'misleading information' about Nairobi Metropolitan Authority. This followed a matter filed in court on Thursday where Nairobi county has opposed the creation of the transport authority. Sonko has sworn an affidavit to denounce the same and has asked his legal team to speedily follow up the matter. Oyagi was among the 15 county members who were suspended in October 2017 over a land grabbing syndicate. Among those on suspension are lawyers Nyagara Nyamweya, Evans Mogire, John Ombogi, Legal Services Director Karisa Iha and principal counsel Newton Mungai. In the case, Sonko is purported to have called for the disbandment of the authority set up by President Uhuru Kenyatta on grounds it is unconstitutional. Uhuru ratified the entity through an Executive
Order in February 2017, to deal with challenges affecting the transport
industry. Popularly known as NAMATA, the team was to
oversee the implementation of the Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS)
project covering Nairobi, Kiambu, Kajiado, Machakos and Murang’a
counties. Its creation followed the signing of an MoU
between Transport CS and governors of Nairobi, Kajiado, Kiambu, Murang’a
and Machakos way back in October 2014. However, the suit papers in question showed that Sonko wanted the body done away with as his administration is yet to be formally notified of any agreement. The governor wants the police to conduct a probe on how the suit, which he has denounced, was filed.
