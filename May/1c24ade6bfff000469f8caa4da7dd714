Kisumu Senator Fred Outa has hinted at plans to reward Opposition leader Raila Odinga with a plum job following the handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta. He said it would be difficult for Raila to criss-cross Kenya preaching peace and reconciliation without operating from a specific government position. “I support the handshake and I can assure you that something is cooking,” Outa said. Raila, he said, can only advocate peace after being offered a job. Outa said business is booming in Kisumu since the handshake and potential investors are planning to set up businesses in the lake region. “The handshake will ensure the ugly incidents where our youths were killed after elections are stopped,” he said. Outa said Kisumu bore the brunt of police brutality and deaths. The senator spoke yesterday on Mayienga FM during a morning talk show. He asked party supporters to allow Raila to explore avenues that will have a trickle effect to all Kenyans.
