Dagoretti High School teams won both the U-16 and U-19 semis to romp into the final of Dagoretti Sub-County Games finals at Lenana School. The school’s U-19 side hammered Lenana 4-0 to book a final berth against Hidden Talent. The latter eliminated Dagoretti Mixed 2-0 in the other penultimate fixture to progress. The U16 finals will pit Dagoretti High and hosts Lenana School. Dagoretti High floored their neighbours Dagoretti Mixed 2-0 in the first semis to cruise to the finals, while Lenana School junior team knocked out a stubborn Ruthimitu Mixed 9-8 in post-match penalties after a 2-2 regulation time stalemate. “We had equally worthy opponents but the team’s tenacity gave us advantage. Dagoretti Mixed and Lenana School got formidable sides and we can’t afford to underrate them,” team coach Joseph Makokha noted. In Kibra sub-county games, national U-19 holders, Upper Hill thumped Silver Spring 2-0 as Shadrack Kimalel edged St. Nicholas 1-0. The U-16 tie between hosts Upper Hill and Olympic Mixed (boys’ team) ended in a barren draw after both teams squandered chances. Meanwhile, Kenya Secondary School Sports Association (KSSSA) signed a three-year deal worth Sh21.5m with Coca Cola towards Term 2 games. This year’s national games will be held at Hill School, Eldoret in July.
