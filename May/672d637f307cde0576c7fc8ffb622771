The National Government Affirmative Action has disbursed Sh10 million bursary funds to about 1,400 students in Homa Bay county. The funds were channelled through the office of the Homa Bay Woman Representative, Gladys Wanga. Speaking at the distribution of cheques, Wanga said out of those who received the money, 1,200 are secondary school students, while 200 students will join vocational training centres. The 200 students got full scholarships. The legislator said the money was fairly distributed throughout the county. “We selected 18 beneficiaries in each of the 40 wards for the secondary school programme and three to five beneficiaries for the vocational training programme,” Wanga said. The students in the vocational training programme will pursue courses in welding, masonry, tailoring, motorcycle repair, solar panel installation and textile making. Wanga said her office partnered with the National Industrial Training Authority (NITA) to enable students acquire skills. They will be taken to Nita branches in Kisumu, Athi River and Nairobi. Wanga added, “We want to uplift the economy of our people. The 200 students will start their courses on May 8.” Click here for the latest political news
