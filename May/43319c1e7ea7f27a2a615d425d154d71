Three Cabinet Secretaries stormed JKIA on Thursday morning for an inspection amid concerns of "security breaches" at the facility. CSs James Macharia (Transport), Fred Matiang'i (Interior), and Najib Balala (Tourism) checked in at the airport unannounced. Matiang'i told journalists the inspection was in line Kenya's preparations for direct US flights starting October this year. The CS said they had been instructed by President Uhuru Kenyatta to "take a more proactive and focused attention towards finalising the direct flights plan." "We are here in line with that directive to ensure that security is also enhanced and operations of our airports across the country," he said. Balala said their visit was intended to ensure that JKIA is transformed into a seamless airport that is responsive to customer care. He said this is their third impromptu visit at the airport that has seen some services raised to international standards. "We have seen commendable improvement especially at the Immigration department," the Cabinet Secretary said. "We have had some challenges at KRA's customs department and they have agreed to address them amicably." Balala said a clear green and red signage channels which will be used to guide customers will be installed at the airport. Their visit came amid concerns of security breaches at the airport, the situation which prompted IG Joseph Boinnet's tour in February. The police chief led a group of top security officers to investigate the breach which is said could trigger a downgrade of the airport’s Category 1 international status. It had been reported that senior managers at the terminal had been exposed in a security gap linked to an award of a lucrative cargo slot. KAA managers got furious after one of the dailies revealed that a local carrier was running unchecked operations in its miraa exports to Somalia. Following the exposÃ©, KAA temporarily closed air-side access to the Jetways facility to allow for investigations. Corporate Communications Manager Angela Tilitei said: "We in KAA take safety and security seriously." "We wish to assure the public that we take all the concerns with the importance they deserve."
