Lugari MP Ayub Savula has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta not to use constitutional amendments to extend his rule after 2022. Savula said that he supports constitutional amendments to expand the executive but it should be done for posterity and not to appease certain individuals or communities. "We have seen Uganda President Yoweri Museveni and Congo’s Laurent Kabila amend the law to remove term limits. Rawanda’s Pierre Nkurunzinza and Tanzania’s John Magufuli are contemplating following suite. We hope our President will not take us that route because Kenyans will not accept it," he said.
