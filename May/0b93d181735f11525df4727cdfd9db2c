The family of the woman who died in an accident allegedly caused by Pastor James Ng’ang’a of Neno Evangelism Centre three years ago plans to appeal his acquittal. Mercy Njeri’s family, however, said it will first listen to the full ruling, expected to be read by chief magistrate Godfrey Oduor at the Limuru law courts today at 9am. Oduor on Friday acquitted Ng’ang’a, driver Simon Kuria and police officers Christopher Nzioka and Patrick Baya. He was making a ruling on whether they had a case to answer. Oduor said the prosecution failed to produce enough evidence to convict the four. Njeri’s family said it has waited for the ruling for long, but the date had been adjourned for six times. It was alleged that Ng’ang’a’s Range Rover Sport KCD 060Q was being driven carelessly on August 26, 2015, causing Njeri’s death. The vehicle collided head-on with a Nissan March, registration KBZ 709W, at Manguo, Limuru. Kuria and Nzioka had been accused of giving false information to police. Baya, who was Tigoni police station base commander, faced a charge of neglecting his duties. Njeri’s family lawyer Kariuki Wanjiri said they will point out issues that led the magistrate to acquit the four, so they can appeal the ruling at the High Court. “This is unfortunate. We have been waiting for this ruling for a long time. The case was well-packaged. We would want to know what led the magistrate to acquit all before we move on, but their acquittal calls for an appeal,” he said. Njeri’s widower Martin Mbugua said he does not know if he will ever get justice for his late wife. Mbugua’s father Peter Ndung’u said the family is not contented with the ruling. “Does acquitting all accused persons mean my children faked the accident that killed my son’s wife? This is bad, we expected something else, not acquittal,” he said.
