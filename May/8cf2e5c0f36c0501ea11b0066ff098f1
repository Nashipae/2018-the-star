The crown prince of Benga music, Dan Aceda, has joined forces with the queen of viral urban hits, Fena Gitu, to unleash Bobea. Under the umbrella Tama Media, the talented duo worked on the second single off Dan Aceda's upcoming album, which is now available on all digital outlets. Bobea was co-written by Fena and Dan and allows the distinct personalities of both artistes to shine through. Speaking to Word Is, Dan said: "Fena is a very good musician and it was fun working with her. You know in any situation, uko kwa studio na mtu mdeadly, everything goes very easy. I really had a lot of fun ata naangalia kama tunaeza fanya ingine na yeye." Adding: “You should always work with people who make you better. Fena is such an amazing artiste. Versatility personified. There’s no better voice, better co-writer that this project could have found. I am honoured to have her on this track.” Fena said: “It was an honour to work with a living legend. It was a nice challenge working with a Benga maestro to bring him to the urban side.” Adding: “Bobea is about being proud of how far we have come after going though hurdles. For me, it has been about growing musically as an artiste. The song seeks to inspire young people to push to the limit. Zidi kubobea, trust in yourself and your craft.” The vocal performance of both artistes is superlative and unlocks a fresh new level of mash-up sound making, where two extremely talented people combine to create an unforgettable audio product. Bobea is a true collaboration.
