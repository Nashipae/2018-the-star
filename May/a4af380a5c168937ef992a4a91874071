Kenyan Premier League champions Gor Mahia will begin their SportPesa Super Cup title defence with a clash against Zanzibari side Jeshi La Kujenga Uchumi in the June 3-10 tournament. Gor edged out their bitter rivals AFC Leopards 3-0 to win the inaugural edition of the tournament before falling to English Premier League side Everton 2-1 in the tournament staged in Tanzania. Last year’s runners up, Leopards renew their rivalry with Tanzania’s Singida United, whom they trounced at last year’s quarterfinal stage. Debutants Kakamega Homeboyz and Kariobangi Sharks were handed tough opponents as they face Tanzanian giants Yanga and Simba respectively. The Tanzanian clubs flopped massively in last year’s edition despite enjoying home support and will return to the showpiece on a clean slate having wrapped up their league matches over the weekend as opposed to their opponents, who are in the middle of both league and Shield competitions. The winner of the tournament will jet out to play English side Everton at Goodison Park shortly after next month’s World Cup in Russia. The showpiece was initially set for Moi Stadium, Kasarani will now be held at the Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos since Nairobi facility is still undergoing renovations.
