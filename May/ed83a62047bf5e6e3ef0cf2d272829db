Today marks two months since the surprise handshake between President
Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga on the steps of Harambee House.
Their truce, hailed as an act of statesmanship, brought relief to the nation
and silenced the series of protests and bloody confrontations. But the promise of a united and quiet country going about
the urgent business of nation building envisaged by the handshake is slowly being
shattered with every passing day, thanks to many unanswered questions about the 'deal'. The majority of Kenyans, fatigued by persistent political brinkmanship,
who had hoped for immediate dividends from the peace deal, are now beginning to
cast doubts on the motives of the handshake. The détente between the two arch-rivals was
promoted as an opportunity for the country to rediscover itself, heal from the
post-election friction and spring forward towards reconciliation. Two months later, the novelty of the deal is now shorn of
its original sheen. There is no implementation plan and the principals remain
cagey about the finer details. Instead, ulterior motives are being ascribed to the deal, as
political machinations gain momentum. It behooves the two leaders to come clean
and provide the country a clear roadmap out of this new morass of
squabbling. Any further delay will be counterproductive to their own stated
mission of unifying the country. Quote of the Day: “If your work speaks for itself, don’t interrupt.” — American industrialist Henry J Kaiser was born on May 9, 1882.
