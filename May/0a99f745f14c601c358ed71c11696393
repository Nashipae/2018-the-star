Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa (pictured) has directed Kerio Valley Development Authority to consult widely before construction of the Sh32 billion Arror Dam in Elgeyo Marakwet begins. Residents have opposed the project, saying they were not consulted. Eugene asked KVDA managing director David Kimosop to listen to the grievances raised by residents. He spoke during a consultative meeting at the proposed site of the dam on Saturday. The dam is expected to provide water to irrigate 10,000 acres of dry land in Kerio Valley and generate 60MW of hydro-electric power. It is funded by the Italian government and will be implemented by the KVDA. Eugene told residents of Kipsaiya, where the mega dam will be put up, that they will be compensated adequately before the dam is built. The state will not forcibly acquire land, he said. The CS said the state plans to build similar dams in Kimwarer (Keiyo South) and Embobut (Marakwet East) for Sh28 billion and Sh30 billion, respectively. Ten residents were arrested last week for allegedly attacking an Italian citizen and KVDA officers who were on a tour of the proposed site in May 4. Elgeyo Marakwet county commissioner apologised to the Italian investors and told them they will have adequate security. However, Eugene urged security agencies to withdraw the charges against the suspects. Click here for the latest political news
