Six Jubilee MPs from Western Kenya have attacked ODM leader Raila Odinga as a dishonest and egocentric person. The Opposition leader has been using and dumping their community, they said on Sunday. MPs Mwambu Mabonga (Bumula), Emmanuel Wangwe (Navakholo), Dan Wanyama (Webuye West), John Waluke (Sirisia), Malulu Injendi (Malava) and Ben Sinali (Ikolomani) spoke at Kimaeti Catholic Church in Bumula constituency. They faulted Raila’s decision to replace Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula with James Orengo as the Senate Minority Leader. Waluke said the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila was not genuine. "We don’t trust the handshake. He wants to use it to manipulate the government and eventually benefit himself. He has never been a genuine person," Waluke said. Injendi asked Raila to stop creating discord in Jubilee and instead concentrate on his job. "He wants to create divisions between Uhuru and his deputy William Ruto for his own benefit. This time around the handshake won’t work if that was the mission," Injendi said. The MPs pledged their support for Ruto in the 2022 election. They dismissed Raila’s call for review of the Constitution saying he was its architect. "He is the one who spearheaded the 2010 Constitution and was very contented with it. What has changed that he wants amendments, if not to make himself relevant politically?" Wanyama said. Waluke said Ruto is looking forward to succeed Uhuru and nothing will stop him. "I urge the Western community to vote for Ruto. Raila can’t make it. He is a betrayer and a dishonest person at all. He is manipulating the Jubilee government to change the Constitution for his own selfish interests," Waluke said. Click here for the latest political news
