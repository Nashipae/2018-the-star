Farmers must test their soils to ascertain their fertility if food security is to be assured, a soil expert has said. Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization soil scientist David Kamau on Friday said, “Soil testing is one of the most important things farmers must embrace. We have been noticing a loss of soil organic matter and as soil is washed, it losses important nutrients.” Kamau made his remarks on the sidelines of the third annual National Potato Vonference and Trade Fair 2018.
