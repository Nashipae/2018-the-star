Seven people were killed on Friday following a head on collision accident near Kamukuywa bridge, Bungoma county. The accident occurred after a PSV matatu and tractor collided at Maliki, few kilometres to the bridge - infamous for accidents involving stationary tractors. This is the same spot where 14 people were killed last week.
