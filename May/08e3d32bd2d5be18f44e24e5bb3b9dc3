The government has urged farmers in 19 pyrethrum-growing counties to plant the cash crop. In a statement, Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe said they will help reclaim the lost markets of Europe, America, China and Australia. He said the state has injected Sh1.5 billion into the industry, as it wants Kenya to go back to its position of the best and largest producer of pyrethrum in the world. The PS said Kenya accounted for more than 70 per cent of global production in the 1980s and supported 200,000 small-scale growers and 3,000 workers. “But poor management, over-reliance on the international market, farmer level issues and competition led to decline in production,” Lesiyampe said.
