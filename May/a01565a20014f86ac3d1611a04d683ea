EALA legislator Simon Mbugua and two others will be charged on Wednesday over alleged links to goons who assaulted former NCBDA Chairman Timothy Muriuki. Mbugua, Antony Otieno alias Jamal Ombok and Benjamin Odhiambo alias Onyango were arrested on Tuesday afternoon and taken to Central police station where they spent the night. They will face charges of robbery with violence - the charge sheet states that Muriuki was injured and his Sh100,000 stolen. Via Twitter on Tuesday, lawyer Nelson Havi said: "There will be no evidence linking [the MP] to the crime for which he has been arrested. The IG should stop hoodwinking us and arrest the culprits seen in broad daylight, in respect of whom he offered a hefty bounty." The government placed a Sh2.5 million bounty on the five people who violently bundled Muriuki out of Hotel Boulevard on April 30. A press conference by the Nairobi Central Business District Association ended in disarray after a group of heavily built men stormed the venue and beat up the ex-chair. The men claimed he was a conman hired to tarnish Governor Mike Sonko's name but the statement he was to issue was in support of the county chief.

The Nairobi Assembly once accused Mbugua of running the show at City Hall by meddling in county affairs but Sonko defended him.
