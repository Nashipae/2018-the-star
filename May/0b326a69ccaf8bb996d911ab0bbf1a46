Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi has urged wrangling MCAs to put aside their differences and deliver. He spoke in Wajir town yesterday after launching the county integrated strategic urban spatial development plan. Abdi instructed Majority leader Hussein Yaqub, also the chairman the assembly planning committee, to ensure the plan is adopted. Once it is endorsed, the county will benefit from Sh50 million from the World Bank. The cash will be used to implement programmes as the county gears up for municipality status. That will entitle it to government money. Abdi says long-standing differences among ward reps is undermining the running of county affairs. Residents are not interested in sideshows, they want services, Abdi said. The governor is fighting to keep his seat after the High Court overturned his victory. Abdi moved to the Supreme Court. The Mandera County Assembly has been adjourned four times since the beginning of the year because of conflicts. Last week some MCAs threw punches after speaker Ibrahim Yaqub told the assembly to discuss anything except formation of the Public Service Board. Reps hurled water bottles at him, forcing orderlies to whisk him away to safety. The furious MCAs vowed to move to court if he did not name the members of the board. The assembly is expected to resume on May 24. Click here for the latest political news
