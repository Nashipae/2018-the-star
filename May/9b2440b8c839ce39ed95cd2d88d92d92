Kenya Volleyball Federation (FKF) Nairobi branch has lined up a series of tournaments after two years of inactivity. Moses Mbuthia, the new branch chairman, said Nairobi is home to a majority of national league teams and has an abundant of upcoming players hence it is not good to have lull. He said he is planning a number of tournaments in a bid to bring to life back to the city. To set the programme rolling will be the Savlon League, Dan Wanyama Cup and Chairman’s Trophy. “We already have plans in place to harness resources of the branch and that of its members including primary and secondary schools alongside universities as we seek to revive volleyball. In addition to the tournaments, we want to introduce beach volleyball in Nairobi,” said Mbuthia who also serves as Nairobi Secondary Schools Sports Association’s secretary general. “This branch host over 70 per cent of national league teams and we can not afford to be dormant. We will require our member clubs to participate in branch activities,” added Mbuthia. Savlon League has in the last eight years offered a platform for players from academies, secondary schools, universities and estate teams to gain exposure. From this tournament players have secured scholarships to High School and university, while others have gained employment with league clubs.
