The Supreme Court has dismissed an appeal by the Kenya Wildlife Service and ordered it to compensate Rift Valley Agricultural Contractors Ltd Sh31.5m for crops damaged by wild animals. Supreme Court judges Mohammed Ibrahim, Jackton Ojwang, Smokin Wanjala, Njoki Ndung’u and Isaac Lenaola on Friday upheld the ruling of the Court of Appeal dated October 10, 2014. They ruled that KWS, as a government body mandated to look after wildlife, is responsible for damages caused by the animals. “For the avoidance of doubt, the judgement of the High Court delivered on July 27, 2011, awarding the respondent Sh31,500,000 is hereby affirmed and each party will bear its own costs,” Lenaola said. In its appeal, KWS said the government, being the owner of the wildlife, would be the suitable party to bear liability for damage caused by wildlife, instead of KWS. “It follows, therefore, that though the government would ideally be expected to have control of the wildlife, factually it was KWS which had the duty of control of the wildlife by dint of Section 3A of the Wildlife Act. Consequently, the liability for the damage occasioned falls on it,” Lenaola said. Between March and June 2000, wild animals from the M7asai Mara Game Reserve entered one of the respondent’s farms in Olkirianie location, Ololunga division in Narok district and damaged crops valued at Sh64,160,130. In 2000, Rift Valley Agricultural Contractors Ltd moved to the High Court in Nakuru and sued KWS, arguing it was negligent and thus liable for the damages caused by the animals. KWS told the Supreme Court the animals moved because of drought and migration, thus an ‘act of God’. The Supreme Court judges concurred with the Court of Appeal that the ‘act of God’ claim was inapplicable in the case as migration of wildlife is an annual occurrence, hence, foreseeable.
