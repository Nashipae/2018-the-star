Kenyans Gabriel Ochieng and Consolata Musanga claimed international Universal Boxing Organization (UBO) belts in sweat and blood-filled bouts during ‘The Awakening Boxing’ tournament held at the Impala grounds, Nairobi. The 11 fights lined up in the Saturday night event registered seven technical knockouts, three unanimous wins and a draw. Ochieng contested for the vacant UBO bantamweight belt where as Musanga contested for the female lightweight title with both winning their titles on TKO. Ochieng took charge from the onset as he dished out heavy and on-target punches over his Tanzanian opponent Ramadhan Kumbele. However, the thriller was short-lived as the bout lasted only 36 seconds as Kumbele was knocked down (face first) by Ochieng. Though he would have wished for a much tougher fight, the jubilant Ochieng attributed his victory to the strategy he mooted alongside his coach. “Our plan worked well. But I took advantage of my opponent’s erratic movements to attack, and did that effectively from the onset. I now hold an international title and I’m happy,” intimated Ochieng on his 18th career win. Musanga, on the other hand,  had a little longer fight, though it did not last the intended six rounds. With the International lightweight title belt on the line, the hard-hitting Musanga was merciless against her Tanzanian opponent Rehema Abdallah. After the opening round, Abdallah’s resilience could not hold much as Musanga sent her to the canvas within two minutes of the second round. Also winning through TKO were — Daniel Wanyonyi, who beat Tanzanian Jacob Maganga (Super middle) in the opening round; Aziz Kolombo, who floored Uganda’s Charles Kakande (Cruiser weight) in the fifth round; and Pardeep Kharera (India), who scored victory against George Owano in second round of the Super welter.
