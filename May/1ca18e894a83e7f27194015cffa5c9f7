Leaders and educationists in Wajir have raised concern over the rising number of children marriage. They have blamed poverty, illiteracy and retrogressive cultural practices. In the last one year, 15 girls have been rescued from early marriages. Wajir Girls’ Secondary School principal Hamaru Sylvano said this year alone they have enrolled four girls rescued from early marriage in Form One. In an interview at her office, Sylvano said due to limited resources, most parents prefer to educate boys and marry off their girls or have them help their mothers with the house chores. “This is a really a worrying trend that poses a  very big threat to the education of the girl. Some of the students do not know the girls were rescued from early marriage stigma,” she said. “We prefer to keep it a secret for fear of stigmatising those rescued. They might be ridiculed or turned into a laughing stock.” In a separate interview with the Star, Woman Representative Fatuma Gedi said many girls are victims of early marriage. “Despite the concerted efforts from different stakeholders, we still have parents who still practice the repressive cultural practice secretly,” she said. “We all need to pull our efforts together and ensure that no girl is denied her right to education.” Gedi urged parents whose daughters give birth while in school to give them a second chance so that they can complete their studies, saying education is the only key to success.
