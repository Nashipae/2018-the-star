Former Kenya Pipeline MD Ezekiel Komen and four others accused of defrauding a widow will know on June 15 if they go to prison. Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi fixed the judgement date yesterday after the defence completed its submissions. Komen is charged alongside former district commissioner Benjamin Rotich, former Uasin Gishu land registrar Tom Chepkwesi and businessman Benjamin Kuto. They denied the charge of conspiracy to defraud Ane Nyongio of 477 acres in Uasin Gishu. Rotich was also charged with abuse of office. He was the chairman of the Moiben land control board, which authorised illegal subdivision and transfer of the disputed plot. He admitted that his wife, Magdalene Rotich, and their house girl, only identified as Selina, were each allocated three five-acre plots. “My wife was allocated the plots after paying the required amounts of money,” Rotich said. Rotich was involved in the allocation since he was the DC and chairman of land board.
