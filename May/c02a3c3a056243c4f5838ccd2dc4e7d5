The Supreme Court has temporarily suspended Appellate Court’s decision to uphold the nullification of Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi’s election. In its ruling on Thursday, the apex court ruled that the governor should remain in office pending the hearing of an appeal he has filed against the decision. Led by Chief Justice David Maraga, the court said the decision is to avert a situation where the office of the governor will fall vacant pending the hearing of the case. “It is averred that the Governor’s office is destined to fall vacant and to be occupied by the holder of the Office of the Speaker, on account of delay in hearing the applicants case on the merits disposing of it,” the judges ruled.

The status quo shall not be disturbed pending the hearing and determination of the matter pending before the Supreme Court.” High Court Judge Alfred Mabeya nullified Abdi’s win on January 12 saying he was not validly elected because he lacked the required academic qualifications for him to hold the office. By law, one must be a holder of a degree from a University recognized in Kenya to be allowed to vie for governor seat. The petition was filed by former Wajir governor Ahmed Abdullahi. Abdi was also slapped with a Sh 2 million fine in costs. Unsatisfied with the decision, the governor moved to the Appeals Court where he argued that the High Court misinterpreted laws and ignored crucial evidence in nullifying his election. However, on April 20, the Appeals court upheld the High Court decision to nullify his election. He moved to the Supreme Court on April 23.
