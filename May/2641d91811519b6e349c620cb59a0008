It’s not long since Eric Omondi’s naked swim stunt landed him in trouble. Some will argue he was just trying to be funny, while others will say he simply wanted to ignite a problematic online conversation. Well, what we know is that he actually achieved both of these and a whole lot more attention. The stunt didn’t sit well with his fans and critics, and he already had an apology written down. Hopefully, he was forgiven for it or maybe the internet just forgot about it, but the truth is he really needed to stay focused and continue creating. Looking at his social network feeds, he has been hard at work redeeming his image. He knows and understands that he needs to get back from the setback caused by his swimming clips. A few weeks ago, he attempted to fill the 60,000-seater Kasarani Stadium when he hosted “Untamed 11”, but only managed to get a fairly large crowd. This could have been an effect of his Instagram post or maybe he was just being too ambitious. Truly, there’s nothing wrong with dreaming big, and at least he managed to pull a sizeable crowd. Eric Omondi has always been a comical thrill ever since he was brought in to the spotlight by Churchill. He is probably the most progressive Kenyan comedian ever. He has done it all, from stand-up comedy to music parodies. His YouTube channel offers a variety to enjoy and have a serious laugh. It’s a good thing he has gone past the entire episode and continued to thrill and make the country a happy place. He continues his stadium tour around the country and we expect he will continue to pull large crowds. Moving forward, if he promises to remain out of trouble, greater things are destined to come his way.
