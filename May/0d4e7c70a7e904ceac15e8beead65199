Magutu MCA Pauline Wanjira yesterday denied reports that she was drinking in a bar when she was attacked in Arusha. She said some people are circulating false information that she was drinking when a fight broke out between her and a male colleague from Nyeri. MCAs were attending a training in Arusha when the violence occurred on May 14. The MCA told a Nyeri MP to stop spreading rumours about the incident. She spoke to the media at the Nyeri county assembly in the company of other women MCAs. Wanjira said the lawmaker should have listened to both sides. She said it is wrong for him to visit media houses with a false version. “I was not in a bar. It was around 7:30pm to 8pm. We were having supper together when a disagreement arose. We were all sleeping in one hotel,” she said. Wanjira said they were having a discussion about the new Nyeri deputy governor when the debate degenerated into a fight. She suffered injuries on her eye, face and hand. Her colleagues said there are better ways of sorting out differences instead of resorting to physical confrontation. The MCAs condemned the attack on Wanjira and demanded that justice be served. They asked why Nyeri Woman Representative Rahab Mukami has remained silent on the matter. Nominated MCA Rose Wairimu said since the incident was reported, no action has been taken against the suspect. “It is normal for people to disagree, but disputes can be settled without someone being harmed,” she said. Wairimu said violence aganst women is increasing and authorities need to act swiftly on the case.
