Some Kalenjin elders and youths met in Eldoret and
endorsed Baringo Senator Gideon Moi to vie for President in 2022. The elders said Gideon, like DP William Ruto, had the right
to vie for the top seat. “Those who are doubting and thinking otherwise
should be aware we have given Gideon Moi our
blessings to vie for the presidency. It's not a preserve for Ruto or anyone else,” one of the elders, Yusuf Keittany, said. Read: MPs bash Gideon Moi over thwarted DP Ruto Kabarak mission Other elders and youth leaders at the meeting
included Daniel Chebwai, Phillemon Lel, Paul Kibet and David
Chepsiror. They were drawn from Uasin Gishu, Baringo, Trans Nzoia, Nandi and
Elgeyo Marakwet. The elders condemned the actions of Ruto allies,  who turned the burial of former MP Grace Kipchoim into a forum to
attack Gideon. “They should not have turned the burial in to a
political forum to hit at Gideon, if indeed they went there to mourn,” Chebwai said. Kibet and Chepsiror said the allies of the DP 
should also respect retired President Daniel Moi and stop dragging his name into " cheap 2022 succession politics". Kibet said it was wrong for Ruto and his allies
to politicise the failed trip to see Moi in Kabarak last week. More: Leave my father out of politics, Gideon tells Ruto supporters over aborted Kabarak visit
