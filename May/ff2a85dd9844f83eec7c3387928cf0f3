Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago (pictured) has introduced a biometric system to register workers and monitor their performance. All county employees will be required to clock in and out in the system meant to curb absenteeism. Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno launched the system in Eldoret yesterday, saying it is not meant to harass workers. “Society is leaning towards technology,” Chemno said. Acting ICT chief officer Titus Kimaiyo said the system is integrated with the payroll and registers staff working hours. Public service management acting chief officer Irene Kapting’ei said soon the county will compensate staff working overtime with leave days. Data from the system will be used in appraisals and promotions. Seven kits will be set up at the county headquarters, social hall, county yard, county commissioner’s office, Environment office and the county hospital. Mandago has said he will prioritise service delivery and completion of projects in his second term. He warned that he will sack lazy county staff. The governor said he has suspended foreign travels to focus on delivering campaign promises. Mandago has not travelled abroad in four months, unlike his first term when he made four foreign trips in the first four months
