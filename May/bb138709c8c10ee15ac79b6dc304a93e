Popular comedy show Varshita!, led by lead actor Eve D’souza (Varshita) and Maqbul Mohammend (Donnovan), has grown to become one of the most popular shows, appealing to viewers of all ages. The Varshita! cast held a meet-and-greet on Saturday, drawing children and adults alike, who were excited to meet the actors. The comedy show brings to fore the problems of interracial marriages, coupled by the traditional and cultural clashes that exist between an Indian and African family that find themselves in a situation that proves difficult to untangle. The Bhatts, an Indian family, and the Wangombe’s, discover that their children Varshita and Donnovan have been secretly dating for 10 years, even as the Bhatt family has been planning a traditional wedding for their daughter to another Indian family. The situations the couple and their families find themselves in make for a crazy but usually hilarious comedy that depicts a crazy, pathetic and tragic relationship of two lovers who find themselves in an unexplained love affair. The family event saw over 400 viewers and fans of Varshita! spend an afternoon with the full cast, which also includes Sanaipei Tande (Eva). Over 100 children who were in attendance had their faces painted and took part in outdoor games. All guests got a chance to take pictures with their favourite cast members and have them autographed.
