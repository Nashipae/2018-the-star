Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko wants a judge to recuse herself from hearing an application filed by a city MCA against him over the loss of Sh1.7 billion through irregular procurement of health services for staff. Makongeni MCA Peter Imwatok accused the governor of sanctioning the illegal payments. When the matter came up for a mention at the Anti-Corruption Court on Friday, the governor raised a preliminary objection, saying Justice Hedwig Ong’udi has no “jurisdiction” to entertain the application. “This court, with all due respect, does not have the jurisdiction to hear this matter. We will be filing a preliminary objection as to why it should not hear this case,” Sonko’s lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui said. Justice Ong’udi directed Sonko’s lawyer to file his objection by May 7 and return to court on May 15 for hearing. The court will deal with the issue of jurisdiction first before turning to the main application that seeks that a compulsion order be issued against the county government for a comprehensive audit of its accounts.
