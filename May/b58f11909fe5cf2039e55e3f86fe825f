Kenya Ports Authority managing director Catherine Mturi-Wairi has been sent on a compulsory leave over incompetence. The decision was made by KPA board of directors, sitting during its 345th Special Meeting on Wednesday. The board noted with concern the last seven days the port of Mombasa has experienced a break down of systems of cargo evacuation. "This has led to serious systems congestion of the port," Michael Maina, one of the board's director said.

"The board observed that the above situation can only be explained by lack of effective leadership," said Maina. Transport PS Prof. Paul Maringa said the new MD is expected to resolve the challenge within two months. "Over the last seven days, we had over 22,000 containers at the yard. The MD could not explain this congestion," Maringa said. Maringa said he has been at the port since last week. He was on Sunday he was joined by Industrialisation CS Adan Mohammed and on Monday East African Affair CS Peter Munya to try and unearth the problem.
