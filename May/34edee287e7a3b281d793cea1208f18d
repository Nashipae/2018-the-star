Mother to Bongo star Diamond Platnumz has spoken up for the first time about allegations that she blocked and unfollowed her son on social media. Sanura Kassim, aka Mama Dangote, has taken this step days after she beat up the singer’s baby mama, Hamisa Mobetto. When asked about this, she didn’t deny the allegations. Mama Diamond said: “Unaweza kweli kumlock mwanao? Ama unaweza kutokuwasiliana na mwanao? Hayo ni mambo tu ya kawaida, tushazizoea.” She then revealed that Zari is currently receiving child support from Diamond. “Kama hangekua anawasiliana na watoto hangekua anapeleka huduma (child support), na mimi kila time nawasiliana nao.”
