Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet has rewarded 29 police officers in Merti, Isiolo county, for thwarting a terror attack. The officers were feted for a operation in February, which led to the killing of a terror suspect and recovery of heavy artillery that was destined for Nairobi. Boinnet presented the distinguished service awards to the officers during a ceremony at Merti Police Division and Sub-county Headquarters on Sunday. "Let's all remain alert and heighten vigilance in the wake of an elevated risk of terror attacks," the IG said at the event.
