Five people have died and 70 others hospitalized following an outbreak of a mysterious disease in Kerio Valley, along the border of Baringo and Elgeyo-Marakwet Counties. The patients are complaining of abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea and are being treated at the AIC Lodengo Kolowa in Tiaty Sub-county. “We get an average of five and seven patients a day, some are discharged on the same day while we admit those who are serious,” the dispensary nurse-in-charge Clara Lotuw told the Star on Friday.

She said that children, expectant mothers and the elderly are the most affected. “The number of patients was growing as more are streaming in every day all with similar symptoms,” she said. Area leaders let by Tiaty MP William Kamket urged the government to urgently address the outbreak. “If five people are dead already, it means the situation is so serious and needs to be addressed before worsening,” Kamket said. He was backed by Kolowa Ward Representative Solomon Makal and Tirioko counterpart Sam Louren.  Click here for the latest political news
