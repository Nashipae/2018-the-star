 The United Democratic Party has joined the push for review of the Constitution to make governance more inclusive. Party leader Cyrus Jirongo told the Star yesterday that the current law is exclusively for two individuals ­— President and Deputy President —but not inclusive of all Kenyans. Jirongo said the law must be amended to expand the executive to add the positions of Prime Minister and two deputies. “In the past, the law served us well because ministers were politicians. But now, it is a two-man affair,” he said on the phone. Jirongo said individuals opposing law change were not doing so in the interest of Kenyans but personal gains. The former MP run for President in the election last year.
