Services at the Kenyatta National Hospital have been affected for 48 hours following a power blackout. Head of Communications Simon Ithae said the blackout was caused  by flooding at the power room, causing an electric short circuit. Patients complained about slow services and long queues. One client said, “I had taken a patient at 6.30am, only to be attended to at 9.30am. The problem was at the cash point, but I’m glad the systems are up, though still slow.” The hospital has four generators for the Newborn  Unit, ICU, cancer care treatment, labour ward and radiology. The departments affected by the blackout were outpatient casualty, accident and emergency unit and the wards. Click here for the latest political news
