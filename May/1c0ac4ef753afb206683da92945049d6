The 2006 Commonwealth Games 10,000m champion, Lucy Kabuu, was yesterday named the Goldenscape Trees Africa Marathon brand ambassador ahead of their inaugural 10Km run this weekend in Nyeri County. The initiative is in line with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s appeal to Kenyans to plant trees with an aim of increasing the country’s forest cover. Kabuu, who clocked 2:27:02 to win the 2018 Milano Marathon in Italy, said she decided to support the initiative since clean air provides perfect training conditions for athletes. “I am honoured to be part of this initiative because it’s a worthy cause. It will set up a good climate for our athletes. Being a role model, I would also like to identify and nurture talent in the entire central region. Participating in this race will give me an opportunity to interact with them,” said Kabuu. The campaign will see Kenyans plant at least 7 million trees in all the 47 counties. The race will be flagged off by the Nyeri CEC for Agriculture, Fredrick Kinyua at the DO’s office in Ruring’u. The route will then cover Tetu Farmers, KNA Owalo, Thuta, Micha, Old Gatitu Road, Gwa Chaba, Ithenguri, Chorong’i, Gatirini, Kiamwathi Empowerment Center and end at Kamukunji Stadium. There will also be a 6km race as well as a fun run. Winners of the 10km race (men and women) will each pocket Sh50,000 while runners up and second runners up will take home Sh25,000 and Sh10,000 respectively. Goldenscape chief executive, Peter Wangai, said the race will be taken to the rest of the counties. “Through Goldenscape Trees Africa, we will teach young people on tree investments in every county, targeting to employ about five million youths,” Wangai said. The organisers have so far planted about 5 million trees in the country.
