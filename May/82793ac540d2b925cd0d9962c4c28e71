Muli is no stranger to trolls online and offline.Â Speaking to Word Is, she said it irks her when
people are so wicked and say things that are nasty even to people
they do not know. "I
come from a background of bullying even when I was a small girl in
school. When somebody says something bad about me, it comes from a very
personal place in me. It is always an instinct to react because I grew
up fighting bullies and I am not gonna take that as an adult. "When I
speak up, I always speak up for every other girl that is getting bullied
or even a woman who is pushed in whatever way by a partner or a
colleague at work who is male."
