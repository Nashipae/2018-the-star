Angry residents of Watamu on Saturday burned two luxurious villas belonging to two Italians after a tycoon demolished their restaurants due to a land dispute. One villa was owned by a journalist while the other belonged to a former Italian minister. Trouble started after a hired gang raided Watamu landing site beach and destroyed the residentsâ€™ restaurants at 5am. Protesters lit bonfires and blocked roads leading to the Watamu landing site. They engaged police in running battles for more than three hours. Police officers used teargas to disperse the furious protesters. During the commotion, a group of youth is reported to have burnt down the villas. There were no guests at the time of the incident. When journalists arrived at the scene, protesters were demanding that the county and national government intervene. They wondered why the tycoon wanted to acquire the property, which is a public access beach. Amina Sudi, who owned one of the destroyed restaurants with her husband, said she lost Sh1 million property. A weeping Sudi said many Watamu residents have been rendered jobless. Their source on livelihooh had been destroyed, she said. Another resident, Abdi Shosi, said the area was designated as a landing site. Click here for the latest political news
