A Sh200 million college built last year has enrolled only six students since it became operational in January this year. Gatanga MP Joseph Nduati said the Gatanga Technical Institute cost Sh100 million to put up, while another Sh100 million was spent on new equipment. Nduati said he will mobilise local administrators to inform residents about the facility and the courses offered. He said it is unfortunate that many youths prefer non-technical courses, even though the technical institute enrols even standard eight drop-outs. “Youths do not know that technical work is readily available and well-paying if they are well trained, instead of waiting for white-collar jobs, which are mostly not forthcoming,” the MP said. He spoke on Wednesday at Ithanga market while issuing bursary cheques worth Sh14 million to secondary school, tertiary and university students. Nduati noted that most major buildings in the country are built by diploma graduates in technical courses. He urged parents not to let their children continue idling at home and instead enrol them in the technical institute to gain skills in plumbing, carpentry, welding, mechanic, and other technical courses. “What these youths do not know is most of the people who have technical skills are paid an average figure of Sh1,000 per day in construction works,” Nduati said. He said some national and international contractors are forced to import technical labour due to shortage of such skills in Kenya. Nduati urged the government to consider changing the curriculum in technical institutes to make them more appealing to youths. He said there are more than 500,000 slots in technical institutes countrywide that youths are shunning.
