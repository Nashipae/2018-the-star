The body of
a man who drowned as he attempted to cross River Mon in Marakwet East on a motorbike was discovered on Monday. This brings the death toll in the area to five. The man
attempted to cross the swollen river on a motorcycle after heavy rains on
Sunday night. An unknown
number of animals were swept by raging floodwaters in the area two weeks ago. Silah Cherop, a resident, said the body was discovered near Kerio River on the Elgeyo
Marakwet-Baringo border on Monday. He said
vehicles plying the area have to wait until water levels reduce because there is no
bridge connecting the two regions. Marakwet
East Deputy County Commissioner Stephen Sangolo said locals and motorists have been asked not to cross swollen rivers. In Kuria East on Monday, more thanÂ 100 houses were swept after flash floods hit a village. The
most affected was Siabai village where spring waters overran homes, killed livestock and uncovered graves. "The affected people have been
forced to stay with their relatives in safer areas," Ntimaru East MCA Augustine Mwera said. During a tour of Siabai village, pressmen found Tobias Chacha re-burying his father after the coffin was pushed to the surface. The Red Cross team and officials from the county disaster management department visited the area to assess the effects of the floods.
