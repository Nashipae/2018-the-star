The Health ministry's decision to hire 100 specialist doctors from Cuba, though controversial, is commendable. Only 966 foreign doctors and dentists are licensed in Kenya, which has a severe shortage of professionals. But even as we praise the administration for strengthening healthcare by importing a few foreign experts, we must resolve the problem of more than 1,200 unemployed doctors, many of them fresh graduates. We urge the doctors' union to welcome the team from Havana and work hand-in-hand to ensure patients receive the best possible care. Cuban doctors will work in remote areas shunned by Kenyan professionals. The government is yet to explain how it will handle communication challenges when a Spanish-speaking doctor interviews a patient with only a smattering of English or Kiswahili. It defies common sense for every Cuban always to always have a translator in tow. Only four years ago, the government entered into a Sh38 billion medical equipment leasing scheme, however, much equipment has been gathering dust in counties as there are insufficient technicians. With healthcare at the heart of theBig Four agenda, every effort must be made to ensure health facilities have working equipment. It makes no sense to import experts who lack the equipment to do their job. Quote of the Day: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.
