Shortage of teachers is the biggest challenge facing most schools, parents have said in a survey by lobby group Twaweza. Forty per cent of parents said pre-primary level is the worst affected, 46 per cent said primary schools lack enough teachers.Thirty-five per cent said secondary schools suffered most.The study was carried out through a mobile phone survey between October and November, 2017. Victor Rateng of Sauti za Wananchi at Twaweza said citizens are engaged in education but focus more on homework and talking to teachers than on collective action to change the system.
