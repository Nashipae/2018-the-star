Media practitioner Tony Timase was not involved in any impropriety or rape as alleged on Saturday night. And the "college student" at the centre of the episode yesterday absolved him, terming the story as lies peddled by her former boyfriend. Speaking to Word Is yesterday, the lady known as Yasmeen said: "All those lies about me getting raped are being peddled by my ex boyfriend. I left him in March because he was abusive. This is not the first time he has threatened to embarrass me in public." But contacted, the ex-boyfriend identified as Collins Mwaura said, "She is here with her mother we are discussing this issue as a family." Yesterday, Tony told the Star he had only met the girl twice. "The first time was on Friday where we met for coffee and she spoke about being in an abusive relationship and planning to move out once her business kicks off," he told Word Is. He said the girl, introduced to her by a former workmate, wanted media contacts to help her build her business. Tony invited her to a house event attended by many media personalities last Saturday. An SMS from Yasmeen to Tony reads in part, "I just need to be in the limelight and she (Tony's workmate) told me you could help me." Tony says the second time we met her is when he invited her to "a friend's house where we were watching the UEFA finals on Saturday night." He showed the Mpesa message of the payment for the cab she used to go to the venue. The lady showed up at 8:33pm. "I introduced her to the media people present at the house because she needed the interaction for her business." Later on, at around 1am in the morning, together with his friend Jan Bosire, and Yasmeen, the TV anchor left for the former Kengeles in Nairobi West where they hang out till 2am before they each left separately. "She took a cab and left, alone," Tony said, a fact that was corroborated by Bosire.
