A voter has moved to court to challenge Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko's decision to nominate lawyer
Miguna Miguna as his deputy. In an urgent application, John Waigi Migwi claims
the nominee does not meet the relevant qualifications for
vetting and approval as deputy governor. Migwi said since
Miguna is not a Kenyan and a member of Jubilee Party, on which
Sonko was elected, he cannot be nominated as the deputy governor. "The said nominee is a member of a prescribed group
known as National Resistance Movement (NRM) which is an illegal movement that
works closely with the main opposition parties in Kenya and spends its time
antagonizing the policies of Jubilee party,”  court documents read in part. He wants the court to stop the county assembly from
vetting Miguna pending the hearing and determination of the case. He further arguers that Miguna being neither a Kenyan citizen nor a member of Jubilee party, hence do not meet the requirements.
