Hamisa Mobetto was given a beating by Diamond Platnumz's mother. It was the talk of town. The celebrity's mother Sanura Sandra, alias Mama Dangote, confirmed it. Mama Diamond says the video vixen disrespected her by spending the night at the mansion her son bought her. She and Diamond slept together that night. “Hayo mambo ya mzazi mwenzie ni huko, pale Madale ni kwangu na simtaki nyumbani kwangu kabisa. Yaani kiufupi simpendi na simtaki na kila akikanyaga hapa kwangu ni kipigo tu. Alipokuja kiwizi usiku ule na kulala nyumbani kwangu, alipaswa kuondoka kabla sijamuona kwa nini alisubiri mimi nimkute maana siku hiyo asubuhi yake nilitoka na nilivyorudi ndipo nikamkuta." All this time Diamond Platnumz was trying to separate the mother from further beating up Hamisa. Her wig was removed, prompting her to run with her shoes in her hand. In an interview with a Tanzanian-based Vlog, the singer's baby mama has spoken out for the first time after the beating. "Siwezi kuongelea swala hilo. I'm not a person that exposes so much of their private life out there. I can't confirm, I can't refuse. I'll just let it be," Hamisa said. "Huwezi kulazimisha mtu apende pilau wakati anapenda biryani. It's my life. Kila mtu ajali maisha yake. It's for me to know and for you to find out." Diamond has kept quiet over the whole issue, while sister Esma says the beef is only between Hamisa and the mother. Diamond has sired a baby boy Abdul Naseeb with the video vixen who is about to hit a year old in August. Hamisa, who is also a beauty queen, is said to be the reason behind Zari and the singer's break-up.
