As President Uhuru Kenyatta led a national tree planting exercise in Nairobi at the weekend, charcoal traders were ferrying the commodity from Mwingi. Kitui Deputy Governor Wathe Nzau, Environment executive John Makau and youths on Saturday intercepted three lorries with 200 bags of charcoal headed to Nairobi. The county officials led the tree planting campaign in Kitui. “This war is yet to be won and we are going to introduce tough rules for traders and those burning charcoal. We spent our day planting trees in different parts of the county, but a few misguided people who want to make sure they make Kitui a desert by not sparing any tree were busy loading the charcoal,” Nzau said. He said he does not have faith in the police and the county enforcement officers. TOTAL BAN Nzau wondered how the lorries passed through roadblocks. He accused the police and county enforcement officers of colluding with charcoal transporters. “Let me warn these officers because they will have it rough. I think every officer in Kitui county – whether in the forest, doing agriculture or a village adminstrator – was told to enforce the ban. Why and how do they burn charcoal on a large scale and transport it without any arrest?” Nzau said. Environment CS John Makau said he is sure money is exchanging hands among the police, enforcement officers and traders. Makau said the traders claimed to have gotten a charcoal permit from Kilifi and Lamu, yet the charcoal was ferried in Mwingi. “There is total ban on charcoal nationwide so does it mean Kilifi and Lamu are deaf and still operate? How on earth could they get charcoal from Kilifi and Lamu and pass through Mwingi heading to Nairobi and why is it that these traders take themselves to be above the law?” he said.
