Livestock farmers have been warned of an imminent outbreak of Rift Valley Fever because of ongoing rains. Livestock PS Harry Kimtai on Wednesday urged county governments to set aside emergency funds to vaccinate animals immediately. “In Rift Valley and parts of Kerio Valley, we have mapped out areas likely to report cases of RVF. Leaders should urgently start the vaccination,” he said. The PS inspected projects in Baringo county. The disease affects cows, sheep and goats. In some cases it may spread to humans. Kimtai (pictured) was with Livestock national director Julius Kiptarus and his Baringo counterpart Richard Bundotich. The PS said, “Once it breaks out the disease will become difficult to cure and control. Prevention is better than cure.” The disease is spread through infected animals or mosquitoes, causing fever, pain and headaches. If not treated urgently, it may lead to death. The disease is common in the highlands and rural areas in the Kerio Valley. It’s inhabited by the Tugen, Pokot, Marakwet, Turkana, Samburu and Maasai pastoral communities. The PS and his team visited the government-funded Sh60 million hay farm at Lelmen in Baringo Central and a Sh10 million borehole at Ngosuonin in Baringo North subcounty. Kimtai urged farmers to take advantage of the rains to grow more pasture and preserve it for the dry season. The projects were funded by World Bank and the national government under the Regional Pastoral Livelihoods Resilience Programme. Kimtai said the government, in collaboration with the county governments across the country, will use GPS chips to trace stolen livestock. “This will discourage cattle rustling by armed bandits in Kerio Valley,” Kimtai said. There has been rampant cattle theft among pastoral communities in Baringo, Turkana, Samburu and West Pokot counties.
