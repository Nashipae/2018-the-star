Residents plying along the busy Outer Ring Road have something to smile about after the completion of the first footbridge at Baba Dogo section. This is one of the expected 11 footbridges that Kenya Urban Roads Highway Authority (Kura) is erecting following a public outcry of the poor workmanship of the new road. KURA has been receiving endless criticism following many accidents along the newly constructed highway that runs from Taj Mall on North Airport Road to the GSU headquarters at Allsops in Ruaraka. The 13km road lacks service lanes and had no single footbridge for pedestrian crossing.
