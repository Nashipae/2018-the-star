Former lawmaker Jakoyo Midiwo has asked Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo to stop making promises but deliver on pledges already made. Midiwo said Odhiambo should be nicknamed ‘the pledging MP’ because he is yet to honour any of his campaign promises. The former Gem legislator addressed residents at Sirembe Secondary School during a funds drive, where Sh3 million was raised. He was with Kieni MP Kanini Kega and Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa. Midiwo said he is still in politics and if Odhiambo will not deliver, he will move to reclaim the seat. “With the spirit of development, I will not stop helping my people,” he said. Midiwo added that his development record speaks for itself and he is willing to work with Odhiambo to spur growth. He said politicians should stop labelling each other based on the party they belong to. “Some people castigated me for vying as an independent candidate and even branded me a Jubilee mole. Following the handshake, are we still moles?” Midiwo said. Click here for the latest political news
