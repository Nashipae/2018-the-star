Manyatta MP John Muchiri has told his colleagues to stop being sycophants and tell President Uhuru Kenyatta that the Constitution must be amended. They know the President is unable to lead the country well because he does not have adequate powers, he said. The MP said instead of telling him the truth, they just tell him what they think will please him. He said constitutional amendments are crucial for better governance. The MP spoke to the Star on the phone yesterday. There are grey areas regarding the independence of the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary, he said. The two-term MP said the powers and roles of the arms of the government need to be defined clearly. We need law changes to give the President enough powers to govern the nation, Muchiri said. The team formed to foster unity after Uhuru’s handshake with Opposition chief Raila Odinga should tell Kenyans if the issue was dicussed, he said. Muchi said the team needs to tell the nation what they were deliberating so that the country is not in the dark.
