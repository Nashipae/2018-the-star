Anti-Corruption Court magistrate Lawrence Mugambi yesterday convicted and fined a former civil servant for defrauding the public of property worth Sh3.8 million more than eight years ago. He slapped the convict with the mandatory sentence of a fine pursuant to Section 48(2)(b) of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act, which provides convicts be fined two times the amount of the benefit and loss that accrues from their action. Wycliffe Marege Mitema, who worked for the Makueni county government, will pay Sh16.7 million for acquiring the property unlawfully and violating various regulations governing expenditure of public funds. Or he goes to prison. Even though it has taken a decade to conclude — the offence was committed 10 years ago — the ruling is a timely boost to the frustrating war on corruption. The sentence should act as a deterrent to career crooks who live off schemes to fleece the public. But while we applaud the ruling, it is obvious that the Anti-Corruption Courts have a long way to go to acquit themselves of their responsibility in the fight against graft. Apart from cases taking too long, the routine acquittal of corruption suspects by courts for ‘lack of evidence’ has raised eyebrows. The courts have defended their decisions on the basis of weak evidence, while the prosecution has charged them with being compromised. The police, the prosecution and the Judiciary must all be held to account if corruption is to be eradicated. This ruling is a good starting point.
