Ambeje said they partnered with Kenya Airways to introduce the new AMDAR system to connect weather departments to improve services.Kenya Airways planes will be fitted with software to collect weather data while in flight.“In weather forecasts, data is very critical and under the AMDAR system we shall use planes from Kenya Airways to achieve this,” Ambeje said.Environment CAS Elmi Mohammed said the system will improve weather forecast for air transport and farming. “The AMDAR system utilises aircraft sensors to collect, process, format and transmit meteorological data to ground stations,” Elmi said.Kenya Airways operations manager John Nalianya termed the move timely. “Aircrafts rely on meteorological data in planning their routes and this system, which is currently on trial, will come in handy in our day-to-day operations and planning,” he said.
