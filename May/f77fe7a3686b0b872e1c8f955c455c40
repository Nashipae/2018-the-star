Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has urged politicians - including his opponents - to conduct smart 2022 campaigns instead of resorting to insults. He said, “Have I ever insulted anyone? We are from one family so why is it that you always have to wake up and insult Gideon?” Gideon said people from Rift Valley campaign the most against him. He spoke at politician and businessman Yano Sengei’s funeral in Kapchepkor village, Baringo North subcounty, on Monday. “Every time you speak, it is about Gideon, why?” Gideon said. He urged his opponents to sell their agenda or the candidates of their choice with decorum “unless someone earns an allowance for tarnishing my name”. DYNASTY Baringo North MP William Cheptumo, Governor Stanley Kiptis and Kanu secretary general Nick Salat attended the funeral. Gideon has hinted at running for President. He said he would return to seek direction from elders and residents. Gideon said, “I will still honour the orders and the direction you will ask me take.” Kanu supporters have urged Moi to declare if he is running for President early enough and start countrywide campaigns. Salat lashed out at National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale and told him to stop attacking Gideon. He said Duale should focus on supporting his preferred candidate. “He has his own party – Jubilee – and we have our own – Kanu. Why is he always bothered with the son of former President Daniel Arap Moi? He should desist,” Salat said. He said Gideon did not apply to be Moi’s son. Salat said it is not him (Duale), but the people, who will decide whom to vote for as President. Click here for the latest political news
