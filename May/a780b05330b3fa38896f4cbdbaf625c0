Kenya are the top seeds for next weekend’s Rugby Africa women’s tournament taking place in Gaberone, Botswana. The Lionesses, runners up at last year’s tournament in Tunisia, headline Pool ‘A’ which also features Madagascar and Senegal. Tunisia are in Pool ‘B’ alongside Uganda and Zimbabwe while Pool ‘C’ features Morocco, hosts Botswana, Mauritius and Zambia. Defending champions South Africa pulled out of the tournament. Head coach Kevin Wambua is expecting a competitive tournament but said the girls are relishing the tournament as they seek to build on their performances at last month’s Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia. “We learnt a few lessons from Gold Coast which we will take to Botswana and I am confident we can go all the way and win the tournament,” added Wambua The girls resumed training a fortnight ago as Wambua rectifies on some of the weaknesses he identified during their recent engagements. “Our play at the breakdown must improve and accuracy in open play can be better going forward. The girls are looking for continuous improvement to be among the best teams in the world,” observed Wambua. Despite the withdrawal of South Africa, Wambua expects a tough outing. “It will be a good tournament. Tunisia are strong while Uganda and Zimbabwe are good upcoming sides and so it will not be a walk in the pack,” said Wambua.
