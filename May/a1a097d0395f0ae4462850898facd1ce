The Kenya Red Cross Society has appealed for food for more than 22,000 flood victims in Kilifi. Coast regional Red Cross coordinator Hassan Musa said Garashi, where more than 3,000 people are living in camps, is in dire need of food. Other places hurt by the floods are Malindi and Magarini. In Garashi, Musa said, victims have only received relief food twice. “Even though we and World Vision have done our part, residents lack water and many children are not going to school,” he said. Most schools are flooded or are being used as camps.
