Siaya county employees will soon start clocking in because they are chronically absent or late. “As we speak, some of them are not on duty since I am in Nairobi, but this will end soon with biometric gadets in place,” Governor Cornel Rasanga said in interview with Radio Mayienga yesterday. The governor said last month he made an impromptu visit to the county offices and found more than a third of the employees had either not reported to work or had left before closing hours. Rasanga said he ordered a head count. He directed that the employees found culpable be surcharged and given show-cause letters. Staff performance will be monitored to enhance delivery of services, Rasanga said. He said employees who skip work are failing the public. The governor said the biometric system has been factored in the budget. Installation will be fast-tracked in all offices in the six subcounties. They are Ugenya, Ugunja, Gem, Bondo, Rarieda and Alego-Usonga. nurses warned Rasanga warned health workers, especially nurses, who have a habit of going on strike because of delayed salaries. He said they would be dealt with. “We want to move Siaya forward. Stop the tendency of boycotting work because of pay delay for a day or two,” the governor said. He said development is moving at a slow pace because the national government does not give counties money on time. Rasanga caused laughter when he said he has “reconciled” with President Uhuru Kenyatta. ‘reconciled’ with uhuru The governor had removed Uhuru’s portrait from his office after the acrimonious elections last year “for undermining NASA leader Raila Odinga”. The governor says he is ready to host Uhuru in his office when he tours Nyanza. He wants to show the President that he has returned the portrait. Rasanga welcomed the Raila-Uhuru handshake. It is a step in the right direction, that will foster peace, cohesion and ensure equitable distribution of resources, he said.
