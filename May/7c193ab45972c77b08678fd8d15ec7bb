Makueni requires Sh1 billion to rebuild following devastating floods that have killed 17 residents and displaced scores, Governor Kivutha Kibwana has said. The governor and Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr yesterday held a consultative meeting with county leaders to strategise on emergency response. A county government report shows 26 dams have been breached, houses collapsed and crops destroyed.The report states that Sh205 million is required to repair damaged dams and water projects. Road repairs will need Sh282 million, the report says. “We have to review some development projects in our 2018-19 budget to facilitate the recovery plan. The decision is painful, but a necessary sacrifice,” Kibwana said. The leaders on Monday formed a committee to coordinate emergency response “to alleviate suffering and avert further loss of lives and property”. All Makueni elected leaders and stakeholders are expected to draw a roadmap for a united response to flooding. Click here for the latest political news
