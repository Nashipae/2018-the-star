The late Baringo South MP Grace Kipchoim will be buried on Saturday at her Kimoriot home, Marigat. Funeral coordinator Bishop Daniel Chemon of Full Gospel Churches of Kenya said arrangements are complete. The legislator’s body will be removed from Lee Funeral Home today for prayers at FGCK church Valley Road, Nairobi. Several fundraisers were held on Monday for the ceremony. Family and friends collected money in Marigat, Nakuru, Nairobi and at Kipchoim’s home in Mochongoi. Baringo Deputy Governor Jacob Chepkwony led a fundraiser at Governor Stanley Kiptis’s offices in Kabarnet town. "The money will be used for transporting mourners and to pay other funeral bills. We expect a big attendance of politicians, relatives
and friends," Chemon said. The bishop said President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto had sent their condolences to the family. Chemon said the church was ready to give the late lawmaker a decent sendoff. Kipchoim died of colon cancer. The 49-year-old MP will be remembered for her campaigns against insecurity and for resettlement of Mochongoi residents. She also championed improvement of schools and water sources. Despite being bedridden, Kipchoim retained her seat with
10,300 votes, narrowly beating her closest opponent Charles Kamuren who got 10,184 in the August 8 elections. Kamuren disputed the result but decided not to move to court. He had lost a petition against Kipchoim in 2013. Click here for the latest political news
