Security fears and lack of awareness are the major reasons slowing down the uptake of cloud services among enterprises, Microsoft has said. Latest sector statistic report from the Communication Authority shows that at least 4,589 cyber threats were recorded in the second quarter of the current financial year. Microsoft East Africa country manager Sebuh Haileleul yesterday said educating the masses and enterprises on the importance of having their data stored in the cloud would go a long way in creating confidence on the importance of using the service. The National ICT study shows  35.6 per cent of public sector institutions use cloud services as compared to only 22.9 per cent of private businesses. To help mitigate the security issues and increase uptake, Seacom and Microsoft yesterday introduced a cloud service – Azure ExpressRoute – which enables customers to create private connections between data centers and infrastructure on their premises or in a cloud environment.
