Didymus Barasa of Kimilili said the lot form the majority of inmates in Kenyan prisons, with others serving sentences as low as one month. "They should be put on probation and be assigned community jobs as a way of reducing the population of our prisons," the MP said at Nasianda primary school. The legislator issued a Sh1.6m cheque from CDF for renovation of the school's classrooms and for the launch of tree planting exercise.
