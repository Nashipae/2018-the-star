The National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) has migrated motor vehicle record searches from the E-Citizen Platform. It has been moved to the Transport Integrated Management Systems amid controversy in the digital payment system. E-Citizen has been on the spot since the Treasury disowned a firm contracted to collect revenue on its behalf. Last month, activist Okiya Omtatah sued the government over the illegal procurement process. NTSA, in a notice, said the public is required to register an account with Transport Integrated Management Systems (TIMS) in order to access the service.

"Log-in to access your account, choose payment method from the provided list. An invoice of Sh550 shall be generated by the system to enable you to make the payment online," the notice read. The agency has also cautioned buyers stating that before purchasing a motor vehicle, it is prudent that one undertakes a search to ascertain the ownership details. "If the information on the logbook does not match those on the copy of records, report to the nearest NTSA office." NTSA says it shall not be liable for any transaction within an account in regard to incorrect ID and KRA PIN numbers.
