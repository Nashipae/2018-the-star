Siaya Governor Cornel on Wednesday shelved plans to build new county offices for Sh100 million after his wife advised against it. Rosella Rasanga told her husband it would be unwise to build new county headquarters at the expense of health, road and water projects. She said it is wrong for Kenyans to praise governors who take five to 10 years to build their offices instead of initiating development projects. The two spoke at the county headquarters in Siaya town, where Rosella met community health workers to talk about Early Childhood Development Education. She is the patroness of ECDE scaling-up programme. Rasanga agreed with Rosella that construction of the office complex is untimely and does not add value to residents’ lives. The governor said he will instead spend the money on projects that matter to residents. “Siaya residents, being the greatest beneficiaries of devolution, cannot benefit from a building worth Sh100 million without drugs in hospitals and other basic needs,” Rasanga said. Plans to build new county headquarters were first mooted in 2014. The new premises would include a shopping mall, petrol station and swimming pool. The county administration uses the offices of the defunct county council. “I see no development in building an office complex in Siaya when residents are still wallowing in poverty, illiteracy, and hunger,” Rasanga said. He said a new building will provide a conducive working environment for him and his staff, but it will defeat the purpose of devolution. “Devolution was created to uplift lives at the grassroots and not to [put up] buildings as others tend to believe,” Rasanga said. “The project will be implemented by other governors after I have set the development foundation.” His administration has set aside Sh170 million in the next budget for health projects that will target the elderly, pregnant mothers and the public at large. Rosella promised to devote her time to the ECDE programme to enhance care for the young.
