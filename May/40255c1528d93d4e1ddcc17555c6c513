The appointment of Miguna Miguna as Nairobi deputy governor by Mike Sonko has continued to elicit mixed reactions among Jubilee leaders. On Sunday, the party's 2017 aspirants accused Sonko of going against the party constitution. The more than 100 parliamentary aspirants (JPA), while addressing the media at Club Heritage in Naivasha, said they will use all means to object the move. After his appointment on Wednesday, the NRMKe General said he had "no idea what everyone seems to be talking about". "Those are malicious distractions. That’s what I’m saying at this moment," Miguna said in an SMS on Thursday.

I will not comment on malicious information, material or cheap propaganda circulating in social media. Thank you." But JPA chairman Mark Mwenje who vied unsuccessfully for Embakasi West parliamentary seat said they were shocked and dismayed by the move. “The issue of Miguna is now affecting development agenda as all attention has been directed towards his nomination which is very wrong,” he said. His sentiments were echoed by his counterpart from Starehe constituency Francis Mwangi who said that Miguna should first join Jubilee before taking up the seat. He wondered why Sonko had gone for the independent candidate yet there were tens of qualified women from Jubilee party who could serve as his deputy. Nairobi county senatorial candidate Badi Ali echoed the sentiments of his colleagues who called on the governor to stop dividing leaders in Nairobi. He noted that the governor should respect the head of state and his deputy noting that the move to nominate Miguna was against the duos wishes.
