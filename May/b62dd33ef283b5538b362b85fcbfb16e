It’s never easy starting anything, so it has to be about you and what you want. Neomi Nganga has been making moves in the fashion industry. Early this year, Kenyan actress, Krysteen Savane went to the Oscars wearing a gorgeous neon green gown with an African print over-skirt from Style by Neomi. Well, for the first time she has talked about her late mother crediting her for her success. She told Word Is: "My mother taught me how to be strong and that is why I am these far. She always ensured that my seven brothers and I had everything, despite living in slums where she was a hustler. "My mother fought so hard to get me. She had seven boys but she fought so hard to get me as the only daughter at the age of 48 years. She taught me how to be tough. Most people think that I am just tough but it came from my mum." Neomi had to adjust and start living by herself when her mother died. "She died when I was still very young, and since I have never found another mother figure in my life, I had to mould myself to be the woman I am today. "I am in my thirties, and since I have not gotten kids, I think I am saving my love for my kids because the only other person I would have given love is my late mum."
