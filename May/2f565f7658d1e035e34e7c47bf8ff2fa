Nominated MCA Mary Mwami has recorded a police statement saying she was assaulted by Governor Mike Sonko’s security guard. She said she was pushed to the ground and her clothing was torn. Mwami said Sonko himself was verbally abusive when she visited his office on Tuesday. The governor’s communication team has denied the claims, saying there was no fracas that day. Mwami said she was assaulted when members of the Transport Committee were scheduled to have an evening meeting with the governor. “As a member of the transport committee, we had a scheduled meeting with the governor on Tuesday evening. As I entered his office, Sonko shouted at me, ‘We mama tuheshimiane, unatukana watu wangu’ (Woman, let’s respect each other, you are abusing my people),” she said. Speaking to the media at City Hall on Wednesday Mwami said to avoid argument, she left Sonko’s office and was escorted by security men. One of them manhandled her, saying she was abusing the governor and his people, she said. “He jumped on my neck, pulled me and threw me on the ground. I’m living with disability. He roughed me up to a point where my bra got torn,” Mwami said. Central police boss Robinson Thuku on Thursday said Mwami reported the incident that night. She is to furnish police with medical reports. “If medical tests prove she was assaulted, we will arrest the accused,” Thuku said.
