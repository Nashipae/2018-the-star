Police have released photos of six goons who attacked the Nairobi Businessmen Association Chairman Timothy Muriuki. A statement from the National Police Service said the suspects are wanted by Police to answer to charges of Robbery with Violence. "The suspects whose images have been attached are wanted by police to answer to charges of robbery with violence.The suspects who have since gone to hiding attacked and robbed Mr. Timothy Muriuki at Boulevard Hotel on 30/04/2018," read the statement  In the statement Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet said the service has placed a cash reward of Sh 500,000 to be offered to anyone with information leading to their arrest. A press conference by the Nairobi CBD Association ended in disarray after a group of heavily built men stormed the venue and beat up Muriuki.  The attackers, however, claimed Muriuki was a conman hired to tarnish Governor Mike Sonko's name. They roughed him up, tore his statement and dragged him away by the collar of his coat shortly after he started speaking.  One was heard saying: "Tunakujua. Hatutakuwacha uharibu jina ya Gavana. Haitawezekana (We know you. We won't let you tarnish the Governor's name. That is impossible)." The goons forced the chairman out of the hotel's gate where he was attacked by more people who had been waiting there.  They tore his coat, punched and kicked him, forcing him to run to Norfolk Towers for safety.
