Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has rubbished the ongoing referendum politics. He said the country does not need a referendum but should instead focus its energy on development and training its youths. Kuria said the country cannot engage in a plebiscite that is
"meant to create employment for three old men at the expense of millions of
Kenyan youth". He made the remarks at Gatundu KMTC during the institution's Open Day on Tuesday. "A referendum will put us in a politicking mood and an opportunity to hurl insults at one another while critical issues like hospitals, colleges and roads take a back seat." He said it was high-time Kenyans stopped seeing the handshake between ODM leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta as being about changing the Constitution.

has other issues which require urgent attention," the MP said. During the occasion, the MP alongside Health PS Peter Tum, KMTC chairman Prof Philip Kaloki opened six lecture halls and presented a college bus funded through the NG-CDF. The question of whether the country needs a referendum has elicited sharp divisions between those in support and those against the proposal to change the Constitution. The debate started after Raila, during the fifth annual devolution conference in Kakamega, proposed the creation of three-tier system of government with a view of entrenching devolution. It takes a vote by universal suffrage to make the proposed changes to the supreme law, hence the birth of the referendum conversation.
