Actress Elizabeth Lulu has been released halfway into her two-year sentence in jail. She will be on probation of the rest of the sentence. She was convicted for the manslaughter of actor Steven Kanumba, in April 7 2012. At the court hearing, Lulu said Kanumba wanted to attack her with a panga, after which he fell down and was unconscious. She then ran for her life, only to get the news that Kanumba had died. Lulu said: "Marehemu alianguka mwenyewe na kujigonga kwa nguvu na kuinuka sehemu nyingine alikuwa kama anatapatapa, nilimwambia Seth kuwa Kanumba amedondoka na akajaribu kumuamsha hakuamka akasema anaenda kumuita daktari." Kanumba was one of the most celebrated actors in Tanzania, with multiple awards for his work in the acting industry.
