COTU secretary general Francis Atwoli on Tuesday accused some politicians of inciting teachers to oust Wilson Sossion as KNUT secretary general. Atwoli, however, said Sossion is firmly in office and Cotu and other workers will defend him from those who want him removed. "Those who are calling for Sossion's removal, who said that he cannot hold two jobs?" Atwoli posed. Sossion has been under pressure to resign after he was nominated by ODM to Parliment as an MP.

On April 11, several teachers staged a sit-in at the Knut headquarters in Nairobi in a bid to eject Sossion.

The nominated MP has maintained that he will not resign from his post even after a gazette notice ordering him to vacate. He said the Kenya Nations Union of Teachers is not government property to be dictated. “Regulation 187 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of the Code of Regulations for Teachers requires teachers released to trade unions to resign or retire from service once they opt to vie for political office,” read part of the letter. It said, “It has been noted you were nominated as an MP yet the commission has not received your resignation or retirement letter”. "During this labour day, teachers are not happy because of the policies that the employer is rolling out. Teachers are also being separated from their families when transferred to other counties without proper consultations," Sossion said.
