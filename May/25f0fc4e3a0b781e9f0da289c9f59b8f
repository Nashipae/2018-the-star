The county has the second highest rate of teenage pregnancies at 38 per cent after Narok which has 40 per cent. Wanga said the statistics were alarming. She said she was discussing with the county commissioner and the county government on best strategies to contain the vice. “It’s high time we collectively fought this scourge because it is ruining the future of our girls,” Wanga said. She spoke on Monday during celebrations for the International Menstrual Hygiene Day at Kandiege in Karachuonyo constituency.
