The rift in Knut has widened after ousted secretary general Wilson Sossion said he will not quit. On Tuesday, deputy secretary general Hesborne Otieno was declared the acting SG a meeting held in Nairobi. But Sossion dismissed the decision. He said the calls to have him out of office have been politically instigated by people with selfish interests. “The ongoing calls are not genuine. Some people are using the issue of two jobs to have me out of office, but it won’t work. The national executive committee in December agreed the union elections be held in June after the retirement of the chairman and the deputy chair who were on compulsory leave,” the nominated MP said.

If Sossion steps aside, he will be the third official of the giant union to be forced out in less than six months. Chairperson Mudzo Nzili and deputy chairperson Samson Kaguma were forced to leave in December. Sossion insists, however, that the union is functioning well. “There are no cracks in the operations and terms of office of the union leadership,” he said. Before the August 8 election, Knut was split along the two major political formations — NASA and Jubilee. Nzili supported President Uhuru Kenyatta’s reelection, while Sossion supported NASA chief Raila Odinga. He was nominated by ODM. Yesterday, a NEC member who sought anonymity said the move by the two leaders was to blame for the split in the NEC.
