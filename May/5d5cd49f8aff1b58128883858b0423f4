The body of the two have been taken to Migori Level Four Hospital mortuary. In a press statement, Nyatike MP Tom Odege faulted both the county and national government of laxity in setting up disaster response centre. Odege said that despite common accidents in the mines which range from carbon monoxide poisoning and collapsed mines the response has been poor. “We need a standby disaster team in Migori county with well trained and equipped staff, we still hope to get the miners alive,” he said. Obado and Odege warned miners to stop their activities as heavy rains pounding the area have made the mines to be dangerous. Their sentiments were shared by Migori county Commander Joseph Nthenge warned the miners to be extra-cautious during this rainy season.  Click here for the latest political news
