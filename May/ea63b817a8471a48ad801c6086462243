The children of a Nyatike gold miner yesterday found his body hanging from a tree in their compound. The man committed suicide following problems with his wife and relatives. Lower Kadem chief David Oula said the deceased married another wife two years ago after his first wife died. “The wife had a long-standing relationship with a neighbour which was the cause  of his marital problems. The deceased never confronted the man in question, but shared his displeasure with the wife,” Oula said. He said when the wife left at dawn to run errands, the man thought she had left him for her lover. The man left a suicide note and asked his brother who lives in Homa Bay to take care of his children.
