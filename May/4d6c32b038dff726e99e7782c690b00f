Fish is brought into Kenya illegally through informal routes in Busia, an NGO official has said. This smuggling business is going on despite a simplified trade regime at the One-Stop Border Post. Idris Alinassrah from World Fish regional office in Lusaka, Zambia, made the remarks in Busia on Wednesday. “The majority of fish is traded informally and something needs to be done to curb the vice,” he said. The illegal stocks lead to poor revenue for fish traders. “The fish that passes through the porous borders does not undergo health inspection,” Alinassrah said. He spoke during the first cross-border fish exhibition in Busia town. Traders and fish farmers from Uganda and Kenya showcased products and services. The NGO official said a well-managed system could lead to numerous economic gains for traders. His organisation will work with the regional economic communities to make it easier for small-scale fish traders to grow. Busia is a major fish hub. The fish comes from Lake Turkana, the DRC, Lake Albert in Uganda and Lake Victoria. Busia Crossborder Traders Association chairman Charles Achieng’ said the forum will help solve the challenges of fish traders. Busia director of fisheries Timothy Odede urged small-scale fish traders from Kenya and Uganda to respect the law. “One of the challenges they have is lack of a big storage facility. The Busia government has allocated Sh15 million over three years for expansion of the Busia Jua Kali fish market and storage facility,” he said. Odede said the county has provided fingerlings, fish feed and extension services. Trader Emily Okumu said among the challenges they face is a glut in the market, which forces traders to give out fish on credit as far as DRC and Uganda. In the end the traders incur losses and even lose capital when the creditors don’t pay.
