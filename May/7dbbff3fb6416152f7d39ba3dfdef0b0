Embu Senator Njeru Ndwiga has faulted those calling for the amendment of the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act. He said the law is punitive but it should remain. The Act was ratified by President Uhuru Kenyatta on May 16. It has been challenged in court. Last week on Monday a petitioner moved to court seeking to have the law quashed on grounds there was no public participation. But Ndwiga on Saturday said the harsh sentences imposed by the Act will tame social media users who disseminate destructive, inciteful and immoral information. “So many careers have been destroyed by unscrupulous social media users and the law will prompt them to be responsible in the use of technology,” he said. Ndwiga said technology if used properly promotes development as it passes crucial information fast. He said many young people make a living with the help of technology, but there are many others who misuse it to destroy lives. The new law prescribes stiff penalties for cyber espionage, false publications, child pornography, computer forgery, cyberstalking and cyberbullying. Sharing pornography through various electronic means will attract a maximum fine of Sh300,000, a jail term of 30 years or both. Those found guilty of spreading child pornography will pay a fine of Sh20 million, spend 25 years in jail or both. Cyberterrorism attracts a maximum Sh5 million fine, 10 years in prison or both. Media watchdogs say the law stifles press freedom. Click here for the latest political news
