Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa has urged the government to allocate funds to Kitale National Polytechnic and elevate it to a university college. He said on Sunday that Parliament passed a motion in 2016 to have the institution turned into a semi-autonomous university. Wamalwa spoke at a church service attended by DP William Ruto in Kitale. “Trans Nzoia has no university at the moment, but my motion to upgrade Kitale National Polytechnic into a university passed two years ago." "The institution should be named Wamalwa Kijana University of Science and Technology once it is elevated,” he said. Trans Nzoia plans to acquire land from the Agricultural Development Corporation to build a university. Click here for the latest political news
