An appellant has urged the court to nullify the Shinyalu victory of MP Justus Kizito (pictured). Sylverse Anami claimed Kizito was not properly nominated by ODM. Anami said Kizito was not eligible for the race because ODM did not follow the right procedure while nominating him. Through lawyers Anthony Lubela and Lillian Ngeresa, Anami said the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) did not establish whether Kizito was a registered voter. Lubela said Kizitoâ€™s eligibility as a candidate was raised at the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal (PPDT) and the IEBC Disputes Committee, but he was still cleared to run. The PPDT ordered ODM to conduct fresh nominations in Shinyalu, but the party ignored. The lawyers questioned why the Shinyalu constituency returning officer received nomination papers from ODM clearing Kizito, yet the name he used was different. The commission relied on an affidavit sworn by the candidate. The IEBC lawyers, Donex Juma and Edwin Kubebea, said the commission investigated and ruled that what was required was only the ID number and voter register. The appeal was heard before Justice Phillip Waki, Justice Sichale Fatuma and Justice Otieno Odek.
