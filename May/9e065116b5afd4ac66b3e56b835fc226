More than 70 pupils in Standard Five and Six are studying under trees at Lunguma Primary School. Four classrooms at the Kwale school collapsed in March following heavy rains. Pupils who are not studying under trees are sharing classrooms with their counterparts in lower primary. Head teacher Mwachama Omari yesterday said the Matuga Constituency Development Fund office did not keep its promise to build two classrooms during the April school holiday. He appealed to donors to support construction of two classrooms for Sh2.5 million. “Considering the urgency of the matter, Matuga MP Kassim Tandaza in March said he would fund construction of two classrooms,” Omari said. He said they plan to rope in parents to help build a temporary classroom, especially now that it is raining. Omari will meet them this week to plan how to go about it. “They can’t continue studying under trees. We are planning to use tents for the time being because we fear the process by CDF might take long and studies have to go on,” he said. Omari said the maintenance fee they get from the government is not enough to pay for construction of classrooms. Each child gets a maximum of Sh50 per term. The school has 270 pupils. “We get a small amount from the Education ministry that isn’t enough to build one classroom,” he said. Omari last month called for urgent help so classes would not disrupted in second term. “If we fail to get help by next month, we’ll have to call parents and plan for a temporary shelter,” he had said. MP Tandaza yesterday said they will set up tents at the school until they receive money to build permanent classrooms. “We have set aside Sh700,000 from the CDF emergency kitty to set up the tents,” he said. Tandaza promised to prioritise the issue and others faced by schools in the subcounty. He blamed the previous leadership of failing to do enough to improve education.
