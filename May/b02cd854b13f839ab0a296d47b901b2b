Hundreds of students in Tana River are yet to report for the second term after 49 schools were flooded. A majority of the students are living in camps and cannot access their schools. In Tana Delta subcounty, 25 schools cannot be accessed. In Galole 13 schools are out of reach and in Tana North 11 schools are yet to open due to the floods. More than 64,000 have been displaced by floods in three weeks. Of that number, only 4,000 have been sheltered. The Kenya Red Cross Society has established 108 camps. It’s feared the number of those displaced could rise once those rescued from remote areas are accounted for. The humanitarian organisation has provided nonfood supplies and health personnel. Tana River Senator Juma Wario on Thursday urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to help as the situation is getting out of hand. “The President didn’t speak about the emergency of floods and intervention measures in his State of the Nation address,” he said. Wario spoke when he visited the flood victims in Gamba and Idsowe. The senator thanked the Red Cross for helping victims. “The Special Programmes department should stop all its activities and focus on the humanitarian crisis. The water levels are rising,” he said. On Wednesday, the Red Cross said nine people had died and more than 86,000 had been displaced by floods in Tana River and Kilifi counties. Seven lost their lives in Tana River while two others died in Kilifi. Kenya Red Cross regional coordinator Hassan Musa said those who do not have shelter are at a risk of waterborne diseases, as most camps don’t have toilets. He said the county government of Tana River has given two-speed boats to assist with the evacuation. “We evacuated a number of people in Tana River, the area is inaccessible, we are deploying a boat from Lamu that has a capacity to carry 10 tonnes,” he said. Moderate to heavy rain and flooding are predicted to continue throughout May.
