The Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded to President Donald Trump because of his work to ease nuclear tensions with North Korea, a group of Republican politicians have said. A historic meeting between Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un over denuclearisation could be announced by the week’s end. Indiana Representative Luke Messer unveiled a letter on Wednesday to members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that was signed by 18 Republicans. The letter says that North Korea has evaded demands from the international community to cease its aggressions but that Trump’s “peace through strength policies are working” and bringing North Korea to the negotiating table.
