Butali Warriors maintained their unbeaten run in the 2018 Kenya Hockey Union men’s Premier League following their 2-1 win over Greensharks at City Park. The match which was abandoned on April 14 at the half hour mark due to rains resumed yesterday with Butali enjoying the initial 2-0 lead. Greensharks then pulled one back in the remaining quarters of the game but it was too late, too late to cancel the 2-0 loss they suffered last month in the opening quarter of the game. Red hot George Mutira had bagged a brace last month in the third and 29th minutes of the game before showers rendered the Astro turf unplayable, forcing KHU to shelve the tie. Yesterday, Sharks had the chance to cancel the two goals but Butali deployed a good defensive approach, which denied the Ben Owaga-coached side goals from the numerous scoring chances. Sharks, who were out to safeguard their unbeaten run, launched serious attack in Butali’s area with Victor Osiche, Chris Wokila and Kelvin Simiyu missing clear cut chances. With three minutes to the final whistle, Ben Ochieng notched in Sharks lone goal although it was too late to restore parity. Butali’s head coach Godfrey Wakachunga praised his charges for playing according to his instructions. “The pressure was on their side and I am happy with my boys for playing to my instructions. We were a bit defensive and invited more pressure on our side but the players handled the situation well. Our aim is to take each game at a time and scoop every point on offer.”
