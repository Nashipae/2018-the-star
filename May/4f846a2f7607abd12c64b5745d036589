A number of schools are under investigation for irresponsible use of finances disbursed by the government and from parents as fees, Education CS Amina Mohamed has said. She said Boards of Management that will be found to have misappropriated the funds will be disbanded and made to face the full force of the law. “We will not hesitate to take stern action against those reported to have embezzled school funds,” she said. The CS asked all secondary school heads to utilize funds properly for infrastructure expansion. She made the remarks during a prize-giving ceremony at Kiambu High school. Mohamed said the government will equally deal with people who expose school children to drugs. The CS thanked Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu for banning the sale of illegal alcoholic drinks in the County, saying the law will help protect defenceless school going, children. The Kiambu County Alcoholic Drinks Control Act, 2017 seeks to regulate the manufacture, selling and consumption of alcohol in the Central Kenya region in a bid to reduce alcoholism that has plagued it for ages. Waititu defended the law saying it seeks to protect young people whose lives have been destroyed by illegal brews. Also present during the occasion included the Director for Quality Standards and Assurance, Pius Mutisya, Deputy Director of Education Truphena Kerongo, area County Director of Education Abdikadir Ali and the Chairman of the School’s Board of Management (BOM) J. Kagenyi. Others were the Principal of the School Solomon Mwangi, parents, teachers and students. Click here for the latest political news
