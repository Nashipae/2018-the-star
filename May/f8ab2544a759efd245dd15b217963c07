EALA MP Simon Mbugua, his alleged accomplices Antony Otieno Ombok and Benjamin Odhiambo were on Wednesday released on a Sh200,000 bail. The three were remanded since their arrest on Tuesday in connection with the April 30 assault on former NCBDA chairman Timothy Muriuki.

Senior principal magistrate Martha Mutuku directed the three to deposit their National Identity cards in court. She had been asked by the prosecution to grant the accused persons stringent bail terms. The magistrate said even though the allegations against the three suspects are serious, there was no evidence in court to suggest they are a flight risk. She further said there is no evidence to the effect that they will interfere with witnesses. The magistrate observed that the prosecution did not oppose the release of the three on bail. She granted the suspects a Sh500,000 bond and one surety each as an alternative to the bail. "Although the allegations are serious, they remain innocent until proven guilty," Mutuku said in her ruling.
