Three black rhinos were on Wednesday evening killed by poachers in the Meru National Park and their horns hacked off. The three included a calf, Tourism CS Najib Balala said on Thursday. Security officers were on the trail of the poachers. The officers laid ambushes after hearing gunshots, but the night-long operation failed to nab the poachers, Balala said in a statement. "The poachers managed to escape. Our officers have good leads and are in hot pursuit," the CS said. Balala regretted the killings, saying it was a blow to Kenya's improved conservation surveillance. Wildlife population has increased over the last two years with Kenya now having the fourth largest number of elephants at more than 34,000. With more than 1,000 individuals, Kenya also has the third largest population of rhinos. Balala said poaching trend had reduced due to enhanced wildlife law enforcement efforts and government investment in conservation. "These efforts led to reduction of rhino and elephant poaching at 85 per cent and 75 per cent respectively last year," he said. Kenya lost 80 elephants and nine rhinos to poachers last year. Security agencies have collaborated with the Judiciary and other industry players to protect gains made in the conservation of wildlife. Following the killings, Balala on Thursday visited the Kenya Wildlife Service headquarters in Nairobi to evaluate the security system. The CS is keen on boosting surveillance on poaching and human-wildlife conflicts. Between March last year and January, 714 wildlife cases have been taken to court. Of the 23 finalised cases, there was a life imprisonment with five acquittals. Sixteen cases were withdrawn. Another case attracted a fine of Sh4 million. Another 397 case are pending. The highest bond remains at Sh20 million. Most cases this year have resulted from illegal grazing with ivory possession accounting for 10 percent. In 2013, Kenya lost 59 rhinos to poachers compared to 35 in 2014. The figure reduced to 11 and 10 in 2015 and 2016 respectively Three hundred and eighty four elephants were killed by poachers in 2012, compared to 302 in 2013. The figure reduced to 164 in 2014 and 96 in 2015. Official records show 15 elephants have been killed this year.
