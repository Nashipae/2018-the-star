Thika MP Patrick Wainaina has urged Kiambu county to expand Thika Level 5 Hospital to ease crowding. He said he visited the hospital and found three patients sharing a bed. Wainaina spoke during the launch of a CT scan at the hospital. Health CS Sicily Kariuki and Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu were present. The governor said the county government was already looking at the overcrowding problem. He said congestion will be a thing of the past once the Sh800million reproductive health unit with a bed capacity of 300 is complete. He said the facility is 95 percent complete and would soon open. The hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Patrick Nyaga says there is an influx of patients from Murang’a, Machakos, Kitui and Garissa counties. "We are forced to use the few resources we have to cater for all patients we receive. We cannot turn away patients,” Nyaga said. The county government has been criticised by residents for having misplaced priorities. Residents said the Sh2 million being spent on alcohol addicts should be used to expand health facilities and buy more beds. The county has enrolled 4,500 addicts on a six-month rehabilitation programme. The programme will cost Sh720 million in total. Click here for the latest political news
