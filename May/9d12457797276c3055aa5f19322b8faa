The government is constructing a 297 Kilometer road from Eldoret to Lokichar to facilitate transportation of oil from Turkana. Transport CS James Macharia said the project has been subdivided into seven parts and awarded to different contractors to fast-track its construction. Macharia has however noted that the biggest challenge is the Kainuk bridge which was swept away by floods.

"Engineers are working on it and if we don't have more floods, it will be ready for the President to flag off the first tankers of oil," Macharia said. Flooding on the Kainuk bridge that links Kenya to South Sudan has caused traders losses amounting to millions of money after the bridge got overtopped by water. Transportation of crude oil from the oil fields is expected to start on June 3. Tullow Oil, the company that is extracting the oil has already produced 60,000 barrels of oil and expects to be producing 2,000 barrels per day.
