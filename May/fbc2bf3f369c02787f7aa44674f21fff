Nascos restaurant in Nairobi’s city centre has been closed down indefinitely for illegal dumping. City Hall officials and armed police from Central Police Station raided the hotel yesterday morning, arrested three staff and closed the premises. Deputy environment director Lawrence Mwangi said the management of the restaurant has been illegally dumping waste from the premises using street families. Mwangi said county officials, led by county secretary Peter Kariuki, arrested three street boys caught dumping on Sheikh Karume Lane and Ronald Ngala Street on Tuesday night. The boys, Mwangi said, admitted they were sent by the hotel, prompting county officers to raid the place. “After the CS [county secretary] alerted us we did our patrol on the same night and arrested three street boys who notified us they were paid to dump trash,” Mwangi said. “This reveals how business people are illegally dumping garbage.” But restaurant manager Daniel Obondo denied the accusaton and said environment officers were retaliating after he declined to give them Sh100,000.
