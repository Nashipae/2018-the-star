Students have been warned about conmen masquerading as agents of landlords of privatehostels. Embu West DCI boss George Etyiang yesterday said conmen have placed posters advertising vacancies in non-existing hostels. Students who contact them through mobile phones are lured and showed ‘fake’ hostels. “They have exploited the scarcity of hostels to fleece unsuspecting students and their guardians. They sometimes ask the students to send money for advance booking,” Etyiang said. He said police were pursuing some of the criminals.
