 The widow of slain school principal Samuel Mbogo has pleaded not guilty to her husband’s murder. Alice Mugechi and co-accused Samuel Gitu denied killing the Gatunguru Secondary School principal when they appeared before Justice Kanyi Kimondo yesterday. The two are accused of committing the crime on the night of May 12 and 13 in Gakurwe village, Murang’a East sub-county, together with others not before the court. The suspects, through lawyer Mwaniki Warima, asked the court to release them on bond. Warima also asked for the witnesses’ statements to help him prepare for the hearing of the case. Justice Kimondo ordered the prosecution to present the suspects’ probation reports to help the court determine if they are eligible for bond. The judge at the High Court in Murang’a further directed the prosecution to supply the defence counsel with all the necessary court documents and scheduled the case for mention on July 30. Gitu was murdered in his home and his body bundled into his car, which was abandoned near his house. Two of his children who were at home when he was killed have been put under witness protection. Local teachers have called for investigations and the trial to be hastened for justice to be served. During his burial on May 18, Mbogo’s 22-year-old daughter Margaret Wangari told mourners that if her mother is found guilty, she would never forgive her. "Money should not kill such a cheerful person. Why do women prioritise money?” Wangari asked. She said people should consider the effect of their actions on children. "Those people you kill also have families, mothers, fathers and siblings who care about them. Money is nothing when there is no peace," Wangari said. Her speech moved the crowd to tears as she said her father’s death had left she and her four siblings alone as their mother remains in police custody.
