A private sector conference starting tomorrow in Nairobi invites nursing mothers to bring their babies, and everyone to bring their own notebooks, pens and reusable water bottles. The 3rd Annual Private Sector Conference on Sustainable Inclusive Business will take place at the United States International University (USIU). The meeting will focus on the new economy, transformation and future-proof businesses. The aim is to support businesses to become sustainable and inclusive. Delegates have been told to come with their babies and nannies. A lactation station will be provided by Better Business Practices. It is an initiative of Kepsa and Unicef aimed at improving maternal and infant nutrition by making workplaces mother- and baby- friendly. “We promote, support and push businesses to thrive and be better for the world,” SIBKenya coordinator Karin Boomsma said. Delegates have been asked to bring along reusable water bottles. No disposable plastic water bottles will be provided. Pure water will be provided at a central location. No notebooks and pens will be provided since delegates rarely use them. To reduce waste and conserve resources, delegates have been asked to bring their own notebooks and pens. The meals will be purely vegetarian, while refreshments will be organic. These will be provided by SIB partners such as Bbrood, Mlango Farm, Bio, Azuri Health, SafariLounge and Fresh ’n Easy.
