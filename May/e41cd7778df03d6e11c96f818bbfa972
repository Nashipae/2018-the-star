The government is carrying out reforms in technical and vocational education training institutions to improve the competence of graduates. Technical and Vocational Education Training (TVET) director Meshack Opwora yesterday asked the colleges to realign their programmes with industrial needs. Opwora said the government is expanding the colleges and building additional institutions to accommodate more students. This is aimed at addressing the shortage of skilled workers. “To bridge the gap, polytechnics must realign their programmes to be consistent with the new competency based education and training approach,” Opwora said. He spoke at the Kisumu National Polytechnic during the commissioning of a Sh130 million mechanical engineering equipment.
