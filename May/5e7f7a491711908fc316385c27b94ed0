Over 15 estates in Nairobi will go without water for 24 hours after a pipe serving Kiambu, Kasarani, and Kangundo was damaged. The Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company said the pipe was destroyed by a road contractor at Kugeria estate in Kiambu county. Acting Managing director Nahason Muguna in a statement on Saturday, said the pipeline the damage occurred when the contractor was laying a new water pipeline from Kiambu to Embakasi (along the Eastern bypass) near the Coca Cola factory.  The areas affected are Thome, Kasarani, Zimmerman, Githurai 45 & 44, Mwiki, Kahawa Barracks, Kahawa Wendani and Kahawa Sukari. Others are Kayole, Komarock, Umoja 2, Baraka estate, Njiru, Ruai, areas along Kamuti road, Thika road, Mwiki road, and Kagundo road. Muguna said: "NCWSC engineers and the contractor have been mobilised to the site at Kugeria Estate in Kiambu and repair works have commenced." "The repair works are expected to take 24 hours." Muguna reassured the city residents and consumers in the affected areas
that every effort is being made to ensure supply is restored. "Any inconvenience is highly regretted," he added.
