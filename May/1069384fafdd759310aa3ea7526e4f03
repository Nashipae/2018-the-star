Reuben Githinji/Embu county has been advised to privatise garbage collection. Heaps of garbage lay uncollected in Embu town following frequent breaking down of garbage trucks. Kirimari MCA Morris Collo on Saturday said despite the county government’s commitment to keep the town clean, it’s clear it has few trucks for the job. Collo said he is disappointed in the number of trucks deployed to collect garbage and the frequency in breaking down. He asked the county government to issue contracts for garbage collection to youth groups. Collo said there are many unemployed but committed youth who can earn a living through garbage collection. But the county has to give them the tenders, the MCA added. He also urged the county government to buy more garbage collection trucks to clean Embu town. "The face of the county needs to be clean," Collo said. He spoke at the Embu county headquarters when he represented Governor Martin Wambora in flagging off more than 600 university, colleges, secondary and primary students and traders. They joined Japan’s Tenri Mission workers in cleaning up Embu town. Collo was with Public Health officer Rosaline Kaugi and Tenri Hospital CEO Jim Njamiu.
