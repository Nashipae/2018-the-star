Nairobi Senator Johnston Sakaja has appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta and Nasa leader Raila Odinga to include young people in their unity deal committee. Speaking during this year's Labour day celebrations at Uhuru park, Sakaja noted that the 14-member team unveiled recently did not have representation from the youth. "Together with Uhuru, you constituted a committee and we are proud of you but where are the youth?" he posed. "We want you to add young people in the committee because they are the trustees of prosperity in this nation," Sakaja said.
