Shibeka claimed the suspect had threatened witnesses and that he would interfere with investigations if freed. "We have received information that witnesses who were in the drinking den have been threatened by the suspect's people," he told the court. He added that residents of Mamboleo and Kuria East were baying for Ambani's blood so he would be safer in custody. The accused denied these claims and noted he had been "languishing in custody" and that officers should have completed the probe before holding him. "There is no reason to seek more time and there is nothing like people being threatened by my people," he told the court, adding that he was not arrested as he presented himself to police. Winam Resident Magistrate Caroline Njalale ordered that the suspect stay at Maseno police station for seven more days "for his own security and safety". The case will be mentioned on May 21.
