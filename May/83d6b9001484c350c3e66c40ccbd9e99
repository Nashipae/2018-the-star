The Eldoret prison is the most congested, with 2,000 prisoners, despite a capacity of less than 800. Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions Patrick Gumo said his office is investigating why the prison has remandees with cases pending for more than eight years. He said measures will be taken to reduce the congestion. He spoke on Saturday when he visited the facility. Some inmates at the prison have boycotted going to court to protest delays in finalising their cases. They want Chief Justice David Maraga to visit the prison and tell them when the cases will be concluded. Lawyers, led by LSK chairman in the region Zephania Yego, last week staged protests in the town over what they termed lack of judges to hear pending cases. The lawyers locked the gates at the High Court and urged Maraga to post new judges to the area. Click here for the latest political news
