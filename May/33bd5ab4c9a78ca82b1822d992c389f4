The country is wading
from one tragedy to another, drought to floods, all of which have exposed our crisis
management ability. This is no time to revive our national pastime — the blame
game — but it reminds us of how precarious all these investments can be if we don’t
secure them with clear contingency plans. While
some accidents cannot be prevented, it is the calibre of emergency response that
separates organised states from hapless ones in the management of abnormal
phenomena. Our deepest
condolences go to the families of all those who have lost lives and property in
recent catastrophes. The Patel Dam tragedy in Solai yesterday was particularly horrendous.
Entire families were wiped out, survivors rendered homeless and without
livelihoods by a facility they had all depended on for years. As
the rain continues to pound and relief and emergency services are tested to
their limits, it is time to reflect again about our priorities. Clearly,
disaster preparedness has forced its way to the top of our national agenda. Let's
talk about the Big Five, not Four, agenda. Quote of the Day: “Human beings, who are almost unique in having the ability to learn from the experience of others, are also remarkable for their apparent disinclination to do so.” — Scottish-American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie on May 11, 1904, donated $1.5m to build a peace palace.
