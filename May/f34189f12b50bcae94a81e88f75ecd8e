A firm that demanded Sh11.3 million in legal fees from the Nairobi County has suffered a major setback after the High court slashed the entire fee by 99.7 per cent. Deputy Registrar L. Mumassaba said since the case filed by Koceyo and Company Advocates, dates back to 2017, the court was required to apply the Advocates Remuneration (Amendment) order of 2014. “Based on the foregoing, therefore, the Advocates Clients Bill of Costs dates February 1, 2018, and filed in Court on February 2, 2018, is hereby taxed at Sh368,662.50.

The bill of costs arose from a case lodged by businessman Simon Kamau against the NCC and Director of City Inspectorate. Kamau wanted the two compelled to remove illegal structures and hawkers illegally that were blocking access to his trading space along New Pwani Road, in Nairobi. Kamau argued that his business, located on New Pwani Road, had been affected by the illegal structures. In a swift rejoinder, City Hall argued that the case did not warrant the huge fees and declined to make the payment, prompting the law firm to seek legal redress in February. Koceyo and Company Advocates is among the six firms that auditor general and the county assembly public accounts committee how they were paid Sh113.6 million by the county in 2015-16 financial year.
