Fat Rhinos, who ill-fatedly missed out on second place in the 2017 charge by merely 10 minutes, return to this year’s competition a little more revitalised after entering a worthy partnership with Kenya’s leading bookmakers, SportPesa. Car 24, commonly known as ‘Fat Betty’, a Toyota Land-Cruiser branded in the famous white and blue colours of the mighty gaming platform, will be driven by Jaspal Matharu and will lead the team’s quest to clinch a podium finish in this year’s spectacle. “The Rhino Charge is huge and an important event and a noble cause. We are very excited for this new partnership with Fat Rhinos,” SportPesa’s assistant marketing manager (merchandising), Muthoni Kihanya, said during a recent ‘Fat Rhinos’ annual golf day. The industrious team, who won the Tiger Line at the 2016 Rhino Charge, are eager to finish strongly this time round and the team manager Deven Jadeja also known as ‘Fat Satan’ echoed his teammate’s goal. “Our target for the 2018 Rhino Charge is to have a top 3 (podium) finish, gain knowledge of car set ups and performance, driver/navigator/crew experience and to present a professional sportsmanship team. “I want to thank our sponsors who always stand up for us every year. A massive mention to SportPesa for coming through this year to help out my team and me. Without you, this would not be possible and I do not take it for granted that you chose to be a part of this,” Jadeja underlined.
