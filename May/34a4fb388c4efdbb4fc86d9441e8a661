A businessman has moved to court seeking to block investigations over a disputed parcel of land in Nairobi’s Industrial Area. Mansukhlal Shantilal Patel, a director of Kensalt Limited and Supplies & Services Limited wants the court to bar the Inspector General of Police, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Director of Criminal Investigations from investigating the disputed property. He is also seeking to bar investigators from impounding documents relating to the land , arguing that he will be prejudiced. Patel says the DCI, through Abdallah Komesha has written to him directing that he report at the CID headquarters on Kiambu Road with documents of ownership of the land. But he says the matter is alredy pending in court and asking him to give details will be prejudicial. Gorvas Limited has laid claim to the disputed parcel of land. “In the circumstances, we are of the opinion that your investigations are not merited and parties should be advised to pursue their respective claims before the Land and Environment Court,” Patel says through advocate Boniface Masinde. Komesha says investigations into the matter has stalled since 2012 partly due to non-availability of the directors of the land to record statements and provide copies of ownership and documents in their possession. Komesha rescheduled the summons to May 2 at 10am for purposes of recording the statements from the directors prompting Patel’s application to block the summons.
