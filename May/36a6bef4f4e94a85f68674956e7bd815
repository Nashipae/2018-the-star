Three miners were on Thursday murdered by suspected al Shabab militants in a quarry in Shimbir Fatuma, Mandera South Sub County. Two others were injured during the attack. The quarry is about 65 kilometres from the Kenya-Somalia border. Residents said that the miners were living in the quarries. On 2015 December, Mandera county ordered all quarries closed immediately to save workers from terror attacks.

The then county police boss Job Boronjo said several quarries have been attacked. “The government is not willing to take chances anymore,” he said. More than 3,000 people, mostly non-residents, rely on the mines for upkeep. On December 2 last year, 36 quarry workers were killed by al Shabaab militias. On July 7, 14 people, mostly workers, were killed by militants as they slept in town. Also read: Mandera miners urged to close quarries early  Click here for the latest political news
