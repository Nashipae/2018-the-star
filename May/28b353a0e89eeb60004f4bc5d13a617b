Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tong’i has distributed Sh25 million bursaries to college and university students. He said 3,500 students from poor backgrounds received Sh10,000 each. Tong’i gave out the cheques in Keumbu, Nyanturago, Kiogoro and Kisii Central. He said beneficiaries were thoroughly vetted. “My team gave priority to total and partial orphans who received between Sh8,000 and Sh10,000 each,” the MP said. He urged parents to enrol their children who did not qualify to join tertiary colleges or university to polytechnics so they can gain skills.
