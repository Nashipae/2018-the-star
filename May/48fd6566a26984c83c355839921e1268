Ganze MP Teddy Mwambire wants former provinces made regional governments. He said on Saturday this is the perfect time to realise the dream. "Ronald Ngala who was once a political kingpin in coastal politics fought for majimbo and this is a chance to make it happen. The counties will remain, but we will have the eight former provinces as the devolved units,‚Äù Mwambire said. But Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi said the push to amend the Constitution must not be used to benefit a few individuals.
