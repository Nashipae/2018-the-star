Brenda’s relationship with contemporary music artist Juliani seems to be on the rocks. The two rarely speak about their relationship until they are asked about it. Well, Brenda, on a local TV channel, opened up about the status of their relationship after speculation that they were no longer an item, despite having a daughter together. She confirmed the rumour that the two had parted ways at some point but are now back together. She did not however divulge much about the cause of their split. Well, in a recent interview with Kiss FM’s Chito Ndhlovu on Maloko Show, Juliani was asked about their relationship. He said, “There is no official position on our relationship and maybe everyone is right with what they think.” He said he had to consult himself before commenting about it. On Mother’s Day, Juliani celebrated his baby mama on social media. He defended this saying, “The fact that she has my baby, I will always treasure her and that is why I wished her well during Mother’s Day. I have a song that will reveal to you guys whether we are still dating or not. But I have learnt that human beings have ego.” Adding, “Binadamu hujidai sana [People are arrogant], until you get them in hospital sick or dead. It is high time we humbled ourselves, especially in relationships, and avoid including ego.”
