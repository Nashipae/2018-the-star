The government has destroyed 400 tonnes of
contraband sugar worth Sh38 million at the Mombasa port. Trade CS Adan Mohamed and his Tourism counterpart Najib
Balala poured the sugar into the Indian Ocean. They warned unscrupulous traders against engaging in
illegal trade which denies the government revenue. Fire engines were used to push the sugar into the
water after it was poured onto the ground at the habour next to berth number
one. The sugar was imported from Brazil in February
2016. It was concealed in 16 containers, each having 500
bags of 50kg sacks of the sugar. The consignment was declared as ‘machine parts’, according
to Industrialisation PS Chris Kiptoo. Machine parts are zero rated, meaning they don’t attract
duty. "We will be destroying any
contraband good on site here at the port," the Industrialisation CS said. He said those who will feel aggrieved by the
government are free to move to court. Balala said the government will ensure the Kenyan businesses are protected. "The main objective is to build our own
manufacturing industry. The moment we bring in goods like these, we destroy our
industries," he said. Manufacturing is one the key pillars in President Uhuru’s Big Four
agenda. Others are food security, affordable housing and affordable healthcare to all citizens. The sugar was packaged in Kakira Sugar Ltd branded bags. However, Adan said sugar from Uganda is not
likely to come into Kenya through the port. "Sugar from Uganda will logically enter the country through Western Kenya," the CS said. "We will be back here on Wednesday to lead the destruction of another 160 containers of mixed
contraband goods," Balala said. The 160 containers contained an assortment of
different goods including foodstuff like macaroni, clothes, cooking oil, among
other non-food items. Click here for the latest political news
