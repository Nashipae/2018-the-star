Kenya Simbas stand-in skipper Davis Chenge said there is room for improvement after beating Uganda 34-16 in the first leg of the Elgon Cup in Kampala over the weekend. The Simbas out-scored the Cranes by five tries to one to inch closer to retaining the trophy with the second leg set for July 7 at the RFUEA ground. The Simbas led 29-9 at half time before closing out the game in the second half with a solid defensive effort to keep the Ugandans at bay. “We are still looking at improving. This was the first game of the year and there was an element of rustiness although we started well. We took our opportunities to give ourselves the lead and we held it on to the end,” added Chenge.  He said the win bodes well for the Rugby World Cup qualifiers which start next month with an away tie against Morocco. “Beating Uganda away was good and it will give us confidence for the away matches in the qualifiers. The boys have picked up very good lessons for the future,” added Chenge. Winger Jacob Ojee, centre Leo Seje and lock Oliver Mangeni crossed over in the first half with Darwin Mukidza booting all the points. Flanker Elkeans Musonye scored the bonus try for Kenya before Biko Adema confirmed the white wash. Ivan Magomu was sure with the boot for Uganda, scoring three penalties while Kabras winger Philip Wokorach converted Simon Olet’s try which was the last score for the hosts.
