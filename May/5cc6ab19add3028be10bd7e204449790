Abagusii leaders yesterday met in Naivasha to chart the future of the community. They included 13 MPs, businesspeople and clerics from Kisii and Nyamira. Governors James Ongwae (Kisii) and John Nyagarama (Nyamira) as well as senators Sam Ongeri (Kisii) and Okong’o Omogeni (Nyamira) did not attend. Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi said he skipped because there was no clear agenda. Participants said it was successful. “It was attended by 90 per cent of our leaders. We have discussed a wide range of issues, including our unity, development and the way forward for the community,” Borabu MP Ben Momanyi told the Star. He said they will reach out to other leaders so they can work together. “I want to encourage other leaders to join us. Those spreading rumours should either join us or crash,” Momanyi said.

They agreed to appoint a spokesperson for the region and mooted formation of a political party to champion residents’ interests. “Our resolve to unite our people is unstoppable,” Nakuru West MP Samuel Arama said. Kitutu Chache South MP Richard Onyonka said the meeting was fruitful, despite the boycott by some leaders. “We discussed how to capitalise on the political status after the handshake to empower our people. The meeting was never meant to be controversial. It was done in good faith. Our political scene is fluid and unpredictable,” he said.
