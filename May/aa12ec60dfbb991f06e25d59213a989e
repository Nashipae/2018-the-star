Hundreds of water pans will be built in Murang’a county to harvest rainwater runoff for irrigation and turn the county into a food basket. The free pans will be built by MPs in villages worst hit by drought. They will be able to store water for as long as six months. Six MPs went on a bench-marking visit to Yatta constituency that is successfully harvesting water to irrigate s throughout the year. Agriculture and Irrigation CS Mwangi Kiunjuri said the project will start in a few weeks after farmers are trained. The MPs included Joseph Nduati (Gatanga), Alice Wahome (Kandara), Mary Waithera (Maragua), Ruth Mwaniki (Kigumo), Ndindi Nyoro (Kiharu) and Murang’a Woman Representative Sabina Chege. They visited Kenyatta Village where the Christian Impact Mission has revolutionised farming through water harvesting. The organisation led by Bishop Titus Masika has constructed more than 4,000 water pans and helped farmers jointly market produce. Masika said the Yatta programme started in 2009 during severe drought. Residents were forced to eat cats and dogs, he said. Six months after the programme started, residents were exporting French beans and other produce. Poverty levels dropped dramatically.
