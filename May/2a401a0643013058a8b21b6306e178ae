Some residents of Kisumu have opposed nominees to the city management board. They said the nomination was skewed and partisan. The residents also said there was nepotism and favouritism. Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o has been told to recall the list submitted to the assembly. Kisumu Residents’ Voice Association chairman Audi Ogada alleged that some names were on the list due to corruption. In a letter dated April 12 to the clerk and signed by acting county secretary Olang’o Onudi, Nyong’o nominated 11 people to the board for vetting and approval. “The governor as the head of the executive has nominated the following people through a competitive process,” it reads in parts. The nominees in the individual member category are Lawrence Gumbe, John Omija, Obware Kennedy Akoko, Charles Owoko Ochome, Elijah Adul and Rose Arungu Olende. Peris Ochola was nominated to represent professionals. Former nominated MCA Salim Ahmed was picked to represent the private sector. Former Kisumu mayor Samuel Okello was nominated to represent an association of towns. Sheila Okal was named to head a cluster of registered neighbourhood associations. Sagar Navichandra Shah was selected as representative of registered associations of the informal sector. Ogada said some nominees represented sectors in which they were not shortlisted for interviews. He said the youth have once again been left out, yet they form the largest number of voters. Ogada said they will hold protests and seek legal redress if their demands are not met. Click here for the latest political news
