Closing quarries after last week’s al Shabaab killings was “the most ridiculous decision any government can make”, Mandera Governor Ali Roba said yesterday. Last Thursday night four non-local workers were killed by al Shabaab militants at a quarry in Shimbir Fatuma, Mandera town, near the Somalia border. On Monday the government ordered all quarry workers to leave until security is increased. The government said it is reviewing the quarry fields’ security to ensure that all workers are in a safe environment. But Roba and Mandera East MP Omar Mohamed rubbished the decision. “I have said time and again that matters of security should not be approached in a reactive manner. This decision is counterproductive and does not serve any good,” Roba said. He spoke in Mandera East during a Koran competition. Omar urged the national government to explore other options to solve the problem. Early this week, quarry workers took to the streets following the directive. They wanted to return to work and demanded better security.
