The magistrate released the suspects on a Sh100,000 bail each. Okong’o urged the court to direct the prosecution to supply his clients with witness statements. Mutai set the case for mention on May 25 and hearing on 29 June. Obiri was later taken to the Kisii law courts where he was charged with uttering words in the local language that were aimed at inciting residents to cause violence.
