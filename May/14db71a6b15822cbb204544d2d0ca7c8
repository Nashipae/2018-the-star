Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja yesterday said the city is in a mess and must be fixed as a “matter of urgency”. He pointed out poor drainage systems, impassable roads, traffic jams and insecurity as some of the problems bedevilling Nairobi. "We have witnessed destruction of property and impassable roads when it rains and floods. We have had to evacuate entire schools in parts of the city where students had been marooned,” Sakaja said in a statement sent to the media. "The drainage, water and sewerage systems cannot hold. There is urgent need to reclaim riparian reserves that have been grabbed, and overhaul the water and sewerage infrastructure.” He wants the county government to come up with a long-term solution to traffic jam so residents do not spend most of their time travelling.

The legislator said the state of insecurity is wanting and law enforcers must weed out thugs. Governor Mike Sonko has lately been under siege for the poor state of roads within the city centre. Heavy rains have worsened the situation. Sonko has been criticised for failing to clear the city of heaps of garbage and allowing hawkers to roam freely in downtown. But the county boss has defended himself and blamed his predecessor Evans Kidero, saying he inherited a corrupt system. He has accued “cartels” of ganging up against him to ensure he fails. On Wednesday last week, Sonko nominated his critic Miguna Miguna as his deputy. This drew condemnation from several Jubilee leaders. Sonko however said Miguna was the right choice and would help him fight cartels that have held City Hall hostage.
