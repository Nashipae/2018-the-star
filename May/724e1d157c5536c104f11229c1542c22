In case you were wondering why you can't find Otile Brown and Sanaipei Tande's hot jam 'Chaguo La Moyo', just know the video has been taken down. A disappointed Otile took to social media to express his disappointment. He wrote: "So YouTube just removed #chaguolamoyo from my channel with over 1.4 million views due to copyright claims. Got me wondering why would someone claim for my own sh*t . Damn this is so shady. I work soo hard but people tryna fight me everyday. I seem cool and stupid to some people but am a beast brah and you can’t kill me easily coz I got God's favour in me. I am not even mad I am just disappointed how people can be this mean in this game."
