Hundreds of motorists spend a better part of their day in a huge traffic jam in Limuru after a lorry ferrying sand blocked Mai Mahiu - Narok road. The gridlock, which started at around 1pm, lasted till late in the evening when police cleared the sections restoring traffic flow. A loader of the lorry which caused the obstruction was arrested and taken to custody at the Tigoni police station. The jam stretched from Mutarakwa to the Nairobi-Nakuru highway,
stretching up to Nairobi on one side and Mai Mahiu on the other. The lorry driver was reportedly fleeing from police officers having failed to stop at a weighbridge along the highway. It was during the chase that officers threw spikes under the vehicle causing its rear tyers to burst. Limuru OCPD Bernard Ayoo said the loader is helping police with investigations into the cause of the accident. Finola Ambetsa, a commuter, said they left Nairobi for Kisii at 10am and had not moved an inch as late as 5pm. "We ate the food we had carried at 1pm thinking that we would have arrive home in time to take supper," she said. Abdi Ahmed, a transporter, said: "We need to be inspected at the weighbridge. The police officers are to blame for the traffic snarl-up." Click here for the latest political news
