MPs and senators who suddenly become wealthy must be investigated in the corruption crackdown, Nyeri senator Ephraim Maina has said. Maina said some politicians amass unexplained wealth immediately they join Parliament. “Parliament should revise the law and stop pretending they are also clean. Lifestyle audits should be conducted on leaders who have gotten sudden wealth,” he said yesterday at his Lusoi home. Maina, a wealthy businessman, asked how money could be paid to people who never tendered. He said stern action should be taken against those involved in the Sh468 million National Youth Service scandal.Maina said failure to do so will encourage ordinary citizens to steal. “The reports circulating defy imagination and it is high time leaders of realise the country has only limited resources which should be used people’s welfare,” he said. Speaking separately, Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua asked investigating agencies to deliver swift justice. “We must bite the bullet as a country. We must see prosecution, punishment and recovery of stolen public resources. We must join and support the President in this war against graft. We trust him in leading us to slay the corruption dragon with finality,” said the MP. The MP described the looting of NYS as shocking, consistent and systematic. He said the country was still struggling with common diseases and it was therefore an outrage that colossal amounts of money were lost. He said the money was enriching individuals and was not achieving the target envisaged in the budget.
