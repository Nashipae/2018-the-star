Kitui town will host the Churchill Live show on Saturday June 2 at a local hotel during the three-day Kitui Rugby 7s jamboree, the show's executive director Daniel Ndambuki, aka Churchill, alias Mwalimu King’angi, has confirmed. Ndambuki, who was in Kitui on Thursday to sign a contract for the live show performance, said: “On June 2 for the very first time, the Churchill show together with its entire crew will be right here.” The deal was signed at the Kitui Agricultural Training Centre and was witnessed by Governor Charity Ngilu. Churchill said the June 1-3 rugby tournament will be a great opportunity to showcase what Kitui has to offer to the world. He said he will try to have legions of his fans attend the rugby event. “I have many people who follow me. I hope to reach out to them in the next two weeks to have them follow me here.” "The set-up we are going to build at the stadium will be of its own in Africa. Wait until we put up the banner," Churchill said. He said he is keen to hunt and nurture upcoming Kamba comedians and musicians. "Kambas are exceedingly talented. Join me in identifying the budding Kamba comedians and musicians so we can nurture them for talent growth and economic empowerment." Churchill said. Ngilu said her administration is all set to host the rugby games. She said her administration is humbled to host Churchill “live in Kitui" as it is a much sought-after privilege by many institutions.
