Global
attention is turning to Africa as an investment destination following
discoveries of significant mineral and oil deposits.
Uganda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Ghana and Kenya are poised to join the
ranks of oil-producers. Kenya has major coal deposits, oil has been
found in Tanzania. These
developments have led to a discourse on the role of oil and the extractive sector
in the socio-economic development of East Africa and its  countries. For Kenya to realise its
Vision 2030 sustainable development blueprint, the government must ensure a reliable energy supply.
Demand far outstrips supply and continues to rise. The government has scaled up efforts to
harness geothermal potential and search for oil, natural gas and
coal. In 2010, it set up a committee to fast-track nuclear
power development. Later it announced
discovery of 400 million metric tonnes coal in the Mui Basin.
Announcements were made in 2012 of oil and gas discoveries in Turkana
county. Commercial viability of oil and gas reserves is estimated at one
billion barrels and exploration is ongoing. The
government is keen to promote the oil and extractive industry to drive
long-term sustainable growth, pursuing its Sustainable Development
Goals. These discoveries have been greeted with joy and high expectations
poverty alleviation, higher living standards an broad-based national
development. At the same
time, there is concern over how  the benefits of these resources will be managed and shared. There is fear that
if revenues are not properly planned for — and more importantly,
equitably and transparently utilised through an accountable and transparent
system ensuring fairness in benefit sharing — the resources could turn out to
be a curse rather than a blessing. The current
debate is not misinformed. It is not lost on Kenyans that oil and gas
discoveries have not propelled the major African oil and gas producers to greater
heights, as compared to producers in Western Europe and Asia. In many cases, sizeable petroleum reserves in less-developed
countries have not improved economic performance. Indeed, for
many petroleum-rich, underdeveloped states, exploitation has reduced the
competitiveness of previously productive economic sectors. This has lead to declining
wealth, social and political unrest, increasingly disaffected populations, the emergence
of rebel organisations, government corruption and destabilised domestic
security. While not a deterministic relationship, access to such valuable
resources has pitfalls for less developed states lacking capacity to
properly develop them.  AFRICA'S OIL AND GAS STORY The empirical
connection between a state’s petroleum endowment and its tendency toward poor
economic performance and domestic unrest is well established. This
relationship has led some to claim that access to oil reserves is a
'curse'. While there is nothing inherently destabilising about access
to large oil reserves, petroleum lends itself to mismanagement, yielding
unfortunate economic and security consequences. The literature
on oil and gas resources, especially among oil-producing and exporting
African countries, reveals a worrying picture of poverty and underdevelopment,
generalised violence and insecurity and general misery — amidst plenty of
petrodollars. Poor oil governance and mismanagement have lead to
failure to exploit fortunes to meet citizens' needs and achieve
sustainable development. Examples abound
of countries that struck oil and either immediately nose-dived into misery or
at best continued to wallow in economic stagnation, unfavourable
trade terms, dependency, unemployment and  attendant social unrest — as in their inglorious pre-oil days. Nigeria, for example, Africa’s
largest oil producer and the ï¬fth overall worldwide, is a classical study in
poverty amidst plenty. With proven reserves of 30 billion barrels per day, Nigeria earned $340 billion from 1965 to 2000. But by
2000, income per capita was exactly what it was in
1965! More shocking: 70 per cent of Nigerians were below the poverty line,
earning less than one dollar a day, compared to 36 per cent in 1970. At the same time,
easy petrodollars erased the need for accountability, bred dictatorship,
distorted the social structure, laid large swathes to waste and
reduced the Niger Delta to an ungovernable hellhole. Elsewhere, discovery and exploitation of oil in Gabon literally wiped out
agriculture, industry and commerce, however, the oil has now run out, leaving the
country in an extremely vulnerable position. In Angola, unrealistic expectations of oil riches led to wanton expenditure on white elephant projects,
resulting in  unmanageable national debt. To date, the bulk of oil output
is mortgaged as security for the loans recklessly incurred in anticipation of
income from 'black gold'. As for Equatorial Guinea, not only has
oil bred an
unaccountable government, but also the bulk of earnings have not
translated into incomes for the citizens, who mostly live in penury.
Petrodollars have been deposited into the personal bank account of top
officials in Washington, DC. It is evident,
therefore, that if not managed in a democratic and transparent manner, coal,
oil and gas resources could haunt Kenya for years to come. Whether Kenya
succeeds in turning revenues from non-renewable energy resources
into long-term investments for her people ultimately depends on the quality of
public policy, legal and institutional frameworks, transparency and public
accountability. Simply stated, given the right policy, legal and institutional
frameworks and public accountability, energy resource revenues can be a 'black gold' blessing, rather than a curse.  WHICH WAY KENYA Kenya’s mining, oil and gas policies, legal and institutional
frameworks must be reviewed, as they were enacted or set up long before the
discovery of oil and gas. While some pieces of legislation — 
such as the 2010 Constitution and the outdated Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Act — are in place, they do not
address today's oil industry dynamics. They, for instance, have
no provisions obligating both the government and prospecting
companies to make disclosures both at the contracting and the
revenue-sharing level. Legislation requires urgent amendments to realign
them to both constitutional
requirements and international standards of transparency and
accountability in extractive
industries. Energy resource development companies — like other large businesses
with
highly sophisticated legal advice — take advantage of weak
frameworks to avoid tax liability. According
to the Permanent Secretary in the Energy ministry, a 'farm-in'
transaction
was concluded between Africa Oil and the Turkana Drilling Consortium.
Under this agreement, the consortium transferred 100 per cent working
interest in Block 10BB to Africa Oil in
exchange for a final maximum share transaction amounting to Sh726,574,
820,512. In announced that pursuant to information from Africa
Oil, on paper this was a cashless transaction. Appearing before
Parliament's Energy committee, the PS said though there was a change in
ownership of the company in charge of the
operation, it was done within the law and the transaction itself was
“cashless”. Committee member Ekwe Ethuro, the Turkana
Central MP, is quoted as having said: “The truth of the matter is that
ownership has transferred from one company to another. It is misleading to put
emphasis on what you call a ‘cashless’ transaction.” Note that in 2010, one
of the major players in Uganda’s petroleum Sector, Heritage Oil, sold its
exploration licenses in the Albertine Rift to Tullow Oil. (Heritage and Tullow
together owned a 50 per cent stake in two lucrative exploration blocks: 1 and
3A.) Tullow then became the sole company licensed to operate in those
areas. (In addition to its stake in Blocks 1 and 3A, Tullow also has the sole
exploration rights to Block 2.) Tullow purchased Heritage’s stake for US$1.45
billion, after which Heritage ceased Uganda operations. In the aftermath
of the 'farm-out' deal, the Uganda Revenue Authority demanded $434
million — 30 per cent of the sale — in capital gains taxes. This demand has led
to a protracted legal battle. During  pendency of arbitration proceedings
filed in the United Kingdom, Uganda’s Tax Tribunal heard the dispute and found
in favour of URA. Arbitration proceedings have now been completed and the
court found in favour of Tullow's indemnity claim for $313 million in its entirety and
also dismissed Heritage's counterclaim. A typical 'farm-in' to a mineral property involves eventual transfer
of an interest in the property. Thus, arrangements and details regarding
transfer of any property should
be reviewed to ascertain taxability of the transaction.
Accordingly, the 'farm-in' arrangement and its taxability must be
considered by the minister in conjunction with his consideration of
approval of
the transfer. Taxability of 'farm in/farm out' transactions
require attention to avoid tax disputes. As Uganda’s experience
demonstrates, Kenya needs clear and efficient petroleum industry
taxation provisions. It is opportune for Kenya to rethink the Capital
Gains Tax regime. More pressing, counties and communities hosting oil
and gas exploration projects have started demanding payment from multinational
corporations within their jurisdictions. The cases of a local
authority in Lamu demanding operation fees from GBP Oil Company Limited and
protests by the Turkana community in Lokichar indicate that potentially
serious tensions between interested parties lie ahead.  LEGISLATIVE
PARADOX While the
proposed Petroleum Exploration,
Development and Production Bill is a progressive departure from The Petroleum
(Exploration and Production) Act CAP 308 1986 revised edition, it has significant inadequacies. These include, inter alia: Firstly, it combines petroleum
exploration, development and production with petroleum revenue management and
local content. Thus, it's not as detailed as
necessary to ensure clarity, regulatory certainty and smooth enforcement. Secondly, it makes no provision for an investment framework
for managing petroleum revenues and clear rules for petroleum receipts
and withdrawals from the Sovereign Wealth Fund the government plans to
create. Thirdly,
it gives the Cabinet Secretary too much discretionary power which could easily
be abused. Fourthly,
it lacks important provisions on gas development, eg, pricing and
utilisation, which are necessary in a potential gas-boom country. Fifth, the Bill lacks a comprehensive transparency regime. It should require disclosure of winning bids after public
tender, beneficial ownership information and expenditure from oil revenues — these are contained  reporting requirements of
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Further, the CS wields excessive discretionary
powers, including licensing of petroleum contracts, appointments of heads and
boards of regulatory agencies and performance of regulatory functions. There is
no clear separation between the CS's policy-making and
regulatory roles. Lastly, Parliament’s
role of ratifying petroleum agreements is well articulated in the
Constitution. But since oil and gas is a new and very complex industry,
Parliament cannot swiftly master the expertise to
understand complex and technical matters in the sector,
let alone effectively scrutinise  agreements. Parliament's
capacity challenge therefore limits its oversight power, leaving the CS
and state agencies free to undermine the licensing process. Further, Kenya’s mining, oil and gas policies, legal and
institutional frameworks should be reviewed as they predate discoveries. The upshot is that unless all issues are resolved
before exports starts, we risk mismanaging a rare resource to the
detriment of the nation. Caution must be exercised and the government
must listen to counsel.  The author is a lecturer at Kabarak University and PhD
