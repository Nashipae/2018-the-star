Residents of Muthwani, Mavoko, have been cautioned against illegal sand harvesting. MCA George Kingori on Saturday said sand harvesting has degraded Mavoko and caused pollution. He urged traders to obey the Machakos County Sand Harvesting Act, 2014. He said the act seeks to ensure conservation and improve dealers’ living standards. Kingori said he would sponsor a motion for the county to lift the ban on sand harvesting in parts of Machakos county – including Masinga subcounty – if dealers cooperate and operate in line with the Act. Kingori met youths engaged in sand harvesting, scooping and loading in Muthwani. He accused landowners and cartels of exploiting desperate youths. “The Machakos County Sand Harvesting Act, 2014 will be implemented to help residents,” Kingori said. He said the current system of operation only benefits a few individuals while the majority languish in poverty. “Youths should unite and form saccos. They stand a higher chance of benefiting and improving their living standards as opposed to the current situation where they are exploited,” Kingori said. He said dealers will have access to grants and loans from the Machakos and national governments.
