EALA MP Simon Mbugua and his team were on Sunday stopped from holding a press conference at a city hotel in unexplained circumstances. Mbugua had paid Sh30,000 to book for the event at the Panafric Hotel but the management informed him the function will not take place. Journalists who headed there were also denied access. The MP is said was due to criticise members of the Executive said to be out to undermine the Nairobi county government. Police too have warned East Africa Legislative Assembly lawmaker not to disrupt peace. Mbugua was last week, alongside two others, charged with robbery with violence following an incident where former NCBDA chairman Timothy Muriuki was attacked during a press conference.
