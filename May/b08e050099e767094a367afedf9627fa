The recent attack on Nairobi business lobby chairman Timothy Muriuki was barbaric and heinous, Embakasi East MP Babu Owino and former Starehe MP aspirant Francis Mwangi have said. They urged police to swiftly investigate and arrest the attackers and those behind them. Muriuki is chairman of the Nairobi Central Business District Association. “We want the faces of these people unearthed and they should be punished. We live in a free society where people are free to air their views,” Owino said. Goons on Monday attacked and beat up Muriuki at Hotel Boulevard, where he was addressing a press conference on the challenges the city faces. The goons claimed Muriuki was a conman hired to criticise and tarnish Governor Mike Sonko’s name. But Owino and Mwangi said the perpetrators should not drag Sonko’s name into their “heinous activities”. “We believe the attack was orchestrated by people whose desire was to tarnish the governor’s name and image in society. Police should tell us who they are,” Owino said.
