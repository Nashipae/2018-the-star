Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua yesterday suffered a blow after a court rejected her bid to include video evidence in her petition against Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru. Kerugoya High Court judge Lucy Gitari dismissed the attempt to include the evidence through witness Kefa Sagana. Gitari said the application lacked basis and was irregular. She said the video was captured on a mobile phone and had undergone many computer processes that eroded its authenticity. The court said witness affidavits did not show compliance with the rules of electronic evidence. Gitari said the video evidence was not listed in the affidavit. She said evidence cannot be admitted in isolation, saying it would deny respondents a chance to scrutinise it. “Bringing new evidence at this stage is an ambush to respondents,” Gitari also said. Waiguru’s lawyer Kamotho Waiganjo had urged the court to reject the video evidence, saying its inclusion would be prejudicial. The court also dismissed Karua’s request to admit her agent’s identification documents as part of the affidavit. Two weeks ago, Karua said a flash disk containing evidence of tampering with election materials had gone missing.
