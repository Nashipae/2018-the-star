The Kirinyaga government has launched a door-to-door NHIF registration drive to improve access to healthcare. The exercise kicked off on Friday. It targets 124,000 households. Governor Anne Waiguru urged residents to cooperate and enrol in the National Hospital Insurance Fund programme. “The registration drive will be carried out by community health volunteers who will visit every household to ensure everybody is registered with the NHIF,” she said. She said the county will pay for the registration of vulnerable groups and those with severe disability to ensure they have benefits of insurance. Universal healthcare is a part of the national government’s Big Four agenda. The others are food security, manufacturing and affordable housing. Waiguru said her administration is keen to reform the health sector and will ensure services are available. A registration drive for the Linda Mama programme is ongoing. It ensures pregnant women get free prenatal care, nursing mothers get free postnatal care, she said. The county has increased drug distribution to curb shortages experienced in past years. It has partnered with the Kenya Red Cross to improve disaster management and emergency response. The county plans to build a five-storey medical complex in Kerugoya. It will have state-of-the-art equipment and offer specialised services. It will have a 500-patient bed capacity. According to the latest statistics, NHIF national coverage has increased from 3.8 million in 2013 to 7.2 million currently. The Fifth National Devolution Conference that ended in Kakamega anchored the delivery of Big Four agenda. Waiguru, also the Council of Governors vice chairperson, said the four-day forum would give governors an opportunity to grasp the priority areas.
