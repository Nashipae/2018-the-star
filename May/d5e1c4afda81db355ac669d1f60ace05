Bar operators have criticised the manner in which the Kiambu government is fighting illicit brews, saying it wants to close all outlets. The traders say the county government askaris are looting their stock and stealing cash during raids. Kiambu Liquor Business Owners said the county is using the ungazetted Alcoholic Drinks Control Act 2018 to oppress them. Limuru subcounty chairman James Mungai said bar owners are counting losses following the raids by county askaris who impound their stock without proper documentation. He said crates and bottles belonging to the East African Breweries and Keroche Breweries have been destroyed and others confiscated. The traders have asked the liquor manufacturers and national government to intervene. A lot of revenue collected from liquor sale is going to waste, Mungai said. He added that bar owners were left out in the drafting of liquor laws signed by Governor Ferdinand Waititu on March 7. “Everybody is concerned about the askaris who do not wear uniforms. They loot valuables,” he said. Mungai spoke in Limuru town on Tuesday when he met liquor officials from Lari, Limuru, Githunguri and Kabete. Operator Ann Kinyanjui said she reported one senior official at the Kiambu police station. She said the man assaulted and indecently handled her when more than 30 askaris raided her bar at Githiga on Sunday. Kinyanjui said the officer slapped and hit her before destroying her computer. “He took my Sh90,000 cash and assaulted me before he was asked to stop. I was treated at the Kiambu Hospital,” she said. Githunguri chairman Charles Njugi asked Waititu to review the laws again and involve the operators in drafting another. “The askaris he is using are idlers. They are not skilled,” he said. “The governor is supposed to involve us in descion making. We are not opposed to the fight against illicit brew. Not all outlets sell illegal alcohol.” Click here for the latest political news
