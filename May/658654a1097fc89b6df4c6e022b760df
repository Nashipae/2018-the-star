Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti has partnered with a Turkish organisation to build a Sh3.8 billion ultramodern hospital. The ground breaking took place on Wednesday at the Homa Bay County Referral Hospital. Construction of the two hospitals, which will stand next to each other, is set to begin in two months. Governor Awiti signed an MoU with the Turkish organisation - Delta Trade Company, and Standard Medical Group led by managing director Ian Okundi. The 210-bed hospital is expected to supplement the current 250-bed referral facility. Awiti said his government provided land for the construction while the investors will contribute the funds. The project, executed under a public-private partnership, will take 12 months and will be handed over to the Homa Bay government after 30 years. Delta Trade Company was represented by its President Huseyin Sahin. "Let detractors to give us time. We have just done ground breaking of this project hence we should be allowed to finish it," Awiti said. Sahin said his organization had over 22 years of developing hospitals in Turkey and is currently extending its reach in rural parts of Africa. "We are going to apply the experience we have to ensure this county gets the best health facility," Sahin said. Click here for the latest political news
