Construction of a Sh4.1 billion dam in Bumula constituency will start this year despite protests from villagers demanding higher companesation. Water and Irrigation Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelgui yesterday said the dam will be built in Sio Sango village and construction will take four years. However, villagers protested over the Sh750,000 per acre compensation, calling it too little. They said it’s based on valuation done three years ago. Chelgui said officers from his ministry will meet villagers to work out compensation and reach ”common ground”. “If the project will touch on anybody’s land, I am assuring you that they will be properly compensated. As government we want to ensure that everyone is well taken care,” he said in Sio Sango yesterday. He said the dam will irrigate 1,700 hectares and serve 20,000 people in Kakamega, Busia and Bungoma counties. A dam 24 metres high, with a storage capacity of 3.92 million cubic metres, will support irrigated agriculture for 1,700 hectares and a small 260KW hydropower station, Chelgui said. He was accompanied by his Devolution counterpart Eugene Wamalwa, Governors Wycliffe Wangamati (Bungoma) and Sospeter Ojaamong (Busia) and MCA Vitalis Wangila. Wangamati said compensation rates should be increased because the deal was negotiated three years ago. “I call on your office to have a sit-downdown with all stakeholders, with a view to review the compensation rates for those who will be affected,” the governor said. Wangila said the compensation offered is too little to sustain villagers who will neeed to relocate. Click here for the latest political news
