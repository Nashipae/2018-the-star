Two students from Ol Joro Orok Secondary School are in police custody after they were arrested on Saturday at Ol Kalou for being drunk. The students allegedly took advantage of the Annual Humanity Walk organized in the area to indulge in the act. The two, whose names were not given, were part of a group of students who took part in the exercise that was organized by the Nyandarua county branch of the Kenya Red Cross. The walk kicked off at the County Commissioner’s office at 10 am, went via Ol Kalou-Nyahururu road, turned off at J.M.Hospital before ending at the Ol Kalou Catholic grounds for speeches and prizes. Police that were providing security at the Catholic grounds picked out the two from the other students after they noticed them behaving in uncivilised manner that was becoming a nuisance. Sharon Gichohi, a teacher that had accompanied the students, disowned the culprits when the media sought her comment. “They are not my students”, she said. The students denied that they were drunk. They said they had only taken an energy drink which they bought from a local supermarket. They could not, however, produce the receipts as proof or show police officers where they dumped the empty cans. The supermarket denied selling alcohol to them prompting Ol Kalou OCS Mark Masinde to demand to view the CCTV footage. The reviews indicated that the students had not entered the store from between 8 am when it was opened to around 1 pm when they were arrested. The students were locked up at the Ol Kalou police station as police officers wait for them to own up and disclose where they bought the alcohol. This will enable them take legal action against the trader that may have sold them the drinks because it is illegal to sell alcohol to children. Click here for the latest political news
