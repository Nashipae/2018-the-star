National Cereals and Produce Board CEO Newton Terer has resigned. Terer confirmed his resignation yesterday without giving reasons. He denied that he was suspended. The resignation came after eight top NCPB officials were suspended to pave way for investigations on the boards operations. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the DCI are conducting the probe. “There was nothing like suspension. I just decided to resign,” Terer told the Star on the phone. Sources said he was suspended by Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri. Kiunjuri is expected to visit the NCPB headquarters today during which he will announce changes at the board. “I have no information on what is happening but I will inform you as soon as I get anything,” NCPB spokesman Titus Maiyo said. “Kiunjuri will meet with the board before announcing the changes.” The board is being investigated over suspected diversion of subsidised fertiliser sold to unscrupulous traders. The government also wants to know how importers were allowed to supply maize to NCPB. The NCPB chairman, Mutea Iringo, on Friday said culprits will face disciplinary action. “The investigations are going on and action will be taken against any government officials who may have been involved in graft or acts which caused the problems at the board,” he said. Iringo spoke after visiting the ELdoret depot on Friday. Sources said Terer was among officials questioned over operations at the board. Initial investigations indicate officials may have diverted more than 10,000 bags of subsidised fertiliser which was repackaged by unscrupulous traders and sold out to farmers at higher prices. Moiben MP Sila Tiren and Kenya Farmers Association director Kipkorir Menjo said the government should identify the brokers and prosecute them. During Kiunjuri’s visit to Eldoret recently, Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago accused Terer of laxity.
