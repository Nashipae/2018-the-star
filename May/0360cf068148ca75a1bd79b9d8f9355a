Embu maize farmers have been urged to spray their crops to kill armyworms. Agriculture executive Ann Nyaga yesterday warned the pest could become voracious as the rains subside. “The worms tend to multiply rapidly during sunny intervals. Farmers must remain vigilant,” Nyaga said in an alert sent out to farmers. Armyworms have invaded farms in several counties with the government struggling to contain the outbreak. Nyaga urged farmers to spot the larvae and immediately spray pesticides, saying it was the most effective way of dealing with the vermin. “The county has trained agriculture officials in maize crop management to prevent infestation and reduce damage caused by armyworms,” Nyaga said. She told farmers to consult scouts in the subcounties for more information on how to control the armyworms. Nyaga also urged farmers to adopt inter cropping with insect repellent legumes. The intercrops emit substances that repel the stem borer moths and armyworms. Last month, experts said the armyworm might ravage farms for the rest of the year as the pest gets into its reproductive cycle. Armyworms are very voracious during the cycle.
