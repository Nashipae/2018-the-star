Opposition leader Raila Odinga has said his legacy when he finally exits the arena of politics would be to see a united Kenya devoid of tribalism. He said his focus for the next few years is to unite Kenyans to a point where they do not “feel as strangers in their own country”. “I will be happy to see every Kenyan free to move around the country and be able to realize their potential, I will feel that I will have lived a peaceful life,” Raila said. He spoke when he paid a courtesy call to ailing business mogul Chris Kirubi at his Loresho home. Kirubi has been battling cancer for quite some time now. Raila's remarks echoed the March 9 unity pact he reached with President Uhuru Kenyatta for what the duo said was for purposes of uniting the country. The two leaders later coined the ‘Building Bridges Initiative’ which they said would steer a national dialogue towards uniting the country. They appointed a 14 member committee of experts to run the programme. The team was mandated with moving around the country to listen to issues that Kenyans are facing. This will culminate in the rollout of reforms to ensure prosperity, fairness and dignity for all Kenyans. Click here for the latest political news
