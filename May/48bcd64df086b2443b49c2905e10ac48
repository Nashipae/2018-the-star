About
563 cases of child abuse have been reported at Ndhiwa subcounty children's
office in the last six months. Area
children officer John Kabasa said the cases include child labour and
defilement. Speaking
on Monday at Rapedhi children home when they marked the World Orphans
day,  Kabasa said the cases have hampered a majority of children's
development. “Many
children are facing hurdles in life in this region because of child
abuse. Most of them fall prey on the hands of wrong people who molest
them,” Kabasa said. Kabasa
said his office has engaged several community based organizations to
create awareness on the dangers of child abuse. The
children's officer said his office is collaborating with provincial administration
to assist them in promoting children's rights. “We
have been able to arrest several suspects who are believed to be engaging in
child abuse. This was made successful through collaboration between
local administrators and the children’s office,” he said. Ndhiwa
DCC Walter Nyamongo said the cases may be more than the ones on record. “Most
of the cases are solved domestically instead of being reported to relevant authorities,”
Nyamongo said. He
warned locals against using kangaroo courts to solve the matters. “We’re
not going to give room to such people .The kangaroo court friends will be
punished for their action,” he added. The
DCC further accused some families in the area of engaging their daughters in
early marriages. He
said the government does not recognize such marriages and the perpetrators will
be apprehended. *END* The
County Commissioner said upto 1429 households in the area have been enrolled in
the child transfer program. The
households benefit from funds from the national government.
