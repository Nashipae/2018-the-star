Instagram has finally added a mute button that lets you ignore people without upsetting them. The feature lets you remove people's posts from your news feed without the risk of them finding out. A similar feature is available on other social media platforms, including Twitter and Instagram's parent company Facebook. But it has never been available on Instagram, forcing users to unfollow someone and risk offending them if they didn't want to see their photos. The mute button has already rolled out to a 'small number' of iOS users and will expand to all users in the coming weeks, Instagram said. The firm said in a statement: 'When you mute an account, you can still see posts on their profile page and get notified about comments or posts you're tagged in. 'The accounts you mute will not be aware that you've muted them. 'You can always unmute an account to get their posts back in your feed.' To mute someone's account, tap the menu button in the corner of one of their posts. From there, select 'mute' to stop their photos from popping up in your news feed - the user will not be notified that you have muted them. You can also select 'mute posts and stories' to also block their Instagram stories from appearing in the app. You can also mute posts and stories by pressing and holding on a story in your tray, or from a profile. Instagram previously allowed users to mute stories, but had previously chosen not to extend this feature to news feed posts. The company also announced today it is testing a feature that tells you when 'you're all caught up' with posts. Instagram said the feature is an attempt to help users combat compulsive online browsing and understand how much time they spend online. The alert tells users when they have seen 'all new posts from the past 48 hours'. It is unclear if the notification means users have seen every post during the previous two days or just the ones Instagram's algorithm has highlighted. Click here for the latest political news
