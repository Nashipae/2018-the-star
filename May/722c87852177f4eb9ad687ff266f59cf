Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka and Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati have opposed calls for a referendum to change the Constitution. They said sending the country back to an election mood will derail development and raise political temperatures. “We are not opposed to constitutional change, but we all know we have just come from an electioneering period and the economy has not picked,” Lusaka said on Saturday in Musikoma, Bungoma. Lusaka said previous referendums polarised the country and the timing to start a referendum debate is wrong. He said Kenyans should be allowed to enjoy peace after Opposition leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta buried the hatchet and are trying to unite people. Wangamati said call for constitutional amendments are ill-timed and will only hurt development. “If we go back to campaigning nobody will work,” he said. three-tier proposal Last month in Kakamega, Raila proposed radical constitutional changes to create a three-tier system of government. The third level, provincial, would be a bridge between the national and county governments to ensure a seamless relationship between the two and equitable development across the country. “My proposal is that we adopt a three-tier system that retains the current counties, creates regional governments and retains the national government and with a very clear formula for revenue sharing,” Raila told delegates during the Fifth Devolution Conference. The proposals are similar to the provisions in the 2005 Bomas Draft Constitution that proposed 14 regional governments. The Opposition leader said the third structure will boost development in the 47 counties. Raila said his proposal is part of the unity deal with Uhuru on March 9. Its details are still shrouded in mystery. Raila said he favoured elements from the Bomas Draft. “We need to bite the bullet and revisit the structure of devolution. It is time to look at how to recover this original spirit,” he said.
