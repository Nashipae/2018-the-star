"The camps have challenges as it is still raining. In Tana River out of the 64, 000 people only 4,000 got shelter, others are at risk of water-borne diseases because the camps don’t have toilets," he said. He said they have established 108 camps in Tana River and eight in Kilifi which are hosting the flood victims. Today, KRC will distribute non-food items for 4,500 families in Tana River. Musa said they have also dispatched a medical team with a mobile clinic in the two counties to begin addressing the health risks. "We evacuated a number of people in Tana River, the area is inaccessible, we are deploying a boat from Lamu that has a capacity of carrying 10 tonnes to carry food and non-food items," he said. He said the county government of Tana River has given two-speed boats to assist with the evacuation. On education, Musa said 49 schools in Tana River and 12 in Kilifi are yet to open due to the floods.
