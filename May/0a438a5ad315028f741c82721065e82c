Kisii University students have been transferred from Kabarnet to campuses in Eldoret and Nakuku after the college was over rent arrears. The Kabarnet Town Campus has Sh10 million arrears. Director Chang’masa Sogomo said they had struggled to pay rent since the college was established in 2014. “It has been a hard task running the campus with fewer than 1,000 students. The majority of them were not able to pay fees on time,” Sogomo said. Students yesterday left the college for their new campuses. Last week, Baringo Governor Stanley Kiptis told students and staff the county would clear the arrears. Kiptis said he had talked to the university council which agreed to retain the college. “This is to inform you that the university management board approved the closure of the campus by May 1,” a memo signed by VC John Akama stated. Some students protested their transfer, saying they were unable to meet the costs of studying outside their home county. “The majority of us are from poor families and cannot afford the expenses of going to study in other campuses,” Antony Chemase said. Students asked the county to clear the debt and keep the university open. The university had also earmarked Migori, Kapenguria and Kitale campuses for closure to cut costs. “Local leaders and county governments intervened and stopped the shutdown. We don’t understand why Baringo leaders failed to avert this closure,” student Hosea Cheboi said. Kisii is the latest university to close its campus in Baringo after Egerton, Bugema and Mt Kenya in 2012.
