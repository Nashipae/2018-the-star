Nairobians and Kenyans at large have in the past few weeks been treated to theatrics involving the running of Nairobi county affairs. Governor Mike Sonko has repeatedly claimed some people in the national government want to bring him down. The nomination of lawyer Miguna Miguna as Sonko’s deputy governor has generated much debate. Amidst the hullabaloo, the provision of essential services in the country’s capital remains wanting. The city is choking on garbage with some streets utterly filthy and stinking. Some alleyways and back streets within the CBD have been turned into dumpsites and the situation has been made worse by the heavy rains pounding the city. Most roads, right from the estates into the CBD, have been impassable and many have huge potholes. Traffic jams, muggers, hawkers, the chaotic matatu industry and street families sum it all up — a lost city. Yet the leaders entrusted to manage the capital and deliver to the people continue engaging in meaningless theatrics. This is distressing. The leaders in both county and national governments must know they hold offices in trust for the public. The leaders have a clear mandate, to deliver services to the people. And Nairobians and Kenyans in general are demanding nothing less.  Quote of the day: “Action indeed is the sole medium of expression for ethics.” — Jane Addams.
