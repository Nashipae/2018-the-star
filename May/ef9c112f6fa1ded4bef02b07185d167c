Caroline Karugu was sworn in as Nyeri deputy Governor on Friday after the majority of MCAs approved her appointment. The seat fell vacant after Mutahi Kahiga, the then deputy governor, took over as county chief following the death of Governor Wahome Gakuru in a road accident in November last year. Majority leader James Kanyugo moved the motion to debate the Committee on Appointment’s report on Karugu’s vetting. The Mahiga MCA said the committee unanimously found her suitable for the position after she scored 92 per cent, surpassing the pass mark. “The nominee was well versed with the mandate of the office and she had a good understanding of the challenges facing the county and the modalities of addressing them,” Kanyugo said. The committee recommended her approval by the County Assembly. Kanyugo said Karugu’s appointment as deputy governor at the age of 40 is a big score for the youth.“Even women are in support of this nominee,” he said. Kajiado Deputy Governor Martin Moshisho was 34 years old when he was sworn in last year. Some MCAs led by deputy speaker Samuel Kariuki opposed Karugu’s appointment. Kariuki questioned Karugu’s qualifications and said she does not have residents’ interests at heart. “Nothing visible in the county that can be traced to the individual,” Kariuki said.
