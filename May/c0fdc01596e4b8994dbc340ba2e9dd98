The government will register more than 2.5 million farmers to benefit from subsidies. DP William Ruto (pictured) on Sunday urged leaders to ensure the programme succeeds so unscrupulous businesspeople do not deprive poor Kenyans of what is meant for them. "We want to partner with the county governments,” he said in Kitale. Ruto said each farmer will be issued with an identification document to be used to access the subsidies. "This will make it easy for us to identify eligible famers. In future, we’ll not have the kind of shortages we are experiencing," he said. The DP said the government has lost a lot of cash meant to benefit farmers. The government will spend Sh12 billion — way above the Sh4.5 billion it had set aside - to buy maize, he said. "We have a challenge. Middlemen and cartels have invaded the business of fertiliser and maize distribution. When we bring fertiliser and maize, middlemen take advantage," he said, adding they are to blame for pending debts.
