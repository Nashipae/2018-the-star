Former MCAs are on the spot for failing to repay millions of taxpayers’ money after getting mortgage and car loans during their tenure. The Auditor General Edward Ouko’s audit report for the year ended June 30, 2017, tabled in Senate on Thursday, for instance, reveals that Sh27 million loan arrears had not been recovered from Bungoma MCAs. Ouko blames the county’s loans management committee for failing to recover the amount from MCAs. He also put the County Assembly on the spot for not repaying Sh88.9 million it borrowed from the MCAs Car and Mortgage Fund. “The Assembly has borrowed from the Car and Mortgage Fund since its inception in 2014 a total of Sh133,247,095 and refunded Sh44,316,635 leaving an outstanding balance of Sh88,930,460,” reads the report. “It is not clear how the Assembly intends to pay back the Fund leaving the Assembly with huge borrowing thus irregular as it contravenes Section 142 of the Public Finance Management Act 2012 on borrowing by county government entities.” The MCAs Car and Mortgage Fund received a total of Sh314.5 million in the four years of operation from the Bungoma County Revenue Fund, according to the auditor. However, Ouko questions the manner in which the money, being a revolving fund, was used on grounds the guiding principles were not adhered to. “The revolving fund principles dictates that at the end of the MCAs’ term, the Fund balance should be equal to the initial funds disbursed which were not the case as at 30 June 2017,” Ouko says. “Consequently, the objective of the Fund to continue as a revolving fund for the upcoming MCAs might not be achieved.” The auditor general expressed doubt on the Scheme’s ability to continue offering services as a revolving fund since it had a deficit of Sh25.8 million. Nairobi City County Assembly is also on the spot, Ouko demanding answers on how the Assembly’s Service Board Car Loan Scheme worth Sh296 million as at 30 June 2017 was managed following a contradicting figure of Sh294 million during the same period. “The resulting difference of Sh2 million has not been explained satisfactorily. Consequently, the completeness and accuracy of car loan fund account balance of Sh294 million as at June 2017 cannot be confirmed,” Ouko says. The auditor also points out that a total of Sh45 million was irregularly transferred in 2016-17 financial year from the Car Loan Fund bank account for various unexplained purposes without approval by the Finance county executive committee officer. Ouko holds the Nairobi County Assembly responsible for violating Sections 116 (3) and (4) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2012 from transferring the money irregularly.
