Ouma National women’s football team Harambee Starlets’ head coach David Ouma is spoilt for choice ahead of the Africa Women Cup of Nations second round qualifier against Equatorial Guinea at the Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos on June 6. Ouma revealed that new call-ups Annette Kundu (Eldoret Falcons), Phelistus Kadari (Vihiga Queens), Anita Adongo (Oserian Ladies), Ruth Ingosi (Eldoret Falcons) and Faith Kwamboka (Thika Queens) have impressed in training, leaving his with a tough task of picking his final team ahead of the crucial encounter. The five, Ouma admitted, are giving regulars a run for their money. Kundu will jostle for goalkeeping slot against Pauline Atieno and Lilian Awuor while Kadari and Adongo will come up against Wendy Achieng, Dorcas Sikobe, Dorris Anyango, Elizabeth Ambogo, Lilian Adera and Vivian Nasaka in defence. Ingosi and Kwamboka will face competition from Cheris Avilia, Sheryl Angachi, Corazon Aquino and Caroline Anyango in midfield. Ouma said the competition for slots is what they need when they come up against a side that has won the AWCON twice and graced the World Cup. He said: “The new players are amazing and they are proving a thing or two in why we drafted them in the provisional squad of 26. We will have to scratch our heads hard when we sit down to pick our final team.” “Our opponents are no pushovers and that’s why we are having three sessions (two for practicals and one on mental strength). They are the stumbling block for us in as far as a second AWCON appearance is concerned and that’s why we are burning the mid-night oil to ensure that all the departments work in unison.” Ouma noted that during the first round qualifier against Uganda, the forwards were not clinical but remained hopeful they will turn up against the West Africans.
