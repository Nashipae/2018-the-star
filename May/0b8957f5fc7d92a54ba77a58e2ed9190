The judgment will be delivered on June 14 in an appeal against a High Court ruling upholding Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o’s victory. Former Governor Jack Ranguma filed the appeal. He wants Nyong’o’s election nullified. Ranguma said the High Court misinterpreted the grounds of his petition. He accused Justice David Majanja, who dismissed the case, of making errors by disregarding witness statements. After hearing submissions, a three-judge appeal bench said the verdict will be delivered in Kisumu. Advocate Richard Onsongo for Ranguma criticised the High Court ruling. He said the election was marred by irregularities that could not be ignored. IEBC lawyer Brian Mukele, however, dismissed the appeal as ambiguous. James Orengo, representing Nyong’o, urged the judges to dismiss the appeal.
