Fifty crocodiles have been seized at Heathrow airport after their transport conditions breached regulations. The year-old reptiles, which arrived on a flight from Malaysia, had fought each other during the journey due to their cramped circumstances. Each of the five transportation boxes used had room for four crocodiles - but 10 foot-long animals were in each one. A Border Force spokesman said "little attention" had been paid to the crocodiles' welfare. One crocodile has since died. The animals had been destined for a farm in Cambridgeshire - where they were to be bred for meat - but are now being cared for by officials from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). The remaining 49 crocodiles will be re-homed, a Home Office statement said. Grant Miller, head of the national Border Force CITES team at Heathrow, said: "It is just not acceptable for reptiles to be transported in this way." He added: "We will seize anything that contravenes CITES regulations, so this should serve as a warning to those thinking about transporting wildlife in such conditions."
