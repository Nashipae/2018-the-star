A young Kenyan man who slipped and fell into a river in Canada two weeks ago is yet to be found. Meredith Sambu, who is in his mid-20s, reportedly slipped and fell backwards into the Squamish River on May 13 while on a camping expedition with friends at the Ashlu Forest Service Road. He is a son to Pamela Otenyo, a deputy immigration officer. The incident happened at night and witnesses told police they could not trace him due to darkness. Canadian police are still searching for him, although death by drowning cannot be ruled out. "We are asking those in the area who see anything in the river or along the riverbanks to contact the RCMP immediately,” a Canadian online news site, The Chief, quoted Cpl. Sasha Banks as having said on May 13. Two weeks later, the search has borne no fruits. “There are daily efforts being made by Squamish RCMP as well as coinciding searches from Squamish SAR,” the site quoted Banks on May 23. Banks said the search operation was being assisted by police helicopter which combed over the area multiple times. The search and rescue teams also conducted boat and land searches with a police dog and uniformed officers. The Squamish River is said to be aggressive with fast running water especially now that snow has melted. "Water can look tame, but it's relentless. It's powerful. We have logjams and other hazards on the river, people need to respect it and understand it, and be very careful around it,” Mayor Patricia Heintzman told The Chief.
