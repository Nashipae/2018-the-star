The Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association term two Sub-County games get underway this weekend in various schools across the county. The event will see lineups battle for top honours in rugby sevens, football (both under 16 and 19), netball, volleyball, racket games (badminton, lawn tennis and table tennis), athletics (cross country, decathlon and heptathlon). Meanwhile, Lenana School will host Nairobi Region games between June 29 and July 1. NRSSSA secretary general, Moses Mbuthia said they are looking to qualify the best performing sides in each discipline. “Our schools are very competitive and I believe, as it has been the norm, we will produce the best teams to face their equals at the nationals. In addition to the titles we will be defending, our teams are preparing to grab more trophies,” noted Mbuthia. “All teams must adhere to KSSSA’s rules and most paramount, abide by the eligibility guidelines,” he added. Competitions have been spaced out in the region to give teams advancing to the next level enough time to prepare and polish themselves. Some of the titles the region will be defending are football girls under 16, won by Olympic Secondary and the under 19 trophy courtesy of Upper Hill. The region is eager to grab the boys’ rugby sevens and reclaim the boys’ volleyball title they last won through Hospital Hill in 2015. In girls’ volleyball, Soweto Academy will be looking to floor regional opposition to romp to the nationals where they are yet to win the title in their two appearances (2016 and 2017).
