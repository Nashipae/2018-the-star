Police in Buru Buru are investigating if some officers are colluding with criminals. This is after three suspected thugs were gunned down and a pistol, police boots and uniforms recovered. The three were shot dead at the weekend along Komarock Road. Police also recovered an AK-47 magazine loaded with four bullets and a mini Ceska pistol with four bullets. A police report filed at Dandora police station yesterday shows officers on patrol received information that four men, known to be criminals, had been sighted at their hideout in Ogopa area. The four started shooting at police during an operation to flush out the criminals from a house they were hiding in. Police fired back and killed three suspects. They did not have identification documents. A fourth suspect is reported to have escaped on foot. Yesterday, a senior police officer at Buru Buru police station said the probe will focus on the source of the police uniforms and possibility that some rogue cops could have given them to the criminals.
