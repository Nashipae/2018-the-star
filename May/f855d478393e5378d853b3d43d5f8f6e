Despite the handshake ending hostilities between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga, the hearing of a case against Ruaraka MP Tom Kajwang in connection to the January 30 oathing ceremony continued yesterday. Kajwang is charged with being present and consenting to the administration of an oath to commit the capital offence of treason contrary to section 59(a) of the penal code. The case before chief magistrate SN Mbugi started on Tuesday. Kajwang’s lawyers James Orengo and Peter Kaluma said the presence of Kajwang at Uhuru Park cannot constitute an offence. Kaluma said his client did not participate in the swearing-in as alleged and state witnesses have not proved his offence . “The prosecution has not provent my client spoke on that day and prosecutors are trying to block cross-examination of witnesses,” he said. The charge sheet shows Kajwang administered an oath to Raila, purporting to bind him to commit treason. The legislator also faced a second count of taking part in an unlawful assembly without notifying the Nairobi police boss. The lawyers yesterday said there is a need for explanation on the issue of identification to see if the suspect was present during the oathing. The case continues on June 6.
