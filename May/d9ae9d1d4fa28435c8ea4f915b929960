The Judicial Service Commission has urged the court to overturn a directive by the salaries agency capping its paid monthly meetings to eight. Lawyer Issa Mansur yesterday told High Court Judge Chacha Mwita limiting members’ sittings was wrong, unlawful and should not be allowed. He said unless the decision by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission was stopped, the JSC would be unable to discharge its duties. “In seeking to limit sittings, the SRC has acted in violation of the JSC Act, which states that the commission can hold meetings as it deems necessary,” the lawyer said.

In a December 2013 circular, the SRC issued the directive to prevent abuse. Secretary Anne Gitau, in a letter dated July 27, 2016, revealed some members drew sitting allowances for meetings that were not properly constituted. “The petitioner’s members got huge allowances from unchecked and unlimited number of sittings,” she said. But Mansur said financial autonomy was a key pillar for all independent commissions and the JSC must, therefore, be allowed to carry out its functions without interference. He argued that the SRC acted beyond its mandate and assumed powers meant for Parliament. It was the role of the National Assembly to allocate funds to independent commissions, Mansur said. “The SRC should not act as a prefect for other commissions. It can only recommend to Parliament to make such decisions,” he said. The salaries agency, however, defended its directive. It said if the JSC had its way, there would be an unnecessarily increase in the wage bill to unsustainable levels. The agency said it had the mandate to settle the sitting allowances of the JSC members just like for any other state officers, and capping their sittings was, therefore, necessary.
