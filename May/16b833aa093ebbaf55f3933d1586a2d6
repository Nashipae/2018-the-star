The Nairobi county government will soon roll out a voluntary early retirement exercise for its staff, especially those approaching 50 years of age. Governor Mike Sonko on Tuesday said a majority of the 13,000 county staff are too old and will retire in ten years time. "I have approved rolling out this program of voluntary early retirement. No one will be forced to retire. Those who feel that are strong enough to work hard can continue working," Sonko said.
