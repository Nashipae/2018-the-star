Another showdown looms at JKIA on Wednesday next week when deported NRMKe General Miguna Miguna will make his second attempt to get into the country. The government blocked Miguna from entering Kenya in March and he was finally flown to Dubai from where he proceeded to Canada. “I’m a Kenyan born citizen. I have a right to enter and leave Kenya as I wish like everyone else. The court has affirmed my rights and I will not waive any of my rights, which don’t vest at the whim of any politician,” he said yesterday. Miguna has been at the centre of a government crackdown on people believed to have facilitated NASA leader Raila Odinga’s swearing-in ceremony in Uhuru Park on January 30. Raila and Uhuru have made up and are championing national unity and reconciliation. Miguna has dismissed their deal.
