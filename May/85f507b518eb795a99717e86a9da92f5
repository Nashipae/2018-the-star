The Nyeri government has bought 100 beehives worth Sh1.8 million. Governor Mutahi Kahiga on Friday urged residents to adopt beekeeping to improve their livelihoods. “Distribution of the hives will be spread across other regions in subsequent phases,” he said as he gave them to 10 groups in Mahiga, Othaya constituency. Each group received 10 beehives, one machine for refining honey, and harvesting tools — a smoker, comb, brush, two sets of protective gear and one double stainless steel sieve. Farmers from Tetu, Nyeri South, Mathira West, Mathira East and Kieni East received hives. The region produces 72,000kg honey worth Sh36 million annually. A farmer can harvest as much as 10kg honey from a single beehive. It is worth Sh10,000. Agriculture executive Henry Kinyua said they will train farmers in modern beekeeping. “The county has very good potential for beekeeping, which farmers should exploit to reap maximum benefits,” he said. Kinyua said problems include costly farm inputs, inefficient marketing systems, low productivity and small, uneconomical land parcels. He said bees play a crucial role in boosting food security, as they also help in pollination. Present at the hand-over were Deputy Governor Caroline Karugu, assembly Majority leader James Kanyugo and prominent farmer Esau Kioni.
