The Director of Public Prosecutions has ordered the arrest and prosecution of Idakho East MCA in Ikolomani constituency for alleged involvement in robbery with violence. Benson Manuni is accused with two others of attacking Seth Winjira in his home in Kasavayi village on September 10 last year. In his statement, Winjira said he identified Manuni, Jackson Mateba and Shisia Shikoli during the attack. He said they robbed him of a mobile phone and Sh2,500. Winjira said they also slashed his hands and hit his head with a blunt object. “We direct that all the three suspects mentioned by the complainant be apprehended and charged with robbery with violence and causing grievous harm,” the letter signed by prosecution counsel Joan Tarus of Kakamega county reads. Manuni said he was in Nairobi at the time of the attack and dismissed it as a witch-hunt by his rivals. The ward rep said his political rivals are trying to “fix me”. “I’m surprised that the case is still on because I thought that file had been closed. But I can tell you they can’t nail me on this one, because the people who attacked him are well known,” Manuni said yesterday. Tarus said the issue of Manuni availing receipts showing he was in Nairobi at the time of attack can be raised in his defence, if need be. She said there is sufficient evidence to prove the two charges against the accused.
