Garissa High School students yesterday took to the streets to protest against the grabbing of part of the institution’s land. The students destroyed stalls erected on the land then marched to the county headquarters, which houses the governor’s office. They blocked Kismayu and Lamu roads, causing traffic snarl-ups, as they chanted “Haki yetu (our rights)”. The students carried placards that read ‘We want our land back’, ‘Our land our education’. Some teachers joined the students in the protest. The students said they will stage protests until a private developer is stopped from building stalls on the disputed land. They said the developer took advantage of the April holidays to fence off the land and build stalls. Some students held a demo on April 25, after the developer started erecting the fence. Justice Regional education director Aden Sheikh told the students to go back to class after delivering their petition. He said no school property would be stolen. “We have heard your complaints. We will address the issue. We will ensure justice is done,” Sheikh said. Garissa county commissioner Joshua Chepchieng told the students the administration is aware of the encroachment on the land. “We have held a meeting with board members and urban planning officials. It was resolved that the construction be stopped,” he said yesterday.
