A conflict is looming between the Kenya Forest Services and residents of Magarini over the ban on charcoal burning. Communities living near the Dakatcha Woodland Forest have said they will continue burning charcoal despite the ban. KFS have begun enforcing the ban. Acting chief conservator of forests Monica Karenda last week ordered a crackdown on charcoal transporters from Kilifi. But residents said they will resist the order because chacoal burning is their main source of livelihoods. Magarini CharcoalÂ Producers Association secretary general Rodgers Mwabaya said they have complied with all regulations on forest conservation. The government issued the charcoal ban on February 24. "We have 10,000 bags which were ready before the ban. We have been stopped from transporting them," Mwabaya said. Mwabaya said the forest is their natural resource. A number of dealers, transporters and producers have been hit by the ban. The traders claimed they have lost Sh1 billion since the ban was announced. "Traders had bought the 10,000 bags and arranged transport before the ban," Mwabaya said. The charcoal is at various collection centres in Dakatcha. The traders said more than 300,000 people have been rendered jobless. Three senior KFS officials were on Thursday suspended for issuing charcoal transportation permits in Kilifi county. The three are suspected to be behind a cartel in the charcoal trade. Mwabaya denied the trade had cause massive destruction of Dakatcha Forest saying their association was legally established under the Forest Act. He said the community often replaced trees fell as a way of protecting and conserving the fores. "We even pay tax to KFS. It is fair that we are allowed to transport the 10,000 bags because they were ready before the ban," he said.
