Sixty students arrested for taking drugs and alcohol at an Eldoret club were yesterday released. Eldoret resident magistrate Diana Milimo freed them after being charged with being drunk and disorderly. The manager of Spree Club, where some of the minors were found, has been arrested. Milimo heard the case in camera because students are underage. They were arrested during a major swoop by police and county enforcement officers in various clubs in Eldoret town. Deputy OCPD for Eldoret West Hussein Gura said the club was also operating without a license. “It’s illegal to operate a club without the necessary licenses, and it’s a serious offense to allow minors into a club at any time,” Gura said. Anxious parents thronged Eldoret police station where the students were locked up. They had not been home since Sunday. A parent Salome Wanja said they are facing challenges in taking care of their children because of peer influence. She said, “Peer influence is a major problem that is ruining many children’s lives.” Uasin Gishu county commissioner Hassan Abdi said the students were arrested during a swoop in several clubs in Eldoret town. “We have shut down some clubs that were allowing minors to take alcohol and drugs in their premises. Owners and their employees were charged,” he said. Alcohol and drug abuse is becoming a major problem in the region. Click here for the latest political news
