President Uhuru Kenyatta must use the State of the Nation Address to demonstrate his commitment to the rule of law. Kenya Editors Guild chairman Churchill Otieno said Uhuru should ensure the media is allowed to operate in an environment free of intimidation, threats and attacks. The guild is composed of senior print, magazine, broadcast and other electronic media editors. The World Press Freedom index ranks Kenya at 96 on media freedom across the globe. The index started in 2002. It ranks 180 countries according to the level of freedom available to journalists. The index is a snapshot of the media freedom situation based on independence of the media, quality of legislative framework and journalists’ safety. Tanzania and Uganda are ranked 93 and 117 respectively. The index ranks Norway and Sweden first and second respectively. Otieno said the rankings show journalists in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are facing serious threats, with falling standards of constitutionalism and challenges in the rule of law. The guild’s alarm comes hours to the commemoration of World Press Freedom Day to be marked tomorrow. “This year’s World Press Freedom Day finds the media industry at a crossroads. The event comes on the heels of last year’s elections, one of the most politically charged and highly polarising ever witnessed,” Otieno said at the Serena Hotel. He urged Uhuru to ensure the access to Information Act, 2016 comes to force The guild will review clauses in the Computer and Cyber Crime Bill regarding media operations. Otieno was with editors guild secretary general Christine Nguku and assistant treasurer Francis Openda.
