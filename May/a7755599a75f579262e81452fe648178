Illegal structures on water paths within the county have increased the rate of floods in residential areas. Students of Embakasi Girls Secondary School on Monday failed to report to school as the school compound was filled with flood water caused by heavy rains making movement to and within the school impossible. Embakasi assistant county commissioner, Jackson Letangule on Wednesday told the Star encroachment of illegal structures had blocked the water paths. "We held a public baraza in the area with the affected residents on March 20th and they agreed that they will voluntarily remove the encroaching structures but up to date, they haven't done so," Letangule said . However, the county government in partnership with the national government started unblocking the drainage systems and pulling down the illegal structures around the school in order to release the flooded water. Embakasi South subcounty administrator, John Saruni who led the exercise said that the demolitions was in order to pave way for free flow of rain water. "These structures have been blocking the water paths and now it is very unfortunate that students cannot report to school because the compound is flooded. The flood water has mixed with water from the sewer which is hazardous not only to the students but to the area residents as well," he said.
