A Kisumu court has released a senior police officer accused of killing a university student. High Court Judge Fred Ochieng yesterday freed Kehancha OCS Sebastian Ambani on a Sh500,000 bond and two surerities of the same amount. He was arrested two weeks ago in Osiepe village over the death of Brian Chacha. The hearing of the case will begin in September. The 22-year-old student died of gunshot wounds. He is said to have been involved in an argument with the officer when the incident occurred on May 10. Ambani was charged with murder on Monday, but pleaded not guilty. His lawyer Richard Onsongo tried to seek his release. But the judge declined until a mental examination was done. Ochieng ordered the suspect be held at Kodiaga Prisons for two days. Prosecutor Gloria Baraza told the court the suspect was fit to stand trial after assessment. Family pathologist Isiaba Ndibire said one bullet damaged the student’s heart and another his brain. The student’s father Danstan Chacha wants justice served. He has appealed for help from the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji, Interior CS Fred Matiang’i and Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet. Chacha said his son was buried on Monday at their village in Kuria West subcounty. Kenya Universities Students Organisation condemned the killing of their colleague.
