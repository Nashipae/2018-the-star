The widow of slain Gatunguru Secondary School principal Samuel Mbogo yesterday appeared in a Murang’a court. However, Alice Mugechi and another suspect, Samuel Gitu, did not take pleas. The principal was killed in his house at Gakurwe village on Saturday night, as his two daughters watched. The prosecution sought remand of the suspects for 15 days so that police can complete investigations. Chief magistrate Margaret Wachira scheduled the mention of the case for May 28. Criminal investigations officer Jeremiah Kazungu said police are pursuing other suspects. "The crime happened a few days ago, we need more time to conclude investigations," Kazungu said. Mugechi asked the magistrate to allow her to go home. She said her children and livestock did not have anyone to take care of them. She promised to cooperate with the police. Mugechi said she needs to prepare for her husband’s burial. REMAIN IN CUSTODY The magistrate declined the request to release the suspects and detained them for 10 days. She said the case they are facing a serious charge and might interfere with witnesses. After Mbogo was murdered, his body was dragged into a car that was parked next to his home in Gakurwe village. Murang’a deputy county commissioner Charles Laboso said Mbogo was killed at 2am. ANOTHER PERSON KILLED The daughters said two men entered their compound and forced their way into the house. The murder occurred two years after Kiru Secondary principal Solomon Mwangi was killed. His wife Jane was charged with murder in the High Court in Murang’a. Click here for the latest political news
