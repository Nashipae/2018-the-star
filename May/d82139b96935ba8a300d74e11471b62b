Cooperatives Alliance of Kenya Chairman Daniel Marube has urged Kenyans to be extra careful before joining any sacco to avoid being duped of their savings. Marube says a lot of people today are using the name sacco to attract the loyalty of savers but yet they have their own selfish interests. "We don't know how these so called pyramid saccos are registered but they are spoiling our name. Before joining one, I would advice any Kenyan to conduct due diligence to find out if the sacco is legally registered, who the officials are, if they submit returns to the Commissioner of Cooperatives, and whether they normally have annual general meetings," he said. He called on the Commissioner of Cooperatives Development Mary Mungai and the county and national governments to fish out people using the name 'sacco' to run one man business activities, and if possible close them down. "When the deal is too good think twice. Kenyans should not just rush to commit their hard earned money into a venture they don't know. When someone asks to deposit Sh350,000 and promises Sh1 million in return you should first ask yourself where this money will be coming from," he added. He called on anyone having any suspicion about any sacco to report to the alliance for immediate action to be taken. KUSCCO managing director George Ototo while speaking during the Annual delegates meeting on Friday had called on sacco leaders to uphold globally shared principles of cooperatives. Ototo said saccos should be managed according to clear by-laws approved by members as a way to protect their reputation. "Let us remember that we have a reputation to maintain and members' savings are at stake. Thus, let us be good stewards of the resources entrusted to us and avoid selfish motives," Ototo said. This comes after Ekeza sacco was deregistered by the government last month for violating operation laws.
