Sanlam Kenya is targeting increased insurance uptake among travel agents through a new partnership with Kenya Airways to roll out s training campaign. Speaking in Mombasa at the inaugural training event, Sanlam Kenya head of operations Caroline Laichena said the programme has been designed to equip the firm’s partners with the necessary skills to recommend appropriate insurance covers to their travel clients. “The insurance sector is responding positively to market dynamics including the convenience of delivery general insurance products through key partners including travel agents,” Laichena said. “Today, a client is more likely to buy a Travel Insurance cover through their travel agent and it remains imperative on insurance companies such as Sanlam Kenya to play a key role in skills transfer for our business partners.” With an upper limit of up to Sh50 million (US$500,000), the cover will provide protection for travellers, their personal belongings as well as many non-refundable trip costs. The package also includes affordable trip cancellation, trip interruption, travel delay, baggage coverage, baggage delay and transportation covers. In addition, the cover also caters for other services including 24 hour emergency assistance and on-demand medical care, which provides travellers with access to on-call physicians, medical advice and physician referrals should they become sick or injured while on a covered trip including repatriation coverage for the insured. “Discerning clients prefer to place their business with travel agents who can provide an all under one roof solution covering travel insurance and suitably designed yet exciting packages for business and leisure,” Kenya Airways area manager, Rose Kiseli said.
