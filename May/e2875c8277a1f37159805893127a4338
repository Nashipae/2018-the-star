Bobasi MP Innocent Obiri and his bodyguard are expected at the Kisii law court on Monday to face charges of incitement and malicious damage to property. The MP was arrested at Hilton hotel in Nairobi on Saturday a week after an incident where goons ambushed quarry workers in his constituency. Obiri is said to have visited the quarry following complaints by
residents that blasting done at the quarry affected houses and a nearby
school. Kisii county police commander Hassan Abdi said Obiriâ€™s bodyguard, who was arrested at Kitengela, is still in custody at the Kisii police station. Abdi said that Obiri will be booked at the police station immediately he will be handed over by the detectives from Nairobi. "The MP is being escorted to Kisii where he will be booked awaiting appearance in court," the police boss said. "He will be charged, alongside his bodyguard, with incitement and malicious damage to property," he added. Abdi urged those in leadership positions to respect the law and at the same time guide the electorate in observing the same. The county commander said the police are still hunting down those who ambushed the quarry workers. He cautioned residents against taking the law into their hands saying they will not be spared for attacking their neighbours. Click here for the latest political news
