Fifty-seven mothers and newborns were yesterday evacuated after a fire broke out at the condemned new maternity blocks at Mbagathi Hospital. Twelve newborns under kangaroo care were transferred to Lang’ata Health Centre. The 42 in the main nursery were moved to the old maternity block. The fire broke out at the main electricity meter box at the postnatal ward, causing a blackout  throughout the entire maternity block.

That was merciful because it stopped the fire from spreading,” medical superintendent Loice Mutua said. “We moved the mothers to the wards in block four in our old maternity wards. That is where we are going to until this building is sorted.” The blackout affected the maternity, postnatal, labour unit and kangaroo baby care room. Nairobi Health executive Hitan Majevdia said the fire was caused by a system overload. “All the incubators and heaters were switched on at the same time, burning one of the lines,” she said. The incident comes barely a month after county engineers condemned the Sh220 million block. It caused panic at the level four facility. The mothers who spoke to the press said they were left out in the cold until past 6am when they were taken to the old maternity rooms. “The rooms are small. We don’t fit. We were out but our babies were taken to the incubators in another room,” one mother said.
