Thomas Markle watched his daughter Meghan's wedding to Prince Harry from 'California', he told TMZ. "My baby looks beautiful and she looks very happy. I wish I were there." He said the wedding was "emotional and joyful". Markle, 73, says he is recovering from heart surgery after suffering a heart attack. "I wish them all my love and all happiness," he said. Last Monday, Markle announced via TMZ he was pulling out of the wedding and said he had recently suffered a heart attack brought on by stress caused by older daughter Samantha Grant's fondness for trashing her sister in the press. He said he wanted to spare Meghan any embarrassment caused by his antics.
