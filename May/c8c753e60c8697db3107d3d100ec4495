South African President Cyril
Ramaphosa said on Wednesday he had established an inquiry into
tax administration and governance amid allegations of misconduct
by the suspended head of the revenue service. Ramaphosa, who replaced Jacob Zuma as head of state in
February and has promised to crack down on graft, said the terms
of reference for the inquiry would be published in the coming
days. "The stabilisation of the South African Revenue Service
(SARS) has received priority attention," Ramaphosa told
parliament, adding that he had signed a proclamation
establishing the tax commission on Wednesday. The inquiry will include investigating the handling of
revenue shortfalls, the unauthorised payment of bonuses to top
executives and the withholding of refunds to ordinary tax
payers, a treasury official told parliament. Tom Moyane, the suspended head of SARS, was earlier this
month served with disciplinary charges related to alleged
misconduct during his tenure. He denies any wrongdoing. Moyane is one of several government officials Ramaphosa has
replaced since taking over from scandal-plagued Zuma as part of
a drive to tackle endemic corruption. Ramaphosa also said he would donate half of his annual
salary of 3.6 million rand ($286,500) to a charitable fund being
launched to mark 100 years since the birth of anti-apartheid
icon Nelson Mandela. He is one of South Africa's richest people after selling out
of his Shanduka investment vehicle, which owned stakes in mining
firms, mobile phone operator MTN and McDonald's South
African franchise, at a time when the firm was worth over 8
billion rand.
