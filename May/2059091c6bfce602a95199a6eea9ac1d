Residents will give their views in public participation forums before new roads and markets are constructed. Governor Mike Sonko yesterday said officials will ask residents what projects they need. In Kawangware, the county will expand the road, renovate the market and put up new stalls for traders who have been working from makeshift kiosks. Trade committee chairman Charles Thuo yesterday told the Star some structures will have to be pulled down. "We want to do away with the culture of having traders along roadsides due to the congestion of markets. The expansion is necessary to accommodate more traders," he said. Thuo said the county always compensates where necessary but in Kawangware, they have a temporary location for the traders to relocate. After the market is upgrading, trades will be allowed back. Thuo, who is also Dandora Three ward representative, said the Kawangware is one of 20 market to up be upgraded in the countyâ€™s five-year development plan. He said construction is underway in various markets, including Mwaririro, Karindini, City Market, Muthurwa and Kangundo Road. He urged the traders to cooperate and have patience as the rehabilitation works takes place. "We are planning to upgrade Muthurwa into a multi-storey market to create more spaces for traders," Thuo said.
