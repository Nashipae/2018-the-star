A section of the Lamu-Garsen road has been closed after floods swept away two bridges. Motorists and commuters have been warned against using the road before it is renovated. Heavy rains have also left massive potholes in some parts. They wreck cars. On Monday, 500 passengers had to cut short their journeys and go back to where they had come from, after floodwaters made their travels impossible. A company had been hired to rebuild the road but is waiting for the downpours to subside. Lamu county police commander Muchangi Kioi yesterday called for patience. He told travellers to use the Mpeketoni-Kizuke road. From there, they can connect to their destinations by boats up to Mokowe jetty, before getting to Lamu town. “All commuters and motorists are barred from using this road — even those going on foot. It is extremely dangerous,” Kioi said. “We have made arrangements for a smaller road to be used. From there, people can connect [to Lamu] by boat. It’s better that way and safer.” He told drivers to avoid the flooded Milihoi area. They might get stuck and become the target of al Shabaab militants, Kioi said. The two bridges sandwiched the area. Some motorists have been parking their vehicles in Milihoi, where scores of police officers and civilians have lost their lives to terrorists. Last year, then-Public Works PS Mariam El Maawy’s convoy was attacked. She succumbed to her injuries three months later. Kioi added, however, that they will provide security. Police are on round-the-clock patrol, he said. Deputy county commissioner Loius Rono said they are out to ensure no death occurs. “The fact that we are closing this road off is timely. We don’t have to wait for the situation to gets worse before making a decision. Stay away and live,” he told residents and travellers.
