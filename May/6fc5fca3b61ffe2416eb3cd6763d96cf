TSC staff were on Monday forced to postpone a recruitment drive at Kirisia High school in Samburu Central after politicians stormed the venue protesting exclusion of locals. Samburu Woman Representative Maison Leshoomo led a pack of leaders and asked the TSC recruitment officers to leave until they come up with a clear hiring guidelines. The leaders expressed fears that employment slots that had been reserved for Samburu county will be taken up by non-locals owing to the commission's current regulations. The teachers' commission gives priority to people who graduated at least five years before time of recruitment, a position the leaders said is untenable in the region. "Regulations that the TSC put in place has locked out our locals,
therefore employment opportunities to the tune of 47 will be taken by
non-locals," Leshoomo said. "We are going to discuss until we get a regulation that will give locals a priority," the county legislator added saying "the employment cake has to be shared equally across the country." MCA Peter Lempei said that the recruitment should not take off until a proper criteria that makes the locals a priority is agreed upon. "Most of the graduates here do not meet the age requirement and in essence this alone locks out most of them," he said. The leaders are also opposing TSCâ€™s regulation that allows the recruitment board to only give five marks to the candidates. The TSC official who was overseeing the exercise said that he was not authorised to comment on the matter but said the interviews have been moved to a later date.
