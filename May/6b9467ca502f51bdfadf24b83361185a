A lobbyist has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to limit his State of Nation address to police accountability, electoral reforms, land injustice and national unity. Suba Churchill from the Civil Society Reference Group wants Uhuru to order the immediate implementation of the stalled Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC) report. He said executing the report will lead to closure on past social injustices. The President is obligated by law to give a yearly State of the Nation Address to the joint sitting of Parliament. The address is meant appraise the country. Churchill said, “In the last five years he has avoided issues of national value, where respect of human rights and rule of law lies. But he has dwelt in irrelevancies.”
