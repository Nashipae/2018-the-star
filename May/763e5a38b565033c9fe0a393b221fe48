Musalia Mudavadi's ANC party has refuted claims that the merger with Moses Wetangula's Ford-K will collapse NASA. The party on Thursday maintained that the merger aims at having a unified outfit that will help them have stronger negotiating power in 2022. Speaking in Kisumu during a two-day retreat, ANC secretary general Barack Muluka said the move is a deliberate proactive action that seeks to bring the Mulembe community together.

We are sitting squarely in the driver's seat to spearhead the process. This we repeat is a deliberate proactive action,' Muluka said. Muluka said the Party's PG will be meeting tomorrow with National Executive Council which will then receive a technical report on the said merger. "NASA is a specific legal entity that came together for last year's general election with a clear objective which does not bar member parties to merge within the coalition," he said. According to him, NASA is still in existence and strong to continue its push for electoral reforms. There have been speculations that the elusive ‘Luhya unity’ may well be in sight if the advanced plans for the merger of Western Kenya’s two foremost parties materialise. According to the plan, once the party is formed, it will then seek an alliance with others including Kalonzo Musyoka’s Wiper that is also consolidating its Ukambani base. “The house we are building will not stand on quicksand. It will be a formidable force in the country,” Mudavadi said. Also Read:Ford-K, ANC merger rattles Kalonzo
