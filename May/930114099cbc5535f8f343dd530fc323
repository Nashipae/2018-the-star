National Super League leaders Western Stima clash with Nairobi Stima tomorrow at Moi Stadium, Kisumu hoping to maintain their massive seven-point lead over fellow Kenyan Premier League promotion hopefuls Ushuru. Western Stima will be seeking to return to winning ways after surrendering their 2-1 lead to eventually draw 2-2 with Coast Stima in their last match. Under the stewardship of tough Ugandan coach, Richard Makumbi, the former KPL side sit top of the standings with 35 points and welcome a fourth-ranked opponent who still harbour KPL hopes especially after missing out narrowly last year. Ahead of the match, Western Stima should be worried of the danger posed by Nairobi’s talisman and free-scoring Stephen Owusu, who is gunning for the golden boot. Later at the same venue, debutants Kisumu All Stars welcome Nairobi City Stars, who have hit top form. Today, Ushuru host GFE 105 at Camp Toyoyo seeking to reduce the gap between them and Western Stima. The taxmen have recovered from a poor start to the season to become title and promotion candidates thanks to their recent back-to-back wins against St Joseph’s and Kibera Black Stars. The duel will pave way for a clash between Administration Police and FC Talanta. The confidence Coast Stima drew from their last match against Western Stima will be heavily relied upon when they face third-rooted KCB at Camp Toyoyo. The match will see the bankers begin life without their striker Crispin Onyango who reportedly joined United States-based AFC Ann Arbor on Thursday.
