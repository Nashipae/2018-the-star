STARRING: Sandra Oh, Jodie Comer, Fiona Shaw, Darren Boyd, Owen McDonnell, Kirby Howell-Baptiste DIRECTED BY: Villanelle novels by Luke Jennings RELEASE DATE: April 8  Eve is a quirky yet shrewd security officer at MI5 in London. But Eve also has a secret dark obsession with female psychopath killers. When a series of murders are reported by the MI5, Eve believes the murders were created by a woman. A woman she believes to be highly trained and dangerous. Eve’s obsession with following the trail of the mysterious woman ends up being dangerous and ultimately, she loses her job. Eve ends up being recruited by Carolyn Martens, Head of the Russia Section at MI6 who has been trying to track the female assassin. Meanwhile, Villanelle is getting reckless in her missions. She seems to be more into killing than her handler, Kostantin, expected. Villanelle believes herself to be untraceable and unpredictable. Which is why she is astounded when she gets word that an MI5 operative called Eve Polastri is investigating her. Villanelle is intrigued at how a simple security officer would know so much about her. Villanelle becomes obsessed with Eve and starts shadowing her. The two women become increasingly fixated with each other, in a dangerous game of cat and mouse. The show is light in its humour yet manages to grip onto its dark mystery. The story is intensely seductive, which makes for a good, bingeworthy show. The show feels strangely unique, although it belongs to a genre that has been overdramatised on television. Perhaps it is because it stars two highly intelligent women on opposite ends of the spectrum. An all-female protagonist-antagonist story has never been this impressive. It goes on to prove that an all-female led action-thriller show can be gripping and maintain good ratings. Seriously, the show is so good that it was renewed for a second season before its premiere.  Star Rating: 5/5
