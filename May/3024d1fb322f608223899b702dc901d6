Drama unfolded at an Embu Village after a drunken uniformed Administration policeman allegedly abandoned his gun in a bar and started beating residents. The officer was on Wednesday said to have gotten drunk at a bar in Kianjokoma town before he left without carrying his gun which he had placed against a wall. Benson Muchangi, a resident, said the officer got drunk and started harassing residents. He said the officer attacked an old man before residents pounced on him in protest. Muchangi said regular policemen on patrol intervened and rescued him from residents before going for the gun at the bar and handing it over to his bosses for safe custody. The officers from Manyatta police station whisked him away. Embu North subcounty county administration commandant Hussein Ali declined to give details on the incident, saying he did not have all the information.
