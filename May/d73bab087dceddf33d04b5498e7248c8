Ndakaini Dam is not filled to capacity, despite the pounding rains. The volume is at 79.21 per cent. Authorities have said water rationing will continue. On Monday last week, the volume was at 65 per cent. Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company acting MD Nahashon Muguna yesterday said the volume translates to 55.45 million cubic metres. “The water we have in Chania River will take us several days before we abstract from the dam,”Muguna said, adding that there is no cause for alarm. The water level in the dam remained low, at 30 per cent last month, despite heavy rain. Officials attributed the low levels to the drying up of rivers feeding the dam. Dam manager Job Kihamba on Monday last week said the 2016 and 2017 drought depleted the aquifers that recharge the rivers feeding the dam. Kihamba said rains had to fill the aquifers for increased river flow. Ndakaini Dam can store 70 million cubic metres at full capacity. The dam is 2,041 metres above sea level and 65 metres deep. Ndakaini has a 75-square-kilometre catchment area. It includes Kimakia and Gatare forests in the Aberdares. Thika, Githika and Kayuyu rivers feed the dam. It produces 430,000 cubic metres daily, 84 per cent of Nairobi’s supply. Muguna said although water rationing will continue, it will be relaxed. “The installed capacity is 525,600 cubic metres per day, against a demand of 770,000 cubic metres a day. The demand is higher than supply,” he added. Muguna said water rationing will end once Maragua Dam is completed in either 2025 or 2026. Treated water from Maragua Dam will be delivered to Nairobi’s Gigiri reservoirs. It is expected to serve 830,000 residents. The dam will increase bulk water supply to Nairobi by 120,000 cubic meters per day. The Sh6.8 billion Northern Collector Tunnel is also expected to be completed next year. Declining water levels in Ndakaini are not caused by construction of the Northern Collector Tunnel, the Athi Water Services Board said. Acting CEO Michael Thuita told the Star the dam level is not rising as much as it should, despite heavy rains. Click here for the latest political news
