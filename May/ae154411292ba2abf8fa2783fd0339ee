Kenyan goods will not be locked out of the European Union market despite the delay by other East Africa Community members states to sign the Economic Partnership Agreement. Trade PS Chris Kiptoo said the EU duty free, quota free market access has been secured under the Market Access Regulation 1529. This allows countries negotiating EPA to continue to access the EU market until the deal is signed. Kiptoo said this yesterday during a stakeholder’s forum on the benefits of the Continental Free Trade Agreement.  “I see no reason why we would want to go alone because we are one region... it is not our intention to break away from EAC for EU,” Kiptoo said. On the AfCFTA, Kenya and Rwanda have already signed and ratified the agreement.
