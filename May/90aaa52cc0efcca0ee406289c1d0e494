Tom Wolfe, author of The Right Stuff and Bonfire of the Vanities, has died at the age of 87, his agent has said. The Right Stuff, about the first American astronauts, was adapted into a film in 1983 with Sam Shepard, Dennis Quaid and Ed Harris. The Bonfire of the Vanities, published in 1987, was a satire of 1980s excesses in New York and was also made into a film starring Tom Hanks in 1990. He also wrote the cult classic Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, published in 1968. More to follow.
