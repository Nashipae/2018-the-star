More than 300 lawyers in Eldoret on Monday locked the High Court for several hours and protested against lack of judges. They said more than 4,000 cases are pending. Following the protests, Justice Hellen Omondi has started work in Eldoret to ease the pressure. The lawyers said although they are happy Omondi is handling cases, they need three more judges and six magistrates to handle pending cases.
