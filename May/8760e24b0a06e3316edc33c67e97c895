A man allegedly killed a woman and her three children in Ryosambu, Nairobi, on Monday morning. The 35-year-old and her children aged four, eight and 14 were reportedly murdered by a man identified only as Maina. He is said to be the father of the woman's fourth child, a three-year-old boy, whom he spared during the attack in Marurui. A teacher found the bodies when she went to check as one of the children did not report to school. Neighbours said the couple disagreed often. "I heard them quarelling last night. The man left but was seen early in the morning," one said. The children's cousin claimed Maina had in the past threatened to kill the woman and that he was a drunkard. "I was with my aunt yesterday ... everything was fine. The man was not married to my aunt," she said. She asked authorities to intervene so the killer is found and justice served. Police launched investigations and took the bodies to City Mortuary.
