STARRING: Martin Freeman, Anthony Hayes, Caren Pistorius DIRECTED BY: Ben Howling/Yolanda Ramke RELEASE DATE: May 18  When there is a lull between the previous year’s television season and the upcoming summer blockbuster hits, the streaming services become our salvation to TV watching. Not only does Netflix store a range of the old classics but they continuously upload new shows and TV movies produced just for Netflix. In other news, we are also curious to see what the Obamas will be producing on Netflix after they signed a deal to create shows on the streaming service earlier this week. Cargo is an Australian-based film about life during the zombie apocalypse. Andy, Kay and their one-year-old daughter Rosie are living in a boathouse trying to find other uninfected humans. Andy’s wife Kay gets infected when she searches an abandoned boat for food. Kay starts a countdown timer for 48 hours, after which she will completely into a zombie. Andy is determined to reach help before Kay is completely turned. But Kay knows she’s doomed and encourages Andy to help Rosie. Kay turns into a zombie when the family gets into a car accident. She manages to bite Andy, thus infecting him before he kills her. Andy has 48 hours to get Rosie to other uninfected humans before he turns into a zombie and hurts her. On his way, Andy gets help from a young Aboriginal girl named Thoomi. Other than the zombiness of it all (which I’m not a fan of), the film is an incredible story of survival and persistence. And, with such a limited cast, every member had to bring out their A-game. Interestingly the film is a remake of a short film that went viral after it was posted on YouTube in 2013.  Star Rating:
