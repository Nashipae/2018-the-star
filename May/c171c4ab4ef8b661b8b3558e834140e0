Maize traders in Nakuru yesterday protested a directive by the state to vet suppliers owed Sh5 million by the cereals board. The traders, who are owed Sh200 million, said the move was punitive. Nakuru Farmers and Traders Association chairman Mungai Ng’ethe said they bought maize for Sh2,800 and sold it to the board at Sh3,200. He denied claims that they bought maize for Sh2,000. Nge’the said if they made any profit per bag, it could not have exceeded Sh150. Drying and transportation costs are deducted, he says.
