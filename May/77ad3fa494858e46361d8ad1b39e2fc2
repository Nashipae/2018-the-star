Yesterday was a sad day for DJ Kalonje and his family. They woke up to the news of the death of their father. The family’s patriarch had been sick for a while now, but his death came as shocking news. DJ Kalonje first broke the news in a WhatsApp group of Kenyan artistes. He then took to social media to mourn the sudden loss of his father. Kalonje thanked his late father for having raised him with the principle of love. "Dear dad, I just want to thank you for everything, you raised us on one principle, love is the answer. It’s with disbelief and sorry I say goodbye to you. May you rest well. I will take care of mum for you. Till we meet again. Rest in peace."
