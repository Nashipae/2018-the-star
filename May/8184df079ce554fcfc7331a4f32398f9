The Kenya Revenue Authority has destroyed spirits worth Sh15 million that were found lacking its stamps. Kevin Safari, KRA's Western region Deputy Commissioner, said the alcohol also lacked stamps by the Kenya Bureau of Standards. “It is regrettable that the government would have lost up to Sh5 million in tax," he said, adding they destroyed 9,300 litres. “The drinks were nabbed from local markets, bars, wines & spirits shops and other outlets in Kisumu." Safari said second generation alcohol was being smuggled into Kenya from Uganda and Tanzania. Most of the unscrupulous business people use Probox and Toyota Wish vehicles to smuggle the contraband into the country at night, he said. He noted, however, that a multi-agency approach with intensified patrols will keep Kenyans from being hoodwinked. The Deputy Commissioner reported that several people were arrested for selling the alcohol. They will be arraigned, he said during the operation at Nyalenda wastewater lagoon, adding they will use sniffer dogs and surveillance cameras at the Busia and Malaba borders. Kisumu East Deputy County Commissioner Josephine Ouko urged the public to be vigilant and inform police of illegal businesses. “Security is a collective responsibility therefore we have to work together to ensure sanity." Ouko warned that the security agencies will shut down unlicensed alcohol outlets. County Police Commander John Kamau said they will not relent in the war on trade in illicit brews. “Those in such businesses must stop before we catch up with them. Nobody will be spared irrespective of status." Click here for the latest political news
