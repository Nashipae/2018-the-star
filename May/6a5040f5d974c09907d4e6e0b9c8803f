Politicians from Kisumu have warned their Nandi counterparts to stop boundary politics which risk plunging the two counties into conflict. This follows a move by the Nandi government to claim seven towns in Kisumu. Nandi wants the National Land Commission to readjust its common border to place Chemelil, Muhoroni, Miwani, Kibigori, Kibos, Koru and Kopere within its borders. These towns are on the border of the two counties. They are adjacent to the railway line crossing the two counties. The towns are known for large-scale rice farming and sugarcane farming. Nandi claims the towns were initially on its side, but were taken away during the colonial era and placed under Kisumu. But Kisumu Senator Fred Outa reads mischief in the petition, saying it is purely politics. He said plans to place Chemelil, Muhoroni, Miwani, Kibigori, Kibos, Koru and Kopere within Nandi county are “impossible”. He warned Governor Stephen Sang to desist from acts which can fuel conflict. Outa said the boundaries of the two counties are well designed and those claiming some towns in Kisumu belong to Nandi are “dreaming and simply playing politics”. “We need to stop remarks or moves which are likely to cause disputes between Kisumu and Nandi counties. Communities at the borders have for years live harmoniously and therefore we must focus on unity and peace,” he said. The senator called on the National Cohesion and Integration Commission to probe the motive of the petition saying it could be political and could plunged the two counties into clashes. “We know why they are bringing up this issue. It is purely related to 2022 general election, so they want to cause chaos early among our communities,” Outa said. Muhoroni MP Onyango Koyoo said such petition is imagination of Nandi Governor Stephen Sang which add no value to Kenyans. He said such a politically motivated petition can bring a serious problem.
