The government will build a cancer centre in Baringo in honour of the late Baringo South MP Grace Kipchoim, DP William Ruto has said. Kipchoim died of cancer and was buried on Saturday in Mochongoi, where Ruto made the declaration. “Cancer has proved to be the leading killer disease in Kenya,” he said. Ruto said the government has made available cancer testing kits in major health facilities in every county. “Here in Baringo, you can get a cancer test for free at the county referral hospital in Kabarnet and the Eldama-Ravine  Subcounty Hospital,” he said. The DP said cancer patients who have enroled with the NHIF can get care funding. “It is a rare show for someone to fight cancer for five years like Kipchoim did. It means apart from being a strong woman, she had good relations with the people and her God,” he said. More than 80 leaders attended the ceremony. They included Baringo Senator Gideon Moi and his Elgeyo-Marakwet counterpart Kipchumba Murkomen.
