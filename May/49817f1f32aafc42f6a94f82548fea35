Three Kenya Hockey Union men’s Premier League teams will put their unbeaten run on the line at City Park Stadium tomorrow. Former champions Strathmore University, Butali Sugar Warriors and United States International University Africa (USIU-A) will seek to keep their early season form on track. Tomorrow law enforcers who have 12 points from five matches come up against Strathmore University who have three points from one match, while Butali, with nine points from three matches, cross swords with USIU-A who have three points from one. It remains to be seen who will blink first during the two ties as Police striker Moses Cheplait was cautious ahead of the match but remained hopeful of recording a win. He said: “There is so much to play for. It will be an interesting tie to look out for. We are psyched up ahead of the match and we hope at the end of it all, the result will go our way.” Today, Nakuru Sports Club and Parkroad Tigers will be seeking to record their first win of the season when they battle their respective opponents. Nakuru, who are win-less after two matches, welcome Wazalendo while the Tigers — pointless from four — matches welcome Bungoma at the City Park Stadium. In the women’s Premier League, USIU will be seeking to bid goodbye to their poor start when they take on Strathmore.
