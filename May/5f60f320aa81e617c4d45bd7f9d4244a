Sauti Sol has decided to break the hearts of many Kenyans. After giving us the best of the best since they started music, they have decided to pass the button to the upcoming. Bien, the lyricist of Sauti Sol, said they are opening a record label. They have signed in a few of their artistes and each band member has an assignment. Polycarp will be handling A&R, while Chimano will be handling the creative part. Savara will be in charge when it comes to production, business and tech, alongside Merek, their manager, while Bien will be overseeing everything. They said they have and are working with so many artistes underground that people are not aware of, but the label will be up and running before August and we will meet them. After the good news, they dropped the bombshell that Sauti Sol has decided to retire because they have done it all and are at the peak of their career. Sauti Sol shocked us even more when they mentioned that they plan to relocate. "This is where we announce that we are retiring as Sauti Sol and tunarelocate at some point. Tumeshafanya kila kitu, mnataka tufanye nini?" Bien made it clear that they have not stopped music because later in life, they will be back, following the musical route of Nyashinski. They want to go and come back with a bang!
