Kenyas have celebrated International Labour Day, dedicated to the welfare of workers. There was more cause to celebrate yesterday because President Uhuru Kenyatta announced a five per cent increase in the minimum wage. On paper, the lowest paid worker gets Sh13,576, up from Sh12,930. It's a trifling Sh646 but employers warned against it. The announcement automatically becomes law, but will it really help workers? How will we know? There's no way to determine whether this will translate to more take-home pay for casual labourers and domestic workers. It's difficult to find a house help paid that much, let alone anything above Sh7,000. Some security sector workers say they receive as little as Sh8,000. Few will disclose their earnings, as most would lose their jobs. Employers can be tricky, many don't provide contracts. Others delay payments. Some don't remit statutory remittances — KRA withholding, NSSF and NHIF deductions — after cutting them from salaries. Workers must step up, report what they earn and their working conditions — if they want that grand sum of Sh646.
