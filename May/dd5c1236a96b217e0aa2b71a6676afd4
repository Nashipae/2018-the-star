Hon Raila Odinga.”The committee is expected to come up with recommendations, which will prepare Kenyans for a third referendum to create new structures in line with its broad mandate of unifying the country.Raila on Tuesday told his party’s top organ that a referendum is inevitable to address the issues raised during his first meeting with Uhuru at Harambee House.That meeting culminated in the public handshake on the steps of Harambee House on March 9.They identified ethnic antagonism, lack of a national ethos, inclusivity, devolution, divisive elections, security, corruption, shared prosperity and responsibility as some of the broad issues to be addressed to realise a new Kenya.“Without the changes we envisage in the MoU, 2022 will be messy,” Raila said at ODM’s NEC meeting in Naivasha.
