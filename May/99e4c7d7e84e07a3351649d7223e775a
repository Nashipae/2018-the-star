Governor Mike Sonkohe has declared another clean-up of the city centre and removal of 4,000 boda boda operators, along with street families and hawkers. This order comes despite despite an agreement to have designated places for the boda bodas to operate. On Sunday while addressing congregation at St Stephenâ€™s Anglican Church, Sonko said the hawkers, boda boda operators and street families will be removed from the downtown area. Chairman of the Boda Boda Association of Kenya Kevin Mubadi yesterday told the Star the operators are confused, because his order is contrary to their understanding. He said he would seek a meeting iwth Sonko to clarify the situation.
