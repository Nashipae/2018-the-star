It’s no secret that Sony Sugar have been on the decline for the last couple of years. Now that they find themselves in the drop zone, four points clear of safety, the reality is starting to dawn on them that a place that they took for granted among the elite is seriously under threat. The 3-1 walloping handed to them by a lowly Thika United means that the Awendo-based sugar millers are winless in five matches. Only Nakumatt, who with their come from behind 2-2 draw against title challengers AFC Leopards continued to show some signs of improvement in recent weeks, are below them. With both sides on 11 points only goal difference separates Sony form the unenviable position at the bottom of the table. Despite their morale boosting win over Sony, Thika too are not out of the woods yet as they occupy the relegation/promotion playoff position they finished on last year. Zoo Kericho will feel hard done for not getting at least a point in their loss to Sofapaka. Zoo went ahead through Mike Madoya, who was set up by Isaac Kipyegon, before Sofapaka responded through Humphrey Okoti, who was picked in the area by Rogers Aloro. Steven Waruru then scored the winning goal in the 54th minute heading home a Teddy Osok cross. The defeat left Sammy Okoth’s men with 15 points, same as Thika. Okoth admitted that his side couldn’t keep with Sofapaka’s pace. Okoth said his side’s shape after taking the lead was bad leading to the two goals conceded. “We went ahead but our shape was bad after we scored and thus we conceded soon after. Sofapaka were fast and we couldn’t keep up with the pace of the game. We also made some individual mistakes and that’s what we are going to rectify before our next game,” said Okoth. Vihiga United’s resurgence continued as they pipped fellow new boys Wazito 2-1 to move a point and two paces above the dreaded zone. Click here for the latest political news
