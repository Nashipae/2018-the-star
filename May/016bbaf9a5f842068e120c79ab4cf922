Kimilili MP Didimus Barasa has criticised Luhya politicians, saying those attacking Senator Moses Wetang'ula were disrespectful. Wetang'ula was on Tuesday labelled a coward by Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala and Godfrey Osotsi (Nominated MP). The lawmakers accused Wetang'ula of attacking NASA leader Raila Odinga "to remain politically relevant." The Bungoma senator fell out with Raila following his acrimonious ouster as the Senate Majority leader. Wetangula accused Raila of orchestrating the move. Over the weekend, Wetang'ula threatened to spill the beans on Raila's political "trickery" if the ODM party boss does not stop criticising him. Malala and Osotsi said Wetang'ula had become political irrelevant. In a press statement on Tuesday, Barasa asked the MPs to respect Wetang'ula. "It is shameful that they [Malala and Osotsi] are fighting a fellow countryman from Mulembe nation," Barasa said. Click here for the latest political news
