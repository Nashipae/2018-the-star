Doctors in Kapenguria are baffled by the shocking presence of seven sewing needles in the belly of a three-year-old girl. Dorcas Chepchumba was admitted at the Kapenguria County Referral Hospital on Tuesday with abdominal pains. X-ray showed the needles were lodged in her abdomen. Her mother Emily Ling’aa said she had no idea how the needles got inside her baby. The grandparents, who live with the girl, said she has been sick for a year. West Pokot chief health officer Ibrahim Longolomoi said they have reported the matter to police. Last year doctors at Thika Level 5 Hospital found 14 needles in the buttocks of a 10-month-old baby. The child’s parents were arrested and charged with torture.
