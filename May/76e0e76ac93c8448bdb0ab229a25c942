Seventeen Rift Valley Kenya National Union of Teachers branches yesterday defended embattled secretary general Wilson Sossion. They vowed to mobilise teachers to ensure he returns to his office at Knut headquarters. Sossion was locked out on Monday. “We are surprised by the decision of some national executive committee members to remove him without following due procedure. That is unacceptable. We will defend him at all costs,” national executive committee member Josphat Serem said. Serem, Wareng Knut chairman John Borr and 100 branch representatives spoke in Eldoret. The officials said there is political interference in the union’s affairs by some individuals interested in destabilising the teachers’ association. They told those opposed to Sossion to respect court orders until the case he filed is heard and determined. Sossion will win the case because he was elected by teachers and is in office legally, they said. Serem said they expect a majority of teachers to back Sossion during a special annual general meeting next month. “We will not allow non-members to frustrate our union and cause divisions to weaken Knut. Teachers will remain united and fight the enemies of our progress,” Borr said. Under Sossion the union has achieved a lot. He has fought for better terms and working conditions for teachers, he said. The officials said they have no problem with Sossion serving as a nominated MP. On Monday, Sossion was blocked from his office by 10 heavily built men. He was told there were strict instructions not to let him in. He pleaded with the men in front of journalists, but the pleas fell on deaf ears. Sossion told reporters he had complied with a court order that lifted his suspension ahead of an inter-parties hearing on May 10.
