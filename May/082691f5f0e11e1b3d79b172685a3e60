The Court of Appeal has temporarily suspended a decision that recently blocked the levying of excise duty on bottled water, nonalcoholic drinks and cosmetics. A three-judge bench consisting of Asike Makhandia, Kathurima  M’inoti and Fatuma Sichale,  in a ruling that shielded the government from losing close to  Sh20 billion, said  the  orders  will remain in force pending determination of an appeal lodged by the KRA. KRA and ICPA securities – a firm that was awarded contract for the supply of Excisable Goods Management Systems at a cost of Sh15 billion, are aggrieved by the decision quashing a law that seeks to impose taxes on the commodities. Justice John Mativo of the High Court in March ruled the manner in which the law was imposed was inconsistent with the Constitution and hence null and void. However on Thursday, the court was of the view both KRA and Sisca stand to lose a substantial – if not colossal amount of money – in the event it refuses to grant the orders sought and the appeal untimely succeed. The judges were of the view that the two will obviously not recover the money and the loss considering Sh1.886 billion has already been expended in the system.
