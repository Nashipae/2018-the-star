Revamp of the National Youth Service was intended to be one of the key planks in the Jubilee administration’s strategy of creating jobs and empowering the youth. Initial skepticism that greeted the blueprint for the new look expanded service, and the implementation plan, were dismissed by government as a distraction. The project enjoyed pride of place in government programmes; its champions were untouchable. Even when the weaknesses in the plan and its gung-ho implementation was exposed as unaccountable, the government was reluctant to critically review the project. Instead it resorted to cosmetic changes. It is apparent that there are systemic weaknesses in NYS . Regardless of which angels we deploy to head the NYS, the opportunities to fleece the public are too tempting. The NYS, like the National Youth Development Fund, is a blot on President Uhuru Kenyatta’s anti-graft credentials. Both institutions have become bastions of corruption. Despite public outrage at how millions were siphoned, not a single conviction was obtained from NYDF or NYS scandals. That the NYS is yet again reeling from another multi-million scam in the clearest signal the fight against corruption is yet to go beyond lip service.
