Right attacker Juliet Makokha and setter Linda Wasike have been dropped from the national Under-18 girls’ squad which departs this evening for the African Volleyball Confederation Zone Five qualifier in Uganda. The two have been part of the provisional squad of 16 players , who have been training for the past two weeks at the YMCA. Team manager Emily Mbotela said the squad is raring to go ahead of the event which serves off this Wednesday. The event will see one team qualify for the African Youth Championship set for Algeria in July. Mbotela said if they hope for the best if the team’s recent performance build up matches against Kenya Commercial Bank and DCI is anything to go by. “The team managed to take two sets from KCB and that’s a clear indication of what to expect. We hope this will be a motivation for the entire squad in he event,” said Mbotela. The team is up against Rwanda, Egypt, South Sudan and hosts Uganda in the four-day event. Mbotela added: “The two players dropped are equally good and I hope they will use the experience and exposure they picked here to impact their respective schools positively going forward. They were impressive and its unfortunate the technical bench had room for only 14 players.” Kenya will also field a boys’ team under the stewardship of Moses Lukorito and William Kemboi.
