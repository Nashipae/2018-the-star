Six gold miners have been trapped after the quarry they were working in collapsed in Nyatike. A seventh one has been pulled out and rushed to Macalder Hospital for treatment. Macalder chief Chris Okelo said heavy rains pounding the area might have contributed to the collapse. "The miners continued working even when it was heavily raining outside, they were not aware," Okello said. Okello said when the miners almost reached the top is when the place collapsed. The six are Ominde Achieng, Ochieng Mwalimu, Otieno Abongo, Odhiambo Opiyo, Isaiah Otwera and Pascal Ochieng. Click here for the latest political news
