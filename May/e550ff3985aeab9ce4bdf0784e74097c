A man has been sentenced to life imprisonment for possessing 155 rolls of bhang in Mombasa. Emmanuel Chacha was caught carrying marijuana from Migori on the Likoni Ferry. Possession of marijuana is being decriminalised all over the world. It is probably less harmful than alcohol. Nevertheless, trafficking is a crime and Chacha pleaded guilty. But was his punishment proportionate? Yesterday there was widespread praise for jailing five people, including a former PS and Nairobi Town Clerk, for their role in a Sh328 million cemetery land fraud. They received jail terms of three years each. The magistrate was praised in this case because normally big shots escape justice. For instance, who has been punished for the billions lost at the NYS? Chacha was sentenced to life imprisonment. But who did more damage to Kenya? Chacha or the Mavoko crooks? Or the NYS crooks? The punishment of Chacha was disproportionate. He had to be sentenced. Three years like the Mavoko gangâ€™s sentence might have been okay but a life sentence was cruel and very unfair.
