Champions Nairobi Water women’s handball team are keen to retain their Super Cup title at the Kaloleni grounds this weekend. The back-to-back winners will come up against Kenyatta University on Saturday and a win will see them play winner between National Cereals and Produce Board and Embakasi Queens. The winner of the title will earn a direct ticket to participate in the next year’s Africa Cup Winners Championship at a venue to be announced later. The Super Cup event brings together top ranked four women and six men’s teams at the end of the regular Kenya Handball Federation national league season. Nairobi Water coach Jack Ochieng said they are ready for the event and remained optimistic of finishing the season unbeaten. Ochieng was optimistic the side will honour this year’s East and Central Africa Club Championship after they missed last year’s event held in Tanzania due to financial constraints. “We finished the regular season unbeaten and we want to extend the good run in the Super Cup. We are aware of our competitors capabilities but we have trained well and we are raring to go,” said Ochieng, who doubles up as the national women’s team coach. He added: “The Super Cup will definitely lay ground for the new season and we want to start on high. We have retained the same squad that won the national league but we are open to bring on board new players.”
