A street urchin who hit headlines in 2017 after he was rescued by his childhood friend has gone back to the streets and reverted back to drugs. Wanja Mwaura, had in October 2017 saved her former classmate, identified only as Hinga, from the streets and drug abuse and took her to a rehabilitation centre. The woman was last week accused on social media of using the victim to gain fame and later dumped him. Hinga was taken to a Limuru based rehabilitation centre and had undergone a total transformation since October 2017.

It's not an easy fight. Thank-you for all your support and let's not judge him harshly for his relapse. Drug addiction is a disease and relapse is a part of the process. Let's pray for him. We did our part as the society,” read the post. Countryman Kabochi wrote,“It was a great effort wanja. Hinga has to make a decision about his life. But still, the process of change only dealt with the chemical problem, not a spiritual problem which is the root cause. My prayer is that he will be set free completely.” James Karatu Giita said “Yes it's not easy. And whoever sees him, let's keep him away from his former environment. Let's be our brother's keeper. That is the best way to appreciate the much done to him. Thanks as well Wanja Mwaura. Your efforts will not go into the drain.” Click here for the latest political news
