IEBC has called for the synchronisation of databases in the voter register and the civil registry to end double registration. The electoral agency also want the register harmonised with those of births and deaths to eliminate cases of dead voters. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chairman Wafula Chebukati Isaid the harmonisation will provide a lasting solution.

He also called for e-voting for cost effectiveness and inclusion of all Kenyans in the diaspora in elections. "Six elections in one day is a challenge to our staff and the election system itself. We want a review of election laws to have national and county elections on different dates to enhance efficiency and reduce pressure," Chebukati told the Samson Cherargei led committee. Chebukati said changes to election laws months to polls and procurement disputes must be determined early enough to avoid disrupting the election calendar. He asked Parliament to align timelines to allow sufficient time for political party primaries and dispute resolution. "We propose the standardisation of the scrutiny processes, pursuant to court orders. This is informed by the haphazard manner with which scrutiny of processes were conducted as ordered by the various courts in the recently concluded election petitions," Chebukati said. They also called for staggering of the appointment of commissioners to ensure continuity, institutional memory and succession at the commission.
