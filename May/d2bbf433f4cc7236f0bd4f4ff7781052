MCAs have demanded an additional Sh2.1 billion for allowances and operation expenses for the 2018-2019 financial year. The county lawmakers yesterday told senators the Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) did not include the funds in the Sh373 billion allocated to counties. They said the allocation is in line with a court ruling that quashed a decision by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) to reduce their salaries and scrap their allowances. The MCAs want Sh610 million to cater for their sitting allowances and another Sh286 million for rent and operational costs. The CRA has opposed the MCAs request.

Mabuka and his Wajir counterpart Mohamed Osman are representatives of the County Assemblies’ Caucus. The county assemblies’ Society of Clerks want Sh38 million allocated for increased salaries of speakers and another Sh225 million for public participation in lawmaking processes. MCAs want Sh140 million for digitisation of county assembly chambers, Sh166 million for office and chamber furniture and Sh208 million for their medical cover and group insurance. “SRC increased the speaker’s salary from Sh242,550 to Sh404,250 per month. That increase needs to be factored in the budget,” Mabuka said. He said they needed another Sh9 million to cater for transport allowances for two MCAs in the County Assembly Service Board as per the SRC directive. Each pockets Sh20,000 monthly allowance. CRA chairperson Jane Kiringai said county assemblies allocation has been increased by Sh3 billion. “Any additional allocation for MCAs recurrent expenditure is against the spirit of devolution,” Kiringai said.
