Former Nairobi speaker Alex Magelo has said he is ready to take up the leadership of the Maasai community. He told mourners at his mother Susan Magelo’s burial on Friday that former Heritage minister William ole Ntimama bequeathed the community’s leadership to him. “Twelve days before his death, Ntimama gave the mantle for Maasai leadership to former Senator Stephen Ntutu and myself. He told us to hold the community together,” Magelo said. Susan, 84, was buried in Sayat village, Narok North.
