Donkey owners in Naivasha on Saturday stormed the Star Brilliant slaughterhouse, following increased animal theft. Carrying packards, the Naivasha Donkey Owners Self-help Group marched to the abattoir, claiming several stolen donkeys had been recovered at its holding yard. Group secretary Jefferson Mbuthia said cases of donkey theft has been on the rise. He urged the slaughterhouse management to cooperate with donkey owners to ensure the animals sold to the facility have not been stolen. Slaughterhouse CEO John Kariuki defended the business, saying they have taken measures to ensure they don’t buy stolen donkeys. He said they have a working group, involving all donkey slaughterhouses and government agencies to ensure the theft is ended. “Before you bring donkeys here, you must have a letter from the chief, veterinary officer and a movement permit,” he said.
