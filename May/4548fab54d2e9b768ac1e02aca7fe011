The High court has issued orders temporarily barring the registrar of trade unions and TSC from removing or de-registering Wilson Sossion as Knut secretary general. Judge Maureen Onyango of the Employment and Labour Relations court on Wednesday certified the matter urgent. She ordered the registrar of trade unions, TSC and Knut deputy SG Hesbon Otieno to file their responses before May 9 and appear for hearing on May 10. "A temporary prohibition order is hereby issued barring the respondents from registering, appointing, recognising, putting or placing any person as Knut secretary general in place of Sossion pending the hearing of the application," the judge said. She also ordered an injunction restraining Otieno or any other person from purporting to act in place of Sossion as Knut secretary general. This is with respect to carrying out or performing any acts or function conducted or decided by the secretary general of KNUT. TSC and registrar of trade were also barred from validating the decision made on April 30 by which Sossion was purportedly suspended. Sossion moved to the court through lawyer James Orengo after his suspension on May 1. He was replaced by Otieno following a National Executive Council (NEC) meeting during which 22
against two members voted in favour of a motion to discuss Sossion’s
conduct. The meeting was attended by chairperson Wycliffe Omuchenyi, deputy secretary-general Collins Oyuu, acting national treasurer Muuo Ndiku, and acting vice national treasurer Dorothy Muthoni. The nominated MP's wars at the teachers’ union started ahead of the 2017
Annual Delegates Conference (ADC). This was after then Labour CS Phyllis Kandie
asked him, alongside other trade unionists to relinquish their
positions, after their election and nomination into public offices. Read: Sossion, Omboko Milemba out as union officials, says Labour CS Also read: Sossion, Milemba fired by TSC for joining politics Click here for the latest political news
