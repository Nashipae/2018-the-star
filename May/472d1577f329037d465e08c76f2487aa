JKUAT students will enjoy free rides from the college gate to Nairobi CBD on selected days. This is after Neo Kenya Mpya, a bus company plying the Nairobi-Thika route, launched a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative this week. One of the company’s directors, Douglas Kuria, said the move is part of their strategy to change the matatu industry which is often painted in negative light. “JKUAT students are our main clients, that is why we settled on them as the first beneficiaries of the program,” he stated. Kuria further indicated that the free rides will be occasionally availed to JKUAT students from 3-4 pm mostly on Thursdays and other off-peak days as may be determined by the management.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads “We intend to make travelling not only a business but an experience where we get to understand our customers,” he stated. He further indicated that the only requirement for the students to enjoy the free rides is to produce their student ID. According to the bus company director, the bus ferried an estimated 100 students on the first day of the free rides which roughly translates to three buses. “The reception by the students was positive and we look forward to the continued corporation with all our customers.” Click here for the latest political news
