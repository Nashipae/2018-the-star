Residents are staring at a food crisis in agriculture-rich Kinangop, Nyandarua county. Food prices have skyrocketed as the heavy rain has hampered farm operations, and destroyed crops and roads. Farmers are counting losses running into
millions of shillings as food rots on the farms with no way of transporting it to the markets. MP Kwenya
Thuku said vegetable farmers are the worst hit. He said the area has for the last two months recorded unusually heavy rainfall. “The rain, which
is getting heavier by the day, has caused massive damage
and there is nothing that we can do at the moment,” Thuku said. “The road
situation can only be addressed once the rains subside as moving in at the
current satiation would be a futile mission.” Farmer Matheri wa Hungu said residents could soon
be forced to ask for relief food from the State. He said potato and cabbage farmers have lost nearly all their crops after their farms
were flooded. Most of the crops are rotting before they mature. “We are staring
at a grim future as nearly all the crops in the farms have withered while the
ones ready for harvest were washed away by the waters,” Hungu said. The former civic leader said the prices of basic produce such as potatoes, cabbages and kales had doubled. “Currently the
price of one sack of potato, which is hard to get, is going for around Sh6,000 up
from Sh2,000 a couple of months ago,” Hungu said. Farmer
Jecinta Wangari urged the county government to use emergency
funds to repair major roads. “We cannot
transport even our milk to the dairies and we are asking the governor to come
to our aid as we have lost heavily due to the rain,” she said.
