The Nubian community in Kibera has protested the county assembly’s rejection of Mama Lucy Hospital medical superintendent Musa Mohamed as Medical Services chief officer. Mohamed, a member of the community, was nominated for the position by Governor Mike Sonko last month. However, his nomination was rejected by MCAs last Thursday over Auditor General’s report on the financial operations at Mama Lucy. The community leaders said grounds for rejecting Mohamed were flimsly. They said rejection was  a plot by “some people to short change the community which is already marginalised.” They called on the health committee of the county assembly to review its decision on Mohamed. The leaders included Kenya Nubian Council of Elders chairman Issa Abdulfaraj, Nubian Rights Forum chairman Shaffie Hussein, Nubian University Students Organisation chairman Hassan Mahmud and Nubian Youth Council chairman Abdulaziz Hassan. Immediately after nomination, Embakasi Central MP Benjamin Mwangi, in whose constituency the hospital is located, wrote to Sonko opposing Mohamed’s appointment as chief officer. Mwangi said residents had complained about poor services at the hospital. The community rejected the claim and instead accused Mwangi of having a personal vendetta against  Mohamed. They said he was among those determined to shortchange the community.
