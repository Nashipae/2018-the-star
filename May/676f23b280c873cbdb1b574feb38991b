An ordained
Catholic Church priest who uses rap to preach to youths has become a sensation
at Rapogi Parish in Uriri constituency, Migori county. Father
Paul Ogalo of St Monica Parish treats his congregation to
rap sessions. A video of
him clad in priestly robes has been shared by his audiences on social
media and gone viral. On Sunday,
Ogalo led a special mass at St Monica Rapogi Parish, where he was born and grew up. “During
the 2007 post-election violence, we lost a bright student at Rapogi High School. The death inspired me to start rapping to reach youths with gospel,” he said. Ogalo said he
noticed most churches do not have youth-friendly services to encourage them to
remain after mass. “I picked my stage name as Paul Swit, which stands for Paul Sees World In Turmoil. These rap songs, complete with a stage name, resonate well with youths,” he said. The Father said
most Catholic Church songs are classical and youths have a disconnection with them. Through his songs, he has changed lives by encouraging young people
to have practical ways of improving their social and economic status. Violet
Menya, the youth leader at Rapogi Parish, said Ogalo's unique style of preaching has
attracted many youths to the church, since he uses the language and techniques
modern youth understand best. Menya said Ogalo has encouraged many youths to embrace the green revolution through tree
planting and initiation of projects, which has changed families' economies.
