Former Funyula MP Paul Otuoma has said he is ready to reconcile with political rival and Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong. He said this will enable the governor to serve the people of Busia without political interference. Speaking during the burial of Mzee Peter Otung'u, 76, the father to his chief campaigner in 2017 George Okaal in Kolanya, Teso North on Saturday, Otuoma said he had no problem with the Governor. "There is no need to engage in premature politics. Let's give the governor time to serve his people. I will try my luck again in 2022," he said. Otuoma also lauded the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Odinga saying it had brought peace in the country. "I was the first to shake hands with President Kenyatta but received condemnation because my handshake was small," he said, amid laughter. Otuoma returned to Teso region barely a week after attending the burial of the mother to his close ally and Sub County campaign coordinator in 2017 general elections Shem Papah in Aboloi. In February, Busia High Court upheld Governor Ojaamong’s election. Otuoma, who lost Ojaamong in the August 8 election, conceded defeat moments after the ruling. Addressing the press yesterday, Otuoma said he may not agree with the verdict, but respects the court. “Most of us are exhausted after the long electioneering period. We should now start looking at our lives. To the winner, it is not about victory, but service to the people of Busia,” he said outside the court.
