Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has ordered fresh investigations into Neno Evangelical Centre pastor James Ng’ang’a’s accident case. Last Friday he was acquitted of charges of causing a woman’s death by dangerous driving three years ago. The preacher was freed by a Limuru court on grounds the prosecution failed to prove its case. Limuru chief magistrate Godfrey Odour presided over the case. This sparked a public outcry. The victim’s family intends to appeal.

He tasked the DCI to conduct comprehensive investigations that will guide the Judicial Service Commission on what to do with those involved in the decision. “This should be done with a view to reaching a suitable corrective and deterrent action to take against persons found culpable for improper handling of this case,” Matiang’i said. “While seeking a report on the investigatory and trial processes that may have caused this outcome, I urge you to appeal this judgment in its entirety.” He asked the DCI to pursue justice for the victims and the public. Ng’ang’a was freed alongside driver Simon Kuria, and police officers Christopher Nzioka and Patrick Baya. It was alleged that Ng’ang’a’s Range Rover Sport KCD 060Q was being driven carelessly on August 26, 2015, causing Mercy Njeri’s death. The vehicle collided head-on with a Nissan March, registration KBZ 709W, at Manguo, Limuru.
