Khaligraph Jones has spoken up for the first time about the status of his relationship with rapper Cashy. The Mazishi hitmaker told Word Is he and Cashy split up. The two came into the limelight after they unveiled their hit single, Micasa. Now, his ex-girlfriend is rumoured to be heavy with child. What does the king of Kenyan rap have to say about this? “If you are asking me if I’m still with Cashy, we are not together. As far as the baby goes, that one I’m not going to talk about, sitaongelea.” Khaligraph also addressed his ongoing beef with Octopizzo after he released a diss song titled ‘Noma Ni’. The song is a direct jab at Khaligraph and what he stands for. Octopizzo said, “Niliwapeleka kaburini so, wanajua ni mazishi na kwa hiyo matanga yenu jo huskii tutadish. Na kama bado una-hate on Octopizzo kill yourself and die.” Asked for comment, Khaligraph said: “I haven’t had a chance to listen to it. If I get a chance I’ll listen to it. I’m always listening to people’s albums. Why would I respond to disses right now? People are trying to bring back the beef thing. They should realise that in the past two years, I’ve refrained from that. I was dissing with the guy like three years ago. It is 2018, I’m 28 years, I want to do collabos with the likes of Jay Z, Cassper and AKA. So taking me back to Octo limits my progression.” He added: “You know I’m the OG. If I was to diss a person, I’d have done that. Mimi siekangi mtu. Octo nimemueka on the side. I feel that story pulls me back. Octo is always dissing me in most of his songs but I never take it. If he feels like he needs to rap about me, it's all good.” Khaligraph, who is set to release an album this year, is expected to bring Kisumu to a standstill at the Guinness Fanzone event, alongside Nameless, DJ Joe Mfalme and Jua Cali.
