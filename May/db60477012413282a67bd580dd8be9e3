A special Cabinet meeting chaired by President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House yesterday approved the National Disaster Risk Management policy. In a press statement, the Cabinet said the policy would help to develop strategic plans to protect Kenyans during natural disasters. It will enable the administration to invest in disaster research and draft plans to reduce the risks to people and property. “The Cabinet also approved the Public Finance Management (National Drought Emergency Fund) Regulations, 2018,” the Cabinet office said. The new regulations will guide the operations of the fund set to enhance the efficiency of drought risk management systems in Kenya. Uhuru said it will provide a common basket of emergency funds for drought risk management. The 21-member Cabinet also approved the Proposed Public Finance Regulations Management, 2018, to provide a sustainable financing to sportsmen, artists and cultural practitioners. The principal objective of the Fund is to guide the operations of the Sports, Arts and Social Development fund. The government will now restructure principal loans after approving the proposed write-off and restructuring of principal. “The National Treasury having analysed loans previously given to public entities has recommended a write-off of principal loans totalling Sh2.9 billion,” the statement said. “It will pave the way for the restructuring of principal loans of Sh764.3 million and conversion to grants of principal Sh268.2 million loans.” The Cabinet also agreed on a joint National Mapping and Resource Mapping using a multi-agency approach. This will ensure the provision of secure up-to-date geospatial data at minimum cost to be shared across a wide range of functions within the government for planning and development purposes.
