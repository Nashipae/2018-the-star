The Kenya Meat Commission has partnered with a Turkish agency to improve livestock production in arid and semi-arid counties. KMC managing commissioner Joseph Learamo said on Friday they have a deal with the Turkish International Development and Coordination Agency to develop livestock feedlots. He said the project will improve livestock production and value chain management, especially in Northeastern. "We will look broadly at the livestock value chain management in catchment areas where we get livestock as raw materials,” Learamo said during a forum at the factory’s plant in Athi River, Machakos. "As it is now, we can hardly get livestock with more than 100 kilogrammes.” He said the value chain includes feeding, breeding, disease control and delivery to slaughterhouses. A delegation from Kenya recently visited Turkey for an exchange programme. "Turkey has agreed to invest in animal feed in most parts of our country. We will take advantage of ASAL counties, which have plenty of land that lie idle for the projects,” Learamo said. He said the government’s research and innovations section will hire Kenyan scientists to work with those from Turkey to decide on best areas.
