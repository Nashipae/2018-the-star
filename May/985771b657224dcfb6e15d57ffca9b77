MCAs have raised concerns over delayed bursary funds. The legislatures say their counterparts in other counties have already received their share. At least 700 people in each of 85 wards within Nairobi are said to have applied for the bursaries. Kilimani MCA Moses Ogeto told the Star yesterday that the delay of the bursaries is a major disappointment to Nairobi residents. “In my ward I have around 500 people who had applied for the bursary and to date, I cannot give them a definite reason as to why there is a delay,” he said. Ogeto said that during the previous administration, there were no such delays or problems with bursaries, compared to what they are experiencing with this government. Early this month when the house was adjourning most MCAs said they gave out bursary forms in December. However Majority leader Abdi Guyo told the Star yesterday that the Controller of Budget had approved the bursaries on Monday. “The regulations were having some issues, which needed to be changed. On Monday she approved it and by the end of this or next week the bursaries will be released,” he said. Education committee chair Millicent Mugadi yesterday rubbished claims that there is friction between the county and national governments, leading to the delay of bursaries. She urged her counterparts to be patient as the bursaries will soon be issued
