It is depressing to see persons with disability struggling the make their way through heavy rain which has become part of our daily routine for some weeks now. Those with no vehicles are at the mercy  of matatu crews, who mostly have little patience for anyone, let alone PWDs. It is, therefore, painful as these people must brave their way to their workplaces, especially in organisations with no policies that encourage inclusivity for challenged persons. However, some organisations are choosing the unbeaten path to deal with this problem. According to director of customer relations at Safaricom Janet Atika, the company has a strategic ambition to increase their PWD staff by five per cent by the year 2020. “At present, this group is only one per cent, and in customer operations’ division it is three per cent,” she said in an interview. The UN Global Impact Guide for business on rights of persons with disability indicates that the disabled are generally overlooked when it comes to access to the marketplace. The guide asks organisations to making their businesses more receptive and responsive to persons with disabilitiy by developing better products and services. Safaricom so far has 97 staff  living with disability and most of them - 75 - are serving in customer operations. Their daily tasks involve responding to inquiries and resolving customer questions on telephone. The company has two members of staff who use sign language because they are deaf. The two work in the social media section because they can type back and give users responses. The proprietor of Signs Media Luke Kizito has hired people with disability. This is the only media house that fully incorporate use of signs in all its programmes, says Kizito. It is evident that many Kenyan workplaces are not user firiendly for people with disability.
