Lameck Baraza / Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi has complained over transformers Kenya Power is using in his area, saying they are malfunctional. Wandayi said it’s unproductive for residents and business persons to lack electricity for more than two weeks, despite paying their bills on time. He said power supply in the county is unreliable since faulty transformers are not replaced. Addressing residents in Ugunja on Tuesday, Wandayi faulted the power distribution company for "purchasing fake transformers that blow off after few days of service". "In cases where the Kenya Power has replaced transformers in Siaya, it has not taken more that a month before they blow up,” Wandayi said. Click here for the latest political news
