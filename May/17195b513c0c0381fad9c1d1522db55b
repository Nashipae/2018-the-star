The National Council of Churches in Kenya has faulted the ban on prayer vigils - commonly known as 'Kesha', which was imposed by Narok county commissioner. Officials from NCCK South Rift region on Friday said the move is ill-advised and that it will not in any way help to find solution to the issue of early pregnancies. Narok county commissioner George Natembeya issued the directive following rising statistics of early pregnancies among school going teenagers in the county. But the clergy men and women said the church has always been on the forefront in championing for responsible sexual behaviour. The church leaders said researches by different universities have never blamed 'Keshas' for teenage pregnancies. They cited a report by the Ministry of Health, African Institute for Development Policy, and NORAD (Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation) titled "Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health in Narok county". The report drew a correlation between teenage pregnancies and low use of contraception, low level of education, female circumcision, and early marriages. "We, therefore, call upon the government to lift the ban since it is a clear case of denying our people the right to practice their religion," the group led by Ernest Ng’eno said. He told journalists they were shocked by the move adding that "it is immoral and irresponsible for church to be blamed for a social problem". During the conference a new leadership for the South rift region was also elected. Ng’eno was elected chairman, Rev Peter Muiruri (Vice chairman), while Rev Sarah Mainye was elected Honorary Treasurer. Others are Canon Jane Lelena (Women representative), Pastor Joram Kiarie, and Samuel Lemurt - to represent persons with disabilities. Click here for the latest political news
