The body of a middle-aged woman was on Saturday morning found dumped along the road at Nyaigwa village Township Ward in Nyamira County. The woman is believed to have been killed elsewhere and the body dumped at the roadside. According to Johnson Manyara, the assistant Chief of Township location, the body was discovered by passers-by who were headed to church. "I was called by one member of the Nyumba Kumi initiative who told me about the body that had been discovered and I also informed the OCS," Manyara said. He said the woman appeared to have been dead for a couple of days since the body had started decomposing. The body had marks all over her face and the fingers on the left hand had been chopped off. "The victim is not a resident of my area of jurisdiction, but we are in the process of establishing where she hails from. It seems the body had been kept somewhere because it is already decomposing," Manyara added. The assistant Chief urged the government to provide enough security in the area to help curb such incidents. He also called on the residents of the area to be calm as police carry out investigations into the matter. The body of the victim was moved to the Nyamira County referral hospital.
