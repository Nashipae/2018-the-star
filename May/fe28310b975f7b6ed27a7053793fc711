Ruiru MP Simon King’ara has drafted a Bill to compel the government to issue title deeds to all public institutions to lock out grabbers. Lack of title deeds exposes public institutions to greedy individuals, he said. King’ara spoke in Ruiru on Monday when he issued Sh26 million bursary cheques to 6,700 needy students. He says most donors are not willing to support institutions that do not have titles. This makes its difficult for the institutions to operate effectively, he said. There are many well-wishers who want to support schools, but they become jittery when there is no title. This affects the growth of institutions, King’ara said. He said more than 70 per cent of public institutions in Kenya, including old ones, are at risk of being grabbed. Fifteen per cent of them have filed land cases. Grabbing of public school land has become a major problem countrywide. “We want the government to issue title deeds to all gazetted public institutions. Land without titles is an easy target for cartels,” he said. King’ara said a Lands office should be set up in Ruiru to fast-track title deeds. It is the duty of the government to guard public property, he said. “I have been fighting to have a Lands office in Ruiru. The process is ongoing. We believe one will be set up by June,” he said. King’ara, who is a member of Parliament’s Lands Committee, said the government would forcibly evict grabbers from public land. He says Ruiru has an alarming shortage of schools. A classroom in most Ruiru primary and secondary schools accommodates more than 170 students, instead of the nationally set number of 50 per class.
