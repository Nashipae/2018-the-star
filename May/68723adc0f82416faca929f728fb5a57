Tanzanian Bongo star Harmonize is now single. He has been dating Sarah, a European woman, for some months now but it seems their love has faded. When asked about his plans to walk down the aisle, the Kwa Ngwaru hitmaker said he is single and has no plans to wed. "Bado, I’m single." The WCB-signed artiste was in Kenya at the weekend, where he brought Nairobi to a standstill at the launch of High Club on Wood Avenue. He addressed Willy Paul’s allegations that he didn’t promote their remix Pili Pili in Tanzania. "No, it’s a long story. Sio kweli kwa sababu utawezaje kujua kama mimi sipromote hii ngoma kama upo huku. Kwa mfano, kwenye Instagram nilipost zaidi ya mara tano. It’s just a long story." (It is not true because how can someone know I am not promoting this song yet it has gone viral...I posted it five times on Instagram) He added: "Tulifanya audio na Willy Paul lakini nilipokuja Kenya kwenye uzinduzi wa album ya Diamond A boy from Tandale, ndio akaniambia kwa kuwa niko Kenya tufanye video. Nashukuru, ni msanii ambaye anajituma." (Willy Paul and I did an audio but when I came to Kenya for the launch of Diamond's album Tandale, he asked that we do a video since I was in Kenya at that time) Willy Paul accused the Tanzanian singer of neglecting their collabo, saying he gave it zero attention. "We should be fair. The way we push our music here, they should also push our music. We are brothers. I feel like they have to play their part. If we are brothers, let’s be real brothers. Hakuna kitu naeza mwambia anajua vile tulikua tume agree (I have no words for him since he knows how we agreed)," he said Harmonize is set to release major collaborations this year together with his much-anticipated album. He is currently making headlines with the songs Kwa Ngwaru featuring Diamond and DM Chick featuring Ghana’s Sarkodie.
