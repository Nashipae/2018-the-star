A lobby group yesterday defended Governor Mike Sonko against criticism that he has run down the city. Friends of Nairobi City County, chaired by former Mayor Joe Akech, said the city’s problems started many decades ago and cannot be fixed in eight months. Sonko has been in office for eight months now. He has been criticised for his failure to fix the city’s problems, despite promising do so within his first 100 days in office. “Cartels are after Sonko because of the corruption loopholes he has sealed at City Hall,” Boda Boda Association chairman Ken Onyango said. “They ... have even threatened him.” Friends of Nairobi City County is made up hawkers, matatu operators, jua kali artisans and boda boda operators. The governor will sponsor this group to Kigali, Rwanda, on June 23 for a four-day benchmarking trip. Matatu Welfare Association chairman Dickson Mbgua said the aim of the trip is to learn best practices and implement them in the capital. “This is the group that will deliver the City in the Sun that we want,” he said. The group urged the government to restore Sonko’s security.
