President Uhuru Kenyatta has tasked Governor Mike Sonko to ensure Nairobians live in a clean environment. This followed the outcry among residents who have lamented over bad roads and garbage in the capital city. Uhuru told the governor to hire youths to clean up Nairobi "instead of spending over Sh700 million to contract companies." He said the city has to be a place where all Kenyans admire and appreciate. "Hii takataka lazima tumalize ndio wananchi waweze kuishi kwa mazingira masafi. Na si ati ni kazi ngumu." (This garbage menace has to end so that Kenyans can live in clean environment...it is not a tough job) "Three years ago when we came here in Mathare, we agreed that Nairobi was going to be cleaned," he said. "Hiyo pesa iende kwa vijana wetu kwa sababu contractors hawafanyi kazi ilhali wanaweka pesa kwa mifuko zao," he said. (Let the money go into the pockets of the youth since contractors have failed and only want to pocket county cash) The president told the governor to live by his promise that his terms in office will not end until the garbage problem is solved. Uhuru spoke during the national tree planting day on Saturday. Last week, Sonko warned Nairobi county executives that they will lose their jobs if they don't deliver. Sonko said this at City Hall when he flagged off equipment for cleaning and unblocking drainage. "To deliver as a government, I cannot work alone. I hereby tell my CECs that If they do not work, I will send them home," he said. He asked the county officials to fully concentrate on efforts towards making the city better compared to what the previous administration did.
