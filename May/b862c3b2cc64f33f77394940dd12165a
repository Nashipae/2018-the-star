Former national champions Ulinzi Warriors have two tight matches as the Kenya Basketball Federation (FKF) Premier League games continue at United States International University courts this weekend. Ulinzi, who are so far unbeaten in the three-week old league, will take on host USIU tomorrow and have their hands full a day later when they meet Strathmore University ‘Blades’. The game of the week is undoubtedly the first meeting between Ulinzi and Blades. In their last meeting last year, the students locked the soldiers out of the play off and wound up second. Thunder, who managed one win and lost the other fixture, have a date with Trailblazers. The self supporting side have found the going really harsh this year having lost all their ties. Former women champions USIU Flames and Eagle Wings will also be on show as they confront Strathmore University ‘Swords’ and Storms respectively. The last game of the day will be a close fight pitting Rachael Wandago’s led Kenyatta University ‘Oryx’ against newly promoted Footprints. The two teams have yet to post a win. The Sunday matches will see Thunder square it off against World Hope. Trailblazers come face to face with Kenya College of Accountancy (KCA) University in a close meeting. Other matches will see Footprints play Storms, Strathmore University meet Eagley Wings with USIU locking horns with Zetech University ‘Sparks’.
