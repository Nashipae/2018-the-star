Q Chillah, a legendary Tanzanian artiste has spoken up about his silence for the last few years. The singer, who is well known for the hit song Uhali Gani, was previously a drug addict. He is said to be the one who introduced singer Ray C to the killer lifestyle. "Nimefanya makosa mengi sana. Siku zote nilkua namuomba Mungu nifanye correction. Nilipotea kupatana na marafiki wabaya walipelekea kufika kwenye hatua mbaya. Mungu alinisogeza na watu wenye nia nzuri." Chillah, real name Aboubakar Katwila, said this during an interview with Tanzania's Dizzim Online. He pointed out that at some point, he wanted to take his own life. He says his children and fans were the reason he decided to sit down and focus on reigniting his life. "Niliacha, sasa ni mwaka wa nne. Lakini kibinadamu hauwezi kuacha kwa siku moja. I took my mind on my trip and think I had a career, I had a dream, ghafla kila kitu kikajua to a stop. "Chillah has now confirmed that he has left the music industry. He is set to release his last song later this week, during his birthday. He makes it clear to fans that it isn't a stunt but an end to his 15-year-old music career. "This is my last song. Ni wimbo ambao unarelate na incident ambayo imetokea two months ago. I thought to myself, on 18th May it's my birthday, so what I'm I celebrating? Nothing. " He added: "I hoped to get money to shoot but financially there are many things I have to do. Kids are in school. Sikupenda, najua imeniumiza. I don't like the life I'm living and that of my kids knowing that they needed to be somewhere better. It's all my fault. Hii sio kiki."
