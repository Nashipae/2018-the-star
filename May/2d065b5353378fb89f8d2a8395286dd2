The interwebs is abuzz with news of a blind date between a celebrity and a die-hard fan. Vera Sidika finally got to meet the "crazy" fan who held up traffic outside the Rick Ross concert at the Carnivore Grounds. Brian Kibet even knelt before the car to catch Vera's attention. The hilarious scene ended with Vera rolling down her car window and obliging the fan by greeting him. Anyhow, Vera and Brian spent Sunday evening chatting and sharing an intimate meal at Tribe's Jiko Restaurant. Reactions include: sanggideons: Hio meno yako na smile wacha tu. I am selling my land soon then I look for you? Utanikubali? Pesa ikiisha nitatoka tu pole pole. ericohndwiga: Otile brown atapata mini heart attack akiona hii rose_dee232: ubaya wa such dates unakuwa exited,anxious,nervous hadi unashindwa kukula mabutterflies ndio zinacheza kwa tumbo
