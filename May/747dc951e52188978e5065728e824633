Contradictory information surrounding the death of a University of Nairobi student has emerged. The body of Dennis Munene was found lying in a swimming pool at a hotel in Mtwapa according to a source within the Coast General Provincial Hospital. The account is different from police's who insists the 25-year-old body was recovered from Lamayani Beach. The source said Munene was taken to the morgue on May 12. He said only "friends" of the deceased checked on him. Read; Missing UoN law student found dead in Mombasa Munene went missing on May 9 at Kasarani. Kilifi South OCPD Joseph Muriuki on Friday insisted Munene was retrieved from the ocean floating. "The body was recorded as unknown. No one knew he was a student," he said. Muriuki said no one reported that he was missing. Officers from the Department of Criminal Investigation have commenced an investigation to unearth the circumstances surrounding the death. Muriuki said Munene had clothes on. He said the deceased was defaced and lips were ripped apart. "His face might have been eaten by fish," he said, adding that other parts were intact. Muriuki said Munene drowned because "his hands were apart" to suggest he was struggling to swim. "He was not killed," he said. But questions are being raised how Munene could have been swimming with clothes on. "He probably might have fallen," the police boss said. Click here for the latest political news
