The DCI is preparing to implement Interior CS Fred Matiang’i’s directive to deport illegal immigrants. DCI’s multiagency team will work with Immigration officers to vet foreigners after the two-month window for them to register. Coast regional police commandant Noah Mwavinda yesterday said the crackdown will begin in 60 days. Senior police officers are said to have met yesterday at the regional police headquarters and discussed how to enforce the directive. The unregistered immigrants pose a security threat, they said. Interior spokesman Mwenda Njoka urged immigrants to get their documents verified to avoid arrest. Mombasa CID boss Washington Njiru said many foreigners running businesses — especially sugar and rice importation — are among those being investigated. work permits “We will intensify operations targetting foreigners who engage in tax-evasion syndicates and money laundering,” Njiru said. In January, 11 Pakistanis were arrested following a raid in Kizingo, Mombasa. They had previously been investigated for illegal employment, tax evasion and money laundering. They are accused of repackaging the imported rice and selling it at subsidised prices. The government says there are more than 100,000 foreigners working in Kenya, most of them are illegal. Matiang’i directed all foreign workers to be issued with new electronic work permits. He said the government will tighten the process of obtaining a work permit.
