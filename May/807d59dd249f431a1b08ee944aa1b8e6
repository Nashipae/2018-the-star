Nyali MP Mohamed Ali has dismissed claims of involvement in the controversial award of bursaries in his constituency. He linked the campaign to opponents who have been trying to undermine him. Ali said on Friday the CDF is headed by a government-appointed manager and any complaints would be handled by the committee, which is independent. Under the law, MPs are patrons of the fund but are not directly involved in its management, as is commonly believed. The award of this year’s bursaries has been dogged by protests from local leaders alleging bias. Ali also denied he had fired three former staff of the CDF, as earlier reported. Fadhili Hassan, Joshua Musyimi and Ruto Ng’etich said their contracts ended and were not renewed. On May 7, the Fund account manager Mamo Michael wrote to Hassan informing him that the Nyali “NGCDF committee has decided not to engage your services further as from the date of this letter.” Momanyi said Ali is a man of “good moral standing and does not steal from the more disadvantaged members of the society”. And Hassan, who was alleged to have lost his job in connection with the bursary, said his role was to check whether contractors were on track and performing their work correctly, then report back to the office. NO POWER “I was not in any way involved with [issuance] of bursary,” he told the Star. Ng’etich, who had previously claimed he was dismissed, also said his contract had expired just like that of Joshua Musyimi. Through his lawyer Paul Momanyi, the MP said he has “no power to fire any person of the CDF committee” because “he’s merely a patron”, is not a “signatory to any of the fund accounts and has no role whatsoever in the disbursement of funds.”
