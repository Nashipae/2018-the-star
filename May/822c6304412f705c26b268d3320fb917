Medic Moses Njue, the former chief government pathologist accused stealing hearts from two corpses, yesterday launched his bid to block prosecution.Njue said his trial and that of his son Lemuel Mureithi are unfounded and only meant to frustrate his work.At the magistrate’s court, Njue and Mureithi are accused of destroying the heart to conceal evidence, knowing the autopsy report would be used as evidence in a case pending in court.They face a third count of illegally removing the heart.Njue has also been linked to a second theft in similar circumstances. Read: Ex-state pathologist denies stealing heart, released on Sh1 million bondThe state is said to have previously recommended his prosecution over another theft of body parts in Meru. The doctor last week denied stealing the heart of Timothy Muumbo on June 25, 2015 after conducting a postmortem examination. The theft is alleged to have occurred at the Lee Funeral Home in Nairobi when the doctor did an autopsy on Muumbo.In papers filed at the High Court yesterday,  Njue sued the Director of Public Prosecution, Inspector General of Police and the DCI.The pathologist resigned from the government to set up his own medical school. He says the trial has no foundational evidence, is ill founded and violates his and son’s rights.Both argue their trial amounts to double prosecution as there exists another similar matter.“I should not be subjected to illegal proceedings whose intention, and of some of the interested parties, is to vex me and trample on my rights,” he adds in an affidavit.He says Muumbo’s relatives have filed a petition before the High Court to compel him to release the stolen body part.Njue cites malice and selective prosecution, saying his trial is meant to pressure him and frustrate the matter pending in court.Being tried at the magistrate’s court, while a civil matter is pending at the High Court, he argues, will prejudice the case.“Pending the hearing and determination of the application an order do issue restraining the respondents from hearing, proceedings with conducting or in any manner proceedings the charges laid or proceedings before the chief magistrate court,” reads the application.
