An MP has warned rapper Timmy Tdat against using his daughter as a video vixen in the video of his upcoming song. Timmy was supposed to release his highly anticipated video later this week but it seems his plans might be scuttled. Speaking to Word Is, the rapper-cum-radio presenter said he didn’t know the vixen was a politician’s daughter. “Kuna video
ilikua inafaa itoke. Mimi sikujua ni mtoi wa MP. Mimi nililipa modelling
agency. Ndio nikasikia kuna mtoi fulani wa MP ametumika ikakua tricky
kuitoa,” Tdat said. The rapper said the girl in question, whose father is said to be an MP from Central Kenya, is a law student who had applied as a model in an agency. “Tulibonga na
MP alidai si picha poa kwa mtoi wake kufanya video kama hizo. Team
yangu ilitry kubonga nayeye imwambie hii ni kazi but yeye akaona huyo ni
mtoi amesoma law ame-invest pesa mob sana kwake,” he said. However, the rapper will not redo the video and will release it with the said chick in it. “Siwezi shoot
tena. Mimi nimelipa director na cameramen. Sasa mimi ningejuaje ni mtoi
wa MP? Niko na time gani ya kuenda kuuliza dem buda yako ni nani?” he said. Adding, “Bora ako na haga fresh na anakaa fiti.” When asked who the Central MP is, he said, “Unataka kuniingiza tena kwa ngori ingine? Sitaki kumpea mileage. Unataka nishikwe na heart attack wewe?”
