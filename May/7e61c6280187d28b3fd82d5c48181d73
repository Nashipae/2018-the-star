A Bungoma MCA was on Monday charged with defrauding a businessman of Sh5 million in the pretext of selling him a house. Luke Opwora (Nominated) is accused alongside politician Levi Makali, who unsuccessfully contested the Sirisia MP seat last year. They faced the charge of defrauding Opicho Fungututi in August last year at the Bungoma Resident Magistrate's court. The two were released on Sh1 million bond or Sh500,000 cash bail each. They spent the night in the remand cells at  Bungoma GK Prison after failing to raise the cash. In January, Opwora 
was arrested for allegedly invading Friends School Kamusinga in an attempt to evict its new principal. Click here for the latest local political news
