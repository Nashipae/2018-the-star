In a statement on Friday, Shah said the mall has been certified as structurally sound by the relevant authorities. "We are now working round the clock to complete the repair and restoration works in a safe and timely manner," he said. He said they have identified temporary spaces within the mall for tenants whose outlets have been affected by the fire. "We would like to express our deepest regret at the inconvenience and disruption caused by this incident," he added. The fire at Sarit centre resulted from a faulty photocopying machine at the CopyCat store on the ground floor. Witnesses said attendants attempted to put it off using a hand-held fire extinguisher in vain. Mitchel Rikta, a tenant at the mall in Westlands, said CopyCat managers took swift action but that the situation got out of control. An alarm was sounded and tenants and shoppers evacuated from the building.
