Nandi Governor Stephen Sang on Friday laid bare receipts showing the purchase of 18 tippers at a cost of Sh8.5 million each. The trucks have been the cause of bad blood between the governor and Senator Samson Cherargei. Cherargei claimed the county bought each lorry at a cost of Sh15 million. He did not produce evidence to back his claims. Sang showed journalists invoices from Trans Africa Limited showing the firm supplied the FAW type tippers. The invoices were dated February 20 and signed by regional manager Paul Mukoya. The governor said the county opted for direct procurement because the prices were set by the government. “The senator can produce the evidence he has to show any contrary dealings. Otherwise he should stop making false claims for personal gain," Sang said. The two leaders have had sharp differences over claims of corruption and skewed hiring of staff. Deputy President William Ruto on Monday summoned the two for a meeting in Nairobi during which he asked them to end the wrangles. Ruto said the fights were hampering service delivery. “It’s true we met in Nairobi and agreed on some issues which we shall follow up on,” Cherargei told the Star on the phone on Wednesday. He said full reconciliation with Sang would be based on tangible measures to deal with graft in the county and improve efficiency of services. Sang has denied the graft allegations, saying he had all documents of tenders and hiring processes. Youth leader have accused Cherargei of f attempting to cause tribal disharmony through claims Sang had hired outsiders. They said Nandi was a cosmopolitan county and residents from others regions had a right to be considered for county jobs. Only two out of 18 chief officers are native Kalenjins.
