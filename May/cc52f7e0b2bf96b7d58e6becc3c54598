Nairobi residents may find relief from constant traffic jams should the proposal to have private cars stay away from the CBD and Westlands on Wednesdays and Saturdays sees the light of the day. The car-free days proposal is being discussed by the Nairobi regeneration committee as part of the plans to decongest the city centre. Cars would specifically stay away from Haile Sellasie Avenue, Tom Mboya Street, University Way and Uhuru Highway. “Between eight in the morning to seven in the evening, we will not allow private vehicles to be within the CBD or even park. But this is something that is being discussed by stakeholders,” Transport executive Mohamed Dagane said yesterday. “This is to encourage or perhaps have paradigm shift in thinking and attitude of commuters in Nairobi to discourage them from using use private vehicles.” Read: Ban cars not matatus from CBD The Nairobi regeneration team was appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta in March. It was tasked with tackling the city’s traffic gridlocks, ending the garbage menace and cleaning Nairobi River and its three tributaries. The team is co-chaired by Tourism CS Najib Balala and Governor Mike Sonko. Kigali is one of the few cities in Africa that has a car-free day – the first Sunday of every month. The rule was introduced in 2016 to tackle pollution and promote non-motorised transport. Dagane said the car-free proposal can only be implemented after the government introduces the 50 high-capacity buses currently under procurement. About three million private cars, with one or two passengers, access the CBD every day, causing massive traffic. The government said it will introduce 30 buses each carrying between 100 and 120 people, by the end of the month. Also Read: Boda boda operators banned from Nairobi CBD Click here for
