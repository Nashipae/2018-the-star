Mt Elgon MP Fred Kapondi has praised the government for arresting Timothy Kitai, alias Cheparkach. Kitai, suspected to be the ring leader of a gang terrorising Mt Elgon residents, was arrested in Eldoret on Monday. He was taken to the DCI offices in Nairobi for interrogation. Cheparkach was later charged at Nairobi’s Milimani law courts, where the police asked for more time so they can finish investigations. “Finally justice for the Mt Elgon victims will prevail. Many people have lost their loved ones and those who lost their lives can’t be replaced,” Kapondi told the Star on Friday on the phone. He said police must conduct thorough investigations. “I’m asking the investigating agencies to get to the bottom of the matter,” the lawmaker said. He told Cheparkach’s young brother, Ngeywo Kitai, and all suspects on the run to surrender. “They better turn themselves in instead of engaging the government in a hide-and-seek game. The government’s machinery is a well-knit system, it has a long arm,” he said. On March 6, Interior CS Fred Matiang’i imposed three months dusk-to-dawn curfew in Mt Elgon to help flush out criminals.
