Mount Kenya leaders are being strategic about the 2022 presidential election. That's why they have retreated after last year's polls. Moreover, most of the fellows making noise and campaigning for DP William Ruto in Mount Kenya are political lightweights. They don't have a lot of sway in the region. They are being strategic now because since the election ended, have you ever heard President Uhuru Kenyatta talk about supporting Ruto in any public forum? He has not. So most people running around are realising they might be making a very costly move. However, it's still too early to tell whether Mount Kenya will support Ruto or not. He must do a lot of work to convince the Kikuyu Nation why they need to rally behind him. The Mount Kenya region will weigh which political formation best caters for their political interests. For the first time, we might have a scenario where Mount Kenya does not have a presidential candidate. But four years is a long time. They can still get a candidate, perhaps not a formidable one. However, they can easily get a candidate to pair with any bloc and share power. But on the referendum, Uhuru is just being tactical. The referendum issue had jolted the Ruto camp. So Uhuru is trying to calm nerves because he has seen the clamour was causing panic in that camp. I strongly believe the President is just being smart. He has not said outright there would be no referendum. He said he is not ready now to run around talking about one. Did he rule out a referendum in the future? He said the focus now is on the Big Four. Some issues identified in the handshake with Raila would require a referendum. However, to hold a referendum requires a year plus. At the moment, we do not even have an electoral commission. So it's not over for Ruto and his team. We will definitely have a referendum. Late next year or early 2020.
