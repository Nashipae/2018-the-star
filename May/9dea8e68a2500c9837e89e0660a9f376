Hull City in Kenya should have been more like Hull City in Gor Mahia pockets. The tour, sponsored by betting firm SportPesa was not the stroll in the pack that the seasoned pros like striker Frazier Campbell and goalkeeper David Marshall expected. Gor Mahia are no pushovers home or abroad and Hull will be happy they return to England unscathed thanks to a 4-3 win on post match penalties. Boniface Oluoch saved three penalties but this was not enough for the kenyan champions to shut-out their European opposition. Gor were on the brink of a win but Cercidy Okeyo saw his last kick saved as Hull clawed their way back. In regular play, Hull should have had their net bulge twice in two minutes. First Francis Kahawa shaved the crossbar with a freekick that once defeated Nigerian shot-stopper Vincent Enyeama, rated as the best goal he has ever conceded. Then, Jacques Tuyisenge curled an effort wide when he should have picked out a teammate. No wonder Marshall smiled wryly. Those were not the only chances Dylan Kerrâ€™s charges curved out. Ivorian Ephraim Guikan showed why he is destined for greater things, tormenting the Hull defence throughout the encounter. Undoubtedly, his tour of duty will not end at Gor. Bigger things lie ahead for him and most of his teammates who showed they have what it takes to go toe to toe with seasoned pros. USM Alger will be at the same Kasarani grounds on Wednesday and they will have watched with trepidation the threat of the Haron Shakava-led team. The only worry from the tie was the limp by Shakava in the closing stages of the well attended clash at the immaculately refurbished Kasarani. But Kerr, a modest former player will be happy that he outsmarted Nigel Adkins, a coach of Rolling status. For years, Kenyan clubs have been used as a punching bag by overseas and continental clubs but Gor have shown they no longer will play that role and instead will throw a sucker punch of their own.
