Kenya Power says it has restored full supply to Lamu County which has been receiving intermittent power supply over the past few days. Power supply to Lamu and neighbouring areas was affected by heavy rains experienced last week in the Sabaki and Tana River County. The rains damaged sections of the distribution and transmission networks serving the area. "Kenya Power is pleased to announce that electricity supply to Lamu has been normalized and that all customers are back on supply," the supplier said in a statement on Sunday. The Tana River basin is home to Masinga, Kamburu, Gitaru, Kandaruma and Kiambere hydro-power stations. About 70 per cent of Tana River county has been destroyed by floods triggering a humanitarian crisis. At least 32 villages have been affected and more than 30,000 homesteads destroyed.
