Avicii, whose real name was Tim Bergling, was one of the biggest stars in electronic dance music. “The Bergling family has now confirmed that the funeral will be private, in the presence of the people who were closest to Tim,” his Swedish publicist Ebba Lindqvist said in a statement, without providing any more details. No cause of death has been released, but in a statement last month Bergling’s family appeared to suggest he took his own life, saying that he struggled with his thoughts and “could not go on any longer”.
