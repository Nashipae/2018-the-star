The task force formed by Deputy President William Ruto to review the causes of forests depletion has been accused of doing a shoddy job.The forest conservation taskforce presented its report to Ruto on April 30.But Elgeyo Marakwet Deputy Governor Wesley Rotich on Saturday said the team collected views in major towns, instead of visiting forest areas.He attended a tree planting drive at Kapchemutwa, where 5,000 trees were planted.Rotich said the task force did not tour Elgeyo Marakwet, despite the county having the second largest forest cover in the country after Nyeri.“The members collected views in Eldoret alone. They should have collected the input of community forest associations, sawmillers and the county government,” he said.
