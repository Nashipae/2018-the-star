The High court has directed an organisation to institute contempt of court proceedings against the Nairobi county government for defying court orders. Justice Samson Okong’o gave the directions after the county government failed to honour a court order that directed it to stop the construction of a multi-million market in Kariokor pending the hearing and determination of the suit. “I hereby direct that the applicant institutes a contempt application against the county government and appear before the court for further mention on July 17, 2018,” Okong’o said.
