Matuga constituency CDF manager Ali Maingu has said at least 30 per cent of schools have unsafe latrines. Most of them were destroyed by heavy rains which have been pounding the region. Maingu yesterday blamed the previous administration for not setting aside enough budget for latrines in schools. Last week, Madibwani Primary School was closed by public health officials for not having good latrines. The more than 200 pupils use a make shift structure, which was destroyed by rain. Public health officials said the school will only be opened once minimum sanitation requirements are met. Maingu said the Matuga CDF kitty issued Sh700,000 to construct permanent latrines at the school. “Construction of toilets at Madibwani school is underway, but this problem is still a concern. It is not the only school with bad toilets or poor infrastructure,” he said. The CDF manager said this year he only received Sh84 million, which is not enough to cater for all schools in Matuga.
