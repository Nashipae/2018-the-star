A fissure in the floor of a pan in Loyamorok, Tiaty subcounty, has sucked up all the water. “This is a mystery because it rained the whole night, but we woke up the following morning [Wednesday] to find the entire dam, [which was] full of water, completely dry,” resident Joseph Long’ole said. The Sh3.5 million pan was built in February by the Baringo government.  It holds 14 million cubic metres ( 1.4 billion litres) of water. It is 70 by 60 metres wide and serves 3,000 residents. Tremors were reported on Sunday and Monday. The fissure is widening and residents have been urged to flee. Geothermal prospecting is underway nearby. The Geothermal Development Company is prospecting in Korossi, four kilometres away, and in Paka Hills 15km away. GDC water engineer Reuben Komen said such “faulting” is common in volcanic areas. “We will be forced to look for an alternative place to drill another dam because the damaged one no longer holds water,” he said. “We also need a geologist to explain the phenomenon of the cracks because all the water went underground and there is no indication of where it drained to.” Long’ole said residents are baffled as the pan didn’t overflow. “We wonder how all the water disappeared, but there was a fault line spotted across the pan,” he said. Long’ole said before the pan was built they would walk more than 10km to Lake Baringo and the Ng’inyang River to fetch water for their livestock and domestic use. Tiaty is classified under arid and semi-arid lands and is inhabited by the pastoralist Pokots, who depend on livestock keeping. “While pondering the [phenomenon], we wonder where [we will] run once the drought sets in … We thought our problem had been solved,” Long’ole said. Tuwo assistant chief John Kaparenger said nobody has been injured but urged residents to move. Loyamorok MCA Maria Losile blamed the damage on poor workmanship. “We appeal to experts to urgently ascertain the cause of the seepage and cracks,” she said.
