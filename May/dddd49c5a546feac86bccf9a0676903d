The Education ministry will meet stakeholders today for a crisis meeting following reports of plans to cheat in this year’s KCSE exam. The more than 200 players are from the ministry, Teachers Service Commission, faith-based organisations and trade unions. The meeting will be at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development. The issues to be discussed include the status report on the Kenya National Examinations Council’s (Knec) preparedness for the 2018 national exams and reviewing the gains made in the last three years. They will discuss the risks involved in the administration of exams and suggest ways of mitigating them. The meeting follows claims some parents and schools are collecting money to buy exam materials. On Sunday, Ortum Secondary School in West Pokot was closed after claims students demanded assistance to cheat in the exam. Last year, the results of 320 students from the school were cancelled over cheating. Knec said it will ensure exams confidentiality is maintained. Acting chief executive officer Mercy Karogo said, “The council advises parents, candidates and other stakeholders not to be duped into purchasing any material purported to be genuine examination questions.” Last year the council cancelled KCSE exam results of 1,205 candidates alleged to have been involved in cheating. Chairman George Magoha said the students were from nine out of 10 exam centres that reported cheating. “It’s amazing that in some cases the candidates had written the right answers before cancelling them to write wrong answers they received from teachers who colluded with them,” he said. Magoha said 11 candidates were found with mobile phones and nine others with unauthorised materials in exam rooms. He said the candidates whose results have been cancelled were free to register for this year’s exams at schools of their choice.
