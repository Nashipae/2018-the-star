A Nairobi court has suspended an order requiring Governor Mike Sonko’s government to pay a law firm that supplied it with printing materials Sh6.2 million. Chief magistrate Edna Nyaloti on Tuesday set aside the orders obtained by Ondabu and Advocates Company. This was after Sonko told the court the orders were wrongfully obtained. The orders had required the county to release the money, from its Cooperative Bank account at City Hall, to the law firm following a consent order. But Sonko told court the consent was entered without the county’s approval. "The consent issued on April 16, 2018 is hereby set aside pending inter-parties hearing of this application," the magistrate ruled. Sonko accused the law firm of colluding with a lawyer who was representing the county in the matter between it and General Suppliers Limited. General Suppliers Ltd had moved to court demanding payment from the county. But on Monday April 16, even before the matter was resolved, a consent was entered with the law firms agreeing that the county's would pay Sh6,234,829.65 On April 17, the County’s acting chief Finance officer Ekaya Alumasi advised the county to forward the matter to the Pending Bill Committee, which is still undertaking verification of all unclear bills, for scrutiny. The bank alerted the county on Tuesday informing it that it had received a garnishee order requiring it to release the funds to the law firm of Ondabu Advocates, prompting the governor to move to court.
