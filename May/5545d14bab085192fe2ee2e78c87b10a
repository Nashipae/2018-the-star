Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro wants corruption classified as a capital offence in the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act. In a letter to Speaker Justin Muturi, the MP said crimes related to graft fall within the threshold of capital offences, which in most cases is punishable by death. "This will help reduce the rampant cases of corruption in public offices," Nyoro said over his proposed amendment. He wants punitive measures such as life imprisonment, capital punishment, forfeiture, increased fines, and other forms of punishments taken against those tried and convicted on corruption among other economic crimes. His proposal comes in the wake of the probe on the Sh9 billion scandal at the National Youth Service. At least 40 people were on Monday summoned by detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to record statements. Before this Youth PS Lillian Mbogo-Omollo and NYS boss Richard Ndubai stepped aside to pave way for the probe into the heist. The two are said were directly responsible for huge payments to various companies over fictitious deals tendered their resignation.
