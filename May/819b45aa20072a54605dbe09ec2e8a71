KBC news anchor Roncliffe Odit has quit the station he has been in the past four years after landing a bigger job. Speaking to Word Is, he said: "Friday was my last working day at KBC. On Monday, I start working with the BBC Swahili team at Riverside." Odit said he the new career move was a childhood fantasy. "I feel excited to be joining BBC Swahili Service. After 13 years in the industry, my dream is finally coming through. Since I was a kid I have always dreamt of working for the London-based media house," he said. "It has been a great journey with ups and downs. I want to thank Jehovah God, my family and my friends, especially Lynace Mwashighadi, whom I leave behind at KBC."
