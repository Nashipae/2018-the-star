The Commission on Revenue Allocation has praised 33 counties for automating revenue collection. Chairperson Jane Kiringai yesterday said the remaining 14 counties are still collecting revenue manually. She said of the 33 counties, 18 counties have realised an increase in their revenue collection. “Use of ICT will enable counties to achieve accelerated growth and development through efficiency and effective use of limited resources,” Kiringai said. She spoke during the third edition of the County Revenue Enhancement and Automation conference in Kwale. Kiringai said Sh6.3 billion, which is part of the fiscal responsibility allocation, will be disbursed to 18 counties for increasing their local revenue collection in the last financial year.
