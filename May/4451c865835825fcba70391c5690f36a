Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga has urged residents to learn about traditional healthy foods. He said food will feature prominently in next year’s Nyeri Tourism and Cultural Festival. “The department concerned should next year set up a small hotel with traditional meals and brews so that those who do not know our traditional food can get to know it,” Kahiga said. “Get chiefs’ permission and prepare traditional brews so people can taste it because that is our culture.” He spoke on Saturday at Dedan Kimathi grounds during the third Nyeri Tourism and Cultural Festival.
