A standard two pupil died instantly on Monday after she was knocked down by a speeding government vehicle near Kamunyii river on Machakos-Wote road. Witnesses said the girl was walking home from school with others when she was hit by the vehicle belonging to The Independent Electoral and boundaries commission (IEBC). "I saw the vehicle skid before it veered off the road then stopped about 20 meters from where the child fell," Vincent Maingi, a boda boda rider, told the Star. The other children scampered to safety. The Star learned that the children had been released to go home as the other lot had left for sports at Unoa grounds in Wote town. Police officers from Makueni accompanied by their traffic counterparts inspected the scene of the accident. A senior police officer claimed that the driver of killer vehicle, which was headed to Wote town at the time of the accident, was drunk. The driver was whisked away by police after locals threatened to attack them. However, Makueni OCPD Bosita Omukolongolo dismissed the claims the driver was drunk. "The driver is with us to record statement. Whether he was drunk or not is an issue subject to investigation and confirmation by medics," the police boss said. Kalota Kasimu, the grandfather to the girl he identified as Vaati, told the Star that the girl was an orphan. Her body was taken to Makueni Level 4 hospital while the vehicle was towed to Makueni police station. Click here for the latest political news
