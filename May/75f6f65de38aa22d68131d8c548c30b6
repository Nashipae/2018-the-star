Four people died on Saturday evening on the Engineer-Naivasha road after an exhauster truck belonging to Nyandarua county lost control and landed in a ditch. Eye witnesses said the truck was headed to Naivasha from Engineer with four occupants on board. A woman who had hiked a lift on the truck was among the victims of the accident that happened at 6 pm. The witnesses said the truck's breaks appeared to have failed as it approached the unmarked ditch. They said the driver steered the free-rolling truck away from a 14-seater matatu that was stuck in water before landing in the water-filled ditch. The ditch was dug by a Chinese contractor who is doing excavation works to build a new bridge on the Engineer-Naivasha road. The contractor demolished the Matundura Bridge along Mingutiu River in preparation for the new one. He, however, did not barricade the section of the excavated road, make a diversion or put signs to warn road users. Efforts to retrieve the bodies and the truck from the ditch were underway by the time of publishing this story. Click here for the latest political news
