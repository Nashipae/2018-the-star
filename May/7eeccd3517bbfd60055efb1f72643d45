An Embu MCA has drafted a motion to bar the use of county assembly chambers for social and promotional events. Mbeti North MCA Peter Murithi said he is against the conversion of the chambers into a social hall. Groups should not meet and conduct social meetings and harambees at the assembly grounds, he said. Speaking at the assembly, Murithi said the chambers should be respected as a gazetted area for legislation. He wants assembly clerk Jim Kauma to ensure the assembly is used by MCAs only. Murithi said the county assembly is a replica of Parliament and deserves equal respect. Access to the floor of the house ought to be restricted to MCAs only, he added. The assembly chamber has in the past hosted a local youth lobby group meeting which ended in disarray after two MCAs clashed. The Kenya County Government Workers Union election and several promotional events by commercial banks, pension schemes and insurance companies have also met at the Embu county assembly. Murithi said such meetings water down the assemblyâ€™s dignity. County assembly speaker Josiah Thiriku is expected to set a date when the motion will be discussed and resolutions made.
