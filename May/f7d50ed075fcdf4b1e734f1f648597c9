He spoke during the burial of the late Baringo South MP Grace Kipchoim at Kimoriot in Mochongoi. Jubilee leaders present rained accusations on his for allegedly playing a role in denying the DP access to meet Moi.

When it the DP's turn to speak, he avoided uttering a word against Gideon and the aborted Kabarak mission.
