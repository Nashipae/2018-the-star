Kenya has lost three rhinos at Meru National Park to poachers. Via Twitter on Thursday, Kenya Wildlife Service reported that the poachers killed two black rhinos and a calf. "It is with a heavy heart that we announce the poaching of [the three] last night at 6.30 pm at the Rhino Sanctuary," KWS said. "A thorough search, both aerial and ground, was conducted at first light [and the carcasses] found with the horns missing." The service said its officers laid ambushes at several strategic points after hearing gunshots but were not successful. "No sign of the gang was
reported but our teams, both covert and overt, are in hot
pursuit with good leads." Kenya had 20,000 rhinos in the 1970s, falling to 400 in the 1990s. It now has 650, almost all of them black. The country has started marking rhinos and aims to tag and identify 22 of them in two weeks at a cost of $600,000, senior government officials said as part of conserving their dwindling numbers. Poaching has been on a downward trend largely
due to enhanced wildlife law enforcement efforts and the government's investment in conservation. These efforts led to
85 per cent reduction in the crime and 78 per cent reduction in
the case of elephants. In 2017, KWS lost 69 elephants and nine rhinos Early in April, Sudan, the last male northern white rhino died at Ol Pejeta Conservancy. He was the last hope for the breed in the world.
