The Boni minority community in Pandanguo, Lamu county, have decried the recent invasion by tycoons on their land. They said the tycoons, who are selling off their ancestral lands, are mostly from Mombasa and the neighbouring counties. In 2015, the community was awarded a bloc title deed for the ancestral land totaling 20,000 acres. The parcel is owned by over 2,000 members of the Boni community. Speaking in their village yesterday, community elders complained that the tycoons were taking advantage of the illiteracy of some of their members. The lot is said to be falling to schemes of people who dupe them into signing papers showing they have willingly given out their lands. The tycoons are said to move around villages also listing all villagers together with their ID numbers which they later use to process dubious land ownership papers. Elder Adan Golja appealed to the national and county governments to intervene and investigate the matter before the community loses their entire ancestral land. “These people know majority of us didn’t go to school and as such, its easy to confuse us. We have held meetings with community members but we always have people who don’t want to toe the line and have found themselves giving out our lands unknowingly,” Golja said.
