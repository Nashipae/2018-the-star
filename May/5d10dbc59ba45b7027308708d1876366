Two people escaped death narrowly after their saloon car was hit by a train at the Mutindwa railway crossing on Wednesday. The passenger train was heading to town from Dandora during the 7am accident. Police and witnesses said the car got stuck on the rail tracks as the driver attempted to cross over to Sonko Road. Most vehicles use the road which connects Umoja to Buruburu estate to evade traffic on Jogoo Road. "The lady driver panicked after she saw the train approaching and dashed out of the vehicle together with her passenger," a police officer said at the scene.

The driver jumped out on time leaving passengers at the mercy of the approaching locomotive. The matatu was dragged 200 meters on the rails, killing 12 instantly.
