Former Chief Government pathologist Moses Njue might face a second charge in the criminal case of stealing body parts. Justice Florence Muchemi yesterday directed Njue to record a statement with the DCI. "An application by Njue for anticipatory bail has been disposed of and he should present himself to the investigating officer," Muchemi said in an Embu court. The purpose of recording statement is to enable DCI boss George Kinoti to make a decision whether Njue should be charged or not. Muchemi said if Njue does not comply with the orders, the anticipatory bail will be discharged. The former pathologist and his son Lemuel Mureithi have been charged with stealing body parts. He moved to the Embu court after the DPP ordered for his arrest over the matter. The DPP’s directive follows a report saying Njue should be apprehended to face a criminal charge. He is accused of stealing a heart from the body of Benedict Karau, who died on March 2, 2015. The DPP has recommended that Njue be charged with theft, wilful destruction of evidence and illegal removal of body parts. The directive is supported by Karau’s family.
