Transport has been disrupted after parts of the Chanagande-Chalani-Mtsengo road in Kaloleni were washed away by floods. Kaloleni MP Paul Katana on Wednesday said at least 5,000 residents in Chalani and Mtsengo have been cut off from Kaloleni. Classes in four schools have been hampered. The MP toured the area together with Kilifi Roads executive Josephat Mwatela. Katana fears the situation could worsen if heavy rain continues. “Motorcycles are now the only means of transport. They have hiked prices. The damaged road connects Kaloleni to Mwanamwinga and Kayafungo wards.  Residents are now forced to use a longer route,” he said. Kaloleni is famous for palm wine and coconut production.  Everyday palm wine is transported to a collection point in Chanagande town. It is then distributed to Mombasa and other coastal towns. Businesswoman Mapenzi Ngumbao told the Star she used to pay Sh1,200 to transport her wares. Since the road was destroyed, she now pays Sh3,500.
