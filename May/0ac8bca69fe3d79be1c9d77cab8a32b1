Poor and rural households are the biggest losers in the monthly fuel price reviews after Kerosene prices were hiked by Sh1.50 by the Energy Regulatory Commission. From tomorrow, consumers of Super Petrol and Diesel will also pay 34 and 78 cents more respectively for their fuel. The regulator attributed the marginal increase in this month’s prices to the average landed cost of imported refined petroleum products. “Super petrol increased by 1.18 per cent to $680.83 per tonne in April, Diesel increased 2.91 per cent to $632.72 and Kerosene increased 3.06 per cent to $683.67 per tonne,” ERC director general Pavel Oimeke said in the monthly release. In Nairobi, Super petrol will retail at Sh107.17 per litre, diesel at Sh98.64 while a litre of Kerosene will go for Sh78.22 for the next month. A litre of Super petrol in Mombasa will cost Sh103.88, diesel Sh95.35 and Kerosene at Sh75.44. In Kisumu, Super petrol will retail at Sh109.11 per liter while diesel and kerosene will cost Sh100.79 and Sh80.12 per litre respectively. Read: Super petrol price drops by 46 cents, kerosene and diesel go up ERC is currently pushing for the government to increase tax on Kerosene to save the export market. The regulator recently raised concerns on the high rate of kerosene consumption in the country adding that increasing tax on the commodity would help address cartels in the industry. “Several unscrupulous cartels in the market mix kerosene with diesel resulting to 27 million liters of kerosene going into vehicles damaging them besides affecting the export market,” Oimeke said.
