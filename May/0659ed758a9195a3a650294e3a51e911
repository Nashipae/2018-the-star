More than 13,000 girls drop out of primary and secondary school in the country annually due to early pregnancies. Lily Okeyo from the Work Her Dream Organization said the number of girls who transit from primary and secondary schools has been on the decline due to poverty and backward traditions. She spoke in Eldoret on Saturday. Work Her Dream partnered with the Uasin Gishu government to organise a walk to create awareness on the importance of education. Okeyo said 18 per cent of girls get married by the age of 18, while 16 per cent by 15. Many abandon their education. Work Her Dream holds awareness drives to encourage parents to keep their children in school. “We need to sensitise the public about access to education because we need parents to take advantage of the resources available so that all children can go to school,” Okeyo said.
