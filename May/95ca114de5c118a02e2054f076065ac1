Kisumu Woman Representative Rosa Buyu has criticised allies of Deputy President William Ruto for linking the current debate on a possible referendum to the 2022 election. Buyu said it was selfish and a show of lack of interest in the Kenyan agenda for the leaders to continue insisting calls for constitutional reforms are a ploy by some politicians to strategise for the next election. She defended former Prime Minister Raila Odinga in his calls for the nation to consider changing the laws as well thought out idea that means well for Kenya.
