Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo has attributed his collapse at a function in Siaya on Saturday to a heavy attack of malaria. The MP was rushed to Bondo hospital and later to Aga Khan in Kisumu after he collapsed at a funeral in Alego Usonga. "Didn’t know malaria can be so dangerous! Developed malaria which the doctors say was starting to affect the brain!" "Fortunately, all is under control now," the legislator said via twitter on Sunday. Otiende said he is still hospitalised at Aga Khan Hospital in Kisumu - which he calls 'temporary place of retreat', and his condition is stable. He is expected to be discharged from the hospital anytime soon. His wife Linet confirmed that the lawyer is doing well. She said the lawyer might have overworked himself following the activities he has been undertaking.
