One person died yesterday morning in Vango village, Tana River, after showing signs of cholera. Another person had died on Saturday at Gamba village in Garsen constituency with similar symptoms. In yesterday's case, widow Fatuma Hassan said her husband Omari Garachu, 47, started complaining of stomach pains after taking their evening meal. Minutes later he started to diarrhoea and vomit, she said. He was rushed to Madogo Health Centre, where he died a few hours later because of excessive loss of water in the body. Tana River Kenya Red Cross Society coordinator Gerald Bombe told the Star there are rising cases of diarrhoea in the camps of people displaced by floods. He said the hygiene standards are poor and water is not treated. Bombe said they are working with the Department of Public Health to improve conditions in Madogo, Bakuyu, Ziwani, Anole and Mathengeni camps. He said people from 2,075 households have sought shelter in the camps. He said the main challenge is the acute shortage of toilets. Displaced people are relieving themselves in the bushes. He said a total of seven patients were admitted at Madogo health centre and four have been treated and discharged. Hamisi Radu an elder for Vango village said the water the community was using is contaminated since they draw them from a nearby lager which was not safe as it was been shared by wild animals and humans as well. Hamisi added that during dry season the villagers normally use the lager as toilets but during rainy period they draw water from the same place. They appealed to Tana River Water and Sewerage Company (TAWASCO) to repair the piping systems that were destroyed during floods havoc. Click here for the latest political news
