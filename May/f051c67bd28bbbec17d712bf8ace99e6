The Kikuyu Council of Elders has told Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko to end the drama and fulfil his election pledges or quit. In a statement on Tuesday, national chairman Wachira Kiago said the governor should stop fighting imaginary enemies and concentrate on running the city. “It is nine months since he came into office. He promised to clean and decongest Nairobi. He was to look into the plight of hawkers and empower our youth. Unfortunately, he has disappointed,” he said. Kiago told Sonko to stop blaming Kikuyus for his inability to manage Nairobi. He should remember the Kikuyus’ votes were instrumental in his election, he said. “We had better leaders, but he was popularly elected. We accepted the people’s verdict. We expected Governor Sonko to support our businesses by creating a good environment. That has not happened,” Kiago said. “Instead, Sonko is on record bashing Kikuyus in spite of the overwhelming support he received,” he said. Secretary general Peter Munga said elders expected Sonko to fulfil his pledge to appoint a Kikuyu deputy governor. However, he has shown disrespect by proposing deported NRM General Miguna Miguna, Munga said. The elders told Sonko to stop blaming PS Karanja Kibicho for his failures. “Governor Sonko must not cheapen our voters. He must fulfil his pledges or resign. Our patience is running out. He must give us a deputy governor from the Kikuyu community, clean up and decongest the city,” they said.
