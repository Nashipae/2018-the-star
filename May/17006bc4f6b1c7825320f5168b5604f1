Parents and teachers at Gatitu Primary School in Ol Joro Orok want the area CDF office to give them funds to repair collapsing boys’ latrines. They say they have unsuccessfully written three times to the Ol Joro Orok CDF office. They say the latrines started developing cracks last year and they fear the pupils are exposed to danger. “The toilets are collapsing. We are risking the lives of our children,” PTA chairman Kabiru Gitau said on Friday. Deputy head teacher Agnes Waithira said they do not know how long the foundation will hold before the latrines cave in. “I shudder at the thought of what may happen if the foundation caves in with pupils inside,” she said. Waithira said the facility cracked two years ago and was renovated by area MP Michael Muchira. By then he had not been elected MP. She said the staff toilets are also in poor condition and might start overflowing if the rains persist. Muchira said MP the school has not informed his office or sought funds for the toilets. He said the only proposal his office has received is for construction of the school’s administration block, which was razed by suspected arsonists in mid-February. Muchira said the money allocated for the school office will be diverted to toilets.
