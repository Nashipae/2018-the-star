Unknown people attacked and killed Gatunguru secondary school principal Charles Mbogo at his home in Gakurwe village, Mathioya sub-county in Murang'a county. Area deputy county commissioner Charles Laboso said the principal was murdered in his home as his two daughters watched at 2am on Sunday. Laboso said the police have launched investigations to establish if any of the teacher's family members had a hand in his murder. He said the principals' wife has been taken in for questioning while the daughters, a teenager and an 8 year-old primary school pupil, are witnesses. "The daughters have detailed how two men entered into their compound and forced their way into their house where they killed their father before dragging his body into his car as they watched," Laboso said. He expressed confidence that the culprits will be apprehended soon and charged with murder. This happened only two years after former Kiru secondary school principal Solomon Mwangi was found murdered and his body dumped in a coffee plantation in Thika. The teacher was reported missing for a week before his lifeless body was discovered. His wife Jane was arrested as the main suspect and charged with murder in Murangâ€™a high court before the case was moved to Kiambu high court. The matter is still in court.
