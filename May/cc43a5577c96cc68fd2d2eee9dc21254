Football Kenya Federation has unveiled Frenchman Sebastian Migne as the new Harambee Stars head coach. The former Congo Brazzaville coach was handed a three-year contract to take over from Stanley Okumbi, who was relegated to the U-20 national team following a series of dismal performances. Migne was unveiled alongside his assistant, Nicolas Bourriquet and is set to bring in two more experts on the technical bench — goalkeeper trainer, Guiilaine Coffey and chief medical officer, Ludovic Breul. FKF president Nick Mwendwa praised the credentials of the new coach and assured him of the federation’s support. "He is a great coach who has a rich history of African football. With him around, our chances of making it to the 2019 Cup of Nations are high. The government and the federation will accord him the support he requires." Migne said: "It’s a new challenge for me and I am ready to start the job. I want to meet the players and the local coaches so that we can begin our quest for Cup of Nations football." The seat fell vacant following the resignation of Paul Put. The 61-year-old from Belgium cited personal reasons.
