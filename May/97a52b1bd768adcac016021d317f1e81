A man who stabbed a Nakuru magistrate has been sentenced to 11 years in prison. Michael Njeri attacked Resident Magistrate Eunice Kelly after he was ordered to serve three years for assault committed in 2014. The charge sheet indicated Njeri stabbed the magistrate on her right arm on November 22, 2016. He will serve the 11 years for attempting to kill the magistrate or pay a Sh700,000 fine on three counts of attempted murder and two counts of assault. Chief magistrate Josephat Burudi delivered the judgment yesterday. He said Njeri was remorseful but the circumstances and nature of offence are inexcusable.

He also faced other charges of attempting to kill Edith Obondo, the complainant in the assault case. Njeri stabbed her several times in the neck and thigh using a screw driver. He also assaulted a court orderly. Magistrate Kelly told Burudi that Njeri stabbed Obondo eight times. “Once I pronounced the sentence, he ran towards Obondo and started stabbing her before turning to me,” kelly said in her testimony. The magistrate tried to shield Obondo by putting her right hand on her neck but Njeri kept stabbing. The courtroom has two benches at the centre. It was therefore easy for Njeri to reach the magistrate. Njeri said he acted out of anger and dismissed claims he had carried the screw driver with him from home to attack the magistrate and Obondo.
