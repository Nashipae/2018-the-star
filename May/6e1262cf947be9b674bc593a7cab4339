Treasury has urged accountants to support the government’s plan to review the interest rate capping law. Last month, the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya warned that removal of legal limits on borrowing will hurt consumers by returning the country to the era of high credit charges. On Tuesday, Treasury CS Henry Rotich, in a speech read on his behalf by Treasury Chief Administrative Secretary Nelson Gaichuhie asked accountants to reconsider their position. “This matter continues to generate interest and debate and I’m aware that ICPAK took a position on this matter at the time of legislation. I want to urge that you also take time, take stock of available data and reassess your standpoint,” Rotich said during ICPAK’s 34th annual conference in Mombasa. ICPAK chairperson Julius Mwatu last month said reviewing the law capping interest rates would be counterproductive. Mwatu said the institute will continue to support interest rate capping as the benefits outweigh the hiccups. “As ICPAK, we believe that the challenges experienced with lending in the recent past are not directly attributable to the interest rate caps. Therefore, any discussions to consider scrapping of the interest rates caps should ensure the initial objectives of the capping are maintained,” Mwatu said then. However, Rotich urged ICPAK to review its stand, adding Kenya is more likely to progress faster if all parties have agreed on a common path. comparable statements The government has set July as the deadline for transition to accrual-based accounting for the public sector. In accrual-based accounting, revenues are recognised on the income statement when they are earned rather than when the cash is received. Rotich said it is valuable to have comparable financial statements across public sector entities, ministries and state departments to enable consolidation of accounts. This will generate useful information.
