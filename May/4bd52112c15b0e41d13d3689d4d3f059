Mugo wa Wairimu, the fake doctor who is accused of raping a woman in his unlicensed clinic in Githurai 44 risk being locked up in remand after he failed to show up in court. Nairobi chief magistrate Francis Andayi on Tuesday threated to cancel Mugo’s bail after he sent a lawyer to tell the court that he was not available. The lawyer informed court that Mugo, whose real name is James Mugo Ndichu had been taken ill following an accident on May 26.

However, the prosecution said the explanation was not enough since no medical evidence was tabled in court to prove the claims. The magistrate noted that it was not the first time the accused was absconding court, and neither did he send his surety to court as an assurance. “Let the accused avail himself without fail on June 6. Summons are also issued to the surety in this matter. If he does not come, I will cancel the bail” ruled Andayi. Further, the magistrate said the accused should also avail medical documents when he appears in court. Mugo made headlines three years ago when a video appeared online showing a man assaulting a patient who was looked sedated at Prestige Clinic. He faces charges of rape, administering a sedative to a woman and operating unregistered clinics. He was arrested on September 10, 2015, at the Gitungo hotel in Limuru, Kiambu County, in the wake of the rape allegation and is out on a surety bond of Sh 5 million.
