Kiambu public health officials have issued a 21-day ultimatum to Gathaiti Primary School to build toilets or risk being closed. The toilets are full and have been declared unsafe. Parents have appealed to well-wishers and the government to build new toilets. “We have written proposals to well-wishers including the Lari CDF but we are yet to get any feedback,” school chairman Njuguna Mwaura said yesterday. The school has a population of 833 pupils, including those in the ECDE centre. Kiambu county officials visited the school on Wednesday and promised to construct the toilets. Area MCA Joseph Karichu said he will ensure the toilets are built to avoid the closure. ”Write a proposal to the county education department, then I’ll follow it up,” Karichu told Mwaura.
