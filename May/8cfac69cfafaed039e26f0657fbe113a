Did President Uhuru Kenyatta stop following his deputy William Ruto on Twitter? This is the question a twitter user asked on Friday after learning that the President did not have the DP among his followers. At the time this was raised, the Star learned that Uhuru followed 33 people, only six of them being Kenyans. They are First lady Margret Kenyatta, State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu, Treasury CS Henry Rotich, Majority Leader Aden Duale, Dennis Itumbi, and Ezekiel Kemboi. The other followers are world leaders. It is not known when Uhuru stopped following his deputy. However, minutes after @robinnjogu asked about the 'anomaly', the DP was added and has his account at the top of the followers list. Other users said it was the DP who could have blocked the president while others just laughed it off. "Or maybe Ruto blocked him like he does everyone," @Gachanja_ said. @SolomonKarori2 said: "What?" "Mmhh let the conspiracy theories start," @ndungutone, a twitter user, said. The president is currently following 34 people. He has 3.17 million followers on twitter.
