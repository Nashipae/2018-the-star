Police officers in the country have been urged to do their work
in a professional manner and respect citizens. Omar Shurie, who is charge
of operations in Northeastern region, said that the officers have no choice but
to carry out their mandate diligently. He spoke yesterday after closing a sensitisation meeting that brought together junior police
officers from the regular and administration police. Police officers have in the past been accused of human rights violations. During the general election last year, they were accused of using unnecessary force to quell demonstrations and also killing some of the demonstrators, especially in Nairobi and Western Kenya. Shurie challenged the police to maintain high levels of discipline and warned each one will be held responsible for his
or her own actions. “We are calling upon officers to maintain human rights while
performing their duties. we would not wish a situation where the force is
accused of violating human rights in any way,” he said. “We want our officers to be responsible citizens and be ready to
defend their actions if and when called upon. That is why we sensitizing you on
the same,” said Shurie. He said the Constitution clearly defines the rights of the citizens and these rights should not be infringed upon. The independent unit within the national police service is
tasked with receiving and investigating public complaints, he said. The workshop was meant to sensitize the officers on the
functions and mandate of the unit.
