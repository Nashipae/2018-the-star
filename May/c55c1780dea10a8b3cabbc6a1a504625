Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has petitioned the CBK to start investigations against Co-operative Bank which awarded Sh75 million payment from the county's account to a prominent law firm. In a letter dated  May 11, Sonko said Tripple O K Law firm, which acted for Kennedy Wainaina in seeking payment of the sum, may have acted contrary to provisions of the law. Sonko said the county will also take up the matter with the Law Society of Kenya and a disciplinary committee against the law firm, whose action may have caused the county to lose the money if the court did not intervene by issuing  restraining orders halting the payment. The letter of complaint is copied to President Uhuru Kenyatta and CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge. "We have discovered with shock that the bank's main lawyers Triple O K Law acted for the decree holder (Wainaina) by dint of the application dated  July 12, 2017," the letter reads. Yesterday, when the matter came up for mention before Justice Rachael Ngetich, the decree holder's lawyer John Ohaga withdrew from representing Wainaina but gave no reasons. Justice Ngetich allowed the bank's new lawyer Gatonye Waweru to file affidavits within 14 days and directed they be served to parties involved in the commercial dispute The judge also gave extension orders stopping payment of Sh75million to Wainaina until all parties in the dispute put in their responses to the filed by  the  County government challenging the  payment to the degree  holder.
