A needle left in the birth canal of a teenage mother was yesterday removed after the Star exclusively reported her agony. Macklin Amunga’s mother Selpher Otenyo said doctors hurriedly took her daughter to the theatre after the news went viral. Amunga, 18, lived with the needle for two weeks following her operation at the Bungoma Referral Hospital. “The doctors quarreled us for engaging the media,” Otenyo told the Star at the hospital yesterday. X-ray showed a needle lodged in her birth canal. The family says they will seek compensation. “We are not going to take this matter lightly. Patients’ rights are repeatedly abused and it must stop,” Amunga’s husband Maxwell Simiyu said.
