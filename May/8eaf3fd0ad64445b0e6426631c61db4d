Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi have defended traders linked to the Sh1.9 billion cereals board scandal. They said most people named in the list are genuine farmers who produce maize in large quantities. Mandago told Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri to name the real culprits involved in maize importation, who were paid at the expense of farmers. "Some of the people branded as cartels are large-scale farmers. They have been supplying huge quantities of maize to the National Cereals and Produce Board for many years," he said. The two spoke on Sunday during a fundraising at Osorongai Catholic Church in Turbo. However, Uasin Gishu Senator Margaret Kamar wants graft barons and cartels named and shamed. Speaking in Eldoret on Sunday, she said if they are not stopped, they will destroy the economy. "Our farmers have suffered a lot. The government should pay them, as it deals with corruption in the National Cereals and Produce Board," Kamar said. STOP SEEKING MILEAGE Cabinet secretaries Faridah Karoney and Charles Keter, senators Kipchumba Murkomen, Aaron Cheruiyot, Samson Cherargei and Mithika Linturi were present. DP William Ruto’s aide Farouk Kibet also attended the event. Sudi and Cheruiyot criticised Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter, who has been vocal over the scandal. They accused him using the maize scam to undermine the DP. The Kapseret MP said Keter was facing corruption charges and had no moral authority to talk about graft. The Nandi Hills MP has accused cartels from the Kalenjin community of fleecing the NCPB. "Let me remind my friend Keter he was arrested at Central Bank because of a corruption case. He has not been cleared, yet he wants to lecture us on graft," Sudi said. The leaders told the lawmaker to stop using Ruto’s name for political mileage. Cherargei and Murkomen also defended farmers, but said the people involved in corruption should be dealt with ruthlessly. Click here for the latest political news
