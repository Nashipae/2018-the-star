Three traffic police officers were arrested on Thursday while collecting bribes from motorists along the Thika-Garissa highway in Yatta, Machakos county. Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) detectives pounced on the officers at a roadblock in Ngoliba area following complaints by motorists. They are Muriuki Kimathi, George Gathirwa, and Daniel Ndirangu. The police constables are attached to Ngoliba police station in Thika East, Kiambu county. Arthur Opili, EACC's Lower Eastern regional deputy manager, said the three will be taken to court this morning. "They were arrested in a sting operation mounted after numerous complaints by motorists who frequent the route," Opili said. Opili, who addressed the press at EACC offices in Machakos town, said Ndirangu fled the scene at the time of operation before being arrested later at around 4pm. "After a search, we recovered a total of Sh18,800 from both Kimathi and Gathirwa while Ndirangu escaped from the scene," Opili said. The arrest came barely two weeks after three other officers attached to Machakos police station were caught collecting bribes at Kathome area on Machakos-Nairobi Highway. The three were charged in a Mavoko court. Also read: Traffic cops on their way out as IG makes changes Click here for the latest political news
