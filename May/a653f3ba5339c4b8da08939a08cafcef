Former FKF president Sam Nyamweya got a reprieve on Friday after the High Court declared a decision banning him from football activities as illegal. Justice Chacha Mwita of the Constitutional Court said the decision by Football Kenya Federation national executive committee was unlawful. The country's football body had, during a meeting on March 21, 2017, banned Nyamweya from football affairs for a period of ten years. However, Justice Mwita said the action was unlawful, irrational, and mischievous. "The decision so communicated to CAF, FIFA and CECAFA is null and void as Nyamweya was not given an opportunity to defend himself as required by the law." This means Nyamweya is now free to comment on any football matter as he so wishes, both locally and internationally. In his ruling, Justice Mwita ordered FKF to pay the cost of the suit filed by Nyamweya. The latter moved to court upon receiving a letter from FKF. Through his lawyer Martin Wahome Njagi, the former FKF chairman had argued that the decision was unreasonable, irrational and made in bad faith. He also told the judge that the NEC meeting made the humiliating decision yet he was not a member of the federation as he had had resigned a year before. Nyamweya said he was being targeted since he filed a case against the current FKF chairman Nick Mwendwa and other officials of the federation. He also told the court that the ban has brought his character and legacy as a respected local and international football administrator into question. His lawyer also argued that Nyamweya has never been held culpable for any misconduct or allegations as purported by NEC meeting. Mwendwa had asked the court to dismiss the case saying Nyamweya had failed to prove any of the allegation.
