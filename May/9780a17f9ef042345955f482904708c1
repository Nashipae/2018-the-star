A primary school teacher was charged on Monday with defiling a pupil. Joseph Okumu denied the charge before Bungoma principal magistrate Stephen Mogute. Mogute directed Okumu be remanded at the Bungoma police station until June 4 when bond application will be heard. Okumu was accused of defiling an 11-year-old girl on March 8. "I only learnt about it after my daughter told me about the ordeal this month,"  the girl’s mother said. Medical examination showed the minor’s private parts were badly injured, the mother said.
