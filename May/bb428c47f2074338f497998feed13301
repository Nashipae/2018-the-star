Horrified residents of Solai were sent on panic mode after news spread that a second dam at Mansukul Patel's farm had burst its banks. The lot fled from the area to safer grounds in what turned out to be an overflow from one of the dams which was set to be drained on Friday. The incident came a day after a dam burst at the flower farm claiming 44 lives and leaving dozens missing. "The dam which is next to the road burst its banks on Friday morning, a witness told the Star in an earlier interview. "Residents fled for fear of being submerged by the waters," the witness said, claims that area chiefs have denied. Screams were heard as the locals ran in different directions with women rushing to save their children. An administrator said security chiefs drained water of the leaking to reduce the pressure as a safety measure. The area has seven dams used for irrigating the commercial flower farm, most of them said to be lacking outlets. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i said the government has launched investigations to determine the stability of six other dams. A multi-agency unit was formed to try and retrieve the bodies of the dead, as many people were reported missing.
