The Health ministry has signed an MoU with the Council of Governors on the hiring of Cuban doctors. At the ceremony on Monday, Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki noted that specialised services are important for Kenyans. "We are ready to support this initiative by Governors," she said after signing the agreement alongside CoG vice chair Anne Waiguru (Kirinyaga). Waiguru said theÂ process that surrounded the deal was "very consultative and inclusive" and that counties will receive the specialists they need most. "The journey towards universal healthcare is a long term undertaking that requires regular consultation and coordination between the two levels of government and all actors," she noted. The national government and counties will share the costs of having the 100 Cuban doctors who will arrive later this month. A memorandum signed by Kenya and Cuba shows shows each county will get at least two. The doctors will work hand-in-hand with their Kenyan counterparts to roll out a range of medical services that are expected to radically change how a large number of life-threatening diseases are managed. Universal healthcare is one of four pillars that President Uhuru Kenyatta has prioritised in his second term. The others are food security, manufacturing and affordable housing.
