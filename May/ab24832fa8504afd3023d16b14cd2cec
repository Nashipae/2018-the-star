Kenyan youngster Justus Soget will once again be gunning for a top three spot in the metric mile when he parades at the Shanghai Diamond League meeting tonight. Soget placed third in the 1500m in Doha in a non-Diamond League event and will be hoping to repeat that performance in a rather tough field. His countryman Timothy Cheruiyot, the world and Commonwealth silver medallist, boasts outstanding credentials as does Ethiopia’s rising teenage talent Samuel Tefera, who stormed to 1500m gold at the World Indoor Championships in Birmingham. The World indoor bronze medallist Abdelaati Iguider of Morocco and the 34-year-old Ethiopian Aman Wote, who finished one place behind in Birmingham, are also in the mix. Another rising Kenyan star and recently minted Commonwealth 800m champion Wycliffe Kinyamal could be the one to beat over two-laps as the 20-year-old makes his Diamond League debut. Standing in opposition will be Kinyamal’s compatriot Jonathan Kitilit, the second fastest man in the world this year, and experienced Pole Marcin Lewandowski, the World Indoor 1500m silver medallist in Birmingham in March. World Indoor 800m silver medallist Drew Windle and his US teammate Clayton Murphy, the 2016 Olympic bronze medallist, will also look to be in the mix. In the non-Diamond League events, World champion Muktar Edris leads the entries in a high-class 5000m. The Ethiopian, who won this race in Shanghai two years ago, will be up against World 5000m bronze medallist Paul Chelimo of the USA. World and Olympic steeplechase champion Conseslus Kipruto, with a personal best of 13:47.5, also makes a rare outing over the 12-and-a-half lap distance.
