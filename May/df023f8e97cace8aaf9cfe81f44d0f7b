Bones suspected to be those of a missing Embu Form Three student and her baby were exhumed in the compound of her GSU officer ex-lover. Kanyueri Secondary School student Pauline Kagendo and her son Johnson Muriithi vanished 11 months ago. It took workers six hours to trace the grave behind a pit latrine in Edwin Mwenda’s compound at Njarange village in Mbeere North subcounty on Wednesday. It was near the officer’s father’s house. Forensic specialist Dr Kalsi told journalists it was not possible to say at this time if the remains were those of the mother and baby sired by the officer. She said she would give a report after investigations and tests. Related: Missing Embu woman's body found in river Mbeere North OCPD Jane Sang said Mwenda was arrested and taken to lockup. The suspects will be charged with murder once investigations are complete, Sang said. A report on the missing mother and child was made on April 19. “I appeal to family members of the girl to be patient. I assure them justice will be done,” Sang said. She said preliminary findings showed the officer and the girl had been lovers. Before the girl gave birth, they had disagreed, she said. Kagendo’s grief-stricken father Stanley Mugendi watched the exhumation. He said recovery of the remains gave him hope he will get justice for his daughter and grandson. Kagendo’s mother Onorata Kanini said the officer reluctantly agreed to support the baby. He occasionally sent money. She said her daughter and grandson went missing on June 10, last year after she went to meet her former lover to take the baby to hospital. She never returned. Click here for the latest political news
