A woman has been charged with killing her 3 year-old son after a family conflict. Linet Makugu was charged with the murder of
Raymond Wamukoya on May 10 at Magongo in Changamwe, Mombasa
county. However, Makugu did not plead to the
charges until she undergoes medical assessment. State counsel Alice Ochola filed an
application for the suspect to be escorted to Coast general hospital
where she will undergo mental tests. Ochola also asked the court to issue
orders for the deputy registrar to appoint an advocate for the
suspect. Judge Dora Chepkwony ordered Makugu to
be detained at the Shimo la Tewa women prisons. According to police reports, the woman, who
lives in Mumias, came to visit her husband in Mombasa. However, she refused to go back, a decision that led to an argument with the husband. Makugu is said to have demanded for her
son to be enrolled in a private school in Mombasa instead of going
back to the rural home. The report further said after the
argument with the husband, she threatened to kill herself and the boy. She allegedly stabbed the boy the
following day after the husband had left for work. A doctors report showed that the boy was cut using a razor blade. The matter will be mentioned on June 6. Click here for the latest political news
