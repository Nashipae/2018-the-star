Tharaka Nithi senator Kithure Kindiki wants Solai farm owner charged for the deaths of 40 people who died after the Patel dam burst its banks last week. Kindiki said the owner had been warned to reduce the water levels by government officials but he did not heed their advice. "We want the government to take action immediately. People's lives cannot be taken for granted. The owner had been warned," Kindiki said.

"He was on television saying he had given victims sugar, cooking oil and sweets to children. Offering all those does not mean that you have solved the issue. We want justice for victims so the law must be followed to the end," Kindiki said. Kindiki spoke on Friday at Gitogoto Chuka Igambangombe constituency where he donated foodstuffs and blankets to families displaced by a landslide at Gitogoto. According to area chief Kinyua Kimotho 250 people from 30 families were displaced after a landslide following heavy rains in the area. Some of the houses were destroyed forcing residents to be resettled at Gitogoto PCEA church where they have been sleeping in five tents donated by Red Cross. Kindiki who visited the area accompanied by Kimotho empathized with children and residents who had been camping there for a week.
