Kenya has a shortage of specialist doctors, Health CS Sicily Kariuki has said. She defended the hiring of Cuban doctors, saying they are coming to complement the 250 specialist doctors in the country. “The ratio of specialised health workers is very low. You can see we are in dire need of additional capacity,” Kariuki said. She spoke on the sidelines of a meeting with members of the National Assembly’s Health Committee in Mombasa on Saturday. “I would like to ask our Kenyan doctors not to be worried of any competition,” Kariuki said.
