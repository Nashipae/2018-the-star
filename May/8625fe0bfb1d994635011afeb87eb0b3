Russian President Vladimir said on Thursday that Moscow regrets the cancellation of the summit between the United States and North Korea. Speaking after talks with French President Emmanuel Macron in St Petersburg, Putin said he hoped the summit would take place nonetheless. Earlier on Thursday US President Donald Trump called off a historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un scheduled for next month, citing Pyongyang's "open hostility." The sentiments were shared by South Korean President Moon Jae-in
who expressed deep regret over Trump's decision. "I am very perplexed and it is very regrettable that the
North Korea-US summit will not be held on June 12 when it was
scheduled to be held," Moon was quoted as saying at a meeting
with his top security officials. Yonhap said Moon urged direct talks between Trump and Kim
and said denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula should not be
delayed by the decision to call off the summit. A spokeswoman for UK Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday: "We are disappointed that the meeting will no longer go
ahead as planned." "We need to see an agreement that can bring
about the completely verifiable and irreversible
denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and we will continue to
work with our partners to this end." Read: Trump cancels summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un Click here for the latest political news
