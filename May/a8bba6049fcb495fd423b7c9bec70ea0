They were speaking at an education forum organised by the National Council for Nomadic Education in Kenya (Naconek) in Garissa. The forum brought together Muslim clerics and education playersfrom Northeastern. Naconek has proposed the integration of madrassa and dugsi into the formal education system. Korane urged youths to learn from the 1,500 al Shabaab returnees from the Coast, who were brainwashed into joining the terror group only to realise it was a trap. young minds He said Islam is a way of life and Muslim children would get the best of both worlds if formal education and madrassas are integrated. “It’s time we engaged the relevant stakeholders in the two sectors and came up with modalities to integrate Islamic teachings into the mainstream education system,” Korane said. “Terror groups are taking advantage of the gaps in the two systems to radicalise our youth.” The governor dismissed sceptics who claim  the integration will increase violent extremism. Roba said Muslims trust their religious leaders but there is need to establish the background of some teachers before allowing them to teach children in madrassas and dugsis.
