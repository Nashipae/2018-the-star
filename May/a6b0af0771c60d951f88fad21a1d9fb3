Travellers were stranded for more than 10 hours yesterday on the Kabarnet-Eldoret road, which had been cut off by a landslide at Tambach, Elgeyo Marakwet county. The road links Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo counties. Rocks and soil covered the busy highway, rendering it impassable at Kamok. Keiyo North deputy county commissioner Joseph Cheruiyot said the Kenya National Highways Authority and the Elgeyo Marakwet government had been asked to clear the debris. He said a grader provided by the county government took too long getting to the scene because of poor roads. No one was injured by the landslide, which happened at night. “We are waiting for a bulldozer from Kaptarakwa to remove boulders and trees on the road,” Cheruiyot said. The Elgeyo Marakwet government issued an alert yesterday morning for motorists on the Kerio Escarpment road to watch out for falling rocks. In the neighbouring Baringo county, residents in areas prone to landslides have been asked to move to safer ground. County commissioner Henry Wafula yesterday said fissures have opened up in Kabasis, Tenges, Ng’etmoi, Timoboiwo and Sacho in Baringo Central subcounty. He spoke to journalists at his Kabarnet office. Baringo has experienced floods following torrential rain. At least 10 people have been killed by floods since the rain began pounding the region in April. The Meteorologocal Department has warned the downpour will continue to next month. “As the heavy rain persists, I’m advising people living in mudslide-prone areas to take precaution. We don’t want to lose lives needlessly,” Wafula said. The commissioner said other vulnerable villages are Kapkiamo, Kapkombe, Kasisit, Tirimionin, Aiyebo, Tanyilel and Kapchepkorin in Baringo North subcounty. Earlier, Baringo Deputy Governor Jacob Chepkwony said the county has a small budget for emergencies. He appealed for help. “We can’t help because we have Sh25 million for drought, floods and water scarcity,” Chepkwony said.
