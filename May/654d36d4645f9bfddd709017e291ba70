Through a statement, it stated that Leng’ete received the honour for her work with Maasai communities in Kenya to end FGM. Leng’ete was only 8-years-old when she ran away from her home to avoid being subjected to FGM/C, a practice that was common for young girls in the village of Noomayianat where she grew up.

She eventually convinced her grandfather, a Maasai elder, to allow her not to have FGM/C so she could continue going to school. In many communities, like Leng’ete’s, the practice of FGM/C is directly linked to child marriage and lack of education for girls. The World Health Organization defines FGM/C as “all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injuries to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.”  Click here for the latest political news
