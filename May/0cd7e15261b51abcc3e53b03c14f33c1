The Kisumu county government plans to reclaim public land and wetlands on the shores of Lake Victoria. The plots have been invaded by private developers. Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said the encroachment is threatening aquatic life and the ecosystem. Developers have erected fences on riparian land, keeping hippos away from grazing. “We will demolish buildings constructed on the wrong areas,” the governor said at Dixon Odhiambo’s swearing in. Odhiambo took his oath of office as the Lands executive in Kisumu town on Tuesday. The county government received reports from the Kenya Wildlife Service on the encroachment and its effect on animals. “Hippos are starving because some people have placed rocks along the shores to create boundaries,” Nyong’o said. The county government set up a task force to probe land allocations across the county to address misuse. “We have had problems on land matters. In some areas, people have more than three title deeds for the same plot, misuse of public land and grabbing,” Nyong’o said. The governor urged Odhiambo to ensure all grabbed public land is reclaimed. In March, the governor moved Lands, Housing, Physical Planning and Urban Development executive Nerry Achar to Finance and nominated Odhimbo for the job. In September last year, the Tourism Finance Corporation (TFC) and the Kisumu government repossessed land illegally allocated to a private developer. The two-acre parcel near Lake Victoria was part of Sunset Hotel, which is co-owned by the county government and the state. The TFC director, Jonah Orumoi, said they acted after a gazette notice nullified the allocation of the plot to a private developer.
