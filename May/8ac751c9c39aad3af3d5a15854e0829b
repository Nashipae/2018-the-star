Water supply resumed in Mombasa and Kilifi on Saturday after the government repaired the Baricho plant which was destroyed by floods two weeks ago. Heavy rains destroyed 11 boreholes at the station which is the main water supply for the Coast region. Among those destroyed were three boreholes drilled at a cost of Sh2.3 billion last year. The boreholes were launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The government repaired nine of the damaged boreholes on Friday, Water CS Simon Chelugui said. Chelugui said the state will spend Sh1 billion to fully repair the boreholes. Chelugui spoke on Friday after touring the Baricho Water Supply Station in Langobaya, Malindi. He was accompanied by Chief Administrative Secretaries Hussein Dado (Devolution) and Winnie Guchu (Water) and Governors Amason Kingi (Kilifi) and Hassan Joho (Mombasa) among other state officials. Chelugi said the three new pumps had a capacity of 50,000 cubic meters per day. â€œThe government will spend Sh220 million to repair the damaged boreholes, Sh450 million to buy equipment and another Sh500 million to build dykes around the boreholes," Chelusui said. The boreholes were flooded after River Sabaki burst its banks. The Coast Water Service Board had deployed a team to repair the boreholes. Kingi asked the board and the ministry to resolve frequent power disconnections at the Baricho plant for efficient water supply. Joho also asked the ministry to foot the plants power bills. The Red Cross has acquired a water treatment plant that will pump one million cubic litres per day. The plant was being installed at the Sabaki Bridge. Red Cross coordinator Hassan Musa said the facility would be ready today. The aid agency wants to supply water to flood victims.
