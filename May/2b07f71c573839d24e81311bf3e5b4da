The University of Nairobi law student who went missing two weeks ago in Kasarani has been found dead in Mombasa. Twenty-five-year-old Dennis Munene’s body was found at Coast General Hospital mortuary on Thursday. He went missing on May 9. His sister, Mercy Gichangi, on Friday told reporters she began looking for her brother on the day he disappeared. “On May 12, I went to his house in Kasarani, but he was not there.His neighbours said they had seen him the first week of May,” she said. Gichangi reported the disappearance at Ruaraka police station. The police started tracking Munene’s phone as Gichangi and her family searched in hospitals and mortuaries. “We did not find him. But that Monday, police told us his mobile number had been last used in Mtwapa on May 9, before it was switched off,” she said. Efforts to establish if Munene’s handset had a new SIM card hit a brick wall. “The only option was to go to Mtwapa police station for assistance. We did that on Tuesday this week. But still, nothing was forthcoming,” she said. “We searched in all wards at the Coast General Hospital. Then we went to the mortuary. The morgue attendant informed us he had seen the body of someone who fitted our description.” Records show the unidentified body was brought in by the police on May 12. It was found at Marina Beach in Mtwapa. A village elder at Marina stumbled on the body. The distraught family wants to know how Munene travelled to Mombasa and how he drowned or was killed.
