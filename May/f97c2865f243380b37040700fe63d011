The ministry of water has stepped up campaigns to supply clean and safe drinking waters for displaced victims in 10 camps in Garissa town and its environs. Water CS Simon Chelugui while on a tour of the damaged water intake and sewerage infrastructure in Garissa town on Saturday said his ministry has distributed plastic water tanks to the camps as a stop-gap measure to prevent outbreak of cholera and other waterborne diseases. He said more than 137 toilets collapsed during the recent flood and was a threat to the safety of drinking water bodies in the town. The sewerage ponds are submerged and the sludge was likely to flow back and spill into the residential areas. The ministry will be working with the Northern water service board, Garissa water and sewerage company, the county government and other aid agencies
