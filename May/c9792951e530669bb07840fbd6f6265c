Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has said the cereals board has not paid him after delivering maize six months ago. “I have not received my money yet I am the Senate Leader of Majority. You can imagine how a farmer in the village is suffering,” he said. Murkomen said the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) paid unscrupulous traders at the expense of genuine farmers. The senator spoke on Saturday in Marakwet West during a consultative meeting on the proposed construction of the Sh32 billion Arror Dam. Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa was the chief guest. An internal report in the Agriculture ministry unmasked 18 traders who delivered huge quantities of maize to the NCPB. The report indicates that one farmer delivered 226,108 bags at the Eldoret depot. Some traders have defended themselves, saying they bought maize from farmers who needed quick cash. Murkomen said farmers in Kenya’s grain basket – North Rift – are contemplating abandoning maize growing because of the huge losses they incur every year. The senator urged Kenyans to brace for an acute maize shortage because farmers will not sit back as cartels have a field day. “We have not signed a contract with anyone to feed people. We can decide to grow oranges, avocados and other fruits,” Murkomen said. In a light-hearted moment, Murkomen told the CS to prepare for lesser ugali. He proposed that the NCPB silos and services be set up in all constituencies to stop wayward traders from selling cheap imported maize. “Devolving the board’s services will eliminate cartels. Farmers will point out the people who supply maize, but do not have farms,” he said. Murkomen praised President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto’s directive to investigative agencies to step up the war on corruption. Eugene said the ministry will devolve the NCPB’s services. Click here for the latest political news
