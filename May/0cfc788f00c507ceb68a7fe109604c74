Parkroad Badgers coach Cyrus Kanyi believes there is still enough time to turn around their misfortunes in the Kenya Hockey Union Premier League with six matches to the end of first leg. The Badgers are bottom of the table with no win from their four matches so far. However, Kanyi believes they will recover soon and start recording wins. He attributed their poor start to the campaign to lack of proper coordination between the old and new players, who are yet to gel. “In the match against Sikh Union on Tuesday, we lost due to lack of concentration. But truth be told, we have begun the season poorly. However, we are optimistic we will turn around our misfortunes. The season is competitive and so we have to raise to the occasion and make our presence felt,” said Kanyi. “But the consolation we have is that we still have six games to the end of the first leg and I believe we will make amends before the break. We know very well it takes a while for the new players to gel and to adapt to the team’s playing system and ours is not any different.” Badgers’ take on United States International University of Africa on May 12 and Kanyi believes the match will be their turning point. USIU-A are fifth on the log with three points from a match. The team threw away an early lead to succumb 3-4 to Nairobi Sikh at the City Park Stadium on Tuesday evening. Gordon Odour scored twice in the 1st and 35th minute as Gilbert Langat added the third in the 36th minute for Badgers. Francis Eshikuri and Davis Wananywe scored a brace apiece to award the 2012 champions the deserved win.
