Vocational and Technical Training PS Kevit Desai has called upon religious leaders and county officials to educate the public especially the youth on the role of training institutions. Speaking during a stakeholders' forum with KEPSA officials in his office, Desai said TVET institutions exist in various counties but most youth ignore them because they do not view them as a pillar in devolved governments in terms of providing skilled manpower. He said a lot has been put in place to ensure quality and relevant skills are provided in these institutions to guarantee youth gainful self employment. The PS pledged to ensure that youth from marginalised communities benefit from these technical and vocational institutions. He said a skills advisory committee will be formed to ensure the system in place accommodates everyone. "The current system doesn't promote purpose, value and hope as it should.It should be a system that will enable our young people to solve their own problems," he said.
