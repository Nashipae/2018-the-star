Vivian is the mother of a grown-up girl. Just after Mother’s Day, the Ching Ching hitmaker finally introduced her fans to her firstborn child. The singer had kept her daughter from the public eye, but it seems she is letting loose. I mean, she’s about to walk down the aisle with the love of her life, Sam West, who doubles up as her manager. She wrote: “My little heartbeat. We’ve been through so much together. God has been good to us." The singer recently had her traditional wedding to Sam, and Word Is is aware that the white wedding plans are ongoing.
