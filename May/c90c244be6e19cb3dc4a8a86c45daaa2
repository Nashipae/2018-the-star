The MP was arrested and charged with robbery with violence over an attack on businessman Timothy Kariuki a fortnight ago. He claimed that the PS is working with powerful people in government to fight and intimidate him over his relations with Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko. "My life is in danger. Powerful forces in government want to eliminate me because I support DP William Ruto's 2022 presidential bid." The Panafric hotel management denied him access to the facility despite a prior booking of Sh30,000. He had also sent out invitations to the media for the Sunday event. Mbugua said the hotel was instructed by police not to allow him address the media at the premises. Several DCI officers and police were deployed at the hotel and at shell petrol station. "The manager informed me he was told by the OCS and the OCPD not to give me access to the hotel." "The hotel was intimidated that if they allow me, then they would be shut," Mbugua claimed.
