Kenya Power has officially sacked 18 employees linked to questionable multi-billion shilling contracts at the power company. The lot reportedly spearheaded the award of the contracts to undertake emergency repairs on power infrastructure. Kenya Power managing director Ken Tarus said no money was lost in the process as procurement had just been completed. He said that the company tendered on Labour and Transport (L&T) contractors with 500 companies being pre-qualified . However, following a complaint from the losers, investigations began with the audit revealing that over 350 companies that won did not meet the threshold. "Over 500 contractors were pre-qualified and would have seen them get the job for the next two years. Those who lost the bid were unsatisfied with the process leading to the investigation," he said on Monday. "At least 350 contractors got in the list of contractors without meeting the criteria and majority are associated with the company," Tarus said.
