A regulator has expressed dissatisfaction with a High Court ruling on ex-Uchumi finance boss saying it’s a threat to investor confidence and company shareholders. On Wednesday, the High Court dismissed investigations instituted by the Capital Markets Authority against former Uchumi finance director Chadwick Okumu and ruled the probe was null and void. The court also quashed all orders issued by CMA against the former boss. It said that it was wrong for CMA to act as the investigator, prosecutor, judge and executioner. Okumu served as Uchumi’s chief financial officer from January 2007 to June 2015 when he was sent packing pending investigations over suspect transactions. Part of the dealings, as found out by audit firm KPMG, included acceptance of conflicted suppliers, substandard products and dubious trade agreements. At the time, Uchumi owed suppliers at least Sh1 billion. Okumu had moved to court to stop penalties imposed on him by CMA for alleged violations while at the troubled supermarket. He claimed the authority punished him for decisions made collectively at Uchumi’s board meetings. Justice John Mativo said that the CMA investigations, in his analysis, were tainted with bias. The authority has disputed the ruling saying that it acted within the CMA Act that gives powers to investigate and take action. “Section 11 ( 3 ) (h), Section 13A and B of Capital Market Act gives us powers to investigate while Section 11 ( 3 ) (cc ), and Section 25 A of the Act gives us powers to enforce,” a statement from the authority said. According to the judge, CMA should have invoked section 11 and delegate its function to an independent body. This is the second time this year that the High Court has cleared Uchumi bosses accused of financial indiscretion. In January 16, three of the troubled retailer directors were cleared of allegations by Justice George Odunga over their role in the flawed Sh895 million rights issue of 2014.
