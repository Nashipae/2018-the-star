North Imenti leaders plan to meet President Uhuru Kenyatta on Madaraka Day so he can fast-track their development projects. The constituency will host the national celebrations in Kinoru Stadium to mark Kenya’s self-rule. The leaders, led by MP Rahim Dawood, on Saturday thanked Uhuru for appointing residents to state offices and supporting growth projects. Dawood, Housing secretary Patrick Bucha and five MCAs said the constituency has urgent development needs. They urged residents to unite to spur growth. They also proposed that the constituency be split into two, Nyaki and Ntima.
