 Engineers are repairing five Uasin Gishu dams after they were classified as dangerous. Environment executive Mary Njogu yesterday said they wanted to avert disasters like the Solai Dam tragedy that claimed 48 lives early this month. There are 300 dams in Uasin Gishu. Njogu said they have all been inspected and declared safe. "Eighteen of them were build during the colonial era but have been repaired. They are crucial because they store huge volumes of water," Njogu said. The five declared dangerous are located in Segero, Barsombe, Moiben and Ainabkoi. Njogu allayed fears of a burst, saying the dangerous dams were being closely monitored. "Residents should not be worried. We've liaised with the county commissioner and the disaster management team to ensure their safety,” Njogu said. She spokes during a tree planting drive at Timboroa. She said they had planted four million trees over the last month. More than 7,000 community members have been allowed to carry out farming in forests as part of the conservation measures in Uasin Gishu County. Kenya Forest Service (KFS) ecosystem officer Thomas Kiptoo said they had partnered with community associations to plant more trees in all major forests. More than 7,000 residents have been allowed to carry out farming in forests as part of conservation measures. Kiptoo said they were keen on increasing Uasin Gishu's forest cover from the current 7.5 to 15 per cent by 2022. “We are working with the local communities to protect and conserve our forests,” Kiptoo said. He had accompanied Njogu for the tree planting drive. North Rift head of conservancy Benjamin Kingeli said they were enforcing the logging ban.
