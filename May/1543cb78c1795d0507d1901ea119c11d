Online shopping platform Jumia has partnered with fresh food traders to sell groceries on their Jumia Fresh platform. “This is our way of bringing Mama mboga closer to you by allowing you to shop at the best prices and at your convenience either from home or office”, said Jumia MD Sam Chappatte. Customers will get free delivery for Jumia Fresh orders above Sh500. This is the first time the online retailer will be selling perishables in line with the company’s mission to increase assortment and give customers the convenience to shop online for everyday essentials. Last month, Jumia announced reduction in delivery fee to Sh100 down from Sh250 for customers within Nairobi. The move was aimed at making it more cost effective for the customers to buy everyday essentials from the platform and enhance customer experience while shopping online.
