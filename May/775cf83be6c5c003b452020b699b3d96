Israel's Security Cabinet, a
forum of senior ministers headed by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, has begun holding its weekly meetings in a secure
underground bunker in Jerusalem, Israeli media said on Tuesday. The facility, known as the "National Management Centre", was
first used by the Security Cabinet in 2011 to rehearse a
national crisis scenario. It was carved out beneath the
government complex in Jerusalem and includes living quarters as
well as command facilities. Reports of the move come amid a rise in tensions with Iran. Israel this month accused Iran of firing rockets from Syria
into the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israel struck back with
its heaviest air strikes in Syria since the start of the Syrian
civil war in 2011. Meetings of the Council, hitherto mostly at the prime
minister's office in Jerusalem, are already generally held out
of the public eye. "Cabinet ministers have told us that one of the main reasons
for the move is Netanyahu's wish to try even harder to prevent
leaks and because of fears of spying attempts by hostile foreign
parties," Israel's Channel 10 said. The group of 11 ministers has already held a small number of
meetings at the facility, and three planned weekly sessions, the
next of which is scheduled for Wednesday, will be held in the
bunker, a media source said. Israeli officials declined to comment on the reports. Click here for the latest political news
