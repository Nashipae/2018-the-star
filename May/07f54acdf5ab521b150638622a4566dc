The low performance rating of Kenya’s three city counties’ governors has divided Mombasa residents. Research by Tifa ranked Governor Hassan Joho second ( 53 per cent) behind Kisumu’s Anyang’ Nyong’o ( 58 per cent). Nairobi’s Mike Sonko scored the lowest at at 44 per cent. Joho scored C+ in health and a D in provision of clean water. Supporters said Joho was underrated. County communications director Richard Chacha said the research wasn’t timely. “Counties got disbursements just three months ago. It was too early to gauge their performance,” Chacha said. He questioned the objectivity of the research firm. Critics have faulted Joho for poor services. “He deserved a 20 per cent ranking. There is nothing he has done,” politician Jimmy Azangu said. He said Mombasa was choking in garbage and roads are in deplorable condition. “There is too much nepotism here. Some communities have been sidelined in appointments ,” the ANC secretary general told the Star on the phone. The poll gave Joho a D+ score in environmental cleanliness and sewerage system. Technical University of Mombasa lecturer Phili Mbaji said Joho’s work had been sabotaged by illegal waste dumping. “We need collective effort, from county officials and the residents” he said. Nominated MCA Mohamed Hatimi said the rating was accurate. “The county has previously performed even better,” Hatimi said. He asked the executive to improve services. Somali community chairman Mohamed Huri said the poll was hurried. “Joho’s second term just started. I’m sure he will transform this county if given time,” Huri said
