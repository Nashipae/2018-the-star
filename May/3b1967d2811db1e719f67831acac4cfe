Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi is being repacked as the only "hope" for Coast, the region's party officials have said. This is being done in the pretext that Raila Odinga of ODM has "slept" with the enemy - Jubilee - who was brutalising them. ANC Coast Secretary â€‹General Jimmy Azangu said this is among strategies in place to make the Coast ANC's second epicentre
after Western ahead of the 2022 vote. Of keen interest is Mombasa
where the party wants to scoop
seats in the face of its dismal performance in the last election. Azangu said meetings with potential strong candidates are underway, top in the list being National Chairman Kelvin Lunani who did not win the Nyali seat. He is being rebranded so his activities with locals have increased lately. "After the handshake, most Coast votes are now undecided. We are capitalising on every bit to turn the region into an ANC zone," Azangu said. "The politics of 2022 will be very unpredictable. It will be tougher than 2017. We are plotting the win today." Azangu said a Sunday meeting in Changamwe resolved that the party popularises itself and Mudavadi as its presidential candidate. ODM is the dominant party and ANC will have to pull a miracle to outshine it, analysts say. "Because of uncertainties in Nasa, we won't wait until the last minute to be edged out by our brothers (ODM)," Azangu said. If
Nasa lives to see 2022, Mudavadi will contest for the coalition's ticket
against Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula. But
if it dies, the plan is for Mudavadi to fight for Coast votes against Raila
who has dismissed claims he is interested in the top seat. "If you noticed, our performance at the grass roots was not encouraging. Reasons included unpopularity of the party," he
said. In
the Mombasa assembly, ODM is the majority while Wiper and Ford-K have a
single seat each. Related: Referendum part of plot to block Ruto's rise to presidency - Pkosing Click here for the latest local political news
