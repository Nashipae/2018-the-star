Communication Authority of Kenya has moved to the Court of Appeal to challenge the decision of the High court stopping it from tapping into private phone conversations. CA alleges that Justice John Mativo erred in law and fact by failing to hold that the petition before him was hypothetical. "The judge erred by creating his own case on behalf of Okiya Omtatah and adjudicating on it," CA says in court documents. In the memorandum of appeal, CA says: "The learned judge erred in law by making findings which were not supported by the evidence on record and by ignoring the uncontroverted position of the evidence adduced by the appellant in the High court." The regulator also claims the court erred in law by holding that the installation of the device management system (DMS) threatens to or violates the right to privacy of subscribers. "The judge also failed to appreciate the nature of CAs letter dated January 31, 2017 to mobile network operators (MNO’s)," CA, through lawyer Wambua Kilonzo, says. The High court in April held that the plan to tap into private mobile conversations through broadband communication networks is a gross violation
of consumer rights. Justice Mativo said the plan to
install spy gadgets was adopted in a manner inconsistent with the
Constitution. He also said there wasn't adequate public participation prior to its
adoption and implementation. Also read: Court bars CA from setting up system to spy on Kenyans Click here for the latest political news
