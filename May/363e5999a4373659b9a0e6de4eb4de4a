Sports CS Rashid Echesa has declared himself the senior-most leader in Western. Echesa and Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa are the only CSs from the region. “When President Uhuru Kenyatta appointed me, you heard many things. Some said that I was not educated. Did you hear me speak Karamojong or Luhya when I went for vetting. Come 2022, some of you will know whom I am,” he said. Echesa spoke on Saturday during Lubinu-Lusheya MCA Elly Keya’s thanksgiving in Mumias East constituency.

Echesa said he will assert himself to ensure the Luhya community is not used in 2022. He told Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang’ula not to gamble in 2022. Echesa termed ‘jokers’ those seeking the presidency from the region. He said to run for President, “one must have a minimum of Sh200 billion”. “Let them put their bank statements on the table and tell us what networks they have in Kenya before we can listen to them,” Echesa said. But Oparanya dismissed Echesa as a novice. He said Echesa cannot purport to be senior to anyone in the region. “Who told him that some of us don’t have money? Does he have access to our bank accounts?” Oparanya asked.
