Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu yesterday criticised the Kenya National Highways Authority for demolishing kiosks on a road reserve “without due process”. She said employees from the authority’s Machakos regional office were “inhumane and heartless” and their “action devastating”. The demolition was “beastly and must be condemned in the strongest terms possible”, Ngilu said. On Saturday night, a team of Kenha staff and armed police officers demolished roadside shacks in Kanyonyoo market along the Thika-Garissa highway and burnt them. Kenha could not be reached for comment. Ngilu said poor residents eked out their livelihoods from the structures and they deserved better. GREAT EVIL The traders said no notice was issued. They came to their workplace as usual in the morning, only to find their structures destroyed. Ngilu faulted Kenha for sidelining leaders and failing to inform residents of its intentions. No local leader was consulted, she said at the trading centre. The governor visited the scene to assess the damage. Ngilu said evictions must be humane to avoid unnecessary “pain, distress, or hardship”. “It is evil to destroy the only source of income for struggling residents. Through the kiosks, they eked an honest living, provided food for their families and paid school fees. It is bad to treat them so inhumanely,” she said. Ngilu was in the company of MP Boni Mwalika and MCA John Kisangau. She said her administration will provide an alternative site for the victims. Kenha is a state agency established under the Kenya Roads Act 2007. It manages, develops, rehabilitates and maintains international trunk roads that link centres of international significance. The authority has focussed on propelling Kenya to achieve the infrastructure goals in the economic blueprint Vision 2030. Click here for the latest political news
