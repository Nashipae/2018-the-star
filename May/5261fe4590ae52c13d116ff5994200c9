Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has cautioned senior security officers who do not work from their offices. Speaking on Saturday during a service at Nyamira Central SDA Church in West Mugirango constituency, the CS said the officials must work where Kenyans can reach them. “This system of senior officials working from their houses and giving commands on mobile phones should stop,” Matiang’i said. He sounded the warning after making a stopover at Nyamira police station, where he held a closed-door meeting.
