A new gospel awards event called 'Tukuza Awards' has entered the music industry. It aims to honour and support various talents in the gospel music industry. The awards, set for December 4, will also provide a platform for holistic and talent empowerment and growth of young artistes in Kenya as a country and beyond. Awards CEO Boniface Siberenge said the awards ceremony will take place in this year and will incorporate 3,500 persons that will be awarded in various categories. "Right now, we are going to different counties to register talent for the awards. They can do it via www.tukuzaawards.co.ke as we are planning a big event, and it is strictly for gospel artistes. We are focusing on the upcoming talents," Milimo said. Milimo said the reason they are focusing on the new talents was because there is unappreciated talent out there and it is time for them to get a break into the limelight. He said they will follow up with the artistes' progress and not only award them but also offer recording deals, including shooting their videos. "Many artistes lack a platform, and there is real talent in the country yet they go unnoticed. That is why I came up with this initiative to appreciate them," Milimo said. Tukuza Awards is seeking to award talent in different categories, including worship songs, video, album, songwriter, producer, band and choir of the year. "We have approached many dignitaries and international artistes and we will invite even the President to grace the occasion," Milimo said.
