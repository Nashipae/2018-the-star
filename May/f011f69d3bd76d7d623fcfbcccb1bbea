A unity meeting is planned to bring together two quarrelling factions of the Luo Council of Elders, president Willis Otondi has said. He said on Friday he will have a ‘handshake’ with his rival Nyandiko Ongadi so they work together. “People can’t achieve progress in the midst of feuds. I would want to meet the opposing group for the sake of unity of our community,” Otondi said in Mfang’ano Island, Suba North, during the burial of Mzee Isaac Odhiambo. The late Odhiambo was the father of Silas Jakakimba, former aide of NASA chief Raila Odinga. Otondi said they will no longer allow wrangles to bedevil the council. He extended an olive branch to Ongadi. Ongadi told the Star on the phone his faction is ready to meet with Otondi’s team. “We have met Otondi twice through Michael Oludhe, but we’ve not been able to reach a common ground because of other elders’ interests,” he said. Disputes have marred the council since the death of former president Riaga Ogallo in 2015, with Otondi and Ongadi fighting for its leadership. Otondi said their differences hurt the community. “If President Uhuru Kenyatta and our leader Raila have agreed to forge ahead together, why can’t we do the same?” he asked. He said they have a role to play in nationwide peace and reconciliation initiatives, but persistent fights might hinder that. “Peace and reconciliation should start with us, before we represent our community in other parts of the country,” Otondi said.
