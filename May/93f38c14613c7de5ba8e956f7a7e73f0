More than 5,000 learners in Baringo are yet to reopen for the second term due to floods and bandit attacks. Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) secretary for Baringo Joshua Cheptarus said more than 30 schools remained closed in parts of Baringo North and Baringo South subcounties. “It is quite unfortunate that as other learners embark on their second term studies, pupils in Baringo cannot resume classes due floods and insecurity,” Cheptarus said. Homes have been submerged in Baringo North while some schools have been turned into camps for those displaced by floods. Some teachers have not resumed work for fear of their lives. Most teachers fled Baringo following frequent bandit raids. At least seven people have been killed and 10,000 displaced by floods in Marigat, Baringo North and Mogotio subcounties since the rains began. Affected schools include Salabani, Sokotei, Eldume, Ol’ Samburmbur, Ng’ambo, Sanadai and Kiserian in Baringo South and Ngaratuko, Kosile, Chemura and Kukui secondary schools in Baringo North. Cheptarus saidthere was overcrowding at the Ol'Samburmbur Primary School where 400 pupils from the Eldume IDP camp in Marigat have enrolled. The IDPs were uprooted from their homes Mukutani by bandits in March last year. Learning was yet to resume at Kosiel and Ng’aratuko primary schools due to tension caused by the killing of herder Reuben Rutto. Rutto was shot dead by bandits two weeks ago. “Those who have fled their homes have camped with their livestock at Kosile Primary School. Learning has resumed in only a few schools where security officers have been deployed,” Cheptarus said.
