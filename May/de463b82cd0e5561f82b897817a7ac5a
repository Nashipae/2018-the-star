Nation Media Group staff restaurant in Nairobi has been closed indefinitely for illegal dumping. City Hall officials raided the hotel on Wednesday and arrested three workers before closing the premises. Deputy environment director Lawrence Mwangi said the management of the restaurant has been illegally dumping waste from the premise using street urchins. Mwangi said the county officials, led by county secretary Peter Kariuki, while on patrol, arrested street boys dumping garbage at Sheikh Karume Lane and Ronald Ngala Street on Tuesday night. The boys, Mwangi said, admitted they were sent by the hotel prompting the county officers to raid the place. "The arrest reveals how business people are illegally dumping garbage. To make matters worse, they dump in locations away from their premises." But the restaurant's manager Daniel Obondo refuted the accusations. He claimed the county environment officers were retaliating after he declined to give them a Sh100,000 bribe they had demanded. "They demanded for Sh100,000 and when I declined, they took away three of my staff members," Obondo said on the phone. Boke Stephen Naheke, Kevin Onyango Dede, and Mary Moraa Sagwe were later charged with illegal waste disposal at the City Hall court. The city county has been on the spot over garbage menace in the city as most streets have been turned into dumpsites. The county has defended itself saying its efforts have been sabotaged by private contractors and businesspeople in the capital. Last week, the government announced that KDF and NYS personnel will soon start collecting trash in the city. About 381 garbage tracks owned by KDF, NYS and county government will be deployed.
