Wiper Party will not stand on the way of Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua's 2022 presidential bid. Chairman Kivutha Kibwana said both Mutua and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka should be allowed to sell their bids. Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana has endorsed Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua’s presidential bid for 2022. He spoke on Saturday at Kai secondary school in Makindu sub-county where he had hosted Mutua for a school fundraiser. Kibwana who is the Wiper party Chairman said the Maendeleo Chap Chap party leader was free to vie for presidency in 2022 without obstacles. "I talked to Kalonzo and we agreed that our party will not stand on Mutua's way," Kibwana said. "Mutua is hunting and Kalonzo is hunting too. We know hunters converge at some point. That is why we have said that the two should proceed with their hunting missions.” Kibwana spoke on Saturday at Kai Secondary School in Makindu where he hosted Mutua for a fundraiser. Mutua, who was first elected on the Wiper ticket, ditched the party in 2014 after falling out with Kalonzo. He later formed the Maendeleo Chap Chap on whose ticket he successfully defended his seat. Mutua beat Wiper's Wavinya Ndeti in last year's elections. He urged Kambas to support him, saying he was ready for the presidential contest in 2022. "I have traveled throughout the country and Kenyans have asked me to seek a higher office when my second term ends. I want to announce that I will be contesting for the presidency in 2022," Mutua said. Mutua and Kibwana shook hands and pledged to open a new chapter of political, social and economic unity. “The three of us - Mutua, [Charity] Ngilu and I - have agreed to join hands and establish the Eastern Kenya Economic Bloc,” Kibwana said. The two governors urged Ukambani leaders to end their political rivalries, saying it would boost the community's development.
