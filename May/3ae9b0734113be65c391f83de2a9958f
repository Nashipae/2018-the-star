Garissa residents have been urged to volunteer information on suspicious people to help fight terrorism. Police department community policing representative Hussein Hassan said sharing information is crucial. He spoke on Sunday in Sankuri ward during a meeting to educate residents on the importance of sharing information with security officers. Many residents in the Northeast and at the Coast are suspicious of police and reluctant to offer information. "You are required to be proactive, not reactive to activities of terror. Let police and security agencies know of any suspicious character," Hassan said. He said the information will be kept confidential. Hassan said insecurity has hurt education in the region.“We have a shortage of teachers after some left because of insecurity. We can avoid such situations if we actively work with security agencies,” he said. Rama Omar from the Kenya Community Support Centre said they are focusing on rural residents, because they are more vulnerable to manipulation by terror groups looking for recruits. He said the lobby has opened satellite offices in all counties to promote peace, good governance and sustainable development. "We need cooperation between locals and police. We urge police to act on any information from the public," Omar said. Garissa is among towns hard-hit by terror attacks. The worst was on Garissa University on April 2, 2015, which claimed the lives of 148 people, mostly students.
