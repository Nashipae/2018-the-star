The high court has dismissed investigations instituted by Capital Market Authority against former Uchumi director Chadwick Okumu by ruling that they are null and void. Justice John Mativo in his judgement said that the said investigations in his analysis were tainted with bias. "The manner in which the entire process was conducted violates the sanctity of the rules of natural justice," Mativo ruled. The court also noted that it was wrong for CMA to act as the investigator, prosecutor, judge and executioner. "No person can be a judge in his own cause," Mativo said. According to the judge, CMA should have invoked section 11 and delegate its function to an independent body. The court also quashed all orders issued by CMA against the former boss. Okumu moved to court to stop penalties imposed on him by the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) for alleged violations at the troubled supermarket chain claiming that the authority punished them for decisions taken collectively at uchumi's board meetings.
