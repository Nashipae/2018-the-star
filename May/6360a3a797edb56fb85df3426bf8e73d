The Migori government, Kenya Red Cross Society and several NGOs have set aside Sh30 million to mitigate against effects of floods. County Environment and Disaster Management director Joshua Ngwala said the money will be used to buy food and nonfood items, rebuild homes for 700 families, classrooms and upgrade the drainage system. Ngwala on Monday said families have been displaced in Nyora, Kabuto and Modi villages in Nyatike after rivers Migori and Kuja broke their banks. Another 100 homesteads in Kuria East subcounty have been destroyed.
