Secretary General Edwin Sifuna noted on Monday that the party is obliged to play its oversight role as the Opposition despite its resolve to work with the government. "We welcome the handshake between our leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta but we will not sit back and watch state officers loot public money," he said.

"As a party, we will not shield anyone involved in corruption," he said during a meeting with 12 Kiambu county branch officials, Earlier today, NYS refuted the claims. Public Service and Gender Principal Secretary Lillian Omollo disputed a report by the Director General of the National Intelligence Service that 13 vouchers amounting to Sh8 billion were paid to "ghost" companies for non-existent supplies to the NYS. "The vouchers given to the DCI for investigation are for Sh900 million. This is not remotely close to the amount claimed to have been stolen or lost," she wrote in a memo to Public Service Cabinet Secretary Margaret Kobia on May 12. It is alleged that senior government officials used proxies to register companies that were used to siphon money from the organisation. But the PS said the cash paid against the alleged vouchers was Sh121 million as per the statement sent to DCI and the PS on May 2. "The state department continues to comply with the requests from the DCI for submission of documents and recording of statements by officers," she said.
