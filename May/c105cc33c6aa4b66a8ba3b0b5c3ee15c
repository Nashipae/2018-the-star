Microsoft Corporation has opened Africa’s first Software Testing Centre in Nairobi, putting Kenya in the global picture as home to technological innovation. Kenya becomes the fourth country in the world after China, Poland and India to host such a centre, which will employ more than 1,000 youth. Deputy President William Ruto praised the move. He said technology is a crucial ingredient for achieving Jubilee’s Big Four agenda. Ruto spoke during the launch in Hurlingham, Nairobi, yesterday. The DP said the friendly policies put in place by the government had created a fertile environment for multinational companies to set up their operations in Kenya. “This is a win for our economy; this is a big vote of confidence for Kenya, in our tech community and its abilities. This development will define our prosperity,” he said. Ruto said the government is committed to making Kenya a chief exporter and producer rather than a mere consumer of technological innovation. “The government wants a vibrant technology sector, a Silicon Savannah and we believe if we can build a proper community of engineers, developers, coders and designers, we can deliver the innovations that will define the prosperity of this country in the future,” he said. Techno Brain Group chief executive officer Manoj Shanker said Microsoft is outsourcing the testing and quality assurance to Techno Brain Kenya for their flagship Windows Operating System for the application’s compatibility. “The Windows Development Group engineering team from America will be working with their counterparts from Techno Brain Kenya to set up the highly specialised and secured test environment in Nairobi as an extension to Microsoft Redmond Windows development engineering centre,” Shanker said. Techno Brain engineers will access the latest Windows Operating System. The Nairobi test centre will get exclusive access to Windows Insider software builds that are yet to be released in the market.
