Calvo Mistari has made headlines for the last two weeks. The rapper is allegedly dating former Ebru TV news anchor Kamene Goro. Well, a close source to the TV girl whispered to Word Is that Kamene is head over heels in love with another man. Last weekend, she was seen at Kengeles, where she hosts the Sun Daze event, kissing an unidentified good-looking light-skinned man. And yes, she likes them yellow yellow. The two have been dating for a month now and can't seem to get over each other. "Kamene ako na chali yake. Hiyo stori ya Calvo sijui lakini amepata chali mwingine. Walianza ku-date last month but one," the source said. Kamene is a video vixen in Calvo's new single, Love Me, which was shot in October last year, before she met the new guy. At the time, they had a steamy affair. In the video, the two are seen locking lips as they spend memorable moments at the coast. In the past, Calvo was dating singer Amelina but later ended things due to irreconcilable differences. Kamene on the other hand, was engaged to a Tanzanian man, who later broke off the engagement. "I haven’t been particularly lucky with love, and there’s nothing wrong with that. I honestly can’t tell you what happened. He had flown down to South Africa on a Monday. Then Wednesday, we talked and at the end of the conversation, he just told me we can’t be together anymore."
