  Since President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga shook hands on March 9, the
opposition leader has argued that without unity, Kenya cannot develop and without
constitutional changes. Raila further argues the constitutional changes should change our system
of governance from presidential to parliamentary. That if we don’t change into
a parliamentary system, no person from any of our small communities will ever become
President. Kenya, he says, will therefore never have political inclusivity and
will forever remain a dictatorship of ethnic majority. The constitutional changes that are being proposed today are sought to
assist Raila win power, and are opposed to helping William Ruto become
President.  If we support or oppose these
changes, let us do so for logical not illogical reasons, for public not selfish
reasons and for national not ethnic reasons. While the parliamentary system has many advantages that could persuade
many Kenyans vote for it, the presidential system is not responsible for all
our problems. It is certainly not the only reason why someone poor or from a
small community may not become President. History informs that under presidential system, Daniel Moi became President,
despite coming from the Tugen, a small community in the Kalenjin ethnic
conglomeration. It is also true that although Nelson Mandela came from the Xhosa, one of
South Africa’s big ethnic communities and President Jacob Zuma came from the
Zulu, another big community, Cyril Ramaphosa comes from the Venda, a small ethnic
group. Yet South Africa has a presidential political system. Tanzania also has presidential system, where the President appoints the
Prime Minister. However, Julius Nyerere, its first and most famous President,
was from the Zanaki, which is not one of the big communities in the country. Barack Obama became President from the racial minority with a
presidential system. The problem Kenya has is exclusion of the poor and small communities,
not because of its presidential system but its capitalism, which exploits and
excludes the economically and politically weak. Kenya’s capitalism engenders
poverty, kills nationalism and propagates negative ethnicity, which encourages
communities to exploit, discriminate and cannibalize each other. It therefore informs the true cause of exclusion in Kenya is not the
presidential system but capitalism and negative ethnicity. Even if we changed
our political system today and do nothing to eradicate negative ethnicity,
wealthy individuals will discriminate the poor, while the big and small
communities discriminate against one another. To eradicate this exclusion and discrimination by the elites, nationalism
must take the place of negative ethnicity in our politics and economy.  Only then will it be possible for persons from
small communities to survive discrimination. Let us also remember that just as being a big community does not make
its people better, if they are infected with negative ethnicity, being a small
community does also not make its masses better if this virus remains. With the scourge and ideology of negative ethnicity, Kenyans have
suffered both from the leadership of the Kikuyus and the Tugen or the Kalenjin
if you like. It is false, therefore, to make Kenyans believe all we need is a
parliamentary system or a small community in the top leadership. When Moi became President, many believed that would be the end of all
our problems. However, poverty increased, dictatorship became more brutal,
negative ethnicity sharpened and the country was completely ruined. We should
have learnt from both Jomo Kenyatta and Moi that negative ethnicity in power
does not solve problems. Let us change our Constitution and system from presidential to
parliamentary, only if we believe it will solve our problems and will be more
representative. Any system we adopt should make us more Kenyan, not substitute the
rule by a big community with that of the minority.  We need a government
of Kenyans, by Kenyans and for Kenyans.
