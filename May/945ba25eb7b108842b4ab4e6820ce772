Members of the County Assembly are now demanding a kitty of an additional Sh2.1 billion in the 2018-19 budget. This come comes at a time when they have also been asking to be granted billions of shillings as Ward Development Fund. The Sh2.1 billion they are demanding is supposed to pay their allowances and other operation expenses, above what they are already consuming. This is an unwelcome move, coming at a time when the country is focussing on reducing its recurrent expenditure in favour of spending in development. Though there is a court ruling barring the Salaries and Remuneration Commission from slashing those allowances, it is prudent for all public servants to help the country reduce the wage bill. The Ward Development Fund, will further create more confusion at the counties. MCAs should focus on their role, which is legislation, as well as over sighting their county governments. Development spending should be left to the Executives of the counties, with MCAs using the assemblies to ensure there is prudent and beneficial spending of taxpayersâ€™ money.
