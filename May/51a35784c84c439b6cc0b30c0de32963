The Ministry of Foreign affairs has appointed 117 Kenyans to serve in the country's foreign missions with effect from June 15. They include Ministers to Kenyan embassies, High commissions, Consulates (Counsellor I and Counsellor II) and permanent missions to United Nations aid agencies like UNESCO. Others are Labour Attachés, Secretaries, Immigration Attachés, Chief Records Management officers, Administrative Attachés and Financial Attachés. In a letter dated May 23, Foreign Affairs CS Amb Monica Juma said the officers will serve for a period of four years. “You are reminded that foreign service abroad is temporary assignment with specific time bound responsibilities and duties. The tour can be varied depending on performance exigencies of duty and prevailing service regulations such as performance, operational needs in the mission or headquarters, retirement age while on posting or indiscipline,” she said. The CS said the officers will serve under the Heads of Mission in the respective countries that they have been posted to. She said they will first undergo training which will be conducted by the Foreign Service Academy (FSA) prior to their posting. SFA Director will have to clear them after the training and evaluation, Juma said. She said the officers will continue with their current duties until the date they will officially be released to report to their new stations. Click here for the latest political news
