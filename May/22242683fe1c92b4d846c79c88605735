An eight-month-old baby is still missing a week after a rescue boat capsized in Tana River. A 13-year-old girl died in the accident. Her body was retrieved early this week and buried. The boat was ferrying 13 people, including the child and her mother, when it capsized at Idsowe Bridge on April 27. It wasn’t far from land, the father of the teenage victim said. The mother of the missing child is admitted at Star Hospital in Malindi. Athman Bakero, the father of the 13-year-old girl who died, said he was waiting for his family on the mainland, but the boat overturned as it approached land. “I saw them coming close to where I was, then I heard a loud bang and the boat capsized,” he said.
