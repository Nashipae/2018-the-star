Kandara MP Alice Wahome has sounded an alarm of students from the constituency being recruited into criminal gangs. She said the Gaza gang, known for its violence and criminal activities in Nairobi, is now spreading its tentacles to the region. The MP also expressed concerns that the gang is taking advantage of students' innocence to lure them into the group. She said if left uncontrolled, the gang will destroy the lives of thousands of youths and increase criminal activities in the area. Wahome pleaded with security organs in Murang'a county to ensure the situation is nipped in the bud before it infiltrates more villages. "I know this group is also in another parts of Murang'a county but in Kandara, I will not allow it to take root. I will work with other MPs to find ways of fighting it." Wahome said the re-entry of Gaza defeats gains made in wiping out gangs which used to extort money from residents some years back. The constituency was the most affected by activities related to the outlawed Mungiki sect. "We cannot afford to let another criminal gang recruit our youths knowing too well the experience we had in the hands of criminal a few years ago," she said. Many shopping centres have remained abandoned while others are just recovering after traders closed down their businesses following infiltration of Mungiki adherents. Wahome also challenged parents to be keen and report any suspicious changes in behaviour of their children. "I am challenging the county commissioner and commander to move swiftly and flush this gang out of our schools and society in general," Wahome said. The MP spoke in Murang'a town during a forum with the constituency's education stakeholders. The meeting discussed ways of improving academic performance in schools. Kandara sub-county had a KCSE mean score of 3.8 points in 2016 and 3.6 in 2017. Click here for the latest political news
