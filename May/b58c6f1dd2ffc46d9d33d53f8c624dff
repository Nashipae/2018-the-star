For months now, Diana Marua and Bahati have hidden their baby's face from the public. This is a move we've seen with other celebrities, and it tends to keep the public guessing. On Saturday night, Heaven Bahati's parents announced that they will be unveiling their baby's face to the public yesterday, and true to their word, we finally know how Heaven looks like. Just as many guessed it, this angel is a sight to see, but it's pretty hard to say who she resembles more between her mother and father, but all in all, she is a beautiful baby girl. It was perfect timing, considering it was Mother's Day. Happy Mother's Day Diana Marua and to all mothers out there.
