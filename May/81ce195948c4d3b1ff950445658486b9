Nairobi county is still struggling to decongest its downtown. Kiosks were demolished but are now allegedly being re-erected (see P23). The county is now allowing only two matatus per sacco into the CBD but how can this possibly be enforced? The county has no technology to check how many vehicles that a sacco has in the CBD. Meanwhile private cars with just one driver are still free to the enter the CBD, choking traffic far more than any one matatu. Nairobi’s traffic problem can only be solved with a proper mass transit system. We are just wasting our time with these cosmetic measures in the CBD. We need trams, buses or light trains running down the main arterial routes – Thika Road, Mombasa Road, Waiyaki Way etc. They should then connect with matatus running non-stop in circles around the CBD where all other vehicles would be highly restricted. Until we have a Nairobi mass transit system, there will be traffic congestion in and around the CBD – whatever we do.
