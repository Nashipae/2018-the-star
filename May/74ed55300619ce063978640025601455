The Kennedy Center trustees have voted to rescind Bill Cosby's Kennedy Center Honors and Mark Twain Prize for American Humor following his sex assault conviction. These are two of the nation's top artistic prizes. "As a result of Cosby's recent criminal conviction, the board concluded that his actions have overshadowed the very career accomplishments these distinctions from the Kennedy Center intend to recognise," the Washington DC organisation said in a statement on Monday. The Kennedy Center joins several US universities that have revoked honorary degrees bestowed upon the 80-year-old 'The Cosby Show' star. A Pennsylvania jury last month found the comedian guilty of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, a former director of operations for the Temple University women's basketball team. Cosby had pleaded not guilty and his attorneys said they would appeal. Last week, Hollywood's Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which hands out the Oscars, expelled Cosby. Cosby was awarded the Kennedy Center Honors, which recognize contributions to American culture, in 1998 and the Mark Twain Prize in 2009. The moves to rescind Cosby's distinctions come as US institutions grapple with how to respond to sexual misconduct allegations against prominent public figures they have honored or taken money from in the past, sparked by the #MeToo social movement. Cosby was known as 'America's Dad' for his role on NBC's top-rated 'The Cosby Show' in the 1980s, and was embraced by many civic, educational and artistic institutions as a figure who transcended racial divides. A Cosby spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment on the Kennedy Center decisions.
