Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa was forced to cancel a visit to flood victims in Baringo due to heavy rains. Baringo county commissioner Henry Wafula said torrential rains made it impossible for the CS to fly to Marigat area on Monday. “The rains were too much so we advised him to cancel for his safety,” Wafula said. Wamalwa was to visit more than 6,000 people displaced after Lake Baringo overflowed last Friday. He was represented by officials who donated maize, beans and cooking oil. More food is on the way. The commissioner was accompanied by Baringo Education executive Thomas Ole’Nongonop, Ilchamis MCA Joseph Barsalach and former MCA Wesley Lekakimon. Flooded schools include Sintaan, Lorobil, Leswa and Ng’ambo primary and Ng’ambo secondary. “We woke up on Friday to find our houses and schools inside the lake,” resident Benson Sauroki said, adding that water was rising. Displaced residents are camping at Sintaan Health Centre and are being assisted by Kenya Red Cross. At least 11 people have been since heavy rains started in April. Rains are forecast to persist till later in June. On Sunday, Water CS Simon Chelugui visited Churo-Amaya area where four dams burst, killing two women. The dams are Chepelow, Kapnus, Kachaptuya and Lokidich. The CS ordered at least four defective dams to be emptied. “Weigh the options — either to relocate to higher, safer grounds or have all the dams dried up the hills to avert the risks” Chelugui said. He also urged thousands of residents living on the lower sides of the dams to relocate to keep themselves safe. Click here for the latest political news
