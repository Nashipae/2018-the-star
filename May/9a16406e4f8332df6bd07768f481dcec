Despite languishing at the bottom of many economic indicators, Cuba's successes in healthcare continue to excite scholars. It is a world-class medical powerhouse, whose high quality of health easily bucks the well-established correlation between low income and poor health. For instance, Cuba already eradicated polio in 1962 and malaria in 1967, the two diseases giving Kenya a headache in 2018. Kenya and Cuba have many similarities, including both being developing, tropical-climate countries. But what exactly can we learn from Cuba’s experience? Today, Kenya’s health system is where Cuba was in 1959, before Fidel Castro led a life-changing revolution. The country ran a dual private-public health system with around 6,000 doctors, two-thirds of whom operated in Havana. Currently, more than half of Kenya’s 7,000 doctors operate from Nairobi city. Half of all Cuban doctors emigrated after the revolution. The Communist leader then nationalised the health system and went overdrive, training new medics. In 2018, Cubans enjoy a cost-free public health service, which boasts the third-highest doctor-patient ratio in the world (only Qatar and Monaco are ahead.) “The country’s entire primary healthcare system (is) by many standards one of the world’s most effective and unique,” says the World Health Organisation in its bulletin: Cuba’s primary healthcare revolution. Cuba is not a rich country. A ministry of health official who joined Kenya’s delegation to the country last month says Cuban doctors work without access to the latest in diagnostic technology. “Sometimes they have to wait weeks for basic equipment to arrive at hospitals to perform procedures, even at times without electricity or running water,” said the official, who declined to be named.  THROUGH THICK AND THIN During their strike last year, Kenyan doctors complained they could not perform because they lack proper facilities and equipment. “The Cuban medics still find the strength to push through all these obstacles and challenges to deliver a service worthy of praise,” says the MoH official. With all these difficulties — mostly because of embargos inflicted by the neighbouring United States since 1959 — the country emphasises heavily on primary healthcare and prevention of diseases. “Your doctors are with communities through thick and thin: before disasters strike, throughout crises and long after storms have passed. They are often the first to arrive and the last to leave,” said former UN boss Ban Ki Moon during his visit at the Latin American School of Medicine (Elam) in 2014. Elam is among Cuba’s largest medical schools, where some of the 50 Kenyan doctors will begin specialised training in September. The WHO says central to Cuba’s success is a series of community-based clinics called polyclinics. “These are the backbone of Cuba’s health system,” Dr Cristina Luna, the national director of ambulatory care who directs the country’s entire primary healthcare system, says in an interview published by the WHO. The Journal of American Board of Medicine explains that primary care in Cuba is provided in clinics, secondary care in polyclinics (specialty clinics), and tertiary care in hospitals and medical institutes. Clinics address approximately 80 per cent of the health problems and emphasise health promotion. One clinic comprises a doctor and nurse team, who provides basic primary care services for 600-900 patients in both the office and patients’ homes. Often the physicians or nurses knock on the doors of people’s houses, asking if anyone is sick. If there is someone ill, they are immediately booked in for an appointment. Patients requiring care beyond the scope of the clinic are referred to the close to 500 polyclinics, whose range of speciality care includes paediatrics, internal medicine, nursing, social work, dentistry and physical therapy, and sometimes including cardiology, pulmonology, ophthalmology, neurology, endocrinology, dermatology and psychiatry.  HEALTHCARE INVESTMENT Another of Cuba’s secret is training of doctors. Dr Richard Karanja, who graduated from the Latin American School of Medicine in 2010, says every province in Cuba has a medical school. The country typically churns out thousands of doctors every year, many of them for other countries, including the United States. “In Kenya, depending on which of the medical schools you go to, you either end up in a five or six-year programme, do an exam, then your internship. In Cuba, the programme is five years, then you do your internship, after which there is a State exam,” Dr Karanja wrote recently. These doctors are trained for free. Today, Cuba has about 33,000 family physicians. Specialisation in family medicine is a requirement for more than 97 per cent of medical graduates, who spend one internship year and two residency years in training after they receive their degrees. Later, they can apply for a residency in a second specialty. As a result, the ranks in these second specialties are being swelled by physicians who started their careers in family medicine. The country’s health system has withstood the test of time and the outcomes beat those of more industrialised countries in Europe and the US. A Cuban boy born today can expect to live for 77 years and a girl 81 years (Kenya, male 61.1, female 65.8). Infant mortality rate is low at 4.2 per 1,000 births (compared to 39 deaths per 1,000 births in Kenya). The doctor to patient ratio is one per 150, which surpasses many developed nations (UK ratio from the latest World Bank data is 2.8 doctors per 1,000 patients; Kenya one doctor for every 16,000 patients). The country spends heavily on health to achieve these statistics. In 2015, Cuba spent 10.57 per cent of its GDP on health, slightly higher than the global average. Kenya spends seven per cent of its GDP on health, according to the Health ministry. The Cuban government spends roughly Sh30,000 to Sh40,000 (US$300-$400) per person each year on healthcare, while Kenya spends only Sh8,000 ($77). Cuba pays a doctor approximately Sh6,500 ($64) per month, while Kenya’s highest-paid medical doctor earns about Sh800,000 a month. The low wages in Cuba are augmented by a range of free services and subsidies for citizens.  ERADICATORS AND INVENTORS The WHO says Cuba has so far eradicated diseases that include (with date eradicated): polio (1962), malaria (1967), neonatal tetanus (1972), diphtheria (1979), congenital rubella syndrome (1989), post-mumps meningitis (1989), measles (1993), rubella (1995) and TB meningitis (1997). As a result of the strict economic embargo, Cuba developed its own pharmaceutical industry, which also exports medicine. In 1985, the country pioneered the first and only vaccine against meningitis B. The country’s scientists also developed new treatments for hepatitis B, diabetic foot, vitiligo and psoriasis. They also developed a lung cancer vaccine that is currently being tested in the US. Cuba was also the first country on earth to eliminate the transmission of HIV and syphilis from mother to child, a feat recognised by the WHO in 2015. The country's health specialists are highly sought after. Doctors are arguably Cuba’s most profitable resource, and the country’s medical missions have proved to be a lucrative diplomatic tool. The healthcare industry is also one of the country’s main sources of income. In 2014, Cuban authorities estimated overseas healthcare services would bring in $8.2 billion, putting it ahead of tourism. Cuba also attracts about 20,000 paying health tourists, generating revenues of around Sh4 billion ($40 million) a year for the economy. Currently, the country provides more medical personnel to the developing world than all the G8 countries combined. Today, around 50,000 Cuban medical workers are present in 67 countries, according to the country’s state news agency. “Cuban doctors are rooted in solidarity and in the Hippocratic Oath. Our job would be unthinkable without foreign missions,” Salvador Silva, a doctor who has worked in Haiti and Liberia last year, told El PaÃ­s, Spain’s most circulated daily newspaper. “Yes, our salary is low and maybe that pushes us to go abroad, but it also makes us proud when we see our work recognised throughout the world, on top of just helping in our own country,” he adds. The government has a different deal with each country it works with. For example, in exchange for sending 3,500 healthcare workers to work in and provide training in Venezuela, a close Cuban ally, Venezuela sends oil. Most details of the Kenyan deal are not public, but the national government will pay the salaries while counties take care of accommodation.
