Only half of the learner population in Nyatike subcounty have reported back to school for second term. Some have been marooned at home by floods, while others have been displaced. On Thursday the Star found empty Early Childhood Development classrooms. At Nyora Primary School, North Kadem ward, just half of the 400 pupils had reported to school. The rest stayed away for fear of being swept away by River Kuja, which has burst its banks. Subcounty education officer Elijah Kongere said nearly all schools in flooded areas such as Nyora, Kabuto, Angugo and those near River Kuja have recorded a low turnout. “...some students who stay across the two major rivers [Kuja and Migori] have been unable to cross the flooded waters, roads too are impassable,” he said. “Parents are afraid of letting students go to school for fear they will be swept away or lose their bags.” Kongere said education stakeholders are looking for solutions to the low turnout problem. Ten other schools in addition to Angugo, Nyora and Kabuto primary schools as well as Miriwi and Got Kachola primary and secondary schools are facing the same problem. The schools may be closed if the turnout problem persists. Nyora Primary School headmaster Jabes Aluoch said most pupils who have stayed away are from lower primary. “...there are no boats to move the pupils across to access the schools," he said. Classes at Nyora Primary are disrupted annually by flooding, which causes deaths and water-borne disease outbreaks. Workers at Nyora Dispensary reported for work but went back home as the facility had been flooded.
