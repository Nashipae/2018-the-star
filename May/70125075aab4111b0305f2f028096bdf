Health workers in Taita Taveta county will no longer be granted long-term study leaves, the county government has said. Nestror Mwasaru, acting Health chief officer, said the county the government has temporarily suspended leave approval until further notice. "This is to bring to you attention that all long-term trainings have been put on hold by the county executive until advised otherwise," he said in a letter to the heads of departments. "Henceforth, no staff study study leave request shall be granted," the notice signed on Tuesday reads in part. A senior officer at the department, however, said the move is set to tame non-performing health workers. "The administration is fighting to streamline the health sector and they must have realised that they are losing a lot from staffs who proceed on study leave." Governor Granton Samboja had promised to crack the whip on health workers culpable of gross misconduct. This followed a public out cry on poor services on major county health centres that include Voi Moi referral hospital, Wesu hospital, and Taveta hospital. Samboja had in February given the Health CEC Frank Mwangemi 45 days to take disciplinary action on health workers who mistreat patients. Click here for the latest political news
