Former Nairobi Deputy Governor Polycarp Igathe is heading to Equity Bank as a Chief Commercial Officer, sources say. An Equity Bank business card going round on social media shows that Igathe will be among the bank's top decision makers. Speaking to the Star on phone on Tuesday, an insider in the banking industry said: “What you have seen on the card ... that's it." The source declined to give more information on the matter. The Star Business team called Igathe using the Equitel number on the card. “Polycarp Igathe speaking," he said when he answered but refused to comment on whether he will be joining the bank. “I am a private citizen. I do not speak to the media,” he said. Igathe resigned as Nairobi's Deputy Governor in January this year after falling out with Governor Mike Sonko. He previously worked as Managing Director of Vivo Energy. Igathe said goodbye to Nairobians via Twitter on January 31 when his resignation took effect. He said: "Strength, progress and peaceful change comes from independent judgment and individual ideas. Compromise should be on issues, not of principles; on political positions, not ourselves. As Kenyans, we should aim to surpass the ideology that fears free thought more than electric shock. I will continue to serve as an adviser."
