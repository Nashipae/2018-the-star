A number of roads will be closed in Nairobi on Saturday for the annual Mater Heart Run. The race is also scheduled to take place in eight other towns. City Hall way, Langâ€™ata Road, Uhuru Highway, Valley Road,
Ngong Road, Mbagathi Way, Aerodrome and Parliament Road will be closed. Motorists have been
advised to use alternative routes. "The run will begin from the Kenyatta International Convention Centre at 7am and is set to end 11am at the same venue," a notice on the road closure states. In Mombasa, the race will be held at the Kenya Ports Authority Sports Club Mbaraki, Booker Academy (Mumias), Meru Polytechnic Grounds (Meru), Kenyatta Stadium (Machakos), Kamukunji Grounds (Nyeri), Afraha Stadium (Nakuru), Moi Girls High School (Eldoret), and Jomo Kenyatta Grounds in Kisumu. The race is an initiative aimed at raising
funds for the Mater Cardiac programme, which identifies and treats
children suffering from heart diseases. It specifically targets children from disadvantaged social-economic backgrounds. Click here for the latest political news
