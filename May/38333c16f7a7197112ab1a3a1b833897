Last Thursday, the body of University of Nairobi law student, Dennis Munene, who went missing two weeks earlier, was found dumped at the Coast General Hospital mortuary. Mysterious disappearances are increasing by the day and Munene’s is just one of the few that get public and media attention. Is there a new wave of extra-judicial killings or gangs masquerading as security officers being used to target and eliminate the innocent? In Mombasa, human rights lobby group Haki Africa says 12 cases of mysterious disappearances have been reported this year alone. Most of the cases involve criminals abducting victims in broad day light. The latest was on Friday at Guraya in which Husni Mbaraka, 18, was abducted by three thugs. Eyewitnesses say he was bundled into a car. There is no great pain than that of a parent losing a child, more so in unclear circumstances. Whether the disappearances are orchestrated by state agents or armed gangs, action must be taken to end this disturbing series of murders. Interior CS Fred Matiang’i must put his best foot forward and protect, not only the young men in Mombasa, but many more countrywide. We are all innocent until proven guilty before a court of law.
