Activist Isaac Aluochier has moved to court to compel the IEBC to refund the Sh12 billion spent on the repeat presidential election. Aluochier said IEBC commissioners contravened the elections laws in carrying out the repeal poll and wasted public funds. He argues that the commissioners had a duty to conduct a credible election in August. Had IEBC not made mistakes, public funds would not have been wasted. “The commissioners were aware of the election offences impacting upon the use of technology, the effect of which is not to comprise the integrity of the elections,” Aluochier says.
