Samburu council of elders is calling upon all elected leaders from Samburu, Laikipia and Isiolo counties to put aside their political differences, unite and work together to solve problems affecting their communities in order to bring development. “We recently came from politics and people must have brushed shoulders, but after election there are many problems including insecurity that leaders must unite in order to help their communities arrive at solutions,” said the council’s Patron Richard Leiyagu. The elders also blamed some leaders in Samburu and her neighbouring counties for fueling division among communities through tribalism, favorism and nepotism, a situation that has retarded development for many years. The more than 1000 elders from the three counties were speaking at Yamo area in Samburu central sub county where they met to elect their leaders. Retired Canol Leyakon Leyagu was elected and blessed to lead the group as the patron after former Samburu West MP Peter Lengees was recently elected as the council’s spokesman. Samburu Council of elders Chairperson John Lengurkuri said the two leaders are trusted to lead the community in solving its problems as they are well educated and have served government in different ranks for many years. “As elders our work will be easy because we have elected people who are educated and have served in government, they know the right direction, if a problem arises it would not be difficult to solve it,” he said. The council’s organizing secretary David Lentiyo called upon all residents and other leaders to respect leaders elected by the elders to lead the community. However, Leguya said his first mission is to unite his community with her neighbors to foster unity, restore peace and bring development. “I am ready to unite with all elders and leaders from Samburu, Laikipia and other places to help our community in order to bring discipline, unity and development,” he promised.
