World Bank's planned construction of over 2,000 low-cost houses in Naivasha is hanging in the balance over the ownership of the 30-acre piece of land. The Sh2 billion project is to be executed in conjunction with the Nakuru county government.Â The Naivasha slaughterhouse will be relocated to pave way for it. A senior county official, who declined to be named, said a case on the land is pending at the High Court in the town. The official said that it was not clear how it was sold and pointed the finger at the defunct Naivasha Municipal Council. "Some investors have legal documents and are claiming to own the land." World Bank and investors are planning to build one and two-bedroom houses which will be mortgaged to low income earners once complete. "World Bank was seeking funding for the project which will be constructed in three phases but we have to wait for the court case to end," the official said. The county appointed a six-member team to work on the project with the lender. A letter signed by secretary Benjamin Njoroge stated that the team will be led by Judy-Leah Waihenya, who is the Lands chief officer. The others in the team are John Kamau (Housing), Isaac Kibaara (Architect), Joyce Nyambura (Trade), Moses Jerono (Technical advisor) and Maureen Litunda (county attorney). Njoroge noted that the team was appointed following a review meeting by the World Bank and the county. Click here for the latest political news
