It was a friendly match Harambee Stars dared not lose. Not in coach Sebestian Migne’s maiden outing. But they did, thanks to Barry Stenkamps strike ten minutes from time, handing Swaziland their first ever win against Kenya in any outing. The last time the two sides met was in the Cosafa Cup several years ago, where two goals form Edwin Lavatsa handed Kenya a routine win. Yesterday’s match was deemed the beginning of an new era that hopefully would end with Kenya qualifying for next year’s African Cup of Nations and perhaps realise their far fetched dream of qualifying for the 2020 World Cup in Qatar.  This was only a friendly but it brought more question than answers to where the country’s football team was headed. Eric Ouma, now without a club after a couple of years in Georgia, was handed a slot in the left back position but his performance did little to suggest he should be in the running for future assignments ahead of the beleaguered Omar Aboud sacked by his Slavia Sofia side over disciplinary  allegations. Few of the players covered themselves in glory not even debutants Joash Onyango and Michael Kibwage, who played in the defense alongside veteran Joakins Atudo. Francis Kahata subtle touches lacked the end product as Stars continually struggled to break down the Southern Africans nation. After a lacklustre first half that ended goal-less, Kenya began to take the game to the visitors but no goal was forthcoming. That period of dominance that was not rewarded with a goal came back to haunt them in the 78th minute when Stenkamp did well to hold off his marker before chesting a lofted pass from the right wing and placing the ball past a hapless Boniface Oluoch. Stars now turn their attention to the clash with Equatorial Guinea on Monday in Machakos.
