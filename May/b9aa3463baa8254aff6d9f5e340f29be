A technical committee working on the planned Ford Kenya/ANC merger has denied reports the process has ran failed to take off. The two parties are working on modalities of working together and eventually forming one strong party after divorcing Raila Odinga’s ODM over divergent political views. However, there have been claims the merger process has failed to work, two months after setting the process on the motion. Yesterday ANC secretary general Barrack Muluka, who also co-chairs the merger technical committee, said the merger plans were on course. “Nothing is going to stop it-least of all panicky political outsiders and their sponsored surrogates in whatever guise,” he said in a statement. Saying ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetangula were in the best of terms, Muluka said there was no contestation as to who will lead the new party or the presidential candidate. “Like everybody else we read reports of our presumed differences in the press usually authored by the same journalists,” he added. Muluka blamed detractors of the merger for the misinformation saying those fearing the merger of the two parties were behind the propaganda aimed at painting the process in bad light. “These are people who have benefitted from our past differences. We are aware that the confidential nature of our progress has kept them extremely worried. Their premature efforts to smoke us out will not work,” said Muluka in a statement.
