Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong and Cabinet Secretary for Devolution and Planning Eugene Wamalwa will arbitrate on Budalang'i MP Raphael wanjala and Chief Administrative Secretary Ababu Namwamba unity pact. The two leaders who launched the distribution of relief food to Bunyala flood victims in Budalangi said Ababu and Wanjala need to work together to steer development in Budalang'i constituency. "Otuoma used to abuse me but we shook hands at the weekend to signify a new beginning. I also want you to exercise restraint and allow Ababu and Wanjala to work together. Handshake for the two leaders is inevitable and the sooner the two agree to work together the better. As a CAS for Foreign Affairs, Ababu can initiate many development projects in Bunyala Sub County," the Governor said. Wamalwa said handshake is the way to go if meaningful achievement is to be realized lest the prevailing tension in the area will continue unabated. The CS said : "The weekend handshake between Busia Governor and Otuoma should be emulated by Ababu and Wanjala, adding that he is ready to facilitate the handshake between the two leaders."
