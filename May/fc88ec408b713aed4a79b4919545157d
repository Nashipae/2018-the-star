Police in Nairobi on Saturday arrested a suspect in connection with a Sh15 million haul of contraband alcoholic drinks which were seized near the Inland Container Depot in Embakasi. The suspect identified as Sheikh Fruqan Hassan was arrested as he attempted to move the consignment from a warehouse near the ICD to Westlands. Kenya Revenue Officers on a routine surveillance patrol pounced on the suspect and his accomplice as they were packing 994 cartons of the drinks. The KRA officers acted together with officers from the Railway Police station in the operation. The goods were moved to the KRA Wilson Airport Warehouses as investigations progress. The seizure came as 400 tonnes of contraband sugar was destroyed in Mombasa.
