The government has been urged to introduce environment studies in primary and secondary schools to stress the importance of conservation. Lari Environment Volunteers Group said trees are carelessly cut down in forests because people have little information about their role in the ecosystem. Organising secretary Suebeth Wangui said the trees harvested since the National Tree Planting was commissioned by Environment CS Keriako Tobiko risk being cut down if people are not educated about their importance. “Some us do not know the role of trees in the environment. That tells you that after 30 years, people will fell them without care,” she said. Wangui said the trees that were planted about 20 years after Wangari Maathai protested over illegal logging have been harvested by saw millers. “The government shouldn’t disregard our proposal. We want our society to be well-guided,” she said. Wangui spoke at Uplands Forest on Wednesday, where she led the group and residents in planting 3,500 indigenous tree seedlings. She was accompanied by area forest station manager Isaac Waweru, Lari Kirenga MCA Joseph Karichu and Lari Environment Volunteers Group chairman Ndegwa Mwangi. Click here for the latest political news
