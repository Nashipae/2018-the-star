EALA MP Simon Mbugua and two others were on Wednesday charged with robbery with violence following the April 30 assault on former NCBDA chairman Timothy Muriuki. Mbugua, Antony Otieno Ombok alias Jamal, and Benjamin Odhiambo alias Odhis denied the charge. They appeared before senior principal magistrate Martha Mutuko with their lawyers Nelson Havi, Cliff Ombeta, Michael Osundwa, and Harun Ndubi. Lawyer Wahome Thuku was watching brief for the former Nairobi Central Business District Association chairman.

Prosecutor Solomon Naulikha said Mbugua has a lot of influence and is likely to interfere with witnesses. He said police are still in pursuit of other suspects who are yet to be charged. Ombeta told the court that the claims by the prosecution can not hold water. Havi said Mbugua should be given free bond arguing that as a public officer, "he is more than cooperative". "The mere fact that he is a public figure should not deter this court from granting him bond. In fact, it is favourable that he be released on a reasonable bail." Mbugua was arrested on Tuesday after police linked him to the attack on Muriuki during a press conference at Boulevard Hotel.
