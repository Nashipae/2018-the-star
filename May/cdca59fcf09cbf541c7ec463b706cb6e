A man died on Friday morning after a quarry caved in and buried him alive in Mukurwe-ini sub-county in Nyeri. The incident happened at Karii quarry in Kiuu village when a section of the quarry collapsed following heavy rains pounding the area. Witnesses said 29-year-old Cyrus Muchoki was harvesting sand. They said he died on the spot after the wall of the quarry collapsed and covered him. "Our efforts to rescue him were in futility because by the time we were getting there, he was already dead," a witness said.

He also asked county government and ND-CDF to consider buying sand from the youth to improve the prices and their livelihoods. The MCA also appealed to the miners to stop harvesting sand until the rains subside saying it is very risky to venture into the mines following the heavy rains. Muchoki's colleagues, however, said sand harvesting is their only means of livelihood and they have no option but to continue with the risky job. About 120 people harvest sand in the area.
