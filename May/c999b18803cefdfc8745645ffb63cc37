South Africa’s fashion brand, Mr Price, is set to take full ownership of all its local after buying out Deacons franchise operations in East Africa that started in 2007. Deacons was previously the exclusive local franchise holder of the Mr Price clothes brand and Mr Price Home. Mr Price is now set to take full control of the subsidiary, setting the stage for complete autonomy from Deacons. “We had a franchise agreement that has worked extremely well over the years. Going forward, Mr Price will now be an independent brand run by MRP in Kenya,” said Deacons CEO Muchiri Wahome. Deacons will be compensated for ceding control of the franchise. Proceeds from the sale will go towards funding ongoing operation, launching an e-commerce platform, launch of a Deacons house brand and store expansion of the other international brands in its portfolio. Mr Price’s plans for Kenya’s fashion market are not immediately clear, but the multinational is now expected to develop and run its own local retail outlets. “The future is positive for Deacons as we will continue to bring relevant brands to market. Directors have also decided to relaunch the Deacons label in order to have more control in its supply chain and focus on penetrating lower segments of the market. This coupled with an imminent launch of an e-commerce platform will ensure sustainable growth for the group,” Muchiri said. For Deacons, the sale of its franchise rights ends its distributorship of Mr Price products, which served the middle class. Deacons plans to concentrate on its other international brands, which include F&F, Adidas, Deacons Kids, Bossini, 4U2, Truworths, and LifeFitness. These brands have received good uptake by the East African consumer as they offer good value-for-money lifestyle solutions and customer service. Deacon’s remains committed to growing its customer base by offering lifestyle solutions to East Africa through its 30-store footprint. In Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda.
