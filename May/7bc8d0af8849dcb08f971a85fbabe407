Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa will table a motion in Parliament to impeach Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri and PS Richard Lesiyampe over corruption at the national grains agency. Wamalwa asked where the two were when their juniors used money meant for farmers to pay cartels, brokers and fraudsters. He spoke in Kinyoro, Saboti on Saturday during the burial of Ivor Kirong, a lecturer who perished in a road accident in Kamukuywa. "I have started working on a motion to impeach the CS and the PS which I will move soon, because it means they were sleeping on the job during the scandal," the legislator said. Kiunjuri on Saturday said he would not step aside. Agriculture ministry sources say eight traders were paid Sh1.9 billion in the last three or months alone, money the ministry says
would have paid about 4,000 farmers. Wamalwa asked he had asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to suspend the two. Had also asked them to step aside but all in vain. The scandal did not involve just maize. There was theft of subsidised fertiliser as well. Traders allegedly bough subsidised fertiliser
at only Sh1,500 from the National Cereals and Produce Board, repackaged it and sold to farmers at between Sh3,000 and Sh3,500. The NCPB CEO Newton Terer resigned last week. Albin Sang was appointed acting CEO in acting capacity for three months. Eight NCPB senior managers were suspended. Lesiyampe suspended three regional managers for Lake Western, North Rift and
South Rift pave the way for investigations. PS Lesiyampe promised an audit and prosecution of officers found culpable. Read: Inside story of the NCPB maize scam Also read: DPP asks KRA, DCI, Assets Recovery Agency to join probe at NCPB Click here for the latest political news
