Nyanza residents have been urged to plant avocado trees to boost their earnings. NASA leader Raila Odinga on Sunday said there was a new avocado species with a lot of commercial benefits. The avocado has huge market in Europe, America and Australia, Raila said. "This is a new cash crop that we want to introduce to our people to end poverty. I'm asking residents to adopt avocado farming," Raila said. The new species, crest avocado, matures after three years and can produce 20 tonnes on a two acres land. "That gives the farmer a minimum of Sh2 million," Raila said. The former prime Minister said experts had approved Nyanza as fertile for the avocado fruits. "They said it's possible to have two harvest in one year," he said. Raila who spoke in Bondo where he planted an avocado tree at Bar Opuk Primary School urged farmers to take advantage of free seedlings. Farmers are currently being given free seedlings in a campaign to plant a million trees in Siaya. "The seedlings will cost Sh200 after the campaign," Raila said. He regretted that Kenya's tree cover had been reduced by continuous felling of trees without replacement. He said such actions had greatly contributed to environmental degradation. "Those cutting trees must remember to replace them," he said. Raila said he will plan a trip with President Uhuru Kenyatta to lead a tree planting drive that will begin in Nyanza. "The decision to plant trees is not an option if we have to counter environmental degradation," he said. Click here for the latest political news
