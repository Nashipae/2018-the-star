Police in Ol Kalou will not hesitate to shoot criminals terrorising residents, Nyandarua Central OCPD Wilson Kosgei has warned. “Where necessary, we’ll use guns, but we will not violate the law to protect innocent people,” he said. Kosgei spoke on Monday at Munyeki Primary School during at a security meeting convened by Nyandarua Central deputy commissioner Gideon Oyagi. This follow concerns over rising crime in Munyeki location. Police urged residents to turn in criminals living among them. “If you are here and you are a criminal, we are telling you your days are numbered. When you leave, tell your accomplices what we said. I am very honest in this, my authority is the gun and the law,” he said. On Tuesday last week, thugs armed with an AK-47 raided the home of businessman Geoffrey Njogu at Kianda village in Munyeki. They injured his wife seriously and abducted his daughter. On the same night, a transformer serving the home of Nyandarua speaker Wahome Ndegwa was vandalised. On Friday the previous week three cows belonging to Njogu’s neighbour, Rachael Wariara, were stolen and slaughtered. On Tuesday the same week, a transformer was vandalised at Quarry Village. Kosgei said there are enough security officers to protect people and property in Ol Kalou.
