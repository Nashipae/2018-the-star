The government is keen on ending frequent skirmishes at the Chepchoina Settlement Scheme. Speaking in Trans Nzoia yesterday, Rift Valley regional coordinator Mongo Chimwanga said they were fast tracking the identification of genuine settlers so they can be allocated plots. “The relevant team is undertaking the process. Only genuine squatters will be given allotment letters,” Chimwanga said. Those living on grabbed plots will be evicted. The first phase of the subdivision of the scheme ended without problems in 2010. “The second phase has been marred with irregularities because some people have attained fake allotments letters,” Chimwanga said. Genuine letters were issued by the Settlement Trust Fund (STF). Last week, a court ordered those with STF letters be allocated their plots. “We will follow the directive of the court. Those aggrieved should seek redress in court,” Chimwanga said. He made the statement after a security committee meeting at the scheme.
