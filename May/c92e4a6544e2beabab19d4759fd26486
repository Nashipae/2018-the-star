Sheil Kotecha lost to India’s Kunal Anand 7-5, 6-4 in the second round of the Uganda Futures tennis tournament in Kampala yesterday. Kotecha got off to a good start against the Indian, breaking his serve to lead take a 2-0 lead. Anand roared back to tie the game at 2-2 after winning the third and fourth games. The two players looked evenly matched and play went to serve for the next six games to be tied at 5-5. Anand was to break Kotecha’s resistance in the eleventh game to lead 6-5 before clinching the next game 7-5. A revitalized Kotecha came out firing in the second set, matching the intensity of Anand with players winning two opening games to tie the game at 2-2. Anand stepped up a gear in the subsequent game, breaking Kotecha’s serve to lead 4-2. Displaying momentum, Anand came within set point by wining the seventh game. A lapse of concentration by Anand saw Kotecha fight back to trail 5-4 but Kotecha ran out of steam in the final game to bow out of the competition. Kotecha expressed confidence he will bounce back in the remaining two legs. “I tried my best but things did not work out and so I hope for improvement in the next two weeks,” added Kotecha. Ibrahim Kibet and Kevin Cheruiyot will grace the tournament from the second leg starting next week while Ismael Changawa remains a doubt for the remaining legs after suffering an injury.
