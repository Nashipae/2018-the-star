Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula yesterday faulted President Uhuru Kenyatta for not committing to fix the IEBC to deliver credible elections in future.He said unresolved challenges undermining the independence of the electoral agency to conduct free, fair and credible elections have contributed to bloody polls every five years.“The President should have committed that as he leaves office, he leaves the IEBC beyond reproach like Caesar’s wife,” Wetang’ula said.The Bungoma senator spoke during debate in Senate on Uhuru’s State of the Nation address.

A referendum is an election,” he said.The Ford Kenya leader also took a swipe at Uhuru’s position that security has tremendously improved.Wetang’ula, who skipped the State of the Nation address, said crime remains a major challenge.“I heard the President say security has improved tremendously. I don’t know if he lives in this country,” he said.Wetang’ula said KDF soldiers fighting al Shabaab in Somalia should be redeployed to guard the Kenya-Somalia border.Mombasa Senator Mohamed Faki also raised concerns over insecurity in various regions and urged Uhuru’s administration to act.
