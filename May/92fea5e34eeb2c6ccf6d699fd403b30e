The government will enforce weight limits for overloaded boda bodas. Kenya Urban Road Authority said many operators carry more than the legal limit of 30kg. This means they cannot easily control the motorcycles. A Kura assistant director for road safety Wilson Kitwa said such a load should be carried by a car or a Tuk Tuk. He said they have already arrested riders carrying two or more bags of cement weighing 50kg each. “Right now there is road accident menace by boda boda operators who do not know traffic rules and those who know do not adhere to them. They don’t wear reflector jackets and helmets, they carry very heavy loads and thus cause a lot of chaos on the road,” Kitwa said. He was speaking during a traffic rules information road show at Kiritiri Town in Mbeere South Sub-county on Wednesday. Kitwa said the violation of traffic rules by the boda boda riders in eastern Kenya has contributed to the loss of more than 1,000 lives. He called on boda bodas to strictly follow the traffic rules to reduce the number of accidents they cause. He said boda boda operators should overtake other vehicles from the right side and the left. The rider and their passengers should wear helmets and reflectors, and each rider should take insurance covering themselves and the passenger. The authority will carry out road shows in eastern Kenya including Kitui, Meru, Embu, Machakos and Tharaka Nithi about the need to observe traffic rules. The roadshows will target motorcycle riders.
