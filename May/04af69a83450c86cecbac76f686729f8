Shujaa face Tonga in the preliminary round of the Rugby World Cup Sevens slated for July in San Francisco, USA. In a departure from tradition in the past two World Cups, where the 24 teams were pooled into six groups of four teams, this time round the lower ranked teams will have to go through a qualifying round to make it to the last eight. Kenya are seeded ninth in the three-day event and if they beat the South Pacific Islanders, they will face Scotland in the next round and will progress to the quarters if they win. The top 14 seeds are ranked according to points accrued during the 2016-17 series and first seven rounds of 2018 in Dubai, Cape Town, Sydney, Hamilton, Las Vegas, Vancouver and Hong Kong. The remaining 10 teams are ranked according to their placing in last World Series qualifier in Hong Kong with Tonga seeded 24th having not taken part in that event. The innovative tournament format will see an initial knock-out qualifier featuring the nations ranked ninth to 24th while the top eight seeds progress automatically to the round of 16. Innocent Simiyu’s charges will be seeking to go one place better than their predecessors, who made it to the semi-finals in both the 2009 and 2013 editions in Dubai and Moscow respectively. Shujaa captain Oscar Ouma said they are keen on a World Cup medal. “We are in very good form and I think with the momentum, we can go all the way and do the country proud “ added Ouma Olympic champions and HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series leaders Fiji take on the winner between Japan and Uruguay in the round of 16 while reigning World Cup champions New Zealand face the winner between Russia and Hong Kong. Top seeds South Africa will encounter the winners between Ireland and Chile while host nation USA, ranked fifth, wrap up the first day of competition as they face the winner between Wales and Zimbabwe in the final match of the day.
