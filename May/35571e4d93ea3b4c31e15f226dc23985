Uber Technologies Inv. hopes to use drones in San Diego to deliver food as part of an innovative commercial test program approved by the federal government on Wednesday. Dara Khosrowshahi, the company's chief executive officer, described how deliveries could be expected in between five to 30 minutes depending on if they were done by humans or drones. "Push a button and get food on your doorstep," he said, according to Yahoo Finance The executive was speaking to a crowd during an on-stage interview with Bloomberg at a Uber Elevate conference in Los Angeles when he said that Uber had become the largest food delivery business in the world. 10 state, local and tribal governments along with companies like Alphabet Inc., FedEx Corp., Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc. and Uber were all selected by the US Transportation Department to take part in commercial drone testing. The CEO has been a skeptic of the flying car program but seems to be playing a different tune as of late. "Uber can't just be about cars," he said. "It has to be about mobility." "It's my personal belief that a key to solving urban mobility is flying burgers, in any city. We need flying burgers." The hope is that the pilot program - a joint effort from NASA and the US Army - will be ready to launch in 2020. Uber will not be building its own flying cars. Uber isn't the first company to test drone delivery. A company in Hong Kong called Food Panda already delivers food by drone in under 20 minutes. According to Food and Wine, they plan to expand to Malaysia, Thailand and other Asian countries. In 2016, Dominos rolled out test drone delivery for a New Zealand location but has failed to implement the program in the United States. At the University of Virginia, Chipotle attempted to deliver meals to students and faculty on the campus. But no other major chain has successfully implemented the strategy as it stands at the moment. Click here for the latest political news
