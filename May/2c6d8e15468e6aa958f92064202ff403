Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko and Environment CS Keriako Tobiko have today met after Saturday's showdown at a presidential event in Nairobi.  During the event, Sonko accused Tobiko of disrespecting the Nairobi county leadership following a protocol hitch during a tree planting ceremony at Moi Forces Academy. He protested loudly after Tobiko skipped him in the speeches and instead invited Deputy President William Ruto to speak at the event. Ruto was forced to sit down and let Sonko speak.

My brother and I have no issues. What happened was not Tobiko's fault. I know those undermining me." Sonko said. The two addressed the media outside City Hall on Tuesday. Sonko reiterated that Tobiko was not to blame for not following protocol. He added, "Only one person wants to destroy my image. But I have forgiven him." Tobiko also reiterated that he has bad intentions towards Sonko. "I have nothing personal with Sonko. Any difference of opinion is nothing personal. We have agreed to work as a team." Tobiko said.
