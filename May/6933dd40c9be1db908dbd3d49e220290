A blind private investigator was charged in a Nairobi court on Tuesday with obtaining Sh945,000 by false pretenses. James Mutua pleaded not guilty to the fraud charges before Milimani Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi. He was granted Sh200,000 bail pending the hearing of the case on July 2. The court heard that the accused obtained the money from Ashut Engineers on diverse dates between June and August 2017 in Nairobi county. "He obtained the money by pretending he could pursue their debt cases in court on their behalf," the charge reads. Senior state counsel Solomon Naulihka informed the court that eight witnesses will testify in the case. In the same court, the magistrate issued summons for retired major Michael Rotich to appear in court on May 21. Rotich is accused of conspiring to promote prohibited substances for athletes at a hospital in Eldoret. The offence was committed between January and February 2016 at Eldoret Towers, Uasin Gishu, with people who have been arraigned. Naulikha sought the orders saying the accused was not in court at the time he was expected to plead to the charges. Click here for the latest political news
