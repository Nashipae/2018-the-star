Kenyans have heaped praises on a pilot who abandoned government officials to assist a pregnant woman who had been shot in Marsabit. Captain Stephanus Kruger flew Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa and other officials to a floods assessment mission in Northeastern on Sunday. It was while there that they learned that a woman had been struck by a stray bullet as rangers pursued hyenas that terrorised Eborr village. The area was marooned by floodwaters so the victim's evacuation was almost impossible. Area chief Karicha Boru said poor networks further hampered their efforts to rescue the woman. Villagers made a distress call upon seeing the helicopter hovering above their village. In the aircraft, a nursing officer who had been helping flood victims put the woman on a drip. She was airlifted to a waiting ambulance, which was 40km away, and then taken to a hospital in Moyale where she is recuperating.
