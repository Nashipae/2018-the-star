Cuban doctors will not be paid more than their local counterparts. Health PS Peter Tum yesterday dismissed claims that the foreign medics will earn salaries higher than those paid to Kenyan doctors. "Somebody claimed the cost of the Cuban doctors is higher. That is misinformed. In fact, the payment and remuneration is the same as those for any other doctor," Tum said. He spoke on the sidelines of a meeting between the ministry and members of the National Assembly's Health Committee at Whitesands Hotel in Mombasa. CS Sicily Kariuki is expected to shed more light on the role of the 100 Cuban doctors. Committee chairperson Sabina Chege said they were not privy to the details of the deal.
