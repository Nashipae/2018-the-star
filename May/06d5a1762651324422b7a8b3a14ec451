Kwale Woman Representative Zuleikha Juma (pictured) on Monday stormed out of a mining forum in protest against exploration of minerals. The forum at Diani Reef Hotel was chaired by Mining CS John Munyes. Juma walked out as Munyes read a declaration allowing Base Titanium to expand their exploration. She said no public participation was conducted before reaching the declaration. The forum was meant to be a public information and education workshop. “I don’t understand why they suddenly changed the venue from Ukunda Showground to a private hotel,” Juma said. “Residents who will be directly affected must be involved and their grievances heard.” Juma is among MPs who have opposed Base Titanium’s request to extend their exploration, saying it would hurt residents. The forum was attended by MPs Benjamin Tayari (Kinango), Kassim Tandaza (Matuga), Suleiman Dori (Msambweni) and Senator Issah Juma Boy. Governor Salim Mvurya and Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani skipped the event. Click here for the latest political news
