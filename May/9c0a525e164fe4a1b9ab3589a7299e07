Two former CDF officials in Likuyani constituency have been found guilty of soliciting a bribe to sign cheques for a school project. Former secretary Wycliffe Shipwakula and Susan Njeri, a project management official, were found guilty by chief magistrate Charles Obulutsa. Obulutsa will sentence the two on Monday. The prosecution applied to have the accused compensate the school for the money lost. The two were accused of demanding and receiving a Sh20,000 bribe to sign cheques for Sh1 million allocated for development at St Peter’s Moi’s Bridge Boys High School on July 14, 2014. State counsel Job Mulati said the EACC Act stipulates the two should compensate the school because the project stalled. MP Enock Kibunguchi was among the 10 witnesses lined up. He defended the CDF officials. Principal Samwel Akweyu (pictured) said the two asked for a Sh50,000 bribe, but he said he could not afford it. They insisted that he gives them some money. That was when he reported the matter to the EACC office in Eldoret. A trap was set up at the school and the two were caught on camera receiving the Sh20,000 treated money.
