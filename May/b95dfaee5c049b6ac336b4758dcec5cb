Deputy President William Ruto is leading thousands of mourners at the burial of the late Baringo South MP Grace Kipchoim. Kipchoim died on April 20 at Nairobi Hospital where she was admitted after her health deteriorated. The 49-year-old had suffered from acute colon cancer for close to two years. Her body was airlifted on a police chopper for the burial ceremony at Kimoriot village in Mochongoi, the border of Baringo and Laikipia county. "It is due to the poor roads and the changing weather condition that we chose to airlift the body from Lee funeral home in Nairobi to save on time," Full Gospel Churches of Kenya Bishop Chemon said. Other leaders present are Elgeyo-Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, Baringo Governor Stanley Kiptis, MPs William Cheptumo, Moses Lessonet, Joshua Kandie and former Baringo Woman Rep Grace Kiptui among others. Chemon eulogized the late MP as a brave leader and recognized her as a staunch Christian. "I was her Pastor in Kabarnet and she approached me before she vied the political seat for Baringo South and I gave her the go-ahead, and she did a great job throughout her time," he said. Kipchoim was re-elected on a Jubilee Party ticket on August 8, 2017, despite being sick. She did not campaign due to the illness but won the tough race for reasons such as her development track record and security initiatives.
