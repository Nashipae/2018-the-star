Lamu residents on Friday opposed amendment to the Wildlife that would eliminate compensation for injuries and deaths caused by some animals. If the amendment passes, there would be no compensation for injuries or deaths caused by poisonous snakes, sharks, stone fish, whales, stingray and wild pigs. Compensation would only be paid in case of injury or death by elephants, lions, leopards, cheetahs, hippos, hyenas, crocodiles, buffaloes and rhinos. Farmers would not be compensated for destroyed crops. They would only be paid for livestock injured or killed. The Kenya Wildlife Service says it doesn’t have enough money to pay compensation claims. Former Environment CS Judi Wakhungu last year said her ministry was unable to pay snakebite victims Sh1.5 billion because KWS had run of cash. Lamu residents told reporters on Friday that the end of compensation would mean more poaching, especially as payback when people are killed or injured. Lamu Wildlife Conservation Committee chairman Ali Shebwana called on Tourism CS Najib Balala to intervene and ensure the amendment does not pass. Shebwana said the amendment would hurt Lamu, which experiences many cases of human-wildlife conflict. He said his office is swamped with applications from people seeking compensation for wildlife attacks and deaths. lives lost Shebwana said in some parts of Lamu, residents continue to lose acres of crops to wildlife. “That amendment cannot possibly pass. It’s demeaning and unfair,” he said. Lives lost can never be replaced and some injuries are permanent and life-altering, Shebwana said. “What of those areas where human-wildlife conflicts never cease?” he asked. Fishermen here have been attacked by sharks and whales. Should all that be treated as normal? Shebwana asked. Lamu Farmers’ Association chairman Julius Mwangi called on the government to compensate all pending cases before changing the law. It should not be retroactive, he said.
