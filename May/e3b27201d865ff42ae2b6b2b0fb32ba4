Those who delivered maize to the National Cereals and Produce Board were not genuine farmers. It is unfortunate that farming in this country has been hijacked by merchants who are out to mint millions. The merchants will impoverish farmers who are struggling to make ends meet. The people who delivered maize to NCPB were millers and other merchants who imported maize and flooded the stores. When genuine farmers took their harvest to depots in January, they were told the stores were full. They asked themselves where the maize had come from because the harvesting had just began. It is regrettable and this must be punished. The ongoing investigations must unearth the merchants for prosecution. When we investigated, we found out that there were many long trucks delivering maize. We asked the identity of the owners of the trucks and the response was they belonged to some unnamed 'big boys.' This meant genuine farmers had been shortchanged and merchants allowed to deliver imported maize to NCPB. When we protested the trailers disappeared. We are yet to be told who the owners were. There were no such big farms to warrant the use of those huge trucks to transport the harvest. We farmers know one other. It was not possible. The owners of the trucks took almost all the money meant for local farmers. We have nowhere to take our produce. Maize is now rotting in our stores when the merchants have already pocketed money for farmers. The NCPB started vetting farmers to fool us.This was an act of cleansing the merchants. People should take responsibility at NCPB. We should not be taken in circles that there was no money lost at all. What we know is that there was corruption and punitive action should be taken against those involved. Farmers are really suffering because many of them had taken loans which must be repaid.
