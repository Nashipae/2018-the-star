The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights chairperson Kagwiria Mbogori has urged the state to put structures in place to compensate the Ogiek community. On May 26 last year, the African Court on Human and People’s Rights ruled in the community’s favour. The court recognised their right to live in the Mau Forest as their ancestral home. Mbogori spoke on Saturday at Nessuit, Mau Forest, during the Ogiek’s anniversary celebrations for the ruling. At the same time, she urged the state to extend the commission’s tenure.
