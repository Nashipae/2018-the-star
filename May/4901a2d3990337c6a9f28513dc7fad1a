Residents of Nairobi's Nyayo Embakasi estate have opposed the construction of six telecommunication masts in the neighbourhood. Activist Boniface Mwangi said the masts are set to be installed in spaces reserved as playing grounds and for hosting estate parties. Nyayo Embakasi Residents Association (Nera) move to court in a bid to stop the installation of the base transceiver station. They have cited that it poses a health risk from radiation and will cause depreciation of their properties due to an "automatic mass movement". The group wants construction approvals by NEMA, the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA), and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority quashed. The residents also want Eton Towers (Kenya Towers), the managers of the estate and Lidcom restrained from continuing with the installation. "The Base Transceiver Station being set up by the respondents is hazardous since it emits radiation well-known to be a major cause of cancer, neurone behavioural symptoms, sleeping problems, cognitive performance and infertility among men," the residents say in suit papers. Wahome Thuku, a lawyer (though not part of the case), also weighed in stating that the move was a total abuse of environment and comfort. Nyayo Embakasi estate has about 20,000 residents. It was constructed by NSSF who are exiting in 10 years. A resident, outraged by the phone masts, also penned an emotional message saying the companies did not conduct proper public participation. "Only 38 names from an attendance register of a selective public participation meetings in hotels was submitted to Nema for approval," he said. "Our survey has showed that 85 per cent of residents are opposed to the project," he said. Click here for the latest political news
