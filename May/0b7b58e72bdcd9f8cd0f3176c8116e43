The widow of Gatunguru principal Samuel Mbogo and a suspect in the murder case have been detained 10 days to help with investigations. Alice Mugechi and Samuel Gitu did not take plea at Murang'a Law CourtS on Monday after the prosecution applied for more time to complete the probe. The two are the main suspects in the principal's gruesome murder. Mbogo was killed at his home in Gakurwe village on Saturday night and his body dumped in a car.

Criminal Investigations Officer Jeremiah Kazungu told the court that police were pursuing other suspects. "The crime occurred barely two days ago. We require more time to conclude our investigations," Kazungu said. He asked the court to detain the two at Murang'a police station to give the prosecution more time before a murder charge is preferred against them. Mugechi, however, asked the magistrate to allow her to go home to her family as the probe goes on. She said her children do not have anyone to cater for them and that she has livestock which require her attention. "I will fully co-operate with police. I am also needed for preparations for my husband's burial," Mugechi told the court. The magistrate said she considered her appeal but refused to release them saying their case is too serious. Wachira scheduled the mention for May 28. Click here for the latest political news
