Police in Ruiru are holding a 14 seater matatu driver and his tout found with 40 mobile phones in their vehicle. The two were arraigned at Thika on Wednesday but OCPD James Ngetich said they only sought more time to hold them to complete investigations. Ngetich said they had received multiple complaints from passengers who lost phones in the matatu and some of the passengers had recorded the vehicles' registration particulars.
