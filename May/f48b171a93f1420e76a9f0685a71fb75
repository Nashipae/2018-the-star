Central Bank governor Patrick Njoroge has warned that further borrowing to fund development projects is not healthy for the country. Instead, he wants the government to shift the funding of such projects to the Public Private Partnership model which he said reduces the debt burden. “The headroom (for borrowing) has now decreased. We cannot continue borrowing for spending on even the good projects. We need to move into non-debt financing of our development projects,” said Njoroge. Kenya’s total debt burden stood at Sh4.6 trillion as at November last year. In February, International Monetary Fund officials told a parliamentary committee that the country’s excessive borrowing amid huge revenue deficit is worrying. Speaking in Mombasa yesterday at media briefing on the scorecard of the Vision 2030, ten years since its launch, Njoroge however said the county’s debt as it currently stands is sustainable. He cited the proposed Sh300 billion Mombasa-Nairobi Express Highway, which the government wants to partner with private entities as the way to go. It will allow a company or a set of companies to build the road and then recoup their costs by charging tolls. However, Dr Njoroge warned that before settling for such proposal, there is need to make sure that there is enough consultation and stakeholders’ engagement. “PPPs are one set of options that may or may not work in some projects, it is not a sort of a silver bullet, it needs to be applied correctly,” he said. Vision 2030 Delivery Board, Dr James Mwangi said the Kenya’s debt is manageable, but the government cannot continue to borrow to finance projects. He said however in fullness of time, Kenyans will come to appreciate when they start getting returns from some of the projects funded by loans.
