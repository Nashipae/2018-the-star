The anti-corruption agency is pursuing Athi Water Services Board member Billy Arocho for allegedly taking a Sh300,000 bribe. A Chinese businesswoman made a report on Monday, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) said yesterday. Jay Ma accused Arocho of demanding money to shield her from the ongoing crackdown on counterfeit goods. Contacted by the Star yesterday, Arocho admitted he met Ma whom he said wanted his help, but denied taking Sh300,000 or asking for a bribe. “I met them a day before, they told me they are being victimised. I went to deputy head of the Public Service Wanyama Musiambo's office yesterday [Tuesday]. Musiambo told me the people are not paying taxes,” he told the Star in a telephone interview. The anti-corruption agency spokesman, Yassin Amara, yesterday told the Star the agency was combing through evidence before arresting Arocho and his accomplices. “We will put people behind bars. We are talking of a bribery that has already taken place,” he said. Amara said Arocho and his co-accused narrowly escaped a dragnet by the anti-corruption sleuths on Tuesday evening as the complainant took Sh3 million to him. According to Jay Ma, Arocho had demanded Sh5 million from her for protection against the swoop led by a multi-agency team. However, the Chinese national who owns Mega DÃ©cor Interiors Ltd and a godown along Mombasa Road, negotiated and the amount was reduced to Sh3 million. Ma said Arocho was introduced to her by a friend after her goods were confiscated at her godown on Monday this week. The multi-agency team arrived at 11a and pounced on workers. They were accused of storing counterfeit goods and failing to comply with tax laws. “I was away at Airtel Kenya when I was informed that some people had forced their way into the godown and arrested my workers. I was told they were government officers. I sent my friend George who talked to them and agreed that we give them something,” Ma said in her affidavit. After negotiations, the 'officers' were to be given Sh300,000 and promised Sh3 million. But unknown to Arocho, Ma recorded the conversation. In one recording Ma pleads with Arocho to give her until 4p on Tuesday to deliver the cash. But Arocho says, “So you have nothing …there is nothing,…..you mean there is nothing…but how long…? In another recording he is heard invoking Musiambo’s name. Arocho tells Ma that Musiambo is his good friend and would help her. “He [Musiambo] is the one leading the [operation] but he is my good friend …he is the boss… he was the one leading what happened today…..we can find ways of helping… how do you want to be helped?” he asks. Arocho was appointed to the water board in 2015. It was seen as a reward for his loyalty to President Uhuru Kenyatta. Click here for the latest political news
