Machakos county has distanced itself from the construction of the Machakos-Kitui road where a bridge has developed a wide rift. Images of the cracked session of the road have been going rounds on social media. The bridge is at Kariobangi-Sokoni road in Machakos Town. Last Week Kenha also distanced itself from the shoddy job. Through a statement, Machakos CEC for Roads Francis Maliti said the road was not a County project and was constructed before counties came in place.

He said that consultants have done a report which has been forwarded to the concerned authorities. The road has also been closed for two weeks in a bid to allow the contractor on the ground to redo the work.
