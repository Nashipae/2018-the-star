Twenty eight businessmen have filed a suit seeking the reversal of the government order for all school buses to be painted yellow. Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i issued the directive earlier this year while he was in charge of the Education ministry. The order was effected after an amendment to the Traffic Act. Schools were asked to install safety belts and operate the vehicles only between 5am and 10pm. The businessmen, who filed their case on Thursday, said compliance with the directives will shorten their working hours and reduce their earnings. They also noted that failure to comply will put them at risk of arrest and prosecution. The complainants want the court to issue an order against their arrest and prosecution. They also want a declaration that they are entitled to full enjoyment of their economic and social rights. The 28 have a fleet of 75 vehicles and said they offer transport services to individuals and organisations. In their line of work, they added, contracts last between one and six months. Some of their clientele are parents who want their children ferried to and from school, employees who want to be picked from home and taken to work and back and mourners headed upcountry. Led by Peninah Wanjiru, they said adhering to the order will render them destitute and their businesses affected. "If they opt out of the contractual obligations with parents, they will be exposed to massive litigation because this will interrupt students' right to education," the court papers state.
