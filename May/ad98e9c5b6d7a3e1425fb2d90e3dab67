A Form One girl has given birth to twins a week apart, shocking residents of Nandolia village, Kanduyi constituency. Twins are usually delivered a few minutes or hours apart. The 18-year-old conceived before sitting her KCPE exam last year in Bungoma county. She went into labour last week and was rushed to a clinic, where she gave birth to a girl. Almost seven days later, she felt persistent pain and went to Bukembe dispensary. Nurses were unaware she was breastfeeding another infant and said she was in labour. The student later gave birth to another baby girl. Her mother said she never heard of such a case. The nurses and villagers were shocked. “As we speak, my daughter is doing well with her twin children. They were born a week apart, but it is difficult to identify the firstborn. We thank God for the blessings,” the mother said. She said that across their family tree, no one has given birth to twins before. Bukembe dispensary nurses said they had no idea the baby delivered at the facility was a twin. “We didn’t handle the first case. When she arrived here, we didn’t know she had given birth to the first child,” one midwife said. “All in all, we handled the case and she delivered a baby girl without any hitch.”
