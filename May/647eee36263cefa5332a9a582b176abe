ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has sought to assure leaders from Western that everyone will be included in his Luhya unity initiative with Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula. He said the merger of the two parties was only the beginning of a long journey together. "I am assuring my brothers in ODM, Jubilee and all other parties that we shall reach out to all of you in due course. No one is being left out," Mudavadi said. The ANC leader was speaking during a thanksgiving ceremony for Lubinu-Lusheya ward MCA Elly Keya in Mumias East on Saturday. Kakamega Governor Wycliff e Oparanya and National Assembly chief whip Ben Washiali were at the same event. They said though they support the unity drive, it must not be restricted to ANC and Ford Kenya. Oparanya said he was firmly in the presidential race. He said he will back Mudavadi if he emerges stronger and Mudavadi should do the same should he emerge the favourite. The governor said he will not accept to deputise DP William Ruto come 2022. Mudavadi dismissed claims by a section of politicians saying the merger has nothing to do with a collapsing NASA. He said ANC is exploring political cooperation with Ford Kenya, at a different level from that in the NASA coalition agreement. Click here for the latest political news
