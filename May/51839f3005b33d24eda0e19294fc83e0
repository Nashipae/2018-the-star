A six-year-old girl was buried alive and more than 300 people displaced at Kapsangar in West Pokot following a landslide on Thursday night. Eight people were injured, 13 cows killed and 46 houses and a school destroyed by the landslide. West Pokot Red Cross coordinator Carlos Kibet said the injured are recuperating at Kapenguria referral hospital. Kaghmuu primary school was totally destroyed and more than 300 pupils forced to stay at home. “The school has mud-walled classrooms which were totally damaged. It might not be constructed soon because the landslides are unpredictable,” he said. Kibet said the displaced families are in dire need of humanitarian aid. “After accessing the impact of the landslides, the Kenya Redcross will supply non-food items to the displaced families. Will provide tents, kitchen utensils, blankets, mosquito nets and other items,” he said. West Pokot county police commandant Mathews Kuto who visited the scene said the school is not in a position to be repaired because it was completely destroyed. “It’s a combination of floods and landslides that caused havoc, in some areas the heavy rains resulted to raging floods which swept, livestock, trees and houses. The most affected place was at the school where the child was buried,” he said. He said the national government will supply relief food to the affected families. The body of the young girl was retrieved from the mudslide and taken to Kapenguria referral hospital mortuary. On Saturday, three people died after another landslide swept away a house at Inoi village in Kahuro sub-county, Murang'a county. OCPD David Kandie said one person was rescued and rushed to Muriranjas hospital while one other person is still being searched for.
