Lamu-Garsen road is impassable after part of it was cut off and floods swept away bridges. A convoy of more that 10 buses was held up at Milihoi on Sunday after a bridge was damaged following torrential rains. In addition, more than 200 passengers in a second convoy were forced to cut short their journey. Passengers, who were travelling to Mombasa and Malindi from Lamu, had to turn back. Travellers were worried about their safety because Milihoi is one of the areas prone to al Shabaab attacks. Swaleh Said of the Tawakal Bus Services said the poor state of the road hindered movement and endangered people’s lives. Vehicles could easily veer off the road and cause accidents, he said. “A tender has already been given for construction of the road. The work needs to be done swiftly. We are wasting so much time on the road. When it rains, the road become slippery,” Said said. Hassan Salim of the Mombasa Raha Bus Services said they now have to drive at extremely slow speed to avoid causing accidents. Passengers arrive late at their destinations, he said. “The normal speed is 80Kph, but we do 40Kph or even less because of the poor state of the road. A journey that should take less than five hours drags on for more than eight hours,” Salim said. “If this road is tarmacked, we would not be worried about terror attacks. People have been killed here by terrorists. You can imagine what was going on in people’s minds,” stranded traveller Is’haq Khatib said. On March 9 last year, President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the construction of the 135km road in Witu town. The tender was awarded to H-Young Company.
