More than 3,000 flood victims in Lamu have refused to relocate to the Nagele camp in Witu, Lamu West. They want to protect their property. The national government and the Red Cross set up the camp to provide temporary shelter and humanitarian assistance until floods subside. The Red Cross says some people stay in dangerous areas and risk death or injury if flooding gets worse. Deputy county commissioner Louis Rono on Wednesday said residents have rejected calls to report to the camp. The county commissionâ€™s office has dispatched a team of chiefs, assistant chiefs and elders to plead with residents. Chalaluma, Moa, Dide Waride, Bultho and Matabore are the worst-hit areas.
