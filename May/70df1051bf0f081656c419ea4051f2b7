A family in Kisumu is seeking justice for their son who was allegedly shot dead by a senior police officer after a bar brawl. Brian Chacha, a 22 year-old student of KCA university, died from gunshot injuries on Thursday night. He was shot on the head and chest. The officer, said to be a chief inspector based in Migori county, was arrested on Friday and is helping police with the investigations. Kisumu county commander John Kamau said the matter is being handled by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. "He is in custody as investigations to establish what transpired continue," the police boss told the Star on the phone. Witnesses said the two were arguing and before gunshots were heard, forcing bar patrons to flee to safety. What caused the disagreement remains unclear. The family pathologist Isiaba Ndibire said the first bullet to the chest caused severe damage to the student's heart while that on the head damaged the brain. The government pathologist was also present during the autopsy on Friday. Danstan Chacha, the man's father, called on DPP Noordin Haji, Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to ensure that justice is served. "I am yet to receive any communication from the police officers investigating the matter," he said. "We want justice served and the officer prosecuted for killing of an innocent boy. Let the DPP and other human rights bodies come to our help." The slain student was staying with a relative in Kisumu town as he attended classes. KCA students protested against their colleagues' killing along the Kisumu streets to press for action against the said officer. The Kenya Universities Students Organisation condemned the shooting saying the suspect must be brought to book. Click here for the latest political news
