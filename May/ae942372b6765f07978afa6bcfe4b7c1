"There was a plan to subvert the will of the people by stuffing ballot papers but when it was discovered, we raised the issue. We are ready to wait for an election that is free, fair and credible." Ouko's opponent Thomas Ombwori claimed that his camp panicked. "I was poised to win the seat. However, I'm confident that the will of teachers will prevail even if we hold the election next year," said Ombwori. Other seats that were up for grabs were that of assistant executive secretary and secretary for tertiary. The seats fell vacant after the former holders joined the Kisii county government.
