Former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale (pictured) has proposed an alliance between Western and Rift Valley ahead of 2022. He called an arrangement between the two regions “workable”, as they are neighbours. Khalwale said Ruto should engage ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetang’ula once their parties merge. He said the Luhya community has separated itself from Opposition leader Raila Odinga for ignoring it after benefiting from its support in every election year. Khalwale said the community has not forgiven Raila and ODM for snatching the only seat a Luhya held in NASA, that of Senate Minority leader Wetang’ula.
