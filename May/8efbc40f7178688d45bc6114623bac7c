Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has ordered a fresh probe into Pastor James Ng'ang'a's accident case. The preacher was acquitted of the charge of causing a woman's death by dangerous driving three years ago. The Neno Evangelical Centre preacher was freed by a Limuru court on May 4 on grounds that the prosecution failed to prove its case. The decision, which the victim's family intends to appeal, sparked public outcry.

He tasked the DCI with conducting comprehensive investigations with a view to guiding the Judicial Service Commission on what to do with those involved in the decision. "This should be done with a view to reaching a suitable corrective and deterrent action to take against persons found culpable for improper handling of this case," the Minister said. "While seeking a report on the investigatory and trial processes that may have caused this outcome, I urge you to appeal this judgement in its entirety." He asked the DCI to pursue justice for the victims and the public. Ng’ang’a was freed alongside driver Simon Kuria and police officers Christopher Nzioka and Patrick Baya. Limuru Chief Magistrate Godfrey Odour presided over the matter. Read: Manguo crash victim’s family to appeal pastor Ng’ang’a acquittal Click here for the latest local political news
