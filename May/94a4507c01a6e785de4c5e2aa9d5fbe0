Two people suspected of a spate of thefts in Kayole estate, Naivasha, were yesterday lynched by residents. The two were cornered while ferrying suspected stolen meat and set ablaze. Former Lakeview MCA Simon Wanyoike said residents have had sleepless nights over crime. He said everyone was afraid of the two as they would strike in broad daylight. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru said the badly burnt bodies were taken to Naivasha Subcounty Hospital mortuary. He urged residents not to take law into their own hands and hand over suspects to police.
