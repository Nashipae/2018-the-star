Contradictory information surrounding the death of a University of Nairobi student has emerged. The body of Dennis Munene was found in a hotel swimming pool in Mtwapa, a source at the Coast General Provincial Hospital said. But the police reports show the 25-year-old was found at Lamayani Beach. The source said Munene was taken to the morgue on May 12. Only Munene’s “friends” were allowed to see his body. He went missing on May 9 at Kasarani. Kilifi South police chief Joseph Muriuki on Friday said Munene’s body was retrieved from the ocean. “The body was recorded as unknown. No one knew he was a student,” he said. Muriuki said no one reported that he was missing. Officers from the DCI have started investigations into the death.
