A Baringo woman’s attempt to meet Deputy President William Ruto suffered a setback on Monday after Governor Stanley Kiptis allegedly “chased her away like a dog”. Michelle Jepkoech, 30, is the woman who disrupted Ruto’s speech in Eldama Ravine on May 19 to seek his audience. She wanted to air her grievances to the DP. Ruto’s aides asked her to arrange with Kiptis for an appointment at the DP’s office in Nairobi. She was to be accompanied by the governor. On Monday, Jepkoech went to Kiptis’s office in Kabarnet to arrange for the meeting but the governor was away. She waited until late into the night before going to his residence. “Kiptis chased me away like a dog,” Jepkoech told the Star. But Kiptis denied the claim. “Idon’t even know her,” the governor said when he met her in his office yesterday. Jepkoech said security at the governor’s gate blocked her. “Kiptis heard an argument and came out straight to me and ordered me to leave his home,” she said. “I was confused. It was dark in the night and I had nowhere to seek refugewith my young kids at the time.” Jepkoech said a woman went with them to her home in Cereals estate, Kabarnet town. The mother of five said she wants the DP to give her land to build a home. Her husband died, she said. Jepkoech made headlines after fighting off Ruto’s security as she shouted “Mheshimiwa Ruto [Honourable Ruto]” when she sought his ears at the Eldama Ravine Garden Square. “Let her come,” Ruto said. He asked Michelle to sit at the dais as he completed his speech. When he finished his speech, Ruto rushed to his chopper after quickly telling Jepkoech to see him in his office in Nairobi. Jepkoech said she is destitute. “My pleas for assistance from Baringo leaders have borne no fruit. I thought the Deputy President could help me,” she said. Click here for the latest political news
