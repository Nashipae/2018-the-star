Education CS Amina Mohamed has announced a 100 per cent penalty waiver to past HELB beneficiaries who clear their loans in lump sum. Amina, during the HELB employers' forum held in Nairobi on Thursday, gave the beneficiaries from May 3 to June 30, 2018.  To benefit from this, one must pay a lump sum of the HELB balance. CEO Charles Ringera said 78,000 loanees owe the institution to a tune of Sh8.1 billion. "With 100 per cent penalty waiver until June, we call upon all the beneficiaries to take advantage of the generous offer by the government," Amina said. SMART-CARD The Education CS further directed all university students to be issued with smart cards from HELB to access loans. "...this will remove physical contact of university deans and students ledger which causes delays." "It will help the students to pay fees from the tuition e-wallet which is locked by a special system for that purpose only," she said. Amina said the PS will oversee the process and issue a report in September 2018. "One of the key priorities is to ensure that all university courses take a required period of time to complete," she said. Noting that Maasai Mara University, KEMU and Pwani university already have the smart cards, Amina said other universities should follow suit. "....with your support I know that will happen so that we end this era of a perpetual habit of staying in the university for long not because of funding but because of many other reasons," she added. Amina said she had received complaints from students on the delays of tuition remittances to institutions. In January, University of Nairobi students went on a rampage protesting delays of their higher education loans.
