Kenya Climate Ventures has pumped Sh35 million into a biodigester that produces biogas and natural fertiliser helping smallholder farmers countryside. Ventures, a World Bank Fund, says the investment in Sistema.bio will be used to deliver sustainable renewable energy and agricultural solutions. In a statement, Sistema.bio Country Manager Raymond Chepkwony said the convertible debt investment will give rural residents access to clean energy by profitably managing all the waste in their households while safeguarding their health. The innovation increases energy, while keeping monthly costs down to about the same they would spend on firewood, charcoal and LP gas. It is intended to increase farm productivity with organic fertiliser, realise an adequate return on investment and save money and time. Sistema.bio will provide interest-free payment plans to farmers
