A man who stabbed his son to death during a fight with his wife has committed suicide in police cells. Eutycus Githinji hanged himself with his shoe laces at Huruma police station, where he was remanded by a court. His body was found hanging from the window of the cells’ toilets. Githinji, 45, was arrested last Monday, weeks after he stabbed his stepson with a kitchen knife and went into hiding. Dennis Mwema, 18, was stabbed on May 9 at their Huruma home as he attempted to stop Githinji from beating his mother Eunice Wanza. Mwema was confirmed dead at hospital.
