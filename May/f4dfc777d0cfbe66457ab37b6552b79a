Kakamega Homeboyz head coach Mike Mururi has expressed his desire to build a youthful team as he sets his sights on the future. Mururi fielded a team full of unheralded youngsters in their weekend win over his former employers, Chemelil Sugar, and said his gamble paid off handsomely and one which he is keen on sticking with. Mururi said: “We had to fiddle up with the line up a little after we lost to Gor Mahia and the players who stepped in have really impressed so much. This is very encouraging not only to the technical bench but the entire team as well.” He added that it will only be through hard work and high discipline that players will be guaranteed a starting place in his team as these are the only qualities that can bring good results. Mururi paid tribute to young and talented left back, Collins Odhiambo, who started in the place of veteran Collins Kisuya and Benson Mutonyi, who has been promoted to the first team, saying they were some of the best youngsters who have a great future in soccer. He also lauded veteran striker, Allan Wanga, who opened the scores against Chemelil as one the stars who have exhibited great commitment to the team and also a real role model to the upcoming players. Against Chemelil, Mururi opted to start Micheal Wanyika for David Juma in goal, left back Odhiambo while Hedmond Mauda took the right back position from Wilson Anakeya. Homeboyz’ win against Chemelil was their sixth from 15 matches and served as a great relief to a team that was under intense pressure from their demanding fans.
