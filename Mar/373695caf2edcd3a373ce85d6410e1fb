Ruto will inspect the ongoing construction of Kamusa-Leadae-Aisaik road and also commission the Leldaet-Singorwet-Teganda road in Bomet central. He will thereafter address a public rally at Silibwet stadium. Read: Isaac Rutto ripe for a cabinet post, Bomet youths tell UhuRuto There has been much public outcry after the region was sidelined on the recent cabinet appointments by President Uhuru Kenyatta despite voting largely for Jubilee. In the recent appointments, Infrastructure principal secretary John Mosonik from the region was dropped. Elected leaders from the region led by Governor Joyce Laboso have had rough times explaining to the residents why the region was left out on the appointments and the DP’s visit will come at an apt time. During a recent visit to Tenwek hospital, Energy CS Charles Keter prevailed upon the angry residents who took him on task questioning why the region had been sidelined but urged them to be patient as there were ‘good plans in store’ for the region. Bomet county commissioner Geoffrey Omoding on Friday urged the public to turn out in large numbers to welcome the DP. “It is true we shall be having the deputy president making a tour to our county as part of the Jubilee’s development agenda…we have put all the requisites in place and we expect everything to go as planned, we also expect hundreds of residents to attend the rally,” he stated. Area MP Ronald Tonui on his part expressed his satisfaction over the move by the DP to make a visit to Bomet saying it was sign that he treasures the region. “We know he has a busy schedule…but having him visit Bomet which is one of the many tours he has made shows he values the impact we have and our support for Jubilee,” he said.
