The hearing of a corruption case against former Kasarani MP John Njoroge will resume on June 27, the Anti-Corruption Court has directed. Milimani chief magistrate Lawrence Mugambi set the hearing date to enable the complainant, Abdirahman Mohamed, to return to the country and be cross-examined. Mohamed is receiving treatment in the United States. The building contractor left Nairobi in December last year. In his testimony, Mohamed said Njoroge was arrested after he pocketed a Sh100,000 bribe to facilitate a Sh3.3 million payment from the CDF office. The bribe was given by Mohamed. The payment was for the completion of a tuition block at Baba Dogo Secondary School. Mohamed, then testifying in a wheelchair, told the court Njoroge also corruptly demanded another Sh50,000 to share with CDF committee officials to facilitate the payment. The offence was committed on June 4, 2013 in the Continental House parking yard. Njoroge has since denied the charges. Previous trial magistrate Peter Ndwiga had freed the MP after Mohamed dropped his complaint, but the High Court set aside the acquittal and ordered a retrial following an appeal by the DPP.
