Journalist Joseph Jamenya yesterday started his 400km run from Vihiga to Nairobi to raise Sh60 million to build a cardiac centre in the county. Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi was among the residents who turned up at Vihiga County General Hospital to see him off. “We support this noble course as a county. We shall put in as much as we can to help our people who suffer regularly from heart attacks,” he said at the colourful event. Jamenya, who works for the Star newspaper, said he is physically and emotionally fit to cover the distance. He urged the county governments of the regions he will pass through and well-wishers to support his campaign.
