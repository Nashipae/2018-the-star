Deputy President William Ruto's visit to the Coast seems to have won him the hearts of his rivals. Overall, at least 15 Nasa and Jubilee Party legislators have pledged to support him in 2022 when he is expected to vie for the presidency. The politicians have hinted at forming a caucus to push this ambition. Wundanyi MP Danson Mwashako (Wiper) heaped praises on Ruto on Sunday terming him suitable to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta after his tenure ends. "We fully support the DP's journey to State House. We will rally our people behind him," Mwashako said at ACK St Barnabas. The MPs said the DP has demonstrated that he is development-oriented and that he has a proper vision for the country. Voi MPJones Mlolwa (ODM) said the region has resolved to back Ruto for his development agenda. Mlolwa said a pack will ensure the Coast region is not left out in the next government. "To succeed we must [sign] a joint pact that will enable Ruto ascend to power." East African Legislative Assembly member Mpuru Aburi said the Gema community will strongly support Ruto in the next general election. He dismissed claims that the community will not honour this deal, saying: "I know there are rumours that with the introduction of Raila Odinga in government, we won't support the DP. That is not true. We all know that Ruto is the next president." Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria said their support was unquestionable. Ruto was with leaders including Langata MP Nixon Korir, Kapsaret MP Oscar Sudi and Taita Taveta woman representative Lydia Haika. Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa also attended the function. Ruto will face politicians including Machakos Governor and Maendeleo Chap Chap leader Alfred Mutua, who has affirmed that he will vie. During a function in Kabarnet on Saturday, Bureti MP Japheth Mutai said there is nothing wrong with backing Mutua. Details: Fit for president in 2022?
