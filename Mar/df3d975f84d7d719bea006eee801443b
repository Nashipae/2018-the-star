The High court on Friday upheld Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu's win in the August 2017 election. Judge Pauline Nyamweya, in her ruling, declared that Ngilu was validly elected. The judge dismissed the petition filed by former Governor Julius Malombe on grounds it lacked merit. She said the petitioner had no sufficient evidence of voter bribery, intimidation, and ballot stuffing. The court ordered Malombe to meet the Sh6million cost for the petition. Justice Nyamweya said that on scrutiny, she noted that even though there were errors in 10 polling stations, they did not affect the final results that were announced by the returning officer. Malombe challenged Ngiluâ€™s win on grounds of irregularities in a number of polling stations. He argued that the results did not reflect the will of the voters in Kitui. During the hearing, Judge Nyamweya allowed scrutiny and recount of votes in 50 polling stations where Malome claimed there was rigging. In the petition, Malombe accuses Ngilu of intimidation and bribery of voters saying that in several polling stations, the number of votes cast exceeded the number of registered voters. In her defense, Ngilu told the court that she won because she is a performer and was the best candidate for the position. Click here for the latest political news
