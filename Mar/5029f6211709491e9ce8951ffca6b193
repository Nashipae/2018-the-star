Kiosk owners in Busia town without temporary occupational licenses have up to March 31 to vacate or be forcibly removed. Busia town administrator Ken Nabulindo said many illegal kiosks are mushrooming in the CBD. “The majority of kiosks are put up at midnight or during the weekend,” he said. Green Garden, which is meant to be a park for relaxation, has been worst hit. Demolition notices were sent on February 12 but delivered on February 27. Nabulindo said some structures have been built on top of culverts and the bus park has not been spared.
