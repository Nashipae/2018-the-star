The government has set aside Sh250 million to train teachers on the new curriculum, an official has said. Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development officer in charge of basic education Shurie Barre said teachers will be trained on how to bring out the creativity and imagination oflearners. They will also be trained on how to bring out the best in learners with special talent. Speaking during a forum on quality education at Lamu Girls’ Secondary School yesterday, Barre said teachers will undergo intensive training to understand the objectives of the new curriculum. The curriculum has been tailored to equip learners with basic skills to help them pursue various professional endeavours. “Teachers must be trained on how to go about this new curriculum and that’s why the government is investing heavily in this training,” Barre said. “Teachers can effectively impart knowledge in learners only when they are conversant with the curriculum.” Coast regional education coordinator Abdulkadir Kigen called for concerted efforts to ensure the objectives of the new curriculum are met. Kigen said the government will employ more teachers in Lamu and other counties where there was a shortage. He praised the government for restoring security in the county. Lamu has in recent years faced insecurity challenges due to frequent al Shabaab attacks. The insecurity paralysed learning in many schools. “Although some challenges still exist, we are grateful for the security and stability which mean better learning for the children,” Kigen said. Lamu Deputy Governor Abdulhakim Aboud, who is also the executive for Education, said the deteriorating standards were disturbing.Aboud said some parts of the county are still volatile. Insecurity forced many teachers to flee the area. Aboud said most schools lack proper infrastructure.  “The government should strengthen security in Basuba and Ishakani,” Aboud said.
