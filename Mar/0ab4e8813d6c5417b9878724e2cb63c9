A case in which three Kenyan plastic surgeons want to bar the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board from licensing any foreign plastic surgeons will be heard on May 7. “The intended licensing of Dr Tilman Stasch by KMPDB on account of misrepresentation or false experience infringe on the medical health stakeholders consumer rights by making him look more qualified because of his skin colour,” the petition reads. Under the Kenya Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, they want the court to restrain all private medical facility, in particular Columbia Africa Health Care and Aga Khan University Hospital, from employing Stasch, a German intending to work in Kenya as a plastic surgeon.
