Kimilili MP Didymus Barasa has warned NASA leader Raila Odinga not to go to Bungoma if ODM senators dare to oust Moses Wetang’ula Leader of Minority. Speaking at Machaka Primary School in Tongaren constituency on Saturday during a funds drive, Barasa said ODM should not undermine the Ford Kenya leader just because Raila has decided to work with President Uhuru Kenyatta. “As leaders of Western Kenya we have welcomed the move by Raila to work with the President,” the Jubilee MP said. However, he said, if ODM leaders and Raila think they would use the new found friendship to belittle leaders fron Western leaders, they will be in for a rude shock. Barasa said Wetang’ula has helped NASA make big strides in Western and should not be despised. Raila should know voters in Western Kenya have already made up their mind to vote for Deputy President William Ruto as President in 2022. If Raila thinks he is going to bring confusion on Ruto’s path to State House, he will not succeed,” Barasa said. On Friday, ODM senators wrote to Speaker Kenneth Lusaka seeking to have Wetang’ula replaced with Siaya Senator James Orengo. This has attracted sharp criticism. “From history we know our late brother Kijana Wamalwa walked with Raila and got hurt. He wants to do the same to Wetang’ula. We will not allow that. Our community will not be belittled,” he said.
