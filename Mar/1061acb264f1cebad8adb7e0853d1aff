Kenya will send a second-string side to the Victoria Falls Sevens tournament slated for March 24-25 in Zimbabwe. The tournament will feature nine teams and Kenya will be joined by Uganda, Zambia, Swaziland, Morocco, Senegal, Zimbabwe, France and Hong Kong. Kenya are likely to call up players who have not had much playing time in the Sevens circuit this season including Eric Ombasa, Harold Anduvate, Sam Muregi, Herman Humwa and Frank Wanyama among others for the two-day tournament. Zimbabwe 7s are the tourney’s defending champions after beating Namibia in last year’s final. Head coach, Innocent Simiyu, has welcomed the tournament and observed it will give fringe players a chance to showcase their skills. “It’s a good tournament and we hope the boys will go there, enjoy themselves and do the country proud,” said Simiyu. Elsewhere, hosts Impala Saracens are top seeds and headline Pool ‘A’ for the fourth round of the KRU women’s 10-a-side festival set for Sunday at the Impala Club. Impala, who beat series leaders Homeboyz 10-5 to claim victory at the third round in Ruaraka a fortnight ago, are joined in this pool by Shamas Rugby Foundation, Mwamba and Kenyatta University’s Blad Babes. Homeboyz are in Pool ‘B’ with Top Fry Nakuru, Comras and Northern Suburbs.
