The NASA leadership in the National Assembly has called off the House boycotts after coalition leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta agreed to work together. Minority leader John Mbadi yesterday told the Star the Raila-Uhuru pact, which caught many by surprise last Friday, offers a solution to long-standing wrangles between the opposition and the Jubilee parliamentary leadership. “I think this agreement is going to help move the agenda forward. It is going to be enriching when we approach debate. We will be approaching [debates] in a sober manner. There will be objectivity,” the Suba South MP said.

Opposition MPs have on many occasions given House and committee activities a wide berth. This angered their Jubilee counterparts, who accused them of serving their own selfish interests. “There will be no party alignments that I’m now Jubilee or NASA. We will be handling issues the way the parliamentary system should work. The House will oversight the Executive without being petty,” Mbadi said. Majority Chief Whip Benjamin Washiali said however the opposition’s move to partner with Jubilee puts Parliament at the risk as its key role is to provide oversighting to the Executive.
