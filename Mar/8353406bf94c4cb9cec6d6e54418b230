When you own land in Kenya, the next move you need to make is getting married and building a home. Diamond Platinumz might just be heading in that direction. Yesterday, when he came to launch his album in the 254, he had a lot of surprises for us. He changed his attire after every song in his album, which by the way is a storyline of his life from the days he was in Tandale as a hawker to who he is now, a big brand all over the world. That aside, another surprise was that he now has land in Ngong, courtesy of a local property company. "Kenya is like my second home," he said. "In fact, I wish I was born in Kenya. With this piece of land, I think I will build my mother and I a house here, so that we can have a place where we can find peace when we need some time off in Kenya." Diamond's mother was pretty much excited. She literally carried the title deed everywhere she went, but we understand. Land in Kenya is a sign of wealth, and The Boy from Tandale did not miss that train. He really needs a Kenyan wife who can make the house a home, because he is actually at liberty to have four wives.
