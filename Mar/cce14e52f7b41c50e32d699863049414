Water levels in the 600MW Masinga Dam is still low, despite the ongoing rains, raising fears of power rationing in the coming weeks. Energy CS Charles Keter said the current levels are at the lowest. He said the water levels are at 1338.69M, the worst in recent times. The standard operating height is 1337M. “We are working on close to one meter, which is not something to be happy about,” he said. But Keter assured Kenyans that all is well, adding that there is no cause for alarm as other dams are operating at capacity. “Unlike in the previous months of December, January and February, where we imported power from Uganda, this time we have enough to last us until the Masinga’s water level rises,” the CS said when he and other ministry officials met the Senate Committee on Energy at Enashipai Resort in Naivasha. Sondu Miriu and Turkwel dams will supply the Western parts of the country with power. On power production, the national government and Japan have signed an agreement for the construction of a 140MW geothermal power plant at Olkaria V in Naivasha. The two-year project will be implemented through Japan International cooperation Agency. Petroleum CS John Munyes said the government has formed a special unit to investigate cases of counterfeit products flooding the market. Although Rwanda has banned petroleum products from Kenya, negotiation talks are underway to resume business. “This sector needs more resources so that the Energy Regulatory Commission can perform its duty,” he said. Narok Senator Ledama ole Kina said the cost of electricity will only go down if the line from Nairobi to Mombasa is completed. The committee chairman and Nyeri Senator Ephraim Maina said they are determined to work with the ministry to ensure consumers access cheap and reliable power.
