Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior has written to the DPP demanding that the song by two Kikuyu artistes on Kitui charcoal ban be pulled down from the website. The legislator said the song must not be allowed to be on the internet longer than it has been. He said: "If not pulled down, they will do more harm than good...the artistes should be arrested and charged forthwith for exciting ethnic hatred and spewing vitriol against a community with no justifiable cause." Mutula, in the letter addressed to Dorcas Oduor, adds: "Although appearing to be directed to Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu and the ban on charcoal burning, the message therein is directed to the whole Kamba community." He said the same has caused ethnic animosity and is bound to excite tribal bigotry between Kikuyu and Kambas. In the said song, artistes Isaiah and Waharaka eat mangoes at the start, an action some say is a mockery of the people of Ukambani. Mutula says the suggestion that Kambas will feed on dogs and wild birds, when the mango season is over, is derogatory, distasteful and unnecessarily provocative.
