Arguably the showiest fashion event in the entertainment calendar, the latest Edition of Thrift Social was upon us this weekend, March 17, with revelers gathering at the Alchemist Bar in Westlands, Nairobi to express their creativity. The event sponsored by Ciroc and Azure Hotel played host to the display of a cool, new representation that was redefining the edition's colour blocking theme. With an aim of shaking off the clichés that surround dressing, revelers turned out in some of the most imaginative and bright-coloured attires and fashion trends. From the numbers that had thronged the venue, it was clear that fashion has turned into a new demographic and more youthful people are starting to embrace non-conventional styles. With regards to the creative direction offered by curator 2ManySiblings, it was not only a celebration of style and individuality but also an observance of great music. The audience was entertained to an incredible music mix by Butch Norman and Mix Master Lenny aided by hype-men Barak Jacuzzi and Shaq the Yungin - who for a better part of the night kept the crowd in an endless frenzy. To add to the outstanding nature of the show, at exactly 10 pm Brooklyn-based musician KAMAU jumped on stage and immediately had the venue rocking. His vocal range and stage presence were nothing short of astonishing. Assisted by his deejay Moon and Mokheirs, he delivered to his fans tracks from his extensive catalogue including tracks like "GRÄ,” "Justfayu." "Pohlease," "Jambo," "LÄƒVÄ­NDÅ­R" and "CÅ­NÄƒRí " among others. The energy never dropped, and at one point, he had the audience actively involved in the performance. And just like that, Nairobians were offered the best Thrift Social experience ever.
