A 20-year-old orphan from Bungoma wants Governor Wycliffe Wangamati to give her a cow to produce milk for her triplets.
Christine Siani from Sipla village in Webuye East constituency delivered on Tuesday night through a normal delivery.
Siani gave birth to the boys at the Webuye Subcounty Hospital. She was taken to the hospital on a motorbike by her relatives when she went into labour.
The triplets are her first delivery. She has appealled to well-wishers and the county government to help her raise the children.
Siani said she did not expect to have triplets.
“This is a gift from God, but it has also come as a shock,” said the single mother.
“I do not have a job. I am asking any well-wisher to come out and help me.”
Siani called out to Wangamati, Woman Representative Catherine Wambilianga and MP Alfred Sambu to give her the dairy cow.
She said she will raise them in a Christian way and prepare them to be future leaders.
Hospital senior matron Prisila Wekesa said the boys are healthy and in good shape.
They were born at around 6am without complication.
They weigh 2.5kg, 1.5kg and 1.4kg.
“They are not so badly off in terms of their birthweight, but we will need to help them to attain more kilos,” she said.
Wekesa said Siani has a lot of work ahead of her regarding the babies’ care.
The matron told journalists that as much as they are happy with the delivery, they are afraid Siani might have a hard time bringing up the triplets by herself at her young age.
She appealed to county leaders and well-wishers to support her. “We know feeding one child is not easy. At her tender age she has three.”
