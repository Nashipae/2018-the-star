Two drivers from the personal cars died on the spot while the third victim passed on while undergoing treatment at Naivasha sub-county hospital. According to a witness Bernard Karani, one of the buses was overtaking carelessly when the disaster struck. "The driver of the bus swerved back carelessly to his lane to avoid a head-on collision with an incoming trailer and in the process, he hit the vehicle belonging to Laikipia County," Karani said. The witness added that the ongoing rains, poor visibility and careless driving had contributed to the accident. A senior police officer who declined to be named confirmed the incident. “A total of six vehicles were involved in the accident and two people died on the spot while the injured have been rushed to Naivasha sub-county hospital,” he said. At the scene, personal effects soaked in blood and diesel were littered all over before police moved in and towed the wrecks to Naivasha police station. This came as tens of motorists were stranded for hours along the Mai Mahiu-Limuru road following a major traffic snarl-up caused by the ongoing rains and a stalled trailer. In what has become the norm along the road, motorists were forced to divert to the main Nairobi-Nakuru highway before the stalled lorry could be towed away. Click here for the latest political news
