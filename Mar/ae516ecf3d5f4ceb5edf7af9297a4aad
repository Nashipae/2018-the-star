Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula has warned Raila Odinga's ODM that the Nasa "divorce will be noisy and messy". The Bungoma Senator reacted on Thursday to a move by ODM to replace him, as Senate Minority leader, with his Siaya counterpart James Orengo. "If anyone wants a divorce it will be noisy, messy and unhelpful, and it will have causalities. I'm not going anywhere. I was not invited to Nasa - I'm a founder." Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka told Senators that he had received a letter from Minority Whip Mutula Kilonzo informing him of the decision. The Speaker, however, told the Opposition coalition to ensure that it follows proper procedures in electing Orengo before the appointment becomes official. "The removal of Wetang’ula, though valid, stands suspended and will not take effect until a Senator is elected by the coalition in the manner provided by Standing Order 20(1)," Lusaka said. He added written communication to this effect and minutes concerning the decision must be sent to his office by the Senate Minority. Sixteen ODM Senators signed the petition to oust Wetang'ula, Judith Pareno saying his election was a gentleman's agreement so it was not legally binding. Pareno, a Nominated Senator, said ODM is only taking what is rightfully theirs. However, Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua said the party cannot purport to fire a leader it did not hire and that Nasa will remain if ODM bolts. Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang said the decision to boot Wetangula is premised on the need to have a strong leadership in the Senate More on this: Nasa affiliates threaten to divorce Raila's party for 'marrying' Jubilee Related: Jubilee ready for coalition with ODM but presidency off limits - Duale Click here for the latest political news
