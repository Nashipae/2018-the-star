The Environment and Land court has given temporary orders restraining the businesswoman proposed to replace Polycarp Igathe as Nairobi deputy governor from occupying a disputed property. “The court is satisfied the plaintiff has demonstrated he has a prima facie case against Agnes Kagure Kariuki and grants the orders sought in paragraphs (c) and (d) of the application,” Justice Antonina Bor said. The judge also granted an order restraining the city county of Nairobi and the chief Lands registrar from making any entries in respect to the disputed property. In the application dated January 31, 2017, Joel Munene moved to court seeking a temporary injunction to restrain Kagure or her agents from entering, occupying, trespassing, selling or in any other way interfering with the property known as Nairobi Block 83/1903 pending hearing and determination of the suit. LEASE Munene claimed to be the legal owner of the suit property having bought it from Erastus Nyaga, who purchased it from the original owner - Silas Kithenji. He claimed Kagure issued him an assignment dated 31/5/2007, giving effect to the transfer to him. “When I attempted to obtain a certificate of lease over the suit property, my application was rejected on grounds there has been double allocation of the plot in question,” Munene told the court. He claimed to have been paying rent and rates charged on the property. Munene also said he has been enjoying quiet and peaceful occupation of the land and is apprehensive Kagure may transfer the property to unsuspecting third parties or cause it be encumbered. He filed the copies of the letter of allotment dated 15/12/1993, beacon certificate, the assignment and lease.
