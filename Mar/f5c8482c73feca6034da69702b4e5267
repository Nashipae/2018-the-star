A teacher yesterday narrated how a mortuary attendant lured children with Sh50 to have sex with a mentally retarded woman after having them watch pornography. Michael Mathenge of Lenana Primary, Nakuru, told the court the children confessed at school. “We interrogated them. They said they had been forced to have sex with a mentally retarded woman by Tom. They would be given Sh50 each,” he said. The children said they watched pornography at Tom’s house, Mathenge said. The accused, a father of five, was charged with 30 counts of child pornography and indecent acts on a child. He denied the charges. The case will be heard on April 14.
