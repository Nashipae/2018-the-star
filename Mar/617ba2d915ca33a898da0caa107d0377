US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will meet President Uhuru Kenyatta and government officials during his tour of Kenya from March 9 to 12. In a statement on Wednesday, the department said Tillerson will focus on continued support for Kenya's democratic process, the refugee issues and press freedom. The Secretary of State is preparing for a tour of Africa that will also see him travel to N’Djamena in Chad, Djibouti and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. He will end the visit on March 13 after meeting the leaders of these countries and those of the African Union Commission. Tillerson's goal is to further United States' partnerships with the governments and the people of Africa. The official has criticised China's economic engagement in Africa ahead of his first official visit to the continent. He said China has encouraged dependency, utilised corrupt deals and endangered the continent's natural resources, and announced a $533m (£380m) humanitarian African aid plan.
