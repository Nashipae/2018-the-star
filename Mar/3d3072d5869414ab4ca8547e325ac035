The national government will spend Sh1 billion to rebuild four of six dilapidated jetties in Lamu. They will be pulled down and reconstructed, Chief structural engineer in the Public Works department Hillary Nyaagna said on Tuesday. They are Mokowe Customs and Lamu Island Customs, Manda Airport — all in Lamu West — and Mtangawanda. The other two, in Lamu East, to be repaired or rebuilt later, are Kizuke and Jetty ya Ngo’ombe. Nyaanga said the jetties will be given a modern look and expanded to benefit more users. Renovation is not the answer, they need total reconstruction, he said. DEATHTRAPS Reconstruction of the Mokowe Customs Jetty will cost Sh400 million, while the Manda Airport Jetty will cost about Sh20 million — covering its expansion. The ministry also plans to renovate sea walls to stop ocean water from flowing into residential and public areas. “Apart from the jetties, we’ll also renovate the sea walls. Many dilapidated,” Nyaanga said. The six main entry points to Lamu and neighbouring islands are dilapidated and dangerous. Some have collapsed, others risk closure because of poor maintenance. Residents and travellers called for prompt reconstruction and described the gateways as deathtraps.Wooden boards have caved in and metal structures have corroded and collapsed. On Monday, Public Works ministry engineers arrived to assess the damage and the required reconstruction and repairs. They will table a report with funding requirements so money can be allocated. “We shall soon start rebuilding the Mokowe, Lamu, Manda and Mtangawanda jetties once the report is presented,” he said. Last week, boat operators in Lamu town closed a section of the Lamu Customs Jetty after it collapsed. Maintenance of jetties is the mandate of the Ministry of Transport and Public Works.
