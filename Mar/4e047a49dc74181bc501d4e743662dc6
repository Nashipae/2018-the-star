betrayal for choosing to work with President Uhuru Kenyatta. “I want to appeal to Ford Kenya and Amani National Congress leaders
Moses Wetangula and Musalia Mudavadi and others who have the interest of Kenyans
at heart to support Raila –Uhuru pact. I believe will in the long run, apart

co-principals who had accused Raila of betrayal have threatened to part ways
with ODM and form their own coalition because Raila has opted to work
with Jubilee party. The decision of ODM leader Raila Odinga to work with
President Uhuru Kenyatta was lauded by religious leaders across the country who

co-principals to bury their political differences and agree to support the two
