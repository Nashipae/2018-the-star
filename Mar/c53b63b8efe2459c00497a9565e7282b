The Kilifi health department has launched a 100-day Rapid Results Initiative to improve health services. The RRI is aimed at improving immunization services, family planning and staff skills, Health CEC Omar Anisa said. Anisa, a doctor, noted that due to last year’s industrial actions, immunizations reduced from 80 to 50 per cent and the rate of skilled deliveries from 65 to 40 per cent. “This is not a project. It is a results-based management tool that we will use to facilitate service delivery," the executive noted.

It is expected that 3,000 surgeries will be carried out, with a focus on cold cases including hernia and hydroceles, and that the costs will be waived. Other areas of interest - those that are not doing well - include reproductive maternal health, HIV/Aids, nutrition, pit latrine cover and fumigation. Anisa said a committee was formed to evaluate the results on a monthly basis and release a report on the tool's overall performance in June. The CEC said they were working with health sector partners such as Unicef and Aphia Plus to achieve the objectives.
