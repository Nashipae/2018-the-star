Uncontrolled logging of both exotic and indigenous trees is to blame for the acute water shortage in Kericho county, officials have said. This is the first time in 40 years Kericho has been hit by a water shortage. Kericho Water and Sanitation Company MD Joseph Terer (pictured) blamed the latest crisis on uncontrolled logging by Kenya Forest Service officers in Sambret and Kuresoi forests. KFS denies the accusation. The firm’s supply has dropped to 10 million litres a day, as opposed to 14 million it previously had, he said. Only five of 35 streams that feed Timbili River remain active. “Without considering environmental impact, foresters have been colluding with firewood and timber traders to indiscriminately destroy forests that sustain rains in the Mau West,” he said. He said Kericho town and its environs have been worst hit. Terer welcomed the 90-day logging ban.
