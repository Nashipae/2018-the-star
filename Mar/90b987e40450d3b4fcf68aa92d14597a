Fifty one Kiambu MCAs have signed a motion to impeach speaker Stephen Ndichu and Majority Anthony Ikonya, saying they lack confidence in the duo's leadership. The MCAs have accused the two assembly leaders of putting them at loggerheads with the electorate. The lawmakers are also angry with Ndichu after they missed to benefit from a medical for which an insurance company was paid Sh25 million. The speakers is yet to respond to their queries. "We are unable to access medical services because our cards have been suspended. Hospitals no longer accept the cards," a letter to Ndichu states. The impeachment motion is expected to be tabled in the assembly next week. MCAs who spoke to the Star on condition of anonymity said they could not reveal the sponsor of the motion for fear of being compromised. The county assembly service board led by Ndichu had proposed a Sh355 million budget for the construction of the speaker's residence, canteens and lounge. The proposal caused an uproar among residents. MCAs rejected the request. "Even after we rejected the proposal, the speaker told residents that it was MCAs who had made the proposal," an MCA said. On Friday, the ward representatives met in Naivasha to finalise the motion. Governor Ferdinand Waititu was also in Naivasha. Waititu was expected to convince the MCAs to drop the impeachment bid. Kiambu has 92 MCAs. Resident have accused the assembly of greed and selfishness. In 2014, MCAs impeached first Kiambu speaker Nick Ndichu for violating public procurement regulations, financial impropriety and use of derogatory language towards members and staff. On Friday, Senator Kimani Wamatangi warned against the impeachment bid, saying it will derail development.
