Uasin Gishu county has sacked 42 revenue officers over loss of funds during the election period last year. They are suspected to have diverted Sh5 million collected as parking fees. The 42 were suspended on December 11, but they have now been officially sacked after they failed to explain themselves before a disciplinary committee and failing to explain themselves clearly. County secretary Peter Lelei confirmed that the case was dealt with by the county Public Service Board. “The county does not in any way condone graft and those who get involved at any level have to pay for it,” he told the Star on the phone yesterday. The officers were suspended by Finance chief officer Peter Chesos. They are suspected to have given fake bank slips indicating they had deposited money collected, yet the cash was never banked. The theft is suspected to have taken place in July, August, September and October. “We suspect they took advantage of the election period to divert revenue,” Chesos said. He said so far they have established more than Sh5 million went missing. Governor Jackson Mandago on Wednesday said he would be more stringent in the war on corruption. He said he will sack executives and staff who attempt to sabotage his work through non-performance. Speaking at his office, Mandago said his wish is to leave a legacy of good work. He said the executives are vital in helping him to deliver on his promises. Mandago said the executives will be held responsible for any failures in their dockets. “This time everyone has to do their work, and if the county assembly recalls any of you because of non-performance, I will approve that,” Mandago said.
