Apart from being one of the most successful Tanzanians, Diamond Platnumz holds Kenya very dear to his heart. He exclusively revealed that he has been wishing he was born here. "Kenyans wananipenda sana. Wakati mwingine natamani ningekua nimezaliwa Kenya. Vitu tumefanya leo hapa Kenya, hamna kule Tanzania. Nawaambia wasanii wa Kenya kwamba wana vitu vizuri sana, wajitahidi kuvitumia vizuri. Mimi hapa nimetumia tu kama siku moja rehearse. I'm sure mimi ningekua nakaa Kenya kuna vitu vingi ningevifanya." He added: "Wasanii wengi kama Bahati, Willy Paul, Sauti Sol, Nyashinski wanafanya vitu vizuri sana. Wamebahatika, wavitumie." His dream of living here was made true by a property company after it awarded him land in Kenya. "I have land in Kenya now. I'm trying to see if I can build a proper branch for WCB Wasafi here." He thanked all Kenyan artistes who've been making things happen for him. "Nashukuru sana. Nawashukuru sana wasanii wa Kenya, industry nzima ya Kenya. Sikua nafanya pale kwa sababu mimi ni Diamond, ila kwa sababu sisi ni East Africa. Let's keep supporting each other. Let's take the East African music to the world." So, what are his secrets to success? "Working so hard. Pray hard, be more creative, be humble and respect everybody." His album, A Boy From Tandale, was launched mid this month, courtesy of Songa. "Kwenye album nimejaribu kuweka kitu ambacho hata nikifa kesho kibaki kwa miaka kumi ama ishirini ama milele."
