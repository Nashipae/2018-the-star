Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has clashed with his Agriculture executive who says fertiliser should be cheap but not free. Wangamati says it should be free to all poor farmers, especially because it will help secure his reelection. CEC member Mathews Chirasha on Wednesday said he had drafted a policy paper on scrapping free fertiliser. “I will not allow anyone to wipe out this programme of giving poor people fertiliser. That would mean you want to send me packing and yet I’m still too young to go home,” Wangamati said on Wednesday. He distributed free fertiliser at the Mabanga Farmers’ Training College. Chirasha said the paper awaits county assembly approval and then Wangamati’s assent. Wangamati told him to shelve the plan. If approved, every farmer would buy fertiliser at low prices, Chirasha said. “We want every person — whether rich or poor — to get fertiliser at the cheapest prices, not this idea of giving it to people free,” he said. Wangamati warned that he would not approve the plan, even if the assembly passed it. He told the executive to focus on measures adding value to his reelection bid in 2022. As many poor families as possible should get the free fertiliser and the county must do more to increase distribution, Wangamati said. “We are giving out 750 of 50kg bags to poor families. We should be looking for ways to increase the number so more can benefit,” he said. The county will also buy maize directly from farmers so brokers do not exploit them, the county chief said. “Our farmers are exploited by middlemen. We won’t allow it. They put farmers’ livelihoods on the line,” he said. The county plans to establish a kitty through which it will buy farmers’ produce, store it in NCPB depots and sell it to millers. Wangamati urged farmers to cooperate so they benefit more.
