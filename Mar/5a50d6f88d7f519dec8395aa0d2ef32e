City Hall employees have threatened to strike following threats by the Local Authorities Pension Trust to stop payments over a Sh13 billion debt owed by the county government. The Kenya County Government Workers’ Union on Friday said it will call for a strike if the county fails to clear the debt. “We have written to Governor Mike Sonko, but he is yet to respond,” KCGWU secretary general Roba Duba said. On Wednesday, Laptrust CEO Hosea Kiili said City Hall has not remitted the money since 2013, despite deductions from workers. Duba said they are considering moving to court to compel City Hall to clear the debt. The former Town Clerk said he had proposed a property swap to clear the debt. “The county has property that can be used to offset the debt,” Duba said. KCGWU branch secretary Boniface Waweru said they will announce their move next week. “We are going to engage the county next week before we give a way-forward,” Waweru said. Laptrust pays Sh50 million to 8,000 pensioners every month. Sixty per cent of the pensioners are City Hall retirees. Of the county’s more than 13,000 employees, 9,600 save with the scheme. Half of the debt has accrued from interest and penalties.
