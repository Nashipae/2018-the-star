US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson canceled scheduled events on Saturday on the second day of a visit to Kenya because "he is not feeling well", a State Department spokesman said. "The secretary is not feeling well after a long couple days working on major issues back home such as North Korea and has canceled his events for the day," spokesman Steve Goldstein said. Tillerson arrived in the county on Friday evening and was scheduled to lay a wreath at the site of the 1998 bombing of the US embassy in Nairobi, in which more than 200 people were killed. He was also to attend an event to highlight US health assistance in Africa, and meet NASA leader Raila Odinga as well. He held a meeting with President Uhuru Kenyatta and other government officials at State House soon after his arrival.

Tillerson, 65, is four days into his first diplomatic trip to Africa, where he has visited Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya, and is scheduled to go on to Nigeria and Chad. During the trip he has also been involved behind the scenes in discussions within the administration on a possible meeting between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. A US embassy official said Ambassador Bob Godec and Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki would attend events on Saturday morning. Click here for the latest political news
