Wrangles in the Homa Bay assembly took a new twist on Wednesday when Central Karachuonyo MCA Julius Gaya was denied access. Gaya is among MCAs considered rebels because of his constant criticism of the assembly’s management. Security guards denied Gaya access when he showed up at the gate at 2.30pm for proceedings. He remained at the gate for two hours and engaged the guards in a shouting match, which attracted youths who demanded Gaya be allowed in. “We’re breaking this gate if you don’t allow Gaya in. He was elected to come to the assembly, not stay outside,” one youth shouted. The assembly management sought help from police officers after youths turned rowdy. Speaking to journalists after recording a statement at Homa Bay police station, Gaya said the security guards were under the instruction of the assembly’s top leadership. ‘i won’t stop’ Gaya said he had not received any communication from the assembly barring him from the premises. “Standing orders are clear... This is illegal,” he said. Gaya said the assembly leadership was intimidating him because he has fought against corruption. “I will not stop exposing wrongdoing in this assembly because its’s part of my oversight role,” he said. His colleagues Eliphalet Osuri (Ruma Kakasingri) Okuku Miregi (Rusinga) and Joan Ogada (Kojwach) accused speaker Elizabeth Ayoo of causing the chaos. Osuri said Ayoo has exposed the assembly to dictatorship. “The speaker should know what they are perpetrating is undermining our dignity as MCAs. She should stop this mess,” he said. Miregi described the fracas as a violation of human rights. “We wonder what is ailing our county assembly. It’s a violation of the rights of the people who elected Gaya,” he said. Ogada accused the assembly leadership of targeting MCAs with differing opinions. “It is wrong to target those who have dissenting opinions,” he said.
