Brooklyn-based creative and musician KAMAU is expected to jet into the country for his first ever performance in Africa to be held this weekend, March 17.  His seemingly perpetual artistic nature will be witnessed at this year's first edition of the Thrift Social installation, Kenya's biggest street style exhibition curated by sibling duo 2ManySiblings (comprising of Velma Rossa and Oliver Asike).  The "MÄ­NT" hitmaker, who brags of being a skillful singer, rapper and producer, is expected to headline and add to the excitement of the installation with his exquisite fusion of cultural and musical influences.  The exhibit that will be held at the Alchemist Bar in Westlands, Nairobi is going to see partygoers gather and stay true to the edition's color blocking theme.  KAMAU is expected to rip through a colorful set with his prominent vocals and rare quirkiness, exhibiting his originality and inventiveness through exceptional musical evolution. His non-conformist sense of style will also be a sight to behold.  Brother KAMAU prides himself of exceptional projects like his 2016 EP A Gorgeous Fortune and his 2017 TheKAMAU-CASSETTE: Å­RTH GÅLD and music enthusiasts alongside revelers will get a rare opportunity to see the creator perform live.
