Starting out as a producer for some big names in the Nigerian music industry, Nigerian artiste Omo Akin saw it wasn’t enough and opted to produce his own music. He is known for his song, Sisi Maria. In an interview with Word Is, he talked about the song. "'Sisi Maria' was basically describing my ideal woman, because you know every man has their own liking in their perfect woman. She is beautiful, peaceful — and that is what the song is all about. "I have worked with Harmonize and it was so nice. He came to Nigeria and because my song was doing well in East Africa, we decided to do a remix. I am also working with Khaligraph Jones and Sauti Sol, and we promise to deliver good music. I like my songs to sound good." Well, Omo Akin thinks Kenyan music is doing well compared to the past. He said: "Some of the Kenyan music is going out now. It's gradual and I think Kenyans should continue supporting their artistes. Kenyan music is much better than it was two years ago. Whatever you are doing, do your best. For me, I like perfect stuff."
