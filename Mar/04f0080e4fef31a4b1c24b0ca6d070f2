The Vice Chancellor's Committee of Public Universities has joined calls for striking lecturers to return to work and allow more time for consultation and negotiations.

"...considering the fact that universities are yet to recover from the set back of recent industrial actions, we are deeply concerned about these developments." The lecturers have accused the VCs committee of frustrating their efforts to strike a deal with the government.
