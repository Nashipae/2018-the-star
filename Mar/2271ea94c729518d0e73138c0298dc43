Carl “Flash” Tundo navigated by Tim Jessop in a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X won the 66th edition of the Safari Rally in the Great Rift Valley region to equal Shekhar Mehta’s record of five wins. Mehta, one of the greatest Safari drivers won the event in 1973, 79, 80, 81 and 82 during the World Rally Championship days while Tundo won it in 2004 in Mombasa, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2018, under the African Rally Championship (ARC) banner. Tundo has achieved all the five wins with Jessop on his navigator’s seat. The three times former Kenya champions (Tundo and Jessop) achieved the feat in bravado after leading the second round from start to finish. Flash, as is he fondly referred to, displayed awesome skills on flash floods to rack up the most coveted racing crown in the country. He clocked 1:55.05 hours to beat Baldev Singh Chager of Kabras Sugar Racing to second as three-time Ugandan champion Jas Mangat seals the podium dash. Chager and Mangat moved up on the leader board after the second Skoda Fabia R5 of Onkar Rai and Gareth Dawe was involved in an accident. Both Onkar and Gareth were airlifted to Nairobi for specialised treatment although the latter was reportedly unconscious after their Skoda nose dived on the last section. “It hasn’t sunk in yet. We are happy with the victory but we really sorry about Onkar’s accident,” said Tundo. Tanzania’s Randeep Singh also savored his career best Safari finish after returning his Evolution X machine in fourth overall place. “It was such a though rally and we are happy to be back in one piece,” said Randeep. Kenya’s duo of Eric Bengi and Tuta Mionki also registered their career best finish in Safari. “Due to the flash floods, we took it really easy and pushed where we could. But quite a shame that Onkar had to exit with an accident. We wish him and his navigator quite recovery,” said Bengi, who is the 2016 KNRC 2WD champion. Farhaaz Khan of Kenya settled for sixth place. “Yesterday (Saturday) was good day for us. We had an incident in CS 6 where we were victims of stone throwing. Luckily we managed to make it to service and finished the day in 8th overall.” Duncan Mubiru of Uganda was happy with seventh place while Kenya’s Mahesh Halai placed eighth.
