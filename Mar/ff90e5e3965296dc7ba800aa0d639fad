The Kwale branch of the Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya wants NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri to give residents lands with expired leases. Chairperson Sheikh Khamis Banda yesterday told journalists that elected leaders have contributed to land injustices at the Coast. Banda said many Kwale locals have suffered land injustices and many live as squatters. He also accused Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori of failing to solve land tussles in Mwereni and Vidziyani, where locals risk being evicted. “We are wondering what plans Dori has for Mwereni and Vidziyani. We want to know how locals can get back what is rightfully theirs,” he said . At the weekend, when Dori accompanied DP William Ruto to Msambweni, he said he has constantly been undermined by some politicians.
