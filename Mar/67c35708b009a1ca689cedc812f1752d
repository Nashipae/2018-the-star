Koilel High School board of management has withdrawn a
suit against the then Education CS Fred Matiang'i and the Knec board for
withholding its KCSE class of 2017 results. The school board, through lawyer Bernard Kipkoech, told
Justice Roselyn Korir the parties had settled the issue out of court. "We were coming up for highlighting of submissions
but I was instructed by my client to withdraw the person after they had spoken
outside court," Kipkoech said.
