Two fishermen from Ndeda Island in Bondo subcounty are feared dead
after their boat capsized in Lake Victoria yesterday morning. Collins Onyango and Marcus Opiyo were on their normal
fishing expedition when their boat was hit by strong winds and it capsized. The duo tried to swim and stay afloat, but the tides and winds were too strong. Ndeda Island Beach Management Unit chairman Joseph Obara
confirmed the ill-fated incident. He said that a
search for the two has started. Separately in Rarieda subcounty, residents of Ndori trading centre found the body of a 32â€“year-old man dangling
on the roof of his house. North Ramba assistant chief Maurice Omondi said the deceased, Simon
Awich, is said to have spent the night with his girlfriend until yesterday morning when he told her that he was tired of taking HIV drugs. The girlfriend left for work only to find him two hour later hanging with a bed sheet round his neck.
