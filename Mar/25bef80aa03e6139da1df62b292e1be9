The national government should save the country from the food and water deficiency by imposing a total ban on charcoal burning and logging. Chairperson of the Kitui West Leaders’ Forum Empowerment Organisation Charles Mutunga said the threat of the country becoming a desert is real. He was speaking to the media on Saturday at Stodesa Hotel in Kitui West after he was re-elected unopposed. Mutunga said the state should address wanton destruction of forests to avert a disaster in waiting, he said. “Our organisation is concerned that rains have dwindled, water sources and rivers have dried up and famine has become a common occurrence in most parts of the nation. It is time the national government stamped it authority and banned charcoal production and logging in total,” Mutunga said. He said the lobby supports reafforestation programmes in Mutonguni, Kwasiku and Muthale in Kitui and backs Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu’s charcoal trade ban.
