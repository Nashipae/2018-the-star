Government officers have been warned against aiding production, sale and consumption of illicit liquor in Nyanza. Nyanza regional commissioner Moffat Kangi said these officers will be punished because illicit liquor is harmful to the public’s health and safety. “Officers found violating our set ground rules will be dealt with accordingly,” he said on Wednesday. Kangi said a team comprising security, public health, Nacada and the Kenya Bureau of Standards officers has been mandated to conduct swoops to weed out illicit substances. Kangi said they will visit all liquor selling points and bars and arrest those selling illegal alcohol. He said the crackdown aims at restoring safety in the manner illicit brews are consumed. The commissioner said this war on illicit brews will be sustained and continuous. Anyone trying to derail the campaign will be punished, he said.
