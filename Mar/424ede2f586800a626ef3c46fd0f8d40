At least 124 MPs had by Wednesday signed a motion for the impeachment of Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki. The Constitution requires at least a third of the 349 members of the National Assembly to append their signatures to meet the threshold. "We are progressing well and members from across the political divide have signed the petition," Wajir woman rep Fatuma Gedi told the Star. "It will be the first matter the House will deal with when we resume sittings." The MPs, in the petition, want the CS held liable for "abuse of office and cross violation of rules and regulations". The proponents of the impeachment motion want the minister punished following the treatment errors at the Kenyatta National Hospital. Last week on Friday, Sicily announced that KNH boss Lily Koros had been sent on compulsory leave. This followed the incident where doctors at the hospital performed a brain surgery on a wrong patient. Koros and an officer in charge of clinical affairs were sent home to pave way for investigations.

Committee chairman Sabina Chege, accompanied by over 12 members, called on the MPs to give her committee a chance to investigate the matter before resorting to impeaching the CS. She addressed a press conference on the sidelines of the post-election seminar which ended She said the committee will invite the CS, Koros, the doctor who performed the surgery, and the board among others to shed light on what transpired. "We should not be quick to judge, let us allow investigations to take place after a week we will write a report and table it in Parliament." "Colleagues should, therefore, give us a chance to investigate the matter," Chege said. Also read: Health staff upset by grand office for CS Click here for the latest political news
