A court has directed all parties in the KRA boss John Njiraini case to file their submissions by April 6. It also allowed activist Okiya Omtatah to amend the case in which he wants the court to determine if the KRA should be allowed to extend Njiraini’s term, given that the government policy — Mwongozo — bars such a move. He wants the court to declare that Njiraini is ineligible to serve for a third term. Employment and Labour Relations Court Judge Nelson Abuodha gave the directions after the two parties failed to agree on how to proceed. “We’ll highlight them [submissions] since the matter is dragging. We need to finish it,” he said. In January, Abuodha declined to grant the interim orders sought by and instead said he would issue the final verdict in the main case, adding that he had powers to order the KRA to recover any money paid to Njiraini should he find that he stayed in office irregularly. Mwongozo provides that the tenure of chief executive officers be a three-year term or as otherwise provided under any other written law and renewable only once, subject to a performance evaluation.
