The Uasin Gishu government has ordered the closure of the Eldoret wholesale market after hawkers clashed with county askaris causing 25 people to be injured a week ago. The closure has rendered more than 2,000 traders jobless and residents will find it difficult to access fresh farm produce. Stalls outside the markets were burned down during the riots. Trade chief officer Simeon Cheplel ordered the closure saying the market does not meet the required health standards. He said the county has designated other market for use in the meantime.
