Baringo MCAs clashed over removal of Senator Gideon Moi’s liaison office from the assembly in Kabarnet town on Thursday. Jubilee reps led by Bartabwa MCA Reuben Chepsongol said Gideon’s office was dormant and illegally placed in the assembly building. “The house committee chairs lack space for offices , we are giving the senator three days to pack his things and leave,” he said. Chepsongol said the state allocates  senators a budget to rent their offices. We don’t understand he has been doing with the money since  2013. However, Kanu MCAs protested against their colleagues, saying they were sent by the Deputy President William Ruto to hit on the senator politcally. They will not succeed in their plans, if anything then they should go back to the people for signatures to impeach the senator. Using media sideshows is wrong,” said Churo-Amaya MCA Ameja Zelemoi.  He said the assembly building does not belong to any political party.  Click here for the latest political news
