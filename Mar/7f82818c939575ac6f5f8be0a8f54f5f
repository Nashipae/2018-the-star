A Bungoma businessman has urged Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula to ditch the opposition and join Jubilee. Joseph Waswa said it is clear the Ford Kenya boss is not needed in NASA following attempts by ODM senators to oust him as the Leader of Minority. Waswa was addressing parents, teachers and pupils of Tongaren constituency on Saturday at a fundsdrive  in aid of Machaka Primary School. Wetang’ula should swallow his pride and join hands with Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka and CS Devolution Eugene Wamalwa, he said.
