Kiss 100 presenter Adelle Onyango is still making it to new heights. Last year, she was nominated to represent Kenya, where she was hosting the Children’s Global Media Summit 2017. This major step came after she was listed among BBC’s 100 Inspirational and Innovative Women 2017. 2018 has started on a good note again, as she has been nominated to be among the 100 women on OkayAfrica. This is a leading digital destination connecting a global audience to African culture, introducing the second annual OkayAfrica100 Women Campaign to jumpstart Women’s History Month. The interactive campaign celebrates extraordinary women from Africa and the diaspora making waves across a wide array of industries, while driving positive impact in their communities and the world at large. Adelle has been so inspiring for many years now with her voice, thus being nominated in the media category. The OkayAfrica 100 Women List spans 10 distinct categories: STEM; literature, TV and film, sports and wellness, style and beauty, media, music, business and economics, politics and activism, and art. Each of the honorees are selected based on achievement, impact and influence within their industries and communities within the last year. The prestigious list is unveiled by way of video docuseries, a collection of inspiring written profiles, an interactive social media campaign, and a range of on-the-ground activation throughout the month. OkayAfrica continues to speak directly to Africa’s consumer base of one billion people, with cutting edge cultural stories and curated experiences, while connecting international audiences to the best of what the continent and its diaspora has to offer. Among others nominated are Anyiko Owoko.
