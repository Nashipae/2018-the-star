City Hall has collected Sh5,634,100 in fines paid by impounded boda bodas since the operation started in January. Director of operations Peter
Mbaya said the ban is still in force and that riders who violate the law will be fined. "The number of arrested boda boda riders has decreased from 800 to 290 when the arrests started two weeks ago." A spot check by the Star on Wednesday revealed that a number of boda boda riders are still very
operating within the city centre. Some of them said they cannot remain at home because of a ban which did not fully reveal the designated areas of operation. The riders said they are operating
in fear of being arrested but some noted they have to earn a living "I have been operating in the CBD for almost two years now and I have a family to
take care of. If I stop my day to day business, what will my family feed
from?" Joe Gitagama said. Emmanuel Wahinga said:Â "This is my
only means of survival. At the moment, the demand for our services is very high since people want to get home or to work faster to avoid the rains." Read: Sonko asks court to dismiss Jaguar's boda boda ban case Click here for the latest local political news
