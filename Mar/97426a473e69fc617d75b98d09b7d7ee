A woman died after she was struck by lightning in her house at Sofia estate in Voi, Taita Taveta county on Friday. The 66 year-old was digging a trench near her house during a heavy downpour when she was struck. Area police boss Fredric Ochieng said the woman fell unconscious and was rushed to Moi referral hospital where she later died.
