A 56-year-old woman and a seven-year-old boy yesterday drowned in Ilenye River at Ithumbi in Mwingi Central constituency. The tragedy followed another two weeks ago, in which a man drowned in River Tyaa in the same subcounty following heavy rains. The body of Mwinzi Matike, 40, was found in Kyethani. He was on his way home at about 9pm when he drowned. Yesterday, the woman drowned as she attempted to cross the river from Ithumbi market. The boy was also crossing from Ithumbi Primary School when he was swept away. Mwingi police boss John Nyamu said police had taken the bodies to Mwingi Hospital Mortuary. “Don’t cross flooded rivers. There is no need to endanger your lives,” Nyamu told residents. Click here for the latest political news
