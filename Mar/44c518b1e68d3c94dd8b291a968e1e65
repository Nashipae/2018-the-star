Delayed disbursement of funds to the counties has virtually paralysed their operations. Staff, suppliers and other operations dependent on cashflow from Treasury, have to bear the brunt of this chronic failure. Doing business with the counties nowadays is a risky affair because of routine delay in payments, resulting in bankruptcy suits and social conflicts. This is counterproductive as, in the long run, it means government tax revenue will continue to fall for lack of economic activity. Indeed, low revenue collection is cited as one of the reasons for the national government’s current cash crisis. But funding the counties is a constitutional obligation. It is the national government’s responsibility to ensure that the counties get the mandatory 15 per cent of the Budget — timely. It is absurd that as the year glides into the fourth quarter, counties have received less than 50 per cent of their equitable share for this financial year. Considering that on average over 60 percent of this money is consumed by recurrent, not development, expenditure, it is obvious what kind of strain this malaise has placed on county government operations. Unfortunately, it is the governors who have to face the wrath of the public for no mistake of their own. To address this injustice, the national government must henceforth prioritise the disbursement of county funds and sort out its own mess.
