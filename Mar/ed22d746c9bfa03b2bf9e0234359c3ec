St. Marys Yala edged Maseno to retain the rugby 15’s title after winning the coin toss in a tough final during the Nyanza Secondary Schools Term 1A ball games.
The two sides had drawn 10-10 after extra time.
During extra time, Maseno School’s Walter Omango and Billy Okwaro scored three kicks each while Ronnie Nalo and Fidens Tony also scored three kicks each, forcing officials to resort to a coin toss to decide the game.
In regular time, Elvis Kadima gave Maseno the lead with Walter Onsomu converting while Edwin Oyoo crossed the white wash for Yala.  Fidens Tony converted to equalise as the team went into the breather tied at 7-7. No team was able to score in the second half, forcing them into extra time. Walter Omanyo gave Maseno the lead in extra time but it was short-lived as Oyoo again scored a penalty to equalise for Yala. The game was played at a neutral Maliera secondary for fear of fan trouble at Yala. In the preliminaries, Maseno had beaten Yala 27-3.
“It was a very close and tight game. At the end of the day, we won it on a coin toss. We are now going back to intensive training ahead of the nationals at Kangaru School in Embu,” said Yala coach Ken Mukok. In the third place play off, Ambira defeated Agoro Sare 9-5. In basketball, Ambira High School coached by Paul Mboya, rallied from behind to beat arch-rivals Agoro Sare 53-47 to win their second regional title. Agoro, supported by their principal James Momanyi, led 25-21 at half time. However, Ambira won the third quarter 17-12 before sealing the fourth quarter 15-10.
“In 2014, we exited in the group stage but to us, it was an achievement. However, this year, we want to go further and my target is  to reach the finals. Our head of technical bench John Ogilo also played a key role,” said Mboya.
Agoro Sare’s coach Paul Odock was gracious in defeat. “We live to fight another day. We congratulate Ambira for winning the title. It was a close game which would have gone either way,” added Odock.
In the girls’ category, on fire Barchando Girls beat Siaya County rivals Ngiya Girls 61-33 to clinch the regional title. A closely contested first half saw Ngiya out-score Barchando 23-21.

In the boys’ category, Kisumu Day narrowly edged arch-rivals Kisumu Boys 1-0,  thanks to Emmanuel Juma strike in the second half.
Mogonga and St Peter’s Keberesi secondary schools dominated track and field events.
The two schools enabled Kisii County to lift the overall athletics title with 370 points ahead of neighbours Nyamira (145 points) and hosts Siaya (132).
Mogonga, which is also an athletics training camp, will be represented by 17 athletes at the nationals while Keberesi has nine. Mogonga, coached by Principal Haron Onchong’a, are targeting at least 10 gold medals at the nationals.
I have a very good team. I don’t want to talk about Mary Moraa because her exploits on the track speak for her. I have other upcoming athletes like Francis Leshoo and Loice Moraa, who is in Form 2,” said OnchongÃ¡. Moraa won the women’s 800m race and was also in the team which won both the 4x100m and 4x400m relays. Leshoo won 800m and anchored his team to winning the 4x400m relay.
