Nakuru All Stars coach James Angila is confident he will lift his side from the bottom of the National Super League log despite the current poor run. The former Kenya Premier League side has lost all their seven matches in the league so far, shipping in 15 goals and scoring only twice. “You can’t write us off yet. We have only played seven matches and it’s still early to write a team off. We are working on getting our campaign back on track,” said Angila. His team succumbed to a 1-0 defeat against Kisumu All Stars on Sunday at Moi Stadium in Kisumu. He added: “This team is capable of being a serious contender for promotion despite the bad start.” In Sunday’s match, on form Gerishon Arabe grabbed the lone goal in the 45th minute of the game to help the debutants record their fourth win in the league. Kisumu All Stars, who are bankrolled by the Kisumu County Government, are fourth on the log with 14 points same as log leaders Bidco United, second-placed Western Stima and third-placed Kibera Black Stars. Kisumu’s coach Nick Aketch said: “As I told you at the start of the season, we are targeting promotion to the Kenya Premier League. We are on the right track.” “This was a tough game and I’m happy with the slim win. It’s the points that matter and we are comfortable with the three points,” added the former Kisumu Posta striker.
