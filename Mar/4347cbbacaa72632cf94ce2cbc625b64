The Bungoma government has suspended the long-serving principal of Mabanga Farmers’ Training College in a crackdown on corruption. Agriculture and Livestock executive Matthews Chirasha suspended Margaret Kogo to pave way for investigations into graft allegations. "I have taken the unprecedented decision to institute administrative and management changes at Mabanga FTC. Madam Margaret Kogo has been sent on compulsory terminal leave with immediate effect," Chirasha said. The executive said in her absence, her deputy, Wycliffe Soita, will take over in acting capacity. The process to sort out the management and administrative questions that have persisted for the past 11 years commences. "Things are not good here, and we want to do the inventory on everything. Corruption is slowly eating up this institution, but we want to raise the institution’s status again," he said. Chirasha said the principal could not account for Sh16 million since 2015, and that she has been supplying chickens to the institution, which is a conflict of interest. Chirasha accused the principal of turning the training institution sitting on 98 acres into a hotel facility for holding meetings. "She can’t account for money received from the selling of maize and bananas, and no explanation was given," Chirasa said. The executive said the county will start distributing fertiliser to resource the poor farmers starting from tomorrow. He said they had finalised procuring free fertiliser to be distributed to 750 vulnerable families in each of the 45 wards. "After the launch today, we will distribute the fertiliser to the wards, where almost 33,000 families will benefit during this planting season," Chirasha said. The college trains farmers on best farming practices. Click here for the latest political news
