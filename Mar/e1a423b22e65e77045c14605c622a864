Kisumu residents have raised the alarm over increasing killings in the lakeside city. Kisumu City Residents’ Voice chairman Audi Ogada yesterday said the trend is terrifying. He wants security officers to crack down on criminals, as insecurity frightens investors. He said more than three people have been murdered in two months. Ogada said a driver was abducted and killed in Muhoroni last week and a boda boda rider hacked to death in Manyatta Koyango. Another person was killed in Kibos, he said. Ogada said some Nyalenda and Kanyakwar residents were attacked and robbed. “In Nyalenda, during the opening of a certain pub, over 10 people were attacked and robbed for hours without police help, even though they had informed the officers of the event,” he said.
