One of the musicians behind the infamous 'Ikamba' song was charged on Monday with three counts of ethnic contempt. John Gichiri denied the charges before Milimani Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi, over the song that authorities say was aimed at stirring hatred between the Kamba and Kikuyu. The court heard that lines in the Kikuyu song translate to: "Be cursed, mangoes are getting finished. It's a matter of time before you start eating termites. Be cursed, it's a matter of time before you start eating birds. "Kamba land is a place of starvation. We stop buying charcoal you die. "[If] you want to see a Kamba just go where there are tyres. Hard jobs are theirs." The musician was bonded by the National Cohesion and Integration Commission ahead of today’s arraignment. Officials at the commission said they were ready to charge him as they hunt for his co-accused. Last week, NCIC chairperson Francis ole Kaparo said the matter was being investigated by the commission and the DCI. The song is said to be offensive and distasteful and to castigate Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu, who imposed a ban on trade in charcoal to conserve the environment.
