The Kisumu county government has allocated a Sh100 million revolving fund for small traders. Planning executive Richard Ogendo said the money will be loaned to traders to expand their businesses. The fund is part of a wider scheme by the county government to improve small traders businesses. “We want to make county residents self reliant. This we can only achieve through financial support to those in business,” he said. Ogendo was with his Energy counterpart Alice Moraa. He said the loan is given to traders at an interest rate of three per cent to be repaid in a year. He spoke on Thursday when he issued Sh5.8 million to 69 traders from Kisumu. Traders who did not receive money will be considered in the next disbursement. Ogendo told the beneficiaries to invest the money wisely to enable them repay.
