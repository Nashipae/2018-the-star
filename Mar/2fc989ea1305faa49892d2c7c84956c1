The translation of US protectionist rhetoric into trade restrictive actions, when WTO’s neo-liberal practice compels less powerful countries to comply with the agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures, is a code red. TRIMs will primarily benefit a small number of large transnational corporations, who roam around the globe holding host governments at ransom. It limits the development space of developing countries, especially in foreign direct investments. It bans performance requirements related to local content, trade balancing and export requirements. It also bans requirement on public agencies to procure from local suppliers. As has been demonstrated by various scholars, including Robert Wade, TRIMS are designed to expand the options of developed country TNCs to enter and exit host markets, more easily, with fewer restrictions and obligations. This is why developed countries can violate these regulations with immunity. Take the recent case in the US, where President Donald Trump signed an order for special tariffs at 25 per cent on American imports of steel, and 10 per cent for aluminium by invoking the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which permits them to act against imports that appear to endanger their national security. WTO rules permit member states to take trade defensive action in the event of threat to national security. So, if WTO is satisfied with the explanation that steel imports endanger US national security, he US will get away with this action. However, in the case of aluminium, Trump has simply imposed a blanket 10 per cent duty. This is not permissible under WTO rules. To date, WTO has not responded in anger as expected. In his book, Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism, Ha-Joon Chang demonstrates FDIs should be regulated and monitored closely so that the developing host countries can benefit from technology transfer, local content development and a boost in exports. Chang cautions: “When a country has an open capital market, FDIs can be made liquid and shipped out rather quickly.” In addition, a foreign subsidiary can use its assets to borrow from domestic banks, change the money into foreign currency and send the money out. He also points out another drawback of FDIs — “transfer pricing” , the practice where subsidiaries of a transnational corporation are “overcharging each or undercharging each other so that profits are highest in those subsidiaries operating in countries with the lowest corporate tax rates.” A case of innovative transfer financing and creative accounting is the ongoing saga in South Korea between General Motors and the Korean government over the recapitalisation of GM’s subsidiary, GM Korea. Last month, GM announced it will close one of the four plants in Korea in May, and unless the government injects more capital, it will close all the plants and exit. GM wants $1 billion from the government to recapitalise GM Korea. In addition, it wants its Korea subsidiary sites designated as special foreign investment zones to make GM Korea eligible for tax breaks for seven years. GM claims to have made an accumulated loss of $2.63 billion between 2014-17 due to high Korean labour costs —which have increased by more than 50 per cent since 2010 — and GM Korea’s workers’ low productivity. It takes about three hours longer to build a car in Korean facilities than in the US. There are also frequent workers’ strikes. On the other hand, Korea Development Bank, which owns 17 per cent of GM Korea, complains of GM’s opaque management, which includes unfair financial support under the cover of services rendered, GM operating as a loan shark by providing loans to GM Korea at an interest way above market rates, and GM supplying components at unfairly high prices, while purchasing assembled cars at lower prices. In this altercation, KDB is right. GM lent GM Korea U$ 2.79 billion at an interest rate of between 4.8 per cent and 5.3 per cent, while the market rate is about 3 per cent. Sangyong Motors, a smaller automobile operation borrows at 3.5 per cent, while Hyundai Motors borrows between 1.49 per cent and 2.26 per cent. We can understand why President Trump is trying to induce FDIs towards the US. It is not doing so well in attracting FDIs. According to UNCTAD’s Investment Trends Monitor released in January, FDI flows to North America, dropped from $494 billion to $330 billion, a decline of 33 per cent. â€‹Cross-border mergers and acquisitions dropped from $372 billion to $295 billion, a decline of 21 per cent. The major factor behind the overall FDIs inflow decline in the US is because of the sharply reduced inflows from a number of offshore financial centers. Since WTO is not able to reign in on the US and other developed nations, developing states’ governments need to cooperate to push for their agenda. Their negotiators should now question the legitimacy of the neo-liberal orthodoxy, which argues that market access is the main key to development.
