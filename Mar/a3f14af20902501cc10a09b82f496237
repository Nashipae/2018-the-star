STARRING: Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, Storm Reid, Zach Galifianakis, Chris Pine BASED ON: A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L’Engle DIRECTED BY: Ava DuVernay RELEASE DATE: March 9  It’s not often Oprah comes out of her book club and on to the big screen. And when she does, we’ve got to pay attention. I mean… it’s Oprah! Oprah was casted as Mrs Which in the adaptation of Madeleine L’Engle’s 1962 coming-of-age novel, A Wrinkle in Time. The story centres around a young girl called Meg Murry, who is disturbed by the disappearance of her father, a scientist called Dr Alex Murry. Dr Murry was obsessed with wanting to touch the stars and creating a wrinkle in time to be able to do so. But his experiments led to his disappearance. Meg is approached by three astral travellers, Mrs Which, Mrs Whatsit and Mrs Who, who tell her that her father has been captured by the darkness, the IT, in the evil planet Camazotz. Meg, her brother Charlie and her friend Calvin travel through the wrinkle with help from the three astral travellers. In Camazotz, Meg has to be brave to help free her father and later her brother, who is processed by the IT. The story has been deemed unfilm-able over the years due to its very fantastical scenery and complex imaginative actions. The director, Ava DuVernay, therefore relied heavily on CGI to complete the film. And whilst the star-packed cast were re-enacting a classical tale, somehow, they fell short in their execution. The film wasn’t at all as wonderous as it should have been. But the film does have something special. And that is focusing on Meg Murry’s story and special adventure, which was captured perfectly by the young and talented Storm Reid. All in all, the film is not great but it can pass as a film for parents to take their children to see on a Saturday.   Star Rating: 2/5
