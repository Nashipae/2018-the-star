Homa Bay MCAs who recorded statements on Friday with police over alleged life threats want the EACC to speed up investigation of corruption. Speaking to the Star on Sunday, the lawmakers said they have been branded rebels because of fighting what they called “high corruption” in the assembly. They are Juma Awuor (Homa Bay Town East), Julius Nyambok (Homa Bay Central), Joan Ogada (Kojwach), Okuku Miregi (Rusinga) and Eliphalet Osuri (Ruma Kaksingri). They said their oversight role starts with the assembly and they will not relent until there is “sanity” in the use of public resources. Early last month, the EACC summoned some MCAs and speaker Elizabeth Ayoo to explain persistent squabbles in the assembly. Central Karachuonyo MCA Julius Gaya said the agency interrogated them but no steps have been taken. “Let the agency release the results of investigation for the sake of residents,” Gaya said. The five MCAs recorded a statement with police last Friday after they said they received life-threatening texts. Awuor, Nyambok and Osuri recorded statements at Homa Bay Police Station, while Ogada and Miregi did so at Oyugis Police Station. They claimed they are targeted because of their stand on utilisation of funds in the assembly by top leadership. “You must pay with your blood for disrespecting the leadership of this assembly,” the quoted one text message as saying. They called on police to arrest those behind the messages since they feel their lives are under a threat. Osuri said the threats should not be taken lightly and expressed concern that the county assembly had a history of eliminating noncompliant MCAs. “We were elected to represent interests of our people and we will continue to do so regardless of circumstances,” Osuri said.
