Diamond Platnumz sister Esma has been making headlines for what fans say is favouring her brother's ex-girlfriend Wema Sepetu over Zarina Hassan. Esma told Word Is she and Wema have been friends for a long time now. "I don't favour any of them. I understand that Wema is my brother's ex, and that doesn't mean that I stop talking to her." She added:Â "Zari knows that Wema and I were friends even before she came into the picture. I love both of them. Their relationships with my brother does not affect me at all. On the other hand, by breaking up with Diamond doesn't mean I don't talk to Zari. Her kids are my kids, she is family." Esma is one of the renowned businesswomen in Tanzania, who has been designing most of the vitenges Diamond wears on stage "Nauza kitenge. Nina wateja wengi sana hapa Kenya. Nimemtengenezea Diamond nguo nyingi ambazo wakati mwingine anavaa akiwa kwenye stage." Esma said this during the launch of Diamond's album, A Boy From Tandale, which took place last week in Nairobi. You can get his album on Songa by Safaricom.
