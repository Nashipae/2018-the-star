Motorists have expressed concern over the state of the Mai Mahiu-Narok road after a section was cut off again in a span of 24 hours. Seventy passengers in a bus headed to Nairobi escaped death narrowly after the section caved in as it was passing yesterday. Transport was paralysed for three hours. Later, engineers from the Chinese Communications Construction Company and Kenha moved in to repair the road then transport resumed. Witness James Karani said heavy rains pounding the area had continued to wreak havoc on the road with the fault lines increasing. He said the bus from Western got stuck after a section of the road caved in. “The passengers were rescued after quick action by a lorry that towed the buses to safety before the section of the road collapsed,” Karani said.
