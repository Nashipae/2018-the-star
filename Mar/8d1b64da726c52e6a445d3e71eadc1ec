The Law Society of Kenya wants the government to allow Miguna Miguna into the country and treat him  with decency. In a statement on Tuesday, the lawyer's body said the government has no lawful reason to hold Miguna at the JKIA airport. Chairman Allen Waiyaki said the Opposition politician should be allowed to use his Canadian passport to re-enter Kenya. "The court order had two limbs that allowed Miguna’s travel back to the country. If the first limb failed, then he was allowed to use his Canadian passport." The self-declared National Resistance Movement General landed at JKIA on Tuesday after he was dramatically deported to Canada on  February 6. However, he was denied entry into the country after he refused to apply for a visa that grants him legal stay in Kenya.

The lawyers body maintained that it is lawful for a dual citizen holding a Kenyan and foreign passport to be entitled to use any of the passports for entry into or exit from Kenya. Noting that Miguna was not exempted from normal immigration procedure either by Justice Mwita,  LSK said it shall not hesitate to demand for any appropriate action on any state officers who may be found to have wilfully failed to facilitate the compliance with the court order. The embattled lawyer got a reprieve on Tuesday after the court held that he be released unconditionally. Justice Roselyne Aburili ruled that the immigration department allows Miguna, who is still detained at JKIA, to go home.
