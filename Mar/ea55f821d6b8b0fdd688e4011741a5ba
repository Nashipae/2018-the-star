Low budget allocation and dependency on donor funding have been blamed for the country’s failure to achieve 100 per cent water access. Water CS Simon Chelugui is calling on the government to increase the budget from the current Sh40 billion to Sh100 billion. Chelugui said water access in the country stands at 60 per cent, having risen from 30 per cent three years ago. He added that the government is committed to lifting the figure to 100 per cent. “If the current trend continues we shall achieve 80 per cent coverage by 2020 and universal access coverage by 2030,” he said. The CS said low funding hurts the rising demand for water and sanitation services. “With the rising population, the ministry requires Sh100 billion annually so that we can increase water coverage.” Chelugui spoke at the Simba Lodge in Naivasha during the launch of the Kenya Water Summit, which was attended by governors. The CS faulted water companies yet to pay donor loans. Click here for the latest political news
