Police in Kisumu have arrested a nurse for allegedly stealing a newborn. Kisumu police boss Chris Mutune told the Star on Sunday that the nurse who works at Avenue Hospital was being interrogated. He said they were tipped off by a member of the public and the nurse was arrested at the facility on Friday night. He said the infant was taken to the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital. "We are investigating the matter and if it's true then the law will take its cause. We will not hesitate to charge her," Mutune said. The incident comes just a month after a baby was stolen from the Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi. The baby was later found in Kawangware. A resident called the police after noticing her neighbour who had had a miscarriage had a newborn at her house.
