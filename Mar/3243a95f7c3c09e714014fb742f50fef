Giant gaming company SportPesa on Saturday gave 20 teams playing in the Koth Biro tournament an assortment of football kits as part of its grassroot football development project, Kits For Africa. Kits for Africa is an initiative of SportPesa and its international partners – Hull City, Everton and Southampton. The project aims to distribute football kits donated by communities allied to the three clubs for distribution to grassroot teams in Africa. "Koth Biro has a rich history having been a launch pad for so many professional footballers in this country. We are therefore happy to present them with these kits from our partners as a show of support to the great contribution that this tournament makes to our country’s football development," SportPesa’s football development manager Patrick Naggi said. The teams that received the kits are: Lebanon FC, Young Achievers, Rongai Youth, Shauri Moyo Sportiff, MASA, Eastleigh North, Shofco, Pellico, Mwiki fc, Githurai All Stars, Team Umeme, Ziwani Combined, Mamba, Headquarter, Country bus, Flats Tornadoes, South B All Stars, Piuretto, South C, Kamukunji Falcons. Koth Biro CEO Robert Ocholla urged the teams to capitalise on the SportPesa goodwill to nurture more footballers to help Kenya realise the dream of participating in the World Cup someday. The latest kit handover comes a week after a similar distribution in Nyeri County in which six teams benefitted. The six included two women’s football clubs. Click here for the latest political news
