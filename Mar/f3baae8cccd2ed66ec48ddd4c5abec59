Diamond’s sister Queen Darleen believes her brother is
still with his baby mama, Zarina Hassan. Talking to a Tanzanian-based
radio presenter, Lil Ommy, the sister says she was shocked after Zari posted
the black rose. “Nilishtuka na nikahisi kama utani. Sikutaka kuuliza kwa sababu
lingeniumiza. Kwa mind yangu najua kwamba bado wako wote. Kama wameachana kama
hawajaachana sitaki kujua lakini nachojua wapo wote.” That explains why Zari and Diamond have both not deleted photos of each
other off their social media. Zari announced the split on Valentine’s Day,
citing his incessant infidelity. This comes days before the launch of Diamond’s
album, A Boy From Tandale.
