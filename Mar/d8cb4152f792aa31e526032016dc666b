Neglect of Northeastern by successive regimes has seen the region lag behind in development because of dilapidated roads and infrastructure. Movement of goods and services is hampered, unlike in many parts of the country. In the Northeastern tarmacked roads end in Garissa county. But in recent years, things are changing. Major roads are being tarmacked and residents are optimistic the region will soon catch up with the rest of the county. The fruits of devolution are being seen. Mandera and Wajir towns are giving their urban roads a facelift. The national government is tarmacking major roads with aim of connecting Garissa, Wajir and Mandera. In 2012, the 20km Modika - Nuno road, which is part of the Garissa - Wajir highway was tarmacked, marking the start o major infrastructural development. Kenya National Highway Authority assistant director for corporate communication Charles Njogu told the Star on the phone on Friday tarmacking of the 134km Nuno - Modogashe road was launched in 2016. Forty per cent of the work is complete. The project is jointly funded by the Kuwait Fund and the government for Sh7.2 billion. A Chinese company is constructing the road. However, Njogu said community issued delayed the project that was to be completed late this year. Abdi Farah, who operates a fleet of trucks between Garissa and Mandera, said once the road is compelete, the cost of doing business will go down.His trucks break down frequently. Duksia Kassim, who runs a restuarant, said PSVs have been avoiding the area and business was affected. Speaking recently in Garissa, Garissa Township MP Aden Duale said the tarmacked roads are a legacy of President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s regime.
