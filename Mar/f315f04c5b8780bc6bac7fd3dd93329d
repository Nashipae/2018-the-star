Former Ebru TV presenter Doreen Gatwiri has been
driving around Nairobi streets with her Range Rover Vogue, beating
some Kenyan men at their own game. Well, she has a new bae. I’m talking about her new Range Rover Vogue that is rated to be worth Sh16.5 million. A close source to the former screen siren can confirm that she is about to sell her Range Rover Vogue. “Doreen just bought this car and she is selling the RR Sport. That’s all I can tell you for now,” the source said Gatwiri has been enjoying a posh lifestyle, and many thought it would end after she and her husband, Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi, fell out. But days after she reported that the politician had assaulted her, she flew
all the way to Italy probably to meditate and rid herself of the
negativity of the situation.
