Kenya Veterinary Association Western branch on Friday took the anti-rabies campaign to Mayenje trading centre in Busia county. Dogs and cats were vaccinated. Secretary Kennedy Owuor said the drive was to educate dog and cat owners on the importance of vaccination. “Rabies is a big threat to the lives of Kenyans, but some dog owners don’t know the risks of keeping a dog which has not been vaccinated,” he said. Busia and Vihiga counties lead in rabies cases in Western. Few victims of dog bites know how to manage wounds and they can end up getting viruses.
