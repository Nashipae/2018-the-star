A man in Embu has been arrested for allegedly murdering his uncle's eight-months-old baby. Erick Njiru,27, is alleged to have turned his anger on the infant after suspecting that its father tried to bewitch him. The suspect is being held at Runyenjes Police station. "The suspect stabbed Lukas Nyaga’s 8-month-old baby boy Fedelis Muthomi with a pen knife at Gatitu village in Embu East Sub-county at 7pm on Friday night,' police said. Embu East OCPD Njoroge Mbugua said the suspect visited Nyaga's home on the fateful day and found the baby sleeping in the bed as his father watched over him. He said an argument ensued before the suspect grabbed the baby and started running away with him as his father pursued. Mbugua said Njiru immediately produced a pen-knife from his pocket and stabbed the baby in the head and escaped. The OCPD said Nyaga and other family members rushed the infant to Kyieni Mission Hospital where he died as he received treatment. Kyieni East location’s chief John Kareko said the suspect will be arranged on Monday.  Click here for the latest political news
