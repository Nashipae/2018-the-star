Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua has promised to support the widow of former Kitui West MP Francis Nyenze (pictured), Edith Vethi, to inherit the seat after he died on December 6 last year. “I am the senior most elected member of Wiper in Kitui. The party has asked me to push hard to ensure Edith wins the March 26 by-election,” Wambua said at a fundraiser at Kauwi AIC. Edith was present. He said Edith, his sister, is capable of delivering services if she wins. “Being my sister is a non-issue since in her own right she has the history of being a performer,” the Kitui senator said.
