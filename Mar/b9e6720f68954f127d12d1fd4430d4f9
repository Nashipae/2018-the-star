Indigenous mangoes are rotting in Kitui for lack of markets.Consumers prefer jucier mangoes with less fibre. Farmers in Mutonguni and Muthale areas of Kitui West and Kwa Siku and Muthamo in Mwingi West are counting huge losses. Farms are littered with rotten mangoes. County deputy director for Agriculture Francis Kitoo yesterday urged farmers to graft their mangoes with exotic varieties to improve marketability. “They have no market, despite bountiful harvests. Fruits have a lot of fibre, so, making juice is more difficult,” he said. Titus Nyanzu from Mutonguni said he has lost Sh300,000. “There are dealers, but people with processing plants are not interested in our mangoes,” he said. Joseph Mbiti from Kwa Siku said he is likely to lose Sh200,000.
