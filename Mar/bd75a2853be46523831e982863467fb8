A Safaricom agent was charged in a Nairobi court yesterday with conspiring to register a mobile phone line in the name of Murang’a Woman MP Sabina Chege. Catherine Nyaboke appeared before Milimani senior principal magistrate Martha Mutuku and denied the counts of allowing falsification of a register, obtaining registration by false pretences and fraudulently making a false document. She was granted Sh200,000 bond or Sh100,000 cash bail, pending the hearing on April 26. The prosecution said that on March 3 at Update Shop in Donholm, Nairobi, Nyaboke, jointly with others not before the court and being a Safaricom agent, knowingly and fraudulently permitted the registration of Safaricom mobile number O727008230 in the name of Sabina Wanjiru Chege to one Waziri Benson Masubo with intent to defraud. Two weeks ago, two Multimedia University students were charged with attempting to obtain money from politicians by false pretences. Derick Ng’etich and Edwin Warukira appeared before Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi and denied fraudulently attempting to obtain Sh100,000 from former Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo, purporting to have been sent by Chege. They allegedly committed the offence on March 8 at Golden Spot Restaurant, Nairobi. The two were arrested after several politicians raised the alarm and lodged complaints with the police after receiving love messages. Police say the accused were part of a syndicate that defrauds politicians by sending obscene photos and demanding money.  From last year, some women politicians have been receiving love messages from one Honourable Benson Masubo Chacha, who pretended to be Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru’s personal assistant. Most of them ignored the messages. The incidents went unreported until some politicians started discussing the issue on their social media sites.
