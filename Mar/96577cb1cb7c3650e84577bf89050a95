Egypt has sought Kenya’s support for the chairmanship of the African Union after Rwandan President Paul Kagame’s term ends next year. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi called for President Uhuru Kenyatta’s support to secure the top position in a special message delivered at State House in Nairobi on Tuesday. The goodwill message was delivered by Egypt’s Foreign Affairs Minister Sameh Shoukry who is El-Sisi’s special envoy. The term of Kagame, who took over from Guinea’s President Alpha Conde in January, will end in 2019.

When El-Sisi made a state visit to Kenya in February last year, he and Uhuru agreed to fast-track bilateral agreements as part of efforts to strengthen their economic ties. Through the Kenya-Egypt Joint Commission for Corporation, which is currently in its seventh cycle, the two countries have laid down a series of strategic interventions to boost trade ties. These include expanding their deals to include players drawn from both governments. The two leaders met again in May last year at Cairo International Airport when the plane carrying Uhuru to the United Kingdom, for the 3rd London Conference on Somalia, made a refueling stop-over. At the Cairo meeting, the Presidents reviewed progress in implementing measures in fighting terrorism, security cooperation and expanding Kenyan exports - especially tea and flowers - to Egypt. Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua and Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma attended today’s meeting. Click here for the latest political news
