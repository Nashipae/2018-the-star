Three men have been arrested in Bungoma after they were found conning desperate youths yearning to join the Kenya Defence Force. The men including two brothers were arrested on Thursday after being tracked by CID officers following a tip-off from the public. They were nabbed in a popular hotel in Webuye by plain clothe officers.
