A petition seeking to have Boda boda riders allowed to operate with the Nairobi CBD has been dismissed. High Court Judge Roseline Aburili yesterday accused politicians of misusing the boda boda riders for political gains. The petition was filed by Starehe MP Charles Njagua. Aburili said a similar petition was dismissed in 2016. “The same person of
interest cannot be left to oscillate around the courts in different colours of
rights where today they sue as a sacco, tomorrow as a welfare association and
a day as an MP trying to protect his interest,” Aburili said. Aburili said politicians were misusing the riders. She asked Governor Mike Sonko to ensure the law barring Boda boda riders from the Cnetral Business District is fully enforced to restore the city's lost glory. The judge said City Hall had abdicated its mandate and failed to enforce the law, leaving the city to “rot in filth”. She was of the view that
the conduct of both the county and Jaguar “is to mutilate the rule of law”. “They must not pawn the riders for political
gains. They must not create any legitimate expectations in the minds of the
riders that they will not enforce the law after the election,” Aburili said. The judge said the City Hall was not a toothless dog and must act within the legal parameters to enforce the law. City Hall's case with the Boda boda riders began in 2015 after former Governor Evans Kidero banned them from carrying passengers to and from the CBD in line with provisions of the Traffic Act 2014. In February 2016, 12 Boda Boda saccos sued the county but the case was dismissed by Justice Joseph Onguto. Jaguar went to court in
January contesting a similar ban imposed by Sonko. In her ruling, Aburili said the MP did not
show how the riders' rights were violated when they were ordered out of the
CBD. “The application however well intended is
unfortunately an abuse of court process,” Aburili said.
