Kenyatta National Hospital has suspended the admission rights of a Neurosurgery Registrar and issued him with a show-cause letter for apparently performing brain surgery a wrong patient. KNH CEO Lily Koros said on Thursday that they took action following the incident, in line with the hospital's procedures. "The hospital deeply regrets this event and has done all it can to ensure the safety and well-being of the patient in question. We are happy to inform the public that the patient is in recovery and progressing well," Koros said. She added that the hospital also interdicted a ward nurse, a theatre receiving nurse and an anaesthetist for roles they could have played in the mishap. According to the hospital's procedures, such an incident requires the suspension or interdiction of involved medical staff. They are also issued with show-cause letters to explain what happened within seven days. This is followed by the convening of a Medical Advisory Committee, chaired by the Director of Clinical Services, to hear all sides and make a determination. The procedure also requires the hospital to forward the determination to respective regulatory bodies for further action if warranted. In this case, the regulatory bodies concerned are the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board and the Nursing Council of Kenya for the registrar and nurses respectively. Koros said: "The seven-day show-cause period comes to an end on March 2, 2018, after which the Clinical Services Director will immediately convene the Medical Advisory Committee to deal with the issue." She added that the hospital will advise the public on actions taken once investigations are completed. "The public should rest assured that the hospital’s management will ensure the hospital continues to adhere to the highest standards of healthcare and professionalism that have made it the jewel of healthcare in East and Central Africa," Koros said.
