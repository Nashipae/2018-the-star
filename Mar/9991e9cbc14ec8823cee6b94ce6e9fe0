Bongo singer Diamond Platnumz unveiled his new album, 'A Boy From Tandale', powered by Songa with Safaricom, in Nairobi last night at the Kenya National Theatre. He played host to American singer Omarion at the launch, saying, "Nimemwalika Omarion kutoka America tukiintroduce nyimbo ambazo tumefanya collabo na yeye." “This 18-track album is a tribute to my humble beginnings in Tandale, which is a slum in Tanzania. It is where I was raised, with a lot of challenges, but also where I formed my closest bonds with family and friends, who to this day remain my support system. It is the place where amidst all the poverty, I discovered my talent,” Diamond Platnumz said. The singer addressed the move by the Tanzanian government to ban his songs and the impact that has had on him and his music. "It’s too harsh a punishment to artistes and doesn’t empower us," Diamond said. "Well nafikiri si wanasema ni nyimbo ambazo zinazowekwa kwanzia saa tatu, kwenda mbele, zinaruhusiwa kuchezwa kwa radio na TV. Kuna age limit. Lakini wakasema... Sijui ni kwa nini wameziban kabisa, kwa sababu sikuletewa barua, na kisheria inatakikana walete barua." How has he been affected so far since the letter banning the songs was made public on February 28? "Unapoban nyimbo kama zangu mimi Diamond, kwanza unatia umaskini yani unapunguza revenue katika income ya kuingia, katika taifa. Na kitu kingine, serikali kuna kitu haijajua bado. Lazima serikali zetu zielewe kwamba industry inakuwa. Unajua zamani serikali ilikuwa inacomplain kwa kuwa movie zetu fake sana, watu waki kiss wanasema ni fake sana. Ina maana ili tufanye vitu ziko real, lazima vitu zingine tukubaliene nazo. Na sisi tuko kati kukuza market nje. Ukichukua mtu kama Rick Ross, hawawezi chukua yako nawe ukatae yao."
