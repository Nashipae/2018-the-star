Operations have resumed at the Likoni crossing channel after two days of disruption that led to congestion, a stampede and confusion. The services were disrupted after the withdrawal of ferries MV Jambo and MV Nyayo over mechanical problems. Motorists and commuters were forced to wait hours to cross. Last Thursday and Saturday, two separate stampedes were reported at the channel after commuters became impatient and forced their way into a ferry. This happened after MV Jambo was withdrawn due to a damaged clutch. Police officers were called to control the crowd. On Monday morning, the situation at the channel became worse after the withdrawal of MV Nyayo whose engine became faulty.

He added: “As for now, the flow is good and there is no more waiting and overcrowding. We regret yesterday's inconveniences." Gowa said they have also ordered new clutches and other spare parts for MV Jambo from Turkey. It was constructed there and brought into the country last year. “Mishandling led to damage of MV Jmabo's clutch. We have, however, already brought the spares and other accessories from Turkey. We are working to make sure it is also restored." Mombasa County Commissioner Evans Achoki said they reviewed last week's two incidents and resolved to increase the number of security guards and police at the channel to ensure order. “We have seen a new trend of commuters becoming impatient," he said. He asked them to patient and noted the importance of personal security. Click here for the latest political news
