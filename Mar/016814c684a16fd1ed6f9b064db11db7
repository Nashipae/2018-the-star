Rayvanny is always flaunting expensive items on his social media pages, leaving us with a million and one questions on what exactly we are doing wrong. If it's not expensive jewellery, it's expensive clothes and shoes. Well, the 'Makulusa' hitmaker has yet again taken to social media to flaunt his brand new Sh82,000Â Rhyton Gucci sneakers. Yes, you read that right. This shoe is worth someone's rent eight months straight, assuming your rent is 10k a month and 2k as pocket change. Some stars who have been spotted rocking this shoe are Wizkid, Migos' Offset and Quavo. This kid is clearly ballin' and we haven't seen the last of it. This is just a tip of the iceberg.
