Human Rights lawyer Maina Kiai has castigated opposition chief Raila Odinga for the secret deal with President Uhuru Kenyatta.He warned that his political support is in jeopardy.Kiai said Raila is lending credibility and legitimacy to an “illegitimate Kenyatta” for “nothing but vague promises”.In a confidential email to Raila seen by the Star, Kiai told off the ODM leader for meeting Uhuru “in secrecy and in total opaqueness”, sparking what he claimed was confusion in his political base. New dawn: Uhuru and Raila resolve to work together to heal KenyaThe former Kenya National Commission of Human Rights chairman said there are consequences for the meeting which he claimed “Uhuru was clearly the superior in status and bearing”.“I feel it is necessary to write to you on this matter. Kindly bear with me, even if you may not agree with me.”In the email done immediately after the Harambe House handshake on March 9, Kiai warned Raila that Miguna Miguna’s opposition to the deal is being well received.“The base is restless and uncertain and I don’t think they are too patient. And it seems your team, from NASA especially, is in the dark. You need to assure us all that this is not about you and that means including more people than you have already,”Kiai wrote.The communication has lifted the lid on the misgivings of the truce as it emerged Raila was under pressure to denounce his pact with Uhuru.

We cant have the same as Judge Krieglar did and prolong our misery and suspicions.”Kiai said the US is running the show in Kenya and regretted that Raila allowed them to prevail.
