Teachers have threatened to
boycott supervising and marking the KCSE exam if their dues from last year are not cleared. Kisumu Kuppet executive secretary Zablon Awange on Monday said Knec owes teachers Sh1.5 billion, which was budgeted for and allocated before the exam began. “We shall boycott
this year's supervision and marking exercise and demand that in future KNEC
pays contracted officials before the exams start,” he told the Star on the phone. He gave Knec five days to pay up.
