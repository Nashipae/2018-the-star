It was a case of a bridge too to close yet too far as the Kenya Prisons’ crushed out of the African women’s Club Championship after succumbing 1-3 (15-25, 25-22, 23-25, 25-21) to defending champions Carthage of Tunisia in the semi-final match at the Ahly Hall in Cairo, Egypt. Following the result, Prisons’ will now wait to play whoever loses between their local nemesis Kenya Pipeline and hosts Al Ahly for the third place play-off. Pipeline and Ahly were scheduled to play last evening in another quarter-final match. Prisons’ technical bench stuck with the same squad that won their quarter-final match against Rwanda Revenue Authority on Monday. In the first set, Carthage took an early 6-1 lead before extending it to 8-3 at the first technical time out as they capitalised on poor reception from theKenyans. The North Africans extended the lead, thanks to their good service, bagging points at will to lead 11-6,15-9 and 16-11 at the 2nd TTO. The East Africans picked points here and there but it was not enough as the champions extended the lead 21-14 en-route bagging the set 25-15. In the second set, the Kenyans took the lead 4-2 and 6-3 before extending the lead 8-6 at the 1st TTO. Prisons then faltered to allow the North Africans to close gap before tying the game at 12-12. Prisons’ coach David Lung’aho then rested Lorine Chebet for Shyrine Jepkemboi and the move paid off as Prisons opened a three-point lead (16-13) at the 2nd TTO. Edith Wisa and Evelyne Makuto were impressive as Prisons earned points to lead 20-18, forcing Carthage to call for a time out. The move by Carthage did little to stop Prisons as they extended lead 23-21, 24-22 before sealing the set 25-22 to level the sets at 1-1. In the third set, Prison trailed 3-7 as Makuto was rested for Sharon Chepchumba. The fortunes did not, however, change as the wardresses trailed 6-8 at the end of the first TTO and 12-16 at the second. Carthage extended the lead 20-18 but it was Chepchumba who excelled as Prisons closed gap 20-21 before tying the match 22-22. Carthage had the final laugh with 25-23 to take a 2-1 set lead. The fourth set, Prisons led for a long spell with the scores at 8-6 at the TTO. However, Carthage changed the story with the scores at 16-15 and never looked back. They took the scores 20-18, 23-19 and 25-21.
