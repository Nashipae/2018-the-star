Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu has told deputy county commissioners, chiefs and their assistants to keep off the operation to control sale of alcohol. He said that is a function of the county government. Waititu spoke on Monday in Gatundu Stadium, where he supervised the election of members of a board formed to vet bar licence applicants. During the event, Waititu only allowed new deputy county commissioner Miricho Maina to wave to the crowd, but he did not let him give an address. Maina was appearing before residents for the first time. He was posted to the area last week to replace Stephen Kihara. Launching the crackdown on illicit liquor last week in Makwa, Gatundu North, Interior CS Fred Matiang’i asked Waititu to work with administrators. Hesaid Kiambu has a history of distilling illicit liquor. Matiang’i said Kiambu is the only county with more bars than all primary and secondary schools put together.
