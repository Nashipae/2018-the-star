Troubles at the Likoni Ferry channel worsened following the withdrawal of another ferry on Monday. Mv Nyayo was withdrawn after a technical hitch. The newly-launched MV Jambo was withdrawn from the channel last week under similar circumstances. Kenya Ferry Services MD Bakari Gowa said they are fixing MV Jambo's mechanical issues. The ferry, launched six months ago, can carry 1,500 passengers and 150 vehicles. "Mv Jambo has minor technical problems but we are working to ensure normalcy returns at the channel," Bakari said. Mv Nyayo has been in service for almost 20 years. Its old age is to blame for its frequent breakdown leading to massive delays at the channel. Click here for latest political news
