Big cats are declining at an alarming rate and could soon be extinct should decisive measures not be taken, Tourism and Wildlife CS Najib Balala has said. He said the big cats are facing increased threats. With a 40 per cent decline in lion population in 20 years and cheetah population reducing from 100,000 in the 1900s to 7,100 in 2015, the government and conservationists have developed a species-specific strategy to conserve and manage the big cats. The CS on Friday said species recovery, tools for population monitoring and creating public awareness ae some of the strategies that can save the big cat population. World Wildlife Day was marked on Saturday, under the theme Big Cats: Predators Under Threat. There are 2,000 lions in Kenya listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
