Three St Mary's Hospital staff yesterday were charged with stealing Sh13 million theatre and lab equipment. They however did not take a plea as a fourth accused was not in court. Lawyer Ester Mwangi said Seth Manera was not served with the
appearance notice by the police. "...he knew his colleagues were to be charged but he didn't know he was
among them," she said. The theft allegedly took place during the forcible entry into the hospital by police and
nuns following a court order removing the initial
management headed by American priest Dr William Fryda. They were arrested early in the month and given Sh30,000 police bail. The accused are Manera, Peter Lemayan, Peter Kibet
and Patrick Njenga. Senior principal magistrate Liz Gicheha adjourned the hearing to April 3. Related: Priest opened secret accounts to channel funds meant for hospital, nun tells court  Click here for the latest political news
