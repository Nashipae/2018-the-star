The Nyeri government has purchased 3.8 tonnes of bean seeds worth Sh900,000 to farmers to plant during the rainy season. Speaking outside the governor's office, Agriculture executive Henry Kinyua yesterday said the Wairimu dwarf bean variety will be distributed to farmers in all 22 wards. "In collaboration with the national government, another 10 tonnes of KAT
X56 is expected to be delivered. This is one of the main cheaply
available protein source for the rural people," he said. The county's average yield is between six and eight bags of beans per hectare, but with good husbandry this can rise to 15 bags.
