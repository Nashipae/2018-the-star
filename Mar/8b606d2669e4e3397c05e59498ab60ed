Nema arrested one person and confiscated speakers from clubs causing noise pollution. Nairobi county director of Environment Njoki Mukiri led the Thursday night operation. She said Nema has continued to receive complaints against clubs which play loud music. “We have been receiving noise complaints from neighbours and we came here a week ago and served them with a notice to stop the use of sound-amplifying equipment so the noise pollution can be contained, but they did not comply,” Mukiri said. She spoke at Ridgeways Inn on Kiambu road. Nema officials confiscated sound equipment. Mukiri said the owners are likely to be prosecuted as it is not the first time the club has flouted rules on noise pollution. She said all clubs have to be made soundproof. Mukiri said Nema has had several meetings with club officials. licence “We want to bring sanity as right now we have a lot of complaints from people who are not sleeping,” Mukiri said. The officials, Mukiri said, has also had several meetings with complainants but nothing seems to be working. Mukiri warned clubs they must comply with the law or risk being closed down. At The Switch club in Kasarani, owner Moses Magua was arrested and is being held at Lang’ata police station. Mukiri said most club owners rush to seek court orders. “We will take him to court on Wednesday after authenticating if the orders are genuine,” she said. The environment management and coordination regulations on noise and excessive vibration pollution require those who want to instal sound equipment to get a licence from Nema.
