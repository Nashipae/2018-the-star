Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy says allegations he received campaign funding from late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi are making his life "hell". "I am accused without any physical evidence," Mr Sarkozy told magistrates as he was placed under investigation, Le Figaro newspaper reports. He is being investigated for illicit election campaign financing in 2007, misappropriation of Libyan public funds and passive corruption. Sarkozy, 63, has denied wrongdoing. The centre-right politician, who was released on Wednesday following two days of questioning, says his Libyan accusers are seeking vengeance for his decision to deploy French warplanes during the uprising which overthrew Gaddafi in 2011. One of Sarkozy's former ministers and a close ally, Brice Hortefeux, was also reportedly questioned by police on Tuesday. On Thursday, Le Figaro published what it said was the full court statement made by Mr Sarkozy to French investigators (in French). In it, he says that he is aware the allegations against him are "serious", but that they amount to "slander" and have had made his life "hell" since 11 March 2011, when the claims were first made by Gaddafi. "I have never sought to evade my obligations in my dealings with my friends, colleagues and all the people mentioned in these proceedings," Sarkozy said, adding: "I have never sought to influence their statements or judgments."
