There will be no extension of leases for multinational tea plantations in Nandi county when the 99 years stipulated expire. At a highly charged meeting in which The Second Nandi Declaration 2018 was adopted, Governor Stephen Sang said there is no turning back. He said his government is formulating a law to ensure the plantations are returned back to the county. COUNTY CORPORATION Sang said a county corporation will be established to ensure the people can access the resources. He spoke at the Nandi Hills Bears Club. The committee of six land legal experts will collect evidence and views from surviving victims of land injustices across the county, especially in Nandi Hills, Tinderet and Aldai. The evidence will be used to seek compensation from colonial and post-colonial governments together with individuals who perpetrated the forcible takeover of land from the Nandi people. Sang said his county government is committed to providing justice. The first Nandi Declaration was adopted in 1969 by Tinderet MP Jean-Marie Seronei. He sought to have all races given equal opportunities. The new 12-point declaration seeks to have Nandi people compensated and plantations given back to the county as a trustee. NO FORCE The British colonial government forcibly removed the Nandi community from its rich agricultural ancestral land to less productive areas. Sang said the county overnment will not go the same route and reclaim the land forcibly. “We are prepared to go to international, African and East African courts of justice to ensure what belongs to us is returned and we are compensated,” he said. The county’s seven MPs and Senator Samson Cherargei skipped the declaration ceremony. Sang said most of the leases are almost expiring. He warned companies not to get irregular extensions.
