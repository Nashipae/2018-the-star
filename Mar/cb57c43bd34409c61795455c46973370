For yet another time, Kenyan Premier League champions Gor Mahia will have a chance to write their name in books of history when they host English Championship side Hull City in a SportPesa-sponsored friendly match on May 13. Gor tackled a Wayne Rooney-led Everton in July last year in Tanzania where they fell 2-1 and they will be seeking their first ever victory over an English side. The two clubs enjoy shirt sponsorship from the betting firm. Gor Mahia head coach Dylan Kerr, said: “It is a good match for us as a club and we welcome Hull to Kenya. We played Everton last year and it was a good experience us and we are hoping to get the best this time.” “It shows that we are growing to international standards and I am happy the management secured such a friendly. The match is good for our side as we seek to defend our KPL title and make progress in the Caf Confederations Cup,” added Kerr. Kerr also cautioned his players not to squander their home advantage when they tackle South African side SuperSport in the Caf Confederations Cup. Gor were tossed out of the prestigious Champions League by Esperance where Kerr was left ruing the wasted chances they created at home. “SuperSport is a big club. They reached last year’s final and we are aware of the threat they pose. This is a team I have known for a while,” said Kerr. “I was playing and coaching in South Africa and we ought to take the match as a final. We have to take our chances especially at home before heading out for the return leg.”
