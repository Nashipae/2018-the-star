A section of Embu lawmakers are demanding immediate reinstatement of former Kenya forests director Emilio Mugo. Mugo was suspended on Monday over the ongoing destruction of forests. The leaders led by Embu senator Njeru Ndwiga termed the action by environment CS Keriako Tobiko a "public dress down of government officials without the due process".

Of concern is the issuance of directives to staff through the press,” the leaders said in a joint statement. The lawmakers said they do not support wrongdoing and incompetence but stressed the need to follow due process and avoid witch-hunting. “The Kenya Forest Service is currently led by one of the gallant sons of Embu, one Emilio Mugo. To us, the speed and manner in which the whole issue is being pushed is totally unethical,” Ndwiga said. Nyeri women representative Sabina Chege asked the CS not to misuse his office barely two weeks after taking over the docket. “Do not embarrass the president; work closely with those you find in various offices. You must allow these officials to do their work,” she said. The elected leaders, however, commended the government for the moratorium on timber harvesting.
