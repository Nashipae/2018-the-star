Singer Willy Paul is finally looking for a wife material lass, one that is ready to give him over five kids. Let’s just say, he is looking for his own version of Zarina Hassan. Posting on social media, Willy started by saying he is ‘clean’, insinuating that he does not father any child out of wedlock. “Clean for you my people… please tag a good, God-fearing wife that will give me a yes I do and later 5 babies!! Bila #MALINGO.” He then shared a photo while at his Saldido recording studios that has pictures of Diamond, Wizkid and Chris Brown on the wall. The singer is set to release a remix to his Pili Pili song with WCB’s Harmonize.
