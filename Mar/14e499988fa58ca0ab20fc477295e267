Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga has asked the national government not to starve counties by delaying funds. Rasanga said the delaying in disbursing funds to counties has become a norm, despite crippling county operations. Addressing journalists in his office yesterday, Rasanga said out of the possible Sh5.5 billion funds earmarked for Siaya in 2017-18, only Sh1.7 billion has been disbursed. “The 2017-18 financial year is almost over but the National Treasury still owes us Sh3.6 billion, derailing county development,” the governor said. Rasanga said the delay in disbursement of funds has forced counties to deal with numerous workers’ strikes. The governor said county heads are forced to suspend some development projects due to lack of funds. Contractors are also on governors’ necks demanding payment of debts that have accumulated from the previous financial years. Rasanga said for residents to enjoy the fruits of devolution, the national government must ensure timely remittance of funds going forward. Rasanga said in light of moving forward in terms of development, the county is developing austerity measures that will see budget cuts and reduced expenditures in nonessential services.
