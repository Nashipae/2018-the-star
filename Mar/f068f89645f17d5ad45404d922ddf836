The rate of inflation dropped to 4.18 per cent in March from 4.46 per cent recorded in February, representing a 6.1 percentage drop from March last year. Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Thursday, however, indicated that prices for food and non-alcoholic drinks as well as housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels increased. "Food and non-alcoholic drinksâ€™ index increased by 1.54 per cent mainly due to increase in prices of some food stuffs which over-weighed decreases recorded in respect to others," director general Zachary Mwangi said. Among the food stuffs that recorded price increases in March are onions (13.62%), sukuma wiki (5.72%), Irish potatoes (3.11%), and tomatoes (2.36%). Others are mangoes (2.79%), cabbages (1.61%) and sugar (0.13%). However, maize grain (-0.39%), maize flour (-0.41%), wheat flour (-1.09) and fresh milk (-0.51%) recorded price decreases by the margins shown. Price increases on housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels was mainly due to the increase in the prices of cooking fuels. "Notably, charcoal recorded the highest price increase at 27.1 per cent compared to other fuels," Mwangi said. The high margin can be attributed to the recent ban on charcoal trade in Kitui County, one of the largest charcoal producing zones, and the 90-day ban on logging. Of all the commodity groups, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels recorded the highest annual price hikes since March last year at 8.98 per cent. Communication and food and recreation and culture had the lowest annual increases at 0.81 and 1.43 per cent respectively. Mwangi attributed the price hikes on electricity to a rise in fuel cost adjustment charges per kilowatt of consumption. He said transport index decreased by 0.06 per cent due to a reduction in fuel prices where the cost of petrol decreased by -0.42 per cent between February and March. LPG gas went up by 0.88 per cent, diesel (0.92%) and kerosene (0.90%). According to the data, 50kwh of electricity went up by 7.14 per cent compared to February while 200kwh went up by 4.79 per cent over the same period. Rent per single room increased by 0.16 per cent over the period to represent a 4.86 per cent increase over the past one year. The survey was conducted in the second and third weeks of March across selected retail outlets in 25 data collection zones in Nairobi and 13 other urban centres.
