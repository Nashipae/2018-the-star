Lydia Ndwiga is one of the top voice coaches in town. The singer has worked with hundreds of celebrities, including Sauti Sol, Bahati and Nyashinski. "I've worked with Wahu, Elani," she said. "I worked with Sauti Sol for their launch of Live And Die In Africa. I trained Bahati, I also worked with Nyashinski just before he did the Malaika song. I'm sure you can hear the difference between his voice before Malaika and after. I've worked with Mbuvi and many more." The CEO of Dynasty Music says her calling is to get celebrities having the right technique when it comes to their music, and especially their live performances. "I basically teach you how to sing with the right technique. I tell artistes they can sing well but most of them use their vocals in the wrong way, and in a few years, they don't sound as good as they used to sound. I try and get people's voice to the correct tone. Sometimes people are too loud or too soft. I try to make them have a constant tone so the audience listening to you can have an amazing experience." So, what does it take to be a celebrity voice coach? "The first thing you need to do is be an expert. I do research on the most famous vocal coaches. I search what other international celebrity coaches like Celine Dion's do. I realised people depend on information. There is no way I can be training people and I have no experience. I need to be on top of my game." Lydia is currently ruling the airwaves with the song Monday to Monday. "I was on my way to pick a matatu. I was on my way to work and I was tired. I told God, how about you bless me with a car, a big house. I knew Monday is a day that brings in the blue but God doesn't change. God is enough."
