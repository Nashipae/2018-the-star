Traders in Moyale are counting losses because of frequent power outages in the town. Many businesspeople are forced to sell their merchandise outside their stalls because of darkness, while others have resorted to hawking. Operators of cyber cafes in the busy town are turning away customers due to blackouts. “I have been idling around. It is frustrating to keep asking customers to come back because there is no power. We have not done any work for  a week,” one trader said. His sentiments were echoed by Hussein Borbor, who said people  who own butcheries, chemists and barbershops are most affected since some use fridges. They appeal to their leaders and the county government to address the issue with urgency to spare them further losses. Residents have been depending on power supply from neighbouring Ethiopia. They appealed to Kenya Power to return their previous generators. Operations in most government offices have also been paralysed for lack of power. In March last year, traders complained about recurrent power blackouts. According to Moyale export director Ali Mumin, small businesses were the hardest hit by the power surge in the electricity supplied from Ethiopia. He said a majority of residents are also cut off from communication after the mobile phones run out of power, with M-pesa and other mobile money transfer outlets in the town recording reduced business. Mumin said institutions such as hospitals, banks and hotels have resorted to using generators, which are costly to maintain. Marsabit County is not connected to the national grid, with Moyale town connected to the Ethiopia grid, which was not stable.
