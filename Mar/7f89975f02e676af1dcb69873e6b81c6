The number of Kenyans categorised as poor has dropped by a marginal 200,000 in 10 years. According to new national statistics released yesterday, 16.4 million Kenyans lived in poverty in 2015-16, down from 16.6 million 10 years ago. This is despite increased population by about 10 million people during the same period. The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics on Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey shows of the 16.4 million, 3.9 million people lived in conditions of abject poverty and were unable to afford the minimum required food consumption basket. The drop from 46.6 per cent in 2005-06 to 36.1 per cent in 2015-16 is attributed to economic growth over the past decade growing at an average annual rate of about 5.2 per cent with the exception of 2007-08, which was negatively affected by the post-election violence. The drop in poverty also coincided with increased deployment of resources to the rural areas, especially in the past five years of devolution. “Over the last 10 years, the country has seen development gains of significant magnitude compared to the early post-independence years. Huge gains have been experienced, ranging from improved maternal and child survival to increased primary school enrollments to poverty reduction and general improvements human wellbeing,” the report reads. Overall, poverty remains higher in rural areas, where 40.1 per cent of residents (11.4 million individuals) were poor, compared to 27.5 per cent (0.9 million individuals) and 29.4 per cent (3.8 million individuals) in periurban and core-urban areas, respectively. The statistics further indicate that 27.4 per cent of households lived in overall poverty. At the county level, the poorest counties were Turkana at 79.4 per cent, Mandera ( 77.6%), Samburu ( 75.8%) and Busia ( 69.3%). Conversely, the four counties with least poverty include Nairobi ( 16.7%), Nyeri ( 19.3%), Meru ( 19.4%) and Kirinyaga ( 20%). In terms of food poverty, 14.5 million individuals did not meet the food poverty line threshold at national level. This means that about one in every three individuals in Kenya was unable to consume the minimum daily calorific requirement of 2,250 Kcal as per their expenditures on food. The six counties with high numbers of overall poor people that collectively account for 26.4 per cent of the national total of 14.5 million food poor individuals are Turkana ( 4.9 %), Nairobi ( 4.9 %), Kilifi ( 4.7 %), Kakamega ( 4.3 %), Kisii ( 4.1 %) and Bungoma ( 3.5 %). The report showed that female-headed households had relatively higher poverty rates compared to their male counterparts while households in polygamous unions are relatively poorer than those in monogamous unions. The proportion of poor children on the other hand was higher in rural than in urban areas, while the total number of poor children was larger than that of poor adults. Nationally, 41.5 per cent of all children (aged 17 years or less) were categorised as poor, which means more than nine million children live in poor households. At the county level, the prevalence of child poverty ranged from about 20 per cent in Meru to almost 83 per cent in Turkana. The survey was conducted over a 12 month period. It recommended that a strategy be designed to boost poor people’s access to essential services, including health care, primary education, and water and sanitation. It urged the state to consider expanding cash transfer programs that directly raise poor people’s incomes while helping families keep children healthy and in school, to improve road networks that multiply economic opportunities for the rural poor and to work on nutrition and parenting training interventions that optimize children’s early cognitive development and their later earning potential. The Survey targeted a sample of 24,000 households drawn from 2400 clusters. Data obtained was from 21,773 Households representing a response rate of 3 Per cent Response rate for rural households was 6% while that for Urban areas was 88.0%.
