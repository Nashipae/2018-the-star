LOW PRODUCTION Despite the increase in food commodity prices,the survey reveals that production of the same has remained relatively low with only few of them recording a marginal increase. Looking at the numbers, the country produced 32.5 million bags in 2007 compared to 37.1 million bags in 2016. This means that maize production in the country has gone up with only 4.6 million bags in 10 years. Beans production has also increased by the same number of bags as maize from 3.5 million bags produced in 2007. Milk production has gone up to 650.3 million litres from 423.1 million litres while production of sorghum and Irish potatoes have reduced to 1.3 million from 1.8 and 2.8 million bags and tons respectively. Due to the low production levels, the statistics show that upto 68.3 per cent of total food consumed nationally was derived from purchases while only 18 per cent was from own production. A notable 5.2 per cent was from gifts. Over half of food consumed in the rural areas was from purchases, while about 24.1 per cent of food consumed in the urban centres was from own production. Interestingly, the prices of kerosene and petrol rose by only 10 per cent over the same period.The survey attributes the slow rise in the fuel prices to the decline in the international oil prices that started in 2014 through to 2016.
