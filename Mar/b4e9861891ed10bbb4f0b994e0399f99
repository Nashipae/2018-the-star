Several ANC officials want Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi and Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala expelled for disrespecting leader Musalia Mudavadi. The officials from 10 Rift Valley and Western branches noted on Monday that they want quick disciplinary measures against the two. Billion Ebole said Osotsi and Malala have openly rebelled against Mudavadi, who is a Nasa principal, so they should be thrown out of the party. “Osotsi is in Parliament courtesy of Mudavadi so it’s surprising that he has turned around to bite the hand that fed him,” Ebole said. He added they will organise demonstrations in Kakamega against the Osotsi and Malala. Harun Nyongesa accused the Nominated MP of mismanaging the party when he was Secretary General. “Osotsi should tell us how Sh60 million disappeared [during his tenure]. He has run away to gang up with our rivals (Jubilee) to avoid being questioned on how the money was misused,"  he said. Ebole and Nyongesa issued a statement in Eldoret accompanied by Ezekiel Kibet, Edwin Koech and student leader Brian Kangogo. Kibet said: “We have been silent, hoping the two legislators would come back to their senses and stop the nonsense they are engaging in but this has been in vain. We will go out in full force to defend our party leader." Osotsi and Malala accused Mudavadi of being a coward after he skipped Nasa leader Raila Odinga’s swearing-in as the People's President on January 30. They have denied claims that they are Jubilee Party moles but Amani National Congress has formed a disciplinary team to deal with them. On February 15, Malala said he is not moved by the threats of disciplinary action while Osotsi accused politicians of diverting attention from their absence at Raila's ceremony.
