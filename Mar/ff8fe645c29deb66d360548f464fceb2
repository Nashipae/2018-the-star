The government will not rescind its decision to reduce salaries of junior officers earning the same pay and allowances as their bosses, a top level meeting of police chiefs decided yesterday. Last week, the National Police Service Commission announced it had scrapped salaries of junior officers in the ranks of constable and coporal earning salaries of inspectors after attaining university degrees. The commission also announced it had suspended tax relief enjoyed by disabled cops. call for dialogue There has been hue and cry after some officers received almost no pay in their February payslips. Yesterday, police spokesman Charles Owino defended the move by the NPSC. This is despite public pressure from civil society groups and trade unions which condemned reducing salaries of graduate police officers. The Kenya National Human Rights commission and Cotu urged the government to reinstate salaries of graduate cops. NPSC chairman Johnston Kavuludi downplayed threats of mass exodus by affected cops. He spoke in Trans Nzoia. Kavuludi said his office has received information from the Inspector General of Police some officers who had been receiving salaries of graduate cops had not presented their degrees and diplomas certificates. He said officers earning salaries of graduate officers and had not presented their academic certificates had their pay stopped because they had been entered into the system illegally. “As a commission, we encourage officers to pursue higher education, earn degrees and diplomas because we need well qualified, skilled, seasoned and capable people to handle modern day crime and offer high standards of security to Kenyans,” Kavuludi said. KNCHR chairperson Kagwiria Mbogori said there was a need for dialogue before the implementation of the policy on salaries. “This is a decision that portends far reaching and negative consequences,” she said.
