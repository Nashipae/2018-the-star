Kenyans lack of preparedness for adverse weather conditions continues to astound and disappoint. Even after the much-lauded plastics ban, the roads continue to be flooded by rains, thanks to the continued and utterly illegal building on riparian land and criminal lack of planning by both the county and national governments. The National Environment Management Authority has often warned against the continued degradation and drainage of wetlands in Kenya. Swamps, springs, dams, rivers, lakes, deltas, estuaries, and mangroves have been illegally encroached on. It is time for Nema and other authorities to take massively preventative action. The Weatherman has become increasingly accurate in his forecasts of the rains; however, Kenyans are still being caught unprepared. The Met is now forecasting that the heavy rains will begin in about 10 days, but few Kenyans are paying any real attention to this real-time warning. Building on riparian land and failing to unclog drainage are two species of impunity that must be stopped at once. Rivers must take their course and the roads and drainage must be clear at all times. This abject being caught unawares like clockwork is a national shame that must end. And one sure way of seeing this happens is to go after those who build on riparian land.
