The Nyandarua county government yesterday launched a staff head. Governor Francis Kimemia said the drive is in line with his resolve to radically reform the county’s public service when he took over the reins in August last year. The two-day exercise count is geared towards enforcing a culture of order, discipline, rule of law, and a value driven public service. “No county or country can grow beyond the capacity of its human resource,” he said. Kimemia said the first five years of devolution eroded the people’s confidence. However, they should expect services as a right. ICT and Public Administration, Mbataru Kariuki who is in charge of the drive said it will help put the debate on ghost staff to rest. He said the drive would cost Sh900,000.
