West Pokot leaders want more teachers posted to the county. Led by Governor John Lonyangapuo, they said yesterday a teacher shortage hurts learning in most schools and could lead to poor results in national exams. Secondary schools have a 65 per cent deficit and primary schools have 75 per cent, they said at Konyao Secondary School, Kacheliba. Lonyangapuo called for affirmative action in the employment of teachers. He said education is crucial for residents because it offers an opportunity to eradicate backward cultural practices such as FGM and cattle rustling. Locals appreciate education and many children are thirsty to learn, but their vision might be hampered by the lack of teachers, Lonyangapuo said. “It’s better to have many teachers than structures. Pupils can learn under trees with the help of trained teachers and excel,” he said. He urged education officials to paint a true picture of the situation for the ministry to act. “The county education director should submit correct statistics about teachers shortage.”
