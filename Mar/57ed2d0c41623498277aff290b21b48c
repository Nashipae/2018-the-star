The government has urged residents of Lari constituency in Kiambu to support chiefs and their assistants. Deputy county commissioner Aaron Koros said the government must work with the community to fight alcoholism, drug abuse and crime. Koros also urged residents to support government plans on education, agriculture and environment. “We cannot achieve our agricultural goals if we do not protect the environment. We aim at ensuring our children leave school with grades that will help them join the next level of education,” he said. Koros spoke at Kambaa Catholic in Kijabe on Friday during the burial of chief Samuel Mukua, who was described as hardworking. He was with local MP Jonah Mburu, MCA Nyutu Wamwere, former legislator Mburu Kahangara and assistant county commissioner Geraldine Barasa attended. Mukua was laid to rest in his farm with residents braving heavy rains to attend his funeral. Speakers eulogised the 43-year-old chief was approachable and always available to help. The MP said residents lost a development-conscious leader. “Residents have lost someone who followed up on what was happening in the area,” Mburu said. He thanked residents for allowing him to serve for five years, urging them to support government projects. Nyutu added, “Losing a loved one is not a simple matter to deal with. Prayers, keeping them company and getting them involved in activities will help them come to terms with the loss. It is our duty to do that.”
