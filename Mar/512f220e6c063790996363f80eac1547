Yesterday, governors
Alfred Mutua of Machakos and Mutahi Kahiga of Nyeri held a conference at which they condemned utterances and actions that perpetuate negative ethnicity and
inter-communal hatred (see P26). They criticised the vigorous tribal campaigns being waged in
both Kitui county and Kiambu county following the ban on the charcoal trade
by the Kitui county assembly and the subsequent burning of a truck carrying the same two weeks ago. The torching of the vehicle owned by a resident of Kiambu
county has triggered tension between the Kikuyu and Kamba communities, which led to a blockade of the Nairobi-Nakuru highway last week. Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu has stoked the fires by taking Kitui Governor Charity
Ngilu to court, accusing her of incitement and endangering lives, among
other things. Matters that are well within the mandate of the Council of Governors. In the meantime, a Kikuyu song entitled Ikamba that says immensely negative things about the Kamba as a
community has gone viral on the Internet. It is unusual for a commercial dispute to escalate into a popular music number that taunts and sneers at one side.
Tensions will smoulder.
The governors are right; the leaderships of Central and Eastern counties should
move swiftly and decisively. There is more that law enforcement and the National Cohesion and
Integration Commission can do to stop this hate speech from spiralling into a nasty ethnic feud. It is getting late. Quote of the Day: “The right to swing my fist ends where the other man’s nose begins.” — Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr, US 59th Supreme Court justice (1902-32), was born on March 8, 1841.
