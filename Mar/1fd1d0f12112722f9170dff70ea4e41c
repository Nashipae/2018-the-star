Self-declared NRMKe general Miguna Miguna has not been presented to the court as earlier directed. Justice George Odunga had ordered that the opposition politician be presented at 2.30pm in person. But when the session begun Miguna had not been presented. "Airport is not far away from here and it means they don't care," Odunga said. "No amount of hearings will help until the petitioner is brought before this court as I ordered. If the IG is unreachable or unavailable, isn't there a chain of command in the police force? If the CS can't be here, he now has a CAS and a PS. Why not send them here?" The High court had also ordered Interior CS Fred Matiang'i, IG Joseph Boinnet and Immigration boss Gordon Kihalangwa to appear in person for the case, an order that the three have also disregarded. The three were to accompany Miguna, who has been at the JKIA since returning from Canada from London. He was initially to be presented in the morning. "Nothing stops the state from complying with the court orders. They have disobeyed court orders as of now and should appear in person," justice Odunga said early on Wednesday.
