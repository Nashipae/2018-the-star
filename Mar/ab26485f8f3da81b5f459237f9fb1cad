Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga is to reshuffle his cabinet this week to have gender and regional balance. Rasanga said his six-member cabinet containing two womenÂ  needs to be expanded. Addressing the press in his office on Friday, Rasanga said the cabinet will be expand to 10 members to improve services.Currently each member of the executive manages two dockets after the assembly rejected some nominees. Rasanga has had a rough time with the assembly. The governor has been forced to submit the lists of his preferred cabinet nominees three times in six months before constituting half of his cabinet. The governor said he would be resubmitting the same names that have been rejected thrice. They are Adrian Ouma (Water), Dismas Wakla (Lands), Dorothy Owino (Education) and George Rubiki (Governance). Two residents have moved to court to bar the governor from resubmitting the same names. Siaya speaker George Okode said the assembly will only be guided by the law when the governor resubmits the same names.
