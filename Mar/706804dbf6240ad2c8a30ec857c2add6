A woman was killed by floods just two days after a mother and her child lost their lives in Homa Bay town. Twenty-five-year old Jackline Awuor's body was found in a trench at Soko Mjinga market on Tuesday morning by people looking for scrap metal. There was a heavy downpour on Monday night. A relative said Awuor had gone to visit her friend when the incident occurred. Witnesses said the woman was overpowered by floods, which swept her body towards Lake Victoria. “The body got stuck on a metal a few metres from the lake,” a witness said. Speaking to journalists on Tuesday, area assistant chief Dacun Okech said floodwater mover the body for about 200m. “A villager called and told me they had found a body in the tunnel. We informed police officers who came and collected the body,” Okech said. Awuor's death brings the number of people killed by floods in Homa Bay to three. On Sunday evening, a woman died while rescuing her baby girl from raging floods at Makongeni estate. Both died when a Nissan matatu they were travelling drifted into a ditch. They were among nine passengers travelling from Migori to Kisumu. The girl’s body was recovered immediately, while the mother’s was recovered on Monday evening. Area OCPD Esau Ochorokodi has asked residents to remain vigilant as the torrential rains continue. He said there has been a lot of destructions as a result of the floods, and the water drainage system is blocked. The police boss called on residents living in low land to move to higher grounds. Ochorokodi said police retrieved the body of a woman swept away Sunday, but they have not identified her. He asked people whose relatives are missing to report. “We have taken the bodies to Homa Bay County Referral Hospital mortuary,” he said.
