Potato farmers have increased yields from 30-48 50kg bags per acre to about 320 bags for the last three years. This is thanks to adopting high quality certified seeds, such as monitou, destiny and markie varieties. Dutch company Agrico BV has been providing potato seeds to over 6,000 farmers in Nakuru, Eldoret, Mau, Meru, Laikipia and Timau, in a Sh400 million venture with Migotiyo Plantations. Agrico BV chief executive William Dolleman told the Star yesterday: “Until recently such consistent quality sourcing was lacking in Kenya. Potato processors were few and the present ones were struggling in operations.”
