National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOCK) kicked off distribution of sports kit to various teams ahead of the Commonwealth Games scheduled for next month in Gold Coast, Australia. While handing over the kit to the athletics team, NOC-K President, Paul Tergat, said they have received full kit from Nike and are in the process of distributing it. “This kit belongs to the athletes and our role is to ensure it reaches them wherever they are. Gone are the days when the kit used to be an issue. He said he will hate to see a situation like the one that bedeviled the country during the 2016 Rio Games. Speaking at Milele Hotel in South ‘B’, where the team is residing, Tergat said their priority as Nock executive remains the sportsmen and women and that is how it will be for his duration in office. He said having been a former athlete, kit is half the success of the team because without it, it’s difficult to plan anything. He called on the athletes to work hard and ensure they win a Commonwealth Games medal because these are the kind of medals that make you a hero or a heroine. “ You can run in all the road races and big marathon but without Olympic, World Championship and Commonwealth Games medal, you are nothing. I have been there and done that and that is why I am here today as the Nock boss,” he added. Commenting on the preparations, Tergat said everything is on track and the sky is the limit as far as they are concerned. Athletics team manager, Joseph Ochieng thanked Nock for the support and assured Tergat that they are upbeat and raring to go. “ There are a lot of changes since you took over and I am sure this will translate into good performance,” said Ochieng. The athletes expressed delight for receiving the kit early, adding that their attention now will be on preparations.
