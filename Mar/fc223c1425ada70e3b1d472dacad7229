We will also make shoes because I want our people to be economically empowered,” she said. private university Wealth creation, youth and women empowerment were among the key pillars of Ngilu’s campaign manifesto. Ngilu urged private school owners to unite and build a university. She said wants more residents to get degres.

You may need to partner with them to set up this university,” she said.
