Gaudencia Makokha is elated after her side WTS KDBS Bank Wloclawek Club made it to the play-offs first round in the Polish women’s second tier league. Wloclawek finished second behind Spojnia Stargard as the regular season came to an end on Saturday. The first round matches are set to start this weekend. Makokha, who left the country late last year for the polish club, said the regular season has been competitive but she was glad her team made it through to the next level. “After making to the play-offs, there is first round and second round qualifications. The teams that have excelled in the first round then proceed to the second round but this is determined by the federation back here,” said the former St. Christopher Secondary School player. She added: “I’m excited about the development and I hope together with my other team-mates, we will perform well and make it to the second round which is set for April 7-8.” The right attacker-turned utility player revealed she has picked valuable lessons even as the season comes to end in May. “I am not sure whether the club will renew my contract or not but whatever happens, I’m now a better player as far as technics are concerned. It has been a good learning curve for me and I can only get better,” said Makokha. Meanwhile, Kenya Prisons will not have time to rest as they head for KKVF national league this weekend. Prisons are fresh from participating in the just concluded African club Championship in Cairo alongside Pipeline.
