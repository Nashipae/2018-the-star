Police have placed a Sh1m bounty on Timothy Kiptanui Kitai, who they say is the leader of the gang involved in the Mt Elgon clashes. "Wanted for murder and robbery in Mt Elgon. He is armed and dangerous," the notice published on Wednesday reads in part. Police said they have identified a number of suspects linked to the recent wave of robberies and murders in the region. They did not give details. Kitai's image was released and circulated on social media. Police said anybody with information should call 0202199151, 0702432877/999 or 112. "A reward will be given to anyone with information leading to his arrest. Let's all work together in the fight against crime," the notice read. On Tuesday, Interior CS Fred Matiang'i declared a 90-day 6 pm to 6 am curfew in Mt Elgon following deadly attacks that have put residents on edge. Matiang'i made the announcement during a tour alongside Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa and their Lands counterpart Farida Karoney. "The curfew begins today ...
