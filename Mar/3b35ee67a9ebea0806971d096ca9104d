The National Drought Management Authority has started distributing supplementary livestock feeds to subcounties in Garissa. The worst affected subcounties are Lagdera, Balambala, Hulugho, Dadaab, Fafi and Garissa Township. County NDMA coordinator Abdinoor Dubow said the subcounties urgently require water and food. He spoke on Friday during the flagging off of 7,800 bags of hay and pellets. About 40 per cent of the county needs relief supplies. Dubow said low rain has put the county in a dangerous situation. About 430,000 cattle and 630,000 sheep and goats could starve. “We are doing water tracking and supplying food, though our capacity is limited. The situation is dire and getting out of hand. We request for assistance from well-wishers and donor agencies,” he said. Deputy Governor Abdi Dagane appealed for more help from the national government and other agencies saying the situation is getting worse. He said 200 ECDE schools have been closed after villagers migrated with their livestock in search of water and pasture. Dagane said the county government has hired an additional 10 water trucks to supply water across the county.
