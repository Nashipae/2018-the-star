At least 800,000 workers have lost their jobs because of the government’s 90-day logging ban, the Timber Manufacturers’ Association has said. Chairman Bernard Gitau told the Star by phone on Friday they have 862 members who have “done no wrong to warrant the ban.” He did not explain how he calculated 800,000 but said the timber industry supports one million people. It would include loggers, drivers, millers and others. “Processed timber cannot even be transported out of our plants. We have structural investments of Sh550 billion across the country,” he said. Gitau said plantations do not affect forest cover of only 7.24 percent. “There are 94 per cent indigenous trees that my members have not touched,” Gitau said. He said all of his members, who are counting losses running into billions, only harvest pine, cypress and eucalyptus known as exotic material. “The 200,000 people in the value chain who are still depending on the industry, will be out of business by next week,” he said. The ban is intended to allow for assessment of forest cover, damage to the environment and to recommend solutions to the problem. Gitau said very soon banks that had extended their members loans will start demanding their money and they will be unable to repay. “In Londiani we have one of the biggest tree nurseries, but we cannot transport seedlings for fear we may lose our license,” he said. Gitau said youth who employed in the sector might commit crimes. He said two of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four pillars will fail without logging. Housing is one of the Big Four, along with manufacturing, food security and health care. Gitau said manufacturing and housing are big casualties of the ban. The National Assembly Environment committee will meet those depending on forests. He said they will inform the panel they are doing legal business and have a right to continue.
