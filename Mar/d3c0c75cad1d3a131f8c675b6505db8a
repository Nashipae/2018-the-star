A seven-year-old girl was crushed to death in Mogotio, Baringo county on Thursday while fetching firewood for use in their school kitchen. The standard three pupil of Chepnyorkin primary school was in the accompany of her colleagues when a huge stone rolled from a hill killing her instantly. Mogotio OCPD Peter Nyangaresi confirmed the 2pm incident. Chief Julius Baskwony of Kaibos-Soi location said the girls may have been trying to climb to the top of the rocky hill to reach a point with plenty of firewood. "A loose rock rolled and unfortunately fell one her," Baskwony said adding that the area has been experiencing rains which has loosened the ground holding the rocks. The chief cautioned residents against walking around the hills during the rainy season to avoid such accidents. He said cases of rocks falling off are common in parts of Tugen highlands, Mochongoi, and Eldama-Ravine. Click here for the latest political stories
