Kiambu county government wants to compel all public and private hospitals to be NHIF accredited. Speaking on Tuesday during the launch of a massive NHIF registration campaign, Governor Ferdinand Waititu said that everyone has a right to affordable health services including the less fortunate who he pledges to support. "We have already set up a kitty of Sh 24 million for those who cannot be able to afford to register for NHIF. No hospital will operate without being NHIF accredited,"said Waititu. The Governor, in conjunction with AMREF health Africa, gave out mobile phones to top community health workers who will go round the county registering those whom do not have NHIF cover. The phones will also be distributed to offices of Member of parliament, MCAs, as well in churches and bus terminals. "We have dispatched a team of 224 community health volunteers with mobile phones in all the 12 sub counties to assist in ensuring at least every resident has a NHiF medical cover. The phones will be used to register members at their places of convenience," Waititu said. The county aims to have registered over 800,000 residents by November 2018. Nominated MCA Caroline Wambui said that the NHIF card will cater for non communicable diseases, which have left most families penniless as well as mininise medical fundraisers. Wambui also called upon the government to exempt the elderly and persons with disabilities from paying for medical services as many not earning a living. Last week, the county assembly passed a motion sponsored by leader of majority Anthony Ikonya to have the executive establish mechanisms of making NHIF membership a platform for accessing the County Government services.
