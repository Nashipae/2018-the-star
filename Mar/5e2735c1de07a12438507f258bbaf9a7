Embakasi South leaders have urged the county government to urgently demolish illegal structures along Ngong River that are causing flooding. The structures have blocked waterways, resulting in massive flooding as heavy rains continue pounding the city. The kiosks built on the drainage are causing blockages, they said. In a joint statement yesterday, the leaders including Kware MCA Rose Kula said the situation is dire, yet the Meteorological Department is predicting more rains. A mixture of rain water and raw sewer is flooding people's homes. Ngong River flows through Imara Daima, Kwa Reauben, Kwa Njenga, Kware and Viwandani wards, which are densely populated. These areas are among those City Hall listed as floods hotspots.Leaking sewer lines and an incomplete drainage on the Outering Road from Pipeline compound the flooding problem. Embakasi Girls in Imara Daima is has been hit by flooding. The drainage system is blocked. Nairobi ICT executive Muthoni Ouko said the school has since been closed as a safety precaution following the flooding. Embakasi leaders have urged the county government to speed up completion of roads in the su county. Stalled construction are impassable and residents are finding it difficult to access the main road. Among the stalled roads are Falcon to Outering, and the Imara to Embakasai road that were being constructed by the National Youth Service in 2016-2017.
