Completion of rehabilitation and upgrading of Phase Two Eastleigh roads by Kenya Urban Roads Authority cuts a new face in Eastlands. Speaking to the Star yesterday, Kura's chief communications officer John Cheboi said the project was a success despite many challenges faced like delays in relocation of services and also sewer leakage during the upgrading. The 2km long carriage which started in 2016 has taken less than 26 months to be completed. According to Kura, the completion of the the road has made businesses to sprout and thrive. Areas between Jogoo Road and 18th Eastleigh street attest to the power of the infrastructure in powering economic growth. The project is aimed at decongesting and improving traffic flow within the city. Kura has also improvised pedestrian crossings and footpaths as part of the project. Residents have applauded the agency for the good job done. "This road has greatly transformed this area. It was impassible with garbage and sewer strewn all over. We did not imagine it could be reinstated into what we have now," resident Abdul Hakee said. Resident Mariam Swaleh said they now take less time to and from work and back and incur less costs of repairing their vehicles since the road is smooth. The agency was however concerned that pedestrian footpaths are being used for parking and roadside vending, forcing pedestrians to walk on the main carriage way which is hazardous to them. They has called upon relevant agencies to address the issue. Click here for the latest political news
