Abrar Boy's High School in Uasin Gishu has been indefinitely closed after 20 students were injured during a fight on Wednesday night. The fight broke out after the students differed on whether to sit end term examinations or not. Anti-riot police were called to quell the fight that degenerated into threats to burn the private Muslim school. Studunts in Forms One and Two differed with their colleagues in the upper classes. The senior students had called for a boycott of the exams. Chairman of the school's board of management Mohammed Ali said nothing was destroyed during the chaos. “Police stopped the fight before it degenerated,” Ali said. He said the school was shut down because the environment was no longer conducive for learning. He said the injured students were treated and discharged. The school, located along the Eldoret-Kaptagat road has a population of 300 students. “The board resolved to send the students home due to heightened tension. We will inform parents on the next course of action,” Ali said. He said disciplinary action will be taken against those who instigated the fight. “We will not allow a few students with bad behaviour to damage the reputation of the school,” Ali said. A meeting of the board to decide the next course of action will be held on Sunday. Eldoret East police boss Richard Obongi said officer were deployed at the school to restore normalcy.
