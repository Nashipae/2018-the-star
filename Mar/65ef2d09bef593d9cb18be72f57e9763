Federation of Women Lawyers in Kenya wants the government to establish safe houses countrywide to deal with the surging cases of gender based violence. In January, 357 GBV cases were registered, with Nairobi taking the lead. Fida chairperson Josephine Mong’are said it is the government’s responsibility to protect its citizens since it has the required resources. Mong’are said Mombasa has committed to set up shelters. The establishment of rescue centers is part of the recommendations made during the just concluded Commission on Status of Women, which took place at the United Nations Headquarters in New York from March 12-23.
