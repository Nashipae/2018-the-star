Murang’a county commissioner John Elungata has started the process of reclaiming grabbed public land. He warned culprits will be arrested and assured residents all grabbed public land will be recovered. “Some people use unscrupulous means to change the ownership of public property, but we are putting them all on notice,” Elungata said on Friday. Government houses are most affected by grabbing. Elungata said, “Some individuals fail to vacate government houses even after retirement and they eventually turn them into their permanent homes.” He called on the Housing department to keep clean records of all government houses and their occupants. Elungata warned government officers who collude with individuals to help them occupy government houses illegally.
