The East African Breweries Limited has hired 3,500 acres of land at Siany Okana Farm in Kisumu with a target to harvest more than 12,000 tons of white sorghum by August. In a move to improve its outreach for sorghum to framers in Nyanza region, Kenya Breweries Limited head of sustainable agriculture Omondi Kasidhi said more than 500 members of the community donated land to the company. This initiative, which comes ahead of opening the Kisumu plant in September, will see EABL cater for all costs of production up to harvesting as well as pay farmers Sh32 per kg for the sorghum. It will also deepen socio-economic benefits to the rural population who have been relying on peasant farming. “The company has a five-year contract with the farmers who have provided their land. Part of the land will be used to grow food crops such as maize, beans and green grams to promote food security.” Omondi told the Star. Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o assured EABL that the county administration will recruit agricultural extension officers to promote engagement in farming and upgrade road networks in the region, “We appreciate the move by EABL which will see county residents employed as well as cushion them from starvation,” he said. Nyando MP Jared Okello called upon residents to donate land. EABL is also planning to recruit farmers in the four counties of Migori, Homa Bay, Siaya and Busia.
