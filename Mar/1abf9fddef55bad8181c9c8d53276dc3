National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has challenged the opposition to continue its oversight role despite the new ‘marriage’ between Jubilee and ODM. Muturi said the move, which has received praise provides a good working environment in Parliament. “This is good development not only for Parliament but also for the country as we need peace for the country to forge forward,” he said. “This is a great opportunity for MPs to work for the public without acrimony as has been the case and we still recognize the role of the opposition in parliament,” he said. Muturi told reporters at Enashipai Spa in Naivasha after opening a one-week training for senior parliamentary staff from 15 Commonwealth countries.
