The Nyandarua assembly on Thursday adopted the first report on the scrutiny of the County Integrated Development Plan for 2018-2022, but wants amendments included. The plan requires Sh205.96 billion for full implementation. The focus is on promotion of agribusiness, trade and industry, internship, mentorship programme and youth development. It also emphasised upgrading of roads to bitumen standards and inter-county road connectivity, promotion of access to quality and affordable health services and sourcing of additional National Government and development partner funding. The county government wants to accelerate public-private partnership to be able to finance projects by 10 per cent of all funds required. The document was adopted with a number of amendments made at the committee stage following incorporation of views from public participation. Two more amendments were done on the floor of the house. Finance and Economic Planning committee chairman Suleiman Kihika, also Kanjuiri Ridge ward MCA, headed the scrutiny of the document. The development plan indicates the Department of Youth, Sports and Arts, intends to establish talent academies in each subcounty at a cost of Sh100 million in line with the governorâ€™s manifesto. But the MCAs, based on the input of the public and Finance committee, resolved the county should set up three talent academies, a sports academy, an art centre and an art theatre. The Finance committee proposed the funding be increased from Sh100 million to Sh500 million.
