Job seeking or tarmacking, as it is generally referred to in Kenya, is not for the faint-hearted. And in a country plagued by graft like ours, more often than not, it is your technical 'know who' rather than your technical know-how that will get you to the interview room and eventually land you the job. As though social connections coupled with the requirement for experience are already not daunting hurdles enough, most public institutions have devised a list of forbidding preconditions that jobless youth are compelled to submit before they can get to an interview. They must have a certificate of good conduct from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, clearance by the Higher Education Loans Board, Credit Reference Bureau and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. By the time an applicant is through the labyrinth, they will have forked out a cool Sh4,500. The jobless, a majority of them young graduates, lament the papers and process is not only expensive, but also discriminatory and oppressive. It therefore came as immense relief, when on Thursday, MPs unanimously endorsed a motion to let the youth apply for jobs without the handicap of the costly clearance papers.
