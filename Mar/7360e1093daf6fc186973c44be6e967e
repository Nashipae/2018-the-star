Tigania East MP Gichunge Kabeabea has accused his predecessor Mpuru Aburi of spreading propaganda. He said it is a lie Muthara and Karama residents will be forced to vacate their land when a survey and demarcation are done. Kabeabea on Thursday said Aburi wants to gain mileage. Aburi is now an East African Legislative Assembly MP. Kabeabea said Lands CS Farida Karoney and PS Nicholas Muraguri have agreed to his request for locals to get title deeds in six months. He advised residents to be on their own land during deed issuing so the wrong people do not claim it. Kabebea will hold forums in Kandebene next Saturday for locals to air their views. forum “There is a lot of propaganda being spread by Mpuru about the intended land demarcation and giving of title deeds. I want to assure my people that being a member of the Lands Committee, I can’t allow any resident’s right to be trampled on,” he said. “I have talked to the Lands CS and PS and what the government wants is our people in Muthara and Karama to get their title deeds by end of six months. As your representative, I will protect you and ensure the exercise is free and fair.” Kabeabea urged residents to attend the forum and give their input. “Where you have been living or farming is your land. No one will vacate. I know Muthara and Karama land has owners,” he said.
