Kenyatta National Hospital may be forced to renegotiate its relationship with the University of Nairobi after it emerged 70 per cent of surgical work is carried out by trainees. The UoN uses the hospital facilities to train medics, which includes actual management of patients. The hospital management last week said it had no control of the postgraduate trainees, called registrars, because they are admitted by the university and are answerable to their lecturers. “We do not pay them and we also have no control on how they are admitted,” said KNH chief executive Lily Koros, who is on compulsory leave.

Seme MP James Nyikal said the standard practice across the world is for teaching hospitals to pay the registrars to make them accountable to the facilities. “KNH should create fully funded training positions and only those who get those positions should be allowed to train there,” he said. Registrars are fully qualified doctors who have at least the first degree, but are currently undertaking masters training in a specialised field like surgery. The wrong brain surgery on February 19 was conducted by registrars, although the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists’ Board has cleared them of any wrongdoing. Koros said sometimes the university admits too many students, and they may not benefit from the congested facility. “We are not expanding as UoN increases students. We are having too many students being trained in a very congested place and may not get the quality training they need,” Koros told the parliamentary Committee on Health last week.
