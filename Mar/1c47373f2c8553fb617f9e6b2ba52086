Former Kitui Governor Julius Malombe has decided to appeal the High Court's decision to uphold Charity Ngilu's win. In a notice on Friday, Malombe said he will go to the Court of Appeal and explain that Ngilu was not validly elected as his successor. "...being dissatisfied with the decisions given ... I intend to appeal the whole ruling and seek the reversal and dismissal of the original action," the notice states in part. He sent copies to Kilukumi & Co. Advocates. The High Court upheld Ngilu's victory in the August 8, 2017 election, judge Pauline Nyamweya declaring she was validly elected. The judge dismissed Malombe's petition on grounds that it lacked merit. Malombe challenged Ngilu’s win citing irregularities in a number of polling stations. He also argued that the results did not reflect the will of the voters. In her defense, Ngilu told the court she won because she is a performer and that she was the best candidate for the position.
