The youngest wife of controversial Uasin Gishu politician Jackson Kibor, Eunita (pictured), has sued the Standard newspaper for defaming her by allegedly referring to her as a gold digger taking advantage of her rich, old husband. In a suit filed at a magistrate’s court in Eldoret, she said she married Kibor in 2002 according to Nandi customs. Kibor is 83 while Eunita is in her 40s and they have five children.  The Standard and Njoki Kaigai are the first and second respondents respectively. Eunita is seeking an apology and compensation for damages caused by an article published on the newspaper’s online portal. “ I hope Eunita has accepted the fact that she will always be seen as the young gold digger wife whose singular achievement will have been taking advantage of an elder to earn a lifetime meal ticket,” reads part of the article.
