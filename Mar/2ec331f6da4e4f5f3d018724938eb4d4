The Kiambu assembly on Tuesday passed a Bill to abolish retail of wine and spirits. The Alcoholic Drinks Control Bill 2018 is expected to be signed into law by Governor Ferdinand Waititu. No bar had been paying licence fees since Waititu took over. Bar owners will have to reapply for licences through the subcounty alcohol committees. The teams will hold public hearings so residents can approve or disapprove the licensing of bars. Those issued with licences must prominently display the certificates so they can be inspected by anyone. Bar owners must also keep records of alcoholic drinks’ suppliers. The Bill limits nightclub operations from 2pm to 3am on weekends. Former Nacada chairman John Mututho said the counties can only fight illicit brew through proper laws. “The law passed in Kiambu should set a precedent that the war on illicit brew is still on,” Mututho said. Kiambu assembly Majority leader Anthony Ikonya said the law is not meant to punish people operating legitimate businesses, but will help uproot those doing illegal trade.
