The government is considering waiving taxes in key economic sectors to empower women. During the launch of First Lady Margaret Kenyatta’s Strategic Framework 2018-2022 at State House yesterday, Public Service CS Margaret Kobia said her ministry will work to implement incentives that will enable more women to invest and compete in large enterprises including manufacturing, infrastructure, transport and mining. These areas have a high growth potential but remain unexploited. The ministry will also invest in education and training in the informal sector to improve productivity, business innovation and make the growth and expansion of businesses sustainable. “We need to focus on innovative interventions and information sharing, for leadership and decision making for women and girls.  Providing opportunities that keep girls in schools and universities is a major part of the solution,” Kobia said.
