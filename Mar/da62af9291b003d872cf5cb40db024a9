Khaminwa told the court that his client is engaged in other official duties of National Mining conference. The charge against the two read that on September 23, 2015, at Uhuru Park, Nairobi county, he uttered words in Swahili that have been translated as: "From Friday next week if teachers will not have been paid nobody will go to work and whoever goes shall be stoned, "indicating that it was desirable to bring death and physical injury to persons in Kenya." Muroko alone faced a charge translated from Swahili to mean: "We are saying, the motion being brought to impeach Uhuru, any Member of Parliament who votes against it will be lynched." The prosecution said the utterances were made at the Cord rally in Uhuru Park on September 23. Muthama and Muroko had earlier made frantic efforts to stop their prosecution, but the High Court rejected their plea.
