Illicit brew from Uganda intercepted in Siaya A lorry ferrying illicit alcohol from Uganda was on Sunday night intercepted in Siaya. Police say they got wind of the Sh2 million consignment from the public. Siaya OCPD Ancent Kaloki said the alcohol was to be distribute to local bars. Kaloki said the alcohol was a banned liquor that has sometimes caused deaths in the country. Police believe the alcohol was sneaked into the country through Lake Victoria in either Port Victoria or Sio-port. “We have previously intercepted many items from Uganda with investigations always leading us to the two ports,” Kaloki said. The owner of the track and the consignment have not been identified. Kaloki said the driver, Thomas , was to appear in court yesterday. Kaloki warned residents against illegal businesses. “We are going to destroy all the alcohol in the track,” Kaloki said. He said they will take the war against illicit brew to the shores of the lake. Kaloki attributed illicit brews to crime. “Our youths can make good use of their energy, but they often end up in crime after taking alcohol,” Kaloki said. He appealed to locals to always partner with the police in eradicating the brew in the country for general growth.
