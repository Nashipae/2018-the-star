A Bungoma assembly team has blamed the killings and insecurity in Mt Elgon on historical land injustices. The 11-member ad hoc team said the issue should be solved urgently. The committee is chaired by Mbakalu MCA Bethwel Mwambu. He is deputised by Cheptais MCA Jane Chebeti. The team was put in place last month by MCAs in a special seating that had been convened by speaker Emmanuel Situma. The committee was tasked with the mandate to keenly look into the escalating incidents of insecurity in Mt Elgon and Bumula subcounties. While tabling the 51-page report on Wednesday, Mwambu said there is a lot of land injustices that have developed into deep wounds that need to be healed before more lives are lost. "We have well-known leaders who have grabbed huge tracts of land and whenever they are asked to surrender, it becomes a problem," he said. Mwambu said the national government, through the Lands ministry, should resettle squatters and landless people in Chepyuk. He also said the Kenya Police Reservists should be recruited in areas affected by insecurity to help police who are not familiar with the terrain. The report recommends that serious disciplinary actions be taken against state officials who are hiding criminals and are working with them to fuel crimes. "There is need to overhaul all security details in Mt Elgon and transfer cops who have overstayed in the area. They are and are now liaising with thugs to terrorise residents and sack those incompetent," Mwambu said.
