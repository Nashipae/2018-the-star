Residents in flood-prone areas are alarmed about possible flooding due to heavy rains and lack of preparedness in the capital. They say they have not seen any major activity to clear drainages and mitigate effects of the downpours. In the past rains have caused deaths and detroyed property. In 2015, more than 10 people were killed by floods in several parts of the city. Transport executive Mohamed Dagane and county secretary Leboo Morintat yesterday said the roads department has embarked on opening and clearing garbage blocking drainage. The county has been accused of lack of prepareness and allowing developers to build on riparian land and drainages.. The rains are expected to subside tonight or tomorrow morning. Then it will be hot and dry again until the long rains are expcted later this month. South C and Nairobi West were identified as among the worse flood hotspots in 2016. Other areas were Kileleshwa, Imara Daima, Thika Road, Langata, Loresho, Zimmerman, Garden Estate, Thome and Roysambu. Kahawa West, Donholm, the Mbagathi/Langata Road Roundabout, Nairobi West, Ruai, Utawala, Mukuru slums and Kibera slums were also identified. The rains have been pounding the county since last week, making movement very difficult on Lagos Road, parts of Moi Avenue in the CBD and the estates. There was a massive traffic jam on flooded Mbagathi Way Thika Superhighway, Industrial Area and Westlands were the worst-affected. In Westlands, a bridge on Peponi Road was submerged on Friday. The rains have not wreaked havoc in South C and Nairobi West, but residents fear flooding. “It was bad last Friday because this road (Muhuho) was submerged but it did not affect homes,” South C resident Job Mutisa said. Area MCA Abdi Osman said two houses at Muguyu area were swamped on Friday but it had drained off and no casualties reported.. “We have talked to Nairobi water and the national government to open up these drainages because we don’t want casualties,” he said.
