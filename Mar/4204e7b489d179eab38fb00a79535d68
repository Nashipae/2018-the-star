With a tough match against Tusker tomorrow, Ulinzi Stars coach Dunstan Nyaudo has urged his players not to despair after the disappointment of their last minute defeat to AFC Leopards last Sunday. The soldiers had looked certain to take a point against Ingwe but a last minute goal from Marvin Nabwire sent the second loss of the season down Ulinzi throats and undid the gains made from the previous game against Mathare United, which had served the team’s first clean sheet of the season. Oliver Ruto scored what seemed the equalizer just minutes after Leopards had taken the lead but the final minute goal sunk their hearts and as the team prepare for the game against Tusker, Nyaudo will be hoping for home comforts to serve the second win of the season. While he lauded his players for a good show, the coach pointed out that his defenders ceded crucial ground in the run-up to Leopards’ first goal, scored by Jaffery Odeny, and that changed the entire course of the match. “We played well but had a genuine goal disallowed. I can’t blame my players at all. I think they gave their all in the game and we can only work to motivate them. We will continue pushing and giving our best and hope results can go our way in coming games,” Nyaudo noted on the clubs official portal “We had a defensive mix up in conceding the first goal and we will address that, definitely.” Ulinzi are down in 12th place with four points in as many matches. Meanwhile the soldiers round six clash against Kakamega Homeboyz, previously scheduled for March 11 at the Bukhungu Stadium, has been brought forward by a day. In a statement, KPL said the change has been prompted by the unavailability of the Bukhungu Stadium on the earlier date since it has been booked for a church function.
