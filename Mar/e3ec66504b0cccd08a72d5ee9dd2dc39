Jua Cali has lent his support to Wahu and Amani after they switched to the gospel industry. "Being saved is something very personal," he said. "You can never know about what goes in the person's mind. I can only say I wish them success. It's another world, you have to understand it. It's not like they'll be doing gospel because of money. "It's also another industry and you know there are those who wouldn't want you to get into the business of music itself. I'll support them. If they release songs and albums, we will buy." The Woyoyo hitmaker spoke during his performance at the Guinness fanzone event that took place in Meru last weekend. The event was also graced by Timmy Tdat and other artistes.
