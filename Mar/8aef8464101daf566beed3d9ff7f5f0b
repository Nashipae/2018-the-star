A man drowned in Mto wa Mawe river on Friday, Athi River after he slipped while vandalising guardrails at the bridge for scrap metal. Mavoko assistant county commissioner Patricia Nthiwa said the man identified only as Francis, 23, drowned at the bridge that is under construction. The body was later retrieved on Friday evening after several hours of search. Youths blocked the busy Mombasa Road briefly causing traffic snarl on the stretch between Lukenya and Athi River Interchange. They were protesting the slow rate at which efforts were being made to retrieve the body. They said their efforts to get assistance from different various quarters had hit a snag. KeNHA and Chinese engineers have been working on the bridge for several months now since the construction of dual carriageway between Athi River's interchange and Machakos turn off began last year.

The flooded river also caused massive destruction at the nearby Green Park estate. Nthiwa urged the residents living along rivers to move from danger zones to high grounds for safety.
