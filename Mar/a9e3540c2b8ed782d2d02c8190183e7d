A woman charged with stabbing her husband to death in Mathare, Nairobi, will now pay a cash bail of Sh50,000, down from Sh200,000. The Tuesday decision came after suspect Irene Owuor asked the court to lower the fine as she had been unable to raise it since last year. Owuor is accused of killing Simon Olweny on November 25, 2017 at Mathare 4A in Starehe Division. She allegedly used a kitchen knife to attack the man after a quarrel. She has denied the manslaughter charge levelled against her. Earlier, the court gave detectives from the Stahere DCI office 10 days to continue holding the suspect until police complete investigations. Corporal Richard Wasonga sought more time for the probe, noting the woman was arrested on November 26. The case will be heard on March 16. Click here for the latest political news
