The 10.022kg heroin intercepted in Kwale on Thursday would have been consumed by 200,000 Mombasa residents, police have said. Coast Regional Coordinator Benard Leparmarai added on Saturday that the effects of the Sh30 million drugs would have been devastating. Leparmarai said the substance, whose value dropped by Sh60 million from earlier estimates, was destined for the Coastal county. It was from Tanzania, he said, adding that in the end, Sh200,000 would have been used to rehabilitate each user. “Who has such money? No government, no county, no person can rehabilitate 200,000 people," he said. “Two hundred thousand people are [too many] yet we know those who benefit are a few fellows ... cartels ... at the expense of public health."  Some of the heroin worth Sh30 million that was intercepted in Kwale county is displaced at the police headquarters in Mombasa, March 17, 2018. /ERNEST CORNEL The Regional Coordinator spoke at the police headquarters in Mombasa when three suspects linked to the drug trafficking were paraded.
