Kibera Black Stars’ remained top of the National Super League standings despite seeing their unbeaten start to the campaign come to a halt yesterday following a 1-0 loss to KCB at Camp Toyoyo. Chrispin Onyango was the hero for the bankers as he netted the lone goal midway through the first half to claim the bankers’ third win in five matches. The defeat left Kibera top with 13 points with Bidco, who thumped Nakuru All Stars second with 11 points and Ushuru, who drew 2-2 with rejuvenated St. Joseph third on the standings. KCB climbed up to sixth in the table with 10 points and a game in hand over the five teams above them. The game began on a high with the two sides showing intentions of opening the scoring charts from the numerous chances created. The on-form Kibera strikers held KCB’s defenders hostage for the better part of the opening half hence barring the flankers from overlapping. After squandering a number of open chances, KCB finally broke the deadlock in the 22nd minute through Chrispin, who beat Kibera’s stopper Evans Adache with a low shot. Nicodemus Onyango would have leveled for Kibera in the 27th minute after the centre half rifled a long shot which almost beat the advancing KCB shot stopper Juma Kaseja. The former Tanzanian international, however, stood tall to tip the ball for a corner. Despite Kibera trailing, their confidence grew and their quest to restore parity saw them pin the bankers to their own half. KCB were forced to an unwanted first half substitution as Abuko picked a knee injury in the 40th minute and the former AFC Leopards man was replaced by Rodgers Omondi. The half time whistle came as reprieve for the under pressure KCB who had endured a tough final ten minutes from the marauding Stars. A revitalized Kibera resumed for the final half with intentions to cancel the goal. Sailing past KCB’s final third, however, proved hard for Kibera who had all their attempts end at the hands of Kaseja who produced the man of the man display.
