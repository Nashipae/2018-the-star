An organisation has launched a fish feed in Homa Bay county. Unga Farm Care Ltd on Monday said the feed will be readily available to farmers. Addressing more than 120 cage fish farmers at Homa Bay Stadium, GM Dickson Jawichre said the fish feed will improve production. The feed is best for tilapia. “The product has been certified, approved and found to be good. We have tested it on farmers and found the results encouraging,” Jawichre said. The fish feed will be offered to farmers at a relatively cheaper price compared to imported feed. The product floats on water, making it the best for fish surface feeding. “The product has a uniform quality. We’ll ensure it is available to farmers and bring it closer to markets,” he said. Unga Holdings MD Nick Hutchinson said the product is packaged in different forms for different farmers. “Farmers can buy the product according to the quantity needed.” Agriculture executive Aguko Juma said many farmers have had problems accessing fish feed. “We’re urging our farmers to go for products that have ben tested and are certified,” he said. The Homa Bay county government had dug about 320 fish ponds to promote business in the county. Juma encouraged residents to join fish farming to increase their source of income. “The county government is regulating fish caging in Lake Victoria to ensure the lake is not polluted. We’re encouraging residents to adopt alternative methods of producing fish in the county,” he added.
