Tanasha Donna has denied rumours circulating in Tanzania that she is Ali Kiba’s Kenyan fiancée. The news went viral after Ali Kiba’s brother confirmed the Chekecha Cheketua hitmaker will be marrying a Kenyan woman. Two years ago, Kiba used Tanasha as his video vixen in the song Nagharamia, featuring Christian Bella. The model insists she and the singer have never been an item. We can confirm that Tanasha is in a relationship with another man.
Not Ali Kiba. And most certainly, not Nick Mutuma, her ex. Kiba is said to be marrying a Mombasa-based woman identified as Amina
Khaleef. The two are said to have been dating since last year, after the
singer parted ways with beauty queen Jokate Mwegelo.
