STARRING: Matt Czuchry, Emily VanCamp, Manish Dayal, Shaunette Renée Wilson, Bruce Greenwood DIRECTED BY: Medical drama RELEASE DATE: January 21  I really didn’t think I had it in me to watch another medical drama so early in the year. But, as it turns out, The Resident has its own charming appeal. On his first day as a doctor, Devon Pravesh, a freshly graduated med student from Harvard, walked into Chastain Park Memorial Hospital confidently, to save lives. But his first day turns grey when he is assigned senior Resident Dr Conrad Hawkins as his mentor. Conrad is tough on Devon from the start, he makes Devon understand that being a doctor is not about the black and white things you learn at medical school. Conrad is an exceptional doctor, tough but very thorough. His thoroughness stems from a fatal mistake he made early on in his career. Conrad doesn’t get along with the chief of surgery, Dr Bell. He believes Bell is an incapable doctor who leaves a trail of dead patients in his wake. In fact, most of the staff know Bell to be incompetent but he bullies them into remaining silent about his mishaps. But the fact is Bell has hand tremors that make him incapable of being a precise surgeon. So, he hides behind the hands of Dr Mina Okafor. Mina’s work is immaculate but her social skills are lacking. Conrad’s ex-girlfriend Nic also works as a nurse in the hospital, and Conrad is determined on repairing their broken relationship. Unlike the likes of Grey’s Anatomy, we have no doctors walking around draining contents of takeaway coffee cups, no soapy entanglement of the doctors lives or overdramatised conditions. The premise here is simple. There’s good doctors who want to do their job well and the veteran doctors who want to remain in power no matter the cost. The show is an improvement on the usual medical soaps that have been airing for years. Its premise is clear, it’s got humour and it’s intriguing enough to be a binge-able affair.  Star Rating: 4/5
