The government has been urged to boost the new curriculum by funding sporting activities. Uriri MP Mark Nyamita said the new curriculum will fail because it does not have enough funding for co-curricular activities. “So far, the government has only provided funding for books, stationery and school infrastructure, but haven’t showed any signs of funding of co-curricular activities or how it will be done,” he said on Friday. He spoke when he met school heads and principals at his offices in Uriri centre. He said head teachers have been urging elected leaders to finance sports in schools.
