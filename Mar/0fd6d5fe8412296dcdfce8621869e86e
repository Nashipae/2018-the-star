Governor Joseph Lenku’s task force formed to evaluate the effects of the last drought in Kajiado put the livestock deaths at 232,400. Livestock executive Moses Narok on Thursday said most cattle died while searching for pasture. He put the loss at Sh13.94 billion. A cow on average costs Sh60,000. Narok said the combined cost of intervention stood at Sh78 million. This includes supplements, drugs, hay and transportation of water to hard-hit areas in Kajiado West. It does not include fuel subsidy for boreholes. The Centre for Minority Rights Development and pastoralists held a press conference on Friday after three-day seminar to discuss drought and climate change. The need to fast track the enactment of county adaptation funds to cushion pastoralists during droughts was discussed. Project Concern International, Neighbourhood Initiative Association, Friends of Pastoralists, Nasaru Women’s Group, Dupoto E Maa and Kenya Livestock Marketing Council were present. Juliana Nasaru read a statement on behalf of the group saying pastoralists are worried climate change will hurt their livelihood.
