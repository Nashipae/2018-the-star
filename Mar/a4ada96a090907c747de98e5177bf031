Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills) and Bowen Kangogo (Marakwet East) have vowed to fight for their seats after the High Court nullified their election. Keter and Kangogo received a rousing reception when they visited their constituencies at the weekend. Keter held private consultations with his key point men in Nandi Hills. “We are still consulting, but we will inform our supporters on the way forward,” he told the Star yesterday. Keter defeated Deputy President William Ruto’s aide Emmanuel Tallam in during the Jubilee primaries to win the party ticket for the August 8 polls. It is unclear if Tallam will run for the seat again. Benard Kitur, who filed the petition against Keter ,visited Nandi Hills on Saturday and was welcomed by his supporters but jeered by Keter’s allies. “They know I am tough and that I am the one who will deal with Keter politically in Nandi Hills,” he said. Kitur ran as an independent candidate and emerged second. Kangogo has said he may not appeal the decision.
