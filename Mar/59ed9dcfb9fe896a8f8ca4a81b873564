An oil company has started training St John Ambulance first aiders in Mai Mahiu town, Naivasha subcounty. The first aiders respond to scenes of accidents. "They evacuate victims from vehicles that use petroleum, which is highly flammable. Others are tankers carrying petrolium products and can explode," Galana Oil Kenya Ltd safety and quality manager Samuel Githinji said. He spoke last Friday when he handed over an equipped rescue centre. The company owns Delta petrol station. “Their mission is to save road users lives, keep onlookers safe and ensure victims are rushed to nearest hospital in good time” he said. “Ours is to support them with skills, kits and other equipment they may need as they do all that."
