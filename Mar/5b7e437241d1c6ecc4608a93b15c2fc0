National Bank of Kenya has opened a branch each in Nandi Hills and Kitale to expand its agribusiness portfolio. This takes the lender’s branch network up to 85. During the launch of the Nandi Hills branch, NBK director of corporate banking Reuben Koech said agribusiness is a critical sector and the new branches will help the bank achieve a competitive advantage. “The agribusiness market accounts for more than 50 per cent of the Kenyan economy. This size of market and potential for serving the various agribusiness actors is compelling and as such, it is critical we focus on building this sector,” he said. Customers will have access to a wide range of services through agribusiness value chain finance targeting smallholder farmers and agricultural support service providers. “High priority value chains we have already identified for funding in the two areas include dairy farming, tea farming, horticulture, vegeculture, livestock and fisheries and agribusiness enterprises including input suppliers, agrovet consultants, agrovet outlets, agri-based processors and market facilitators,” Koech said. “We have tailor-made solutions in line with our overall growth strategy for the agribusiness sector.”
