The National Social Security Fund will not pay the Sh1.89 billion estimated contractual claim presented by its contractor in construction of the Hazina Trade Centre in Nairobi. NSSF acting managing trustee/CEO Anthony Omerikwa on Friday said the Fund has sought the services of the State Department for Public Works for review, verification and guidance on the claim. The contractor is claiming payment after construction of the Hazina Trade Centre expansion was halted. This followed a dispute with then NSSF anchor tenant Nakumatt Holdings. The contractor had presented a claim amounting to Sh6.9 billion, which was revised downward by NSSF’s consultants to Sh1.89 billion. At the time, the anchor tenant Nakumatt Holdings took tenancy of the building in 2003. Its lease with the Fund was express that the building was incomplete, but ready for partial occupancy. The Fund has in the meantime reviewed the whole project and scaled it down to 15 floors from the initial 36 floors. The building is being finalised at a total cost of Sh4 billion down from the initial Sh6.7 bilion. In February 2013, the Fund entered into a contract for Sh6.7 billion for the completion of an additional 36 floors on the existing building in Nairobi’s CBD.
