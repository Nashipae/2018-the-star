Farmers sold two million more bags of maize to the strategic national reserve, the agriculture ministry has said. Principal Secretary Richard Lesiyampe however said this was due to the attractive prices the government offered, probably prompting farmers to import maize for supply. “On average, government buys 1.5 million bags, but this year we collected over 3.5 million bags,” he said in an interview. Lesiyampe confirmed Sh7 billion has been released for maize delivered to National Cereals and Produce Board, and expects another Sh3.5 billion to complete farmer payments once the supplementary budget is approved. He said going forward, farmers will be registered, complete with the acreage of their plantations, to avoid brokers buying produce from neighbouring countries to sell it to the national reserve. “The government will only buy strictly from registered farmers, who will also benefit from the subsidised fertiliser. We have realised that stockists are mopping up government subsidies and re-selling to farmers at almost triple the set price,” he said. The government procured 1.2 million 50 kilogramme bags of fertilisers to be distributed to farmers countrywide against a demand of more the 600 tonnes. He said 900,000 bags had been distributed with the remaining 300,000 set to be given to farmers in North Rift. He urged county governments to supplement the national government’s farm inputs subsidy as demand was too high. “The 1.2 million bags subsidy can only reach 30 per cent of the farmers. Counties can help by supplementing the subsidy by supporting farmers.”
