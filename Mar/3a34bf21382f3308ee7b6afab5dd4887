Residents in an Embu village are worried about a masked man who strips naked and scares schoolchildren . Parents of Ugweri village said the man exposes himself and acts in a bizarre manner in the mornings when children are going to school. Area senior chief Daniel Ndwiga said the man charges at the them. He said pupils, especially girls, are scared they may be harmed. Ndwiga warned the man that if he does not stop his devious and dangerous behaviour, his days are numbered. Investigations have begun and the man will be arrested for causing a breach of the peace, he said. “Pray that we don’t find you. If we do, you we shall deal with you accordingly,” said the chief. He ordered all parents to send their children to school, adding that eight parents have been arrested for illegally keeping children at home.
