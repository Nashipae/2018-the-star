Focus today will be at the Milimani law courts as three petitions are determined. Among those who will know their future include Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu, Embakasi East MP Babu Owino, Embakasi South MP Julius Mawethe and Embakasi North’s James Gakuya. Justice Pauline Nyamweya will issue her judgment on whether Ngilu was validly elected as governor. Former Governor Julius Malombe challenged Ngilu’s win. He alleged that a number of polling stations were marred with irregularities and the results do not reflect the will of the voters. During the hearing, judge Nyamweya allowed scrutiny and recount of votes in 50 polling stations where Malombe claimed there was rigging. In the petition, Malombe accuses Ngilu of intimidation and bribery of voters, saying in several polling stations, the number of votes cast exceeded the number of registered voters. Ngilu told the court she won because she is a performer and was the best candidate. Justice Joseph Sergon is expected to rule on whether Babu’s election was free and fair. His rival Francis Mureithi moved to court to nullify Babu’s win, arguing that it was not free and fair. In his submissions through lawyer Kiragu Kimani, Mureithi said the election is not only about numbers but the process, which was flawed.
