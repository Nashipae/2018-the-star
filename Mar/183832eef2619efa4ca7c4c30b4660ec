The government will today begin inspection on the progress of teaching mathematics in Class One and Two in seven counties. Joint mission officials will inspect schools in several counties, including Taita Taveta, Nandi, Kisumu, Homa Bay, Trans Nzoia, Busia, Laikipia, and Nairobi. This is under the Kenya Primary Education Development, supported by a grant of Sh8 billion from the Global Partnership for Education. It is being implemented under the supervision of the World Bank to ensure effectiveness of teaching mathematics in early grades. The inspection dubbed Classroom Observation, will involve senior education officials and administrators, who will sit in classrooms and note how teachers teach.
