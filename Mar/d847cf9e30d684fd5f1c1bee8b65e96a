Governor
Mike Sonko on Tuesday urged courts to give punitive fines and sentences to
individuals found guilty of corruption. Sonko said some of
individuals accused of swindling millions of shillings from the
county have been given very lenient punishment by the courts. “We have tried our
level best to curb graft, but courts should give punitive ruling to
these individuals,” Sonko said. He was speaking
when he hosted a delegation of Central Organization Trade Union led
by Secretary General Francis Atwoil at City Hall. Sonko said he has
worked to improve the workers' welfare, including early payment of
salaries and remittances of statutory deductions, since he took over
as the county boss. “We are in the
process of polishing some sectors and soon county
workers will enjoy," he said. Atwoli applauded
Sonko’s efforts to transform the city and urged him to put more
effort in addressing problems facing county staff. The COTU boss urged
the governor to take land grabbing matter head-on and those found
guilty to face full wrath of the law. “Land grabbing
syndicate in the city is real. I have a victim in Mariakani in South B
and I want you as the governor to take the case up and assist those
families," he said.
