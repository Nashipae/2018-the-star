Former President Mwai Kibaki and seven other directors have regained control of a multimillion-shilling property and company in Nyeri they started in the 1970s. The Court of Appeal yesterday overturned as “erroneous” a 2016 ruling by the Lands Court declaring new directors of Mathingira Wholesalers Company legitimate. The prime plot is situated at the heart of Nyeri town and houses businesses like hotels, bars and offices. The case started in 2008. Kibaki was being represented by senior counsel Gibson Kamau. Judges Agnes Murgor, Fatuma Sichale and Sankale Kantai found that the lower court allowed “strangers and imposters” to manage the property without authority of the original owners. “The Lands Court decision had set a dangerous precedent on issues of governing properties and transferring of shares,” they ruled. “The suit property belongs to the list of proprietors declared by a certificate of lease issued in 1976 and renewed in 2012.” The court found that Kibaki and his seven colleagues bought the prime plot in 1976 and incorporated it as Mathingira Wholesalers Limited in 1983. Further, the Appellate court said the original owners also became the directors of the company, and they have never transferred their shares in accordance with company articles and memorandum of association. The court heard that the original founders of the company are deceased and only Kibaki and Kanyungu, a former councillor, are alive. The dispute about the property started following a disagreement on its management after a new chairman was elected in October 2007, replacing Kanyungu. Kibaki’s lawyer, Kamau, welcomed the appellate court decision, saying prospective property owners must adhere to the law. See:Kibaki appears in court over Nyeri town property
