A police
officer was shot dead at the Elgeyo Marakwet-Pokot border on Friday after a mission
to recover stolen livestock turned chaotic. The Anti-Stock Theft Unit officer had been in team trailing bandits who had stolen tens of cows and sheep from Kapyego, Marakwet East on Thursday. He was killed when the raiders opened fire on the officers in Kamolokon area of Embobut Forest in an afternoon ambush. David Rono, who is Kenya Forest Service Operation Commander in charge of the forest, said ASTU officers, their rangers and police reservists intended to recover thousands of cattle hidden in the forest by the rustlers. “The officer was shot in the head as the rest of the security personnel ducked for safety," he said. “The raiders had stationed themselves at vantage point before sporadically opening fire on the security personnel as they approached the location of the animals." Rono reported that two forest wardens went missing during the melee but were found safe at around 2 am on Saturday. Unconfirmed reports indicated several bandits were gunned down during the shootout that lasted hours. Police seized an AK47 rifle and 16 bullets that the attackers had. The body was taken to the morgue at Kitale County Referral Hospital. On Saturday, locals said tension had returned to the border after five weeks of calm. James
Chacha, a Special Deputy County Commissioner, said elders from
Marakwet East and Pokot South met to look into solutions. Chacha was appointed by Interior Cabinet Secreatry Fred Matiang’i to coordinate security operations in the Kerio Valley. He said
30 cows and 36 sheep were recovered by the officers despite the ambush. “We are
sorry for the killing of our officer. The suspect is known and police are
pursuing him,” Chacha said. The Special Commissioner asked residents to remain calm and not treat the attack as a mark of war between the two communities. Click here for the latest political news
