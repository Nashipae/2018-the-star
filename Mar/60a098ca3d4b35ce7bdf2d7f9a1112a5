Marsabit Governor Mohamud Ali on Wednesday said all workers should work to deliver quality services. His administration will streamline operations in the county and fire non-performing workers. “Action will be taken against anyone who does not take their duty seriously,” Ali said. The county boss added that his administration is committed to improving living standards in Marsabit. “No one will play with the service delivery. The business of taking things casually will not apply in my administration.” Ali said all department heads must issue service delivery reports for accountability. He urged security agents to investigate a case in which county leaders colluded with business people to steal food from the National Cereals and Produce Board depot (pictured) on Saturday.
