Hundreds of Wajir residents and students yesterday held peaceful demonstrations to protest the lack of teachers in schools. The protest was one of the biggest witnessed in the recent past. The demonstrators first met at Orahey Grounds and later proceeded to the county commissioner’s office. Parent Mohamed Abdi said, “This county has an 85 per cent illiteracy level, now you want to add on another 14,000 students to that group. We request the President to address this matter immediately.” County commissioner Lloyd Kibaara said the government is working to ensure learning in schools is not interrupted. Non-local teachers have skipped classes and called for transfers, citing insecurity, especially terrorist raids.
