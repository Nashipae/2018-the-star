Wajir county is coming up with a sustainable approach to global warming and unpredictable climate change. Deputy Governor Ahmed Ali said on Friday that two percent of the county’s annual budget has been committed to the climate change fund. He spoke during the launch of the Climate Change Fund projects at the county headquarters, Ali said the county and the Swedish International Development Agency has set aside Sh96.89 million for the fund. This follows enactment of a Wajir County Climate Change Fund Act, 2016. A well-resourced department of environment, energy and natural resources has been established to undertake related projects. “As a county we are committed to the climatic change agenda. We appeal for support from all stakeholders and residents,” Ali said. He said the county in collaboration with the Kenya Forestry Service and the State Department of Interior will continue protecting woodland trees through enforcement of the Forestry Act. “We will soon embark on distributing 10,000 seedlings of indigenous and exotic trees this season to contribute to our country’s target of forest cover,” he said.

This will replace diesel powered electricity that is not only expensive but also detrimental to human safety. The MCAs in September last year unanimously approved a Sh4.6 billion budget to tackle drought in the region. The money is part of the county’s budget for the 2017-2018 financial year and was approved in 30 minutes.
