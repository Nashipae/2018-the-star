The Lands ministry has digitised only 18 of the 61 gazetted registries, CS Farida Karoney has said. Speaking in Kasarani yesterday when she visited the Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development, she said her ministry wants to be slow but sure. “Records are many but we are streamlining this. We want to partner with other government agencies, specifically the ICT ministry, to pool resources and make the process faster,” Karoney said. “We cannot choose between digital and manual. It is a question of when we must do it.” The CS wants to ensure all ministry records are digitised in two years. She visited the mapping centre to support her ministry before titling. Karoney said with maps, titling will be much faster. The CS said her ministry will work closely with other government agencies to ensure government assets are protected. Schools, hospitals, government institutions will be handed title deeds to keep land grabbers away. Since Independence, only nine million titles have been issued. This means less than 30 per cent of the land in Kenya is titled. Karoney said digitisation will deal a blow to corrupt individuals, as it will prevent manipulation of records. “Over time, cartels will be eliminated,” she said, adding that she cannot police whatever is happening all over the country without digitised records.
