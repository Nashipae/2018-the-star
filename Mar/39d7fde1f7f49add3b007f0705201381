Sleuths from the EACC raided a yard in Bungoma on Tuesday, unearthing the diversion of petroleum meant for export. They arrested three people, after tracking the syndicate for months, and took them to Bungoma police station. The three are accused of diverting petroleum
bought from Kenya Pipeline for export, selling it locally and evading taxes. Three others escaped the raid during which the officers confiscated a truck and several generator pumps. An EACC official, who spoke to the Star on condition of anonymity, said the raid came after a month of tracking suspects. "They break Kenya Revenue Authority seals and use new ones then sell the fuel locally, to the undue
advantage of other traders," the source said. "They divert the product to their yards and then sell it to local distributors. Their tracks
then go to Uganda for procedural clearance processes despite the fact that
they are empty at the time of crossing the border." The 42,000-liter tankers have an average street value of Sh4.6 million each. The officer said the yard in Bukemebe area had been receiving about 10 a week. Five other yards have been identified between Eldoret and Malaba. “This is a very big cartel that costs the government millions of money in taxes. The suspects are believed to have political god fathers. Local police say that any officer who tries to unearth the syndicate is victimised by seniors," the source said. "But we will break down the cartels despite the stumbling blocks of power brokers." Thousands of used and unused KRA seals were found in the yard, alongside documents with the names of the owners and the banks where they have accounts. The EACC officials waited for their KRA and Kebs counterparts to effect a court warrant to break into the
trucks and underground reserves. They will check whether the petroleum is adulterated and look into how the cartel has been acquiring KRA seals Click here for the latest political stories
