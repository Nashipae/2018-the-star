Knut has urged the Teachers' Service Commission to stop its delocalisation policy as the tutors have families to take care of. "It is unfortunate
that without even consulting with us, TSC went ahead last month to move over
30,000 head teachers across the country,” Eldoret
East branch Knut executive secretary Sammy Bor said. He said the policy
is meant to destabilise teachers’ families, and is unfair and dehumanising. “Who knows, if we allow
them to go on they might escalate to swap all the teachers in the 47
counties," Bor said. He was addressing 800 teachers during the Boresha Sacco members’ educational meeting in Eldoret town on Saturday. He said the policy will affect teachers' performance as they will not concentrate on their work being so far away from their families. In July last year, TSC chief executive officer Nancy Macharia said the delocalisation policy
will affect only affect head teachers, deputy principals, deputy head teachers and senior teachers.
