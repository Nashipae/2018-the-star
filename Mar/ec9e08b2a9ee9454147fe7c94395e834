Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong yesterday ordered the distribution of drugs to various hospitals following complaints from patients. On Wednesday, Ojaamong toured hospitals in Matayos and Butula subcounties, including the Khunyangu Subcounty Hospital, during which he came face to face with shocking tales of lack of drugs. County transport manager Abraham Emuria was asked to mobilise more than 10 vehicles to distribute the drugs. Workers packed the drugs in waiting vehicles as Ojaamong's directive took effect. Ojaamong said he would take action against pharmacists delaying drug distribution. The stores pharmaceutical technologist Tom Wanyama said lack of transport had hindered distribution. "The first batch will go to hospitals in Samia and Bunyala regions," Wanyama said. He said there were few workers to load and offload the drugs to waiting vehicles. "We also need a standby generator for cold chain drugs," Wanyama said.
