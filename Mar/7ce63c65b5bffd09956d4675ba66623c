Kenya Pipeline and Prisons women’s teams have both named strong squads ahead of next week’s Africa Club Championship in Cairo, Egypt. The arch-rivals have, however, included few new faces in their respective squads with local champions Kenya Pipeline adding right attacker Christine Njambi and middle blocker Tebla Simiyu. Njambi is, however, expected to muscle for the starting line up against experienced Esther Wangeci. The two are expected to fill up the gap left by Violet Makuto, who is illegible to play in the 11-day tournament having featured for another club in Dubai. Simiyu on other hand will be fighting for the starting place against team captain and regular Triza Atuka and promising duo of Yvonne Sinaida and Beldine Akinyi. Njambi and Simiyu are excited with their inclusion in the squad and have promised to live up to expectations. Pipeline coach Japheth Munala said the new faces have shown growth in the training and remain optimistic of good results in the event. “We have prepared well and we look forward to a good show, ” said Munala while unveiling his 14-member squad at a Nairobi hotel yesterday. Africa bronze medallists, Prisons on other hand, have drafted in three players among them—Lorene Chebet, Herma Jepyegon and Sharon Chepchumba— ahead of their departure tomorrow morning. Kipyego will, however, jostle for a starting line up in the setting department against Joy Luseneka while Chebet will be out to catch coach’s eye alongside experienced Diana Khisa, Shyrine Jepkemboi and on-form Edith Wisa in the centre position. Luseneka and Kipyego are seeking to fit into the big shoes of Jane Wacu who is away in Seychelles with club Anse Royale while Chebet, Khisa, Jepkemboi and Wisa are keen to cover up for Brackcidise Agala who is out on maternity leave. Chepchumba will fight for starting line up in the left attacking position alongside Evelyne Makuto (captain), Mercy Moim, Yvonne Wavinya, Joan Ngeiwo and Sharon Chepchumba.
