Home-based players, who were named in the Harambee Stars for upcoming international friendlies against Comoros and Central Africa Republic, left the country yesterday for Marrakech, Morocco—the hosts for the two matches. Kariobangi Sharks trio of goalkeeper John Oyemba, star midfielder Patilla Omoto and in-form striker Eric Kapaito were part of the entourage that left yesterday. Others, who departed included goalkeepers—Farouk Shikalo of Bandari and first choice shot stopper Patrick Matasi of Posta Rangers as well as AFC Leopards skipper Duncan Otieno. The six were to be joined by Gor Mahia trio of Samuel Onyango, defender Haron Shakava and play-maker Francis Kahata. The three were part of the Gor team that were ousted from the Caf Champions League away at Tunisian outfit, Esperance. The twin fixtures will be the first matches Kenya will be featuring in since the shock resignation of Belgian Paul Put last month. It will also herald the return to the national set up of Uefa Champions League winning midfielder, Mcdonald Mariga. The former Inter Milan star played the full 90 minutes as his Real Oviedo side ended their win-less streak in the Spanish second division by beating Granada on Sunday night. The foreign-based players including captain Victor Wanyama and star striker Michael Olunga are expected to join their compatriots in Morocco. With Stars now ranked 105th in the world, assistant coach Stanley Okumbi will be desperate for victories against the two minnows. Stars will first face off with Comoros on Saturday before concluding their tour against CAR. The match ups are part of the national team preparations for the 2019 African Nations Cup qualifiers which will resume with a home match against five-time African champions Ghana. Kenya lost their first match away at Sierra Leone.
