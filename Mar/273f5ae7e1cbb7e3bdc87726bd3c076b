The family of a Swiss national who succumbed to injuries inflicted by thugs in Kikambala, Kilifi county, yesterday accused police of laxity in investigating. Schneider Hans Rudolf, 71, died on Sunday, 10 days after he was attacked and robbed at his home in Majengo, Kanamai. His wife Ursula Schneider and family friend Dolores Keller said investigators are yet to question key suspects. They accused security agents of working with the suspects to cover-up the murder. On Monday, Kilifi police boss Joseph Muriuki said they had arrested a suspect found with Rudolf’s mobile phone. Police said the suspect had contacted Rudolf’s family in Switzerland, who alerted the security agents who tracked down the suspect to a private villa in Mtwapa. But Ursula said Salma Rashid is only assisting with investigations since she picked the phone on the roadside and texted Ursula’s son. A gang armed with crude weapons raided Rudolf’s home, demanded cash from his family and attacked him in front of his family members. Last year, at least three Swiss nationals were killed in Kilifi county. Sources said Rudolf is related to a Swiss couple found murdered and dumped in Kiembeni last August. Werner and Marrianne Borner were murdered at their home on Nyali estate, where they had lived for at least 20 years. The body of Swiss national Moser Max was found dumped in Mtwapa Creek by a fisherman. The body had extensive facial injuries. Police say the killings of elderly foreigners are organised by people close to them who want to inherit their wealth or steal cash and valuables.
