Arsenal lost 2-1 at Brighton and Hove Albion yesterday, a fourth successive defeat in all competitions for the London club which intensified the pressure on manager Arsene Wenger. After a bright start from the visitors, Lewis Dunk volleyed in to give the home side the lead—ensuring Arsenal’s run without a Premier League clean sheet stretched to 11 games—their longest since February 2002. Glenn Murray’s fifth goal in as many league games made it 2-0 after 26 minutes, before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang pulled a goal back for Arsenal two minutes before halftime. Arsenal improved in the second half, but Brighton held on to secure a third Premier League home victory in a row to go 10th in the table. Arsenal’s eighth defeat in all competitions in 2018 leaves them six, trailing north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur in fourth by 13 points. Earlier, Wenger said he is not in denial about the Premier League club’s faltering campaign, believing that the north London outfit are worse off than last season. Wenger has drawn widespread criticism from supporters and pundits as Arsenal lie sixth in the table on 45 points, a staggering 30 points behind league leaders Manchester City after 28 matches. “This season is worse than last season because last season we won the cup and we made 75 points,” Wenger told British media. “I don’t deny that, but we’ll analyse that at the end of the season. Don’t worry, I can live with reality. At the moment, we lost a cup final and we lost a big championship game. “What are the underlying things? We have to focus on what we did well and what we didn’t do well. We need to correct it.” Arsenal were comfortably beaten twice in five days by Man City, starting with the League Cup final followed by a league defeat last Thursday, leading to increased calls for the north London club’s long-serving boss to end his 22-year reign.
