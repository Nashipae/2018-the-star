Two Kajiado leaders have said the recent handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga will not disrupt Jubilee’s resolve to deliver the next President in 2022.
Governor Joseph Lenku and nominated Senator Mary Seneta said Deputy President William Ruto is Jubilee Party’s choice to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta.
They spoke in Kajiado South constituency on Friday and Saturday, respectfully.
“We want to affirm that the national development of reconciliation position will not derail our resolve to support DP Ruto to ascend to power in 2022,” Lenku said.
He said they, however, support the show of unity between the two leaders.
Seneta said Jubilee Party endorsed Ruto to run for presidency soon after the 2017 repeat presidential election.
