Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro (pictured) has urged Kenyans to harvest enough rainwater for use during the dry seasons. He expressed concern over the unpredictable weather s and told Kenyans to buy water tanks and build pans to store as much water as they can. “The time has come for us as a country to stop relying on the rains that have become unpredictable to grow our crops. We should start investing in water harvesting,” Nyoro said. Kenyans let rainwater go to waste and end up suffering during droughts as they seek relief food, he said. Nyoro said the current rains can only sustain crop farming if water is well harvested. Kiharu was one of the constituencies hard hit by drought and hunger late last year, especially Gaturi, Kimathi and Kambirwa areas.
