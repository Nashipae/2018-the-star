Homa Bay youths have asked President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga to begin their nationwide tours in the county. Led by Young Contractors Association chairman Eli Oyier and Homa Bay town youth leader Philip Osinde, they said the two leaders should initiate development projects when they visit. Oyier said the agreement by Uhuru and Raila to work together has quelled tension in the country and asked Kenyans to embark on development. â€œWe congratulate them for agreeing to work together. They should start the reconciliation tours with Homa Bay and launch projects to assist youths," Oyier said.
