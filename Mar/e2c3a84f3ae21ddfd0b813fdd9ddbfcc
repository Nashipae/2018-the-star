Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula has called for the immediate lifting of the three-months curfew imposed by Interior CS Fred Matiang’i on Mt Elgon last week. Wetang'ula said the dusk-to-dawn curfew was hurting innocent residents. Speaking in Kimabole village in Sirisia on Sunday, the Senate Minority leader asked the government to withdraw security personnel who had been deployed to enforce the curfew. He said Matiang’i ought to have consulted area leaders before arriving at the decision to impose the curfew. Wetang'ula, who was accompanied by Woman representative Catherine Wambilianga, claimed that security officers were torturing innocent people under the pretext of looking for information. “The curfew is hurting farming and businesses, two main economic activitiesm that feed Bungoma. The security officers deployed there will maim, rape and torture innocent people to get information,'' Wetang'ula said. He said the curfew ought to have been imposed only in Kopsiro division where the gang was terrorising residents because of land-related conflicts and not in Cheptais. “We know that the main problem in Mt Elgon is land. Once the historical injustice is dealt with, peace will be restored,'' Wetang'ula said. He cited the Chepyuk settlement scheme and asked the government to give title deeds to squatters. Wambilianga said she had received many complaints about police raping women and girls. We want them [police] replaced with Kenya Police Reservists," Wambilianga said. More than 30 people have been killed by criminal gangs in Mt Elgon over the last three months. Matiang’i visited the area last week before he imposed the curfew. He said the move would allow police to apprehend the gang of 17 believed to have carried out the killings. Police have placed a Sh1 million bounty on the commander of the gang Timothy Kiptanui alias Cheparkach. Click here for the latest political news
