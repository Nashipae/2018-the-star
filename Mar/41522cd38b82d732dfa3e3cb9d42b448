The national government will soon start distributing water from Ndakaini Dam to residents of Gatanga, Murang’a county. Area MP Joseph Nduati yesterday said the Athi Water Services Board has already sent surveyors to the ground. “We have been supplying the city of Nairobi with water for decades now yet residents still fetch water from rivers,” he said. The agreement was reached after the MP put up a spirited fight to have residents supplied with Ndakaini's water. The dam was built in 1989 and sits on 1,200 acres. Nduati has been pushing the government to distribute 10 per cent of the water in the constituency as a form of compensation. Last month, he asked the board to honour President Uhuru Kenyatta's directive to distribute water that will be harnessed though the Northern Collector tunnel to Gatanga before it is channeled to Nairobi. Nduati said residents will oppose the Sh6.8 billion tunnel until the water is first distributed locally. The contractor is already laying pipes to tunnel the water to Nairobi. He was speaking at Kihumbuini market during a tree planting drive attended by Woman Representative Sabina Chege, Kipipiri MP Amos Kimunya and Igamba Ng’ombe MP Patrick Munene. Chege said youth groups will be picked to plant trees in all the wards. She said she will award the groups that will plant the most tree seedlings; the winners will bag Sh100,000, second place will get Sh50,000 and the third Sh25,000. “I'm challenging the youths, especially those who are active on social media, to join us and get a chance of making money while doing something that will have a positive impact,” Chege said. She said primary schools that will plant the most tree seedlings will be awarded laptops and desks. The exercise isin partnership with the Kenya Wildlife Service and well-wishers. The legislators distributed 10,000 seedlings in the constituency, which borders the Aberdare. Click here for the latest local political news
