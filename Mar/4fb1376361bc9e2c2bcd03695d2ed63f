The top two teams in each pool qualify for the round of 16 with subsequent rounds being played on a knockout basis. The winner of the tourney will earn a direct trip to Anfield, home of Premier League giants Liverpool. Liverpool Legend, Bruce David Grobbelaar, will be in attendance for the one-day tournament. Grobbelaar, a former Zimbabwe international footballer, played as a goalkeeper for Liverpool FC between 1981 and 1994. The original eccentric genius between the sticks, Bruce will be best remembered for the wobbly-legged penalty heroics which brought Liverpool the 1984 European Cup and inspired Jerzy Dudek to the same feat in Istanbul 21 years later.
