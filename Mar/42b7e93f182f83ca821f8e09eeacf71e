Kenya Cup enters the last round this weekend with Strathmore Leos and Top Fry Nakuru seeking a final slot in the play off. Strathmore are sixth with three points ahead of seventh-placed Nakuru. Today, Strathmore host second-placed Menengai Cream Homeboyz at Makadara, needing a win to keep their hopes alive while Nakuru travel to Nairobi to face Mwamba at the Nairobi Railways Club. A win against Homeboyz will see Strathmore cement their sixth position. However, If the Benson Mbai charges lose, they will need to collect two bonus points by scoring four tries and losing by seven or less points which would give the students 27 points, that can be equaled by Nakuru if they win against Mwamba. A win for Nakuru and no points whatsoever for Strathmore will see the former accumulate 26 points, one more than the Leos and in the process secure a return to the playoffs after missing out last season. On the other hand, a win for Mwamba against Nakuru hands Strathmore playoff qualification, according to KRU. Log Leaders and defending champions KCB, the only unbeaten side this season so far, host third-placed Impala at the KCB Sports Club. KCB can secure a semi final slot with victory Impala which has already secured a play off position. Kabras, who have also secured a playoff berth, will take on Kenyatta Universityâ€™s Blak Blad seeking to return to winning ways while Nondescripts will be at home to the already qualified Quins at the Jamhuri Park. At Gusii Stadium, Kisii and Regional Logistics Mombasa will clash in a dead rubber since the two teams have already been relegated from the top flight league. The two teams were promoted from the KRU Championship this season but have back.
