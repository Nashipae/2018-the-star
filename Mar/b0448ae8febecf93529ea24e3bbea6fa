CCTVs will be installed in forests, Environment PS Charles Sunkuli has said. They will be put up at key entry points in and outside the forests. Sunkuli said this will help manage the resource. He spoke at his Olesentu home in Transmara West subcounty, Narok county, on Saturday. Sunkuli said the Kenya Forest Service will be strengthened. “We have realised the KFS faces key challenges like inadequate vehicles, surveillance equipment. Entry into the forests is haphazard,” he said. Sunkuli said the ministry will use technology to manage forests. “We need to adopt new technology. We would like to acquire drones.”
