The Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation will receive Sh300 million to fight the deadly armyworm. Agriculture Principal Secretary Richard Lesiyampe said the money will be spent on rapid assessment and research on chemicals to control the fall armyworm. He urged the county governments to allocate money for pesticides on time in case the armyworm attacks crops again this year. “Counties should ensure there is adequate surveillance to help farmers fight the pest. The government has formed a rapid response team comprising research institutions and other industry players, but it can only come in to help when the counties are overwhelmed,” Lesiyampe said. He told farmers to be vigilant when crops begin sprouting. Lesiyampe said beside using pesticides, farmers should plant nappier grass around their farms to control the spread of the pest. Kalro director general Eliud Kireger said they will release a list of chemicals that can be used to control the armyworm. Agriculture Chief Administrative Secretary Andrew Tuimur is in Brazil with a team of technical officers from the ministry for a meeting with delegations from other African countries that have also been affected by the fall armyworm.
