Coffee farmers in Murang’a county have received free organic manure from the county government to improve coffee production. The programme, dubbed Kahawa Bora, started in 2015. More than 70,000 farmers have received the manure and stopped using fertiliser believed to increase soil acidity and reduce yields. The programme will complement a second project in which the county government is rehabilitating 50 coffee bushes in smallscale farms. Launching the fourth phase of the programme in Gaturi, Kiharu subcounty administrator Jeremiah Kamau said over-reliance on fertiliser has reduced coffee harvests per bush and lowered farmers’ returns. The manure given for free for the first time since the programme started will increase coffee production by more than 10 times. Currently, a coffee bush produces two kilos per yield, instead of the expected 10.
