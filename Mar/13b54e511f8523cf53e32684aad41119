For the first time since Kenya Police Training College was opened in Kiganjo, recruits participated in a clean-up in Nyeri town on Saturday. The 500 recruits set aside their training and joined Nyeri government officials in the exercise as part of their corporate social responsibility. Armed with spades, wheelbarrows, slashers and gloves, they spent the better part of the day cleaning and unclogging drainages. They cleaned the Nyeri Referral Hospital, the streets and estates as well as the county office building. Governor Mutahi Kahiga said the programme, called ‘Pamoja Ng’arisha Nyeri’, was successful. College director of curriculum development and evaluation Eric Nteere said the exercise is meant to foster good relations with the community. “We want to make this a regular exercise,” he said.
