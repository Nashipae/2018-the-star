Education cabinet secretary Amina Mohamed has been challenged to do away with decrees placed by his predecessor Fred Matiang’i to ensure the sector moves back on track. Speaking on Friday at St. Joseph’s Nyamilu Primary School in Central Kanyamkago, Uriri MP Mark Nyamita and local Knut officials in Migori county warned Mohamed that she risks “falling in a deep hole” if she continues with policies left behind by Matiang’i. “When we said that Matiang’i was clueless with numerous decrees we were vindicated with the fail of text books to schools and delocalisation of teachers especially in North Eastern parts of the country,” Nyamita said.
