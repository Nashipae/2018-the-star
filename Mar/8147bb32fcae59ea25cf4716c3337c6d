Busia Governor
Sospeter Ojaamong yesterday told NASA leaders opposed to the recent unity between President Uhuru
Kenyatta and Raila Odinga not to waste more time. Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula and ANC's Musalia Mudavadi have said Raila betrayed the coalition when he met Uhuru. Ojaamong said the electioneering period is over and leaders should focus
on development. "The handshake
between Raila and Uhuru is enough signal that leaders should bury the hatchet and focus on growth. What we need now is to
sit down and movethe country forward," he said. Ojaamong said the country needs
clean water, food for its citizens, good roads, drugs in health
institutions and teachers. "I'm ready to receive Uhuru
and Raila in Busia to cement their recent peace pact," he
said.  Click here for the latest political news
