Two students of Multimedia University were yesterday charged with attempting to obtain money from politicians by false pretences. Derick Ng’etich and Edwin Warukira were accused of fraudulently obtaining money from former Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo and Murang’a Woman Representative Sabina Chege. They allegedly committed the offence on March 8 at Goldenspot Restaurant in Nairobi. They are accused of obtaining Sh100, 000 from the two legislators. The two denied the charges before chief magistrate Francis Andayi and requested for a free bond, claiming both are students. Ng’etich also pleaded with the court for leniency, saying he has a heart problem and is still under medication. The prosecutor was not against granting of bail. The second accused, Warukira, did not confirm whether he is a student since he did not produce his student identity card. He claimed he had lost it. The suspects are accused of being members of a cartel defrauding politicians by sending obscene photos and demanding money. Police are trailing the gang leaders and will arrest them soon. They were each released on Sh30,000 bail. The case will be heard on April 11.
