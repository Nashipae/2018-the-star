Residents of Spotlight Villa in Lamu have protested alleged forceful eviction from the land. Transport and business activities were temporarily halted in the town on Sunday as the protesters marched on the streets with placards. They accused tycoons of colluding with police to harass them. Local tycoons are interested in the 52-acre piece of land. According to Mohamed Athman, residents who have reported the harassment to police have been arrested and detained by police. "It is sad when the police become comprised," Athman said. He called Governor Fahim Twaha and the National Land Commission to intervene. The residents said they have lived in the area for more than two decades. “It's very unfair for us to be evicted to pave way for some tycoon. Why cant they go and buy land elsewhere?" Athman said. Halima Badi said police were taking advantage of their situation to extort money. “They have arrested youths who openly spoke against the forceful eviction. They have demanded Sh10,000 to release them," Badi said. He accused police of intimidation. Another resident Mohamed Ali appealed to county leaders to come to their rescue. He said the leaders should not keep quiet when land grabbers were forcefully evicting squatters. The demonstrators submitted their petition to the county commissioner and the county assembly. They have called for a resolution to all land injustices countrywide.
