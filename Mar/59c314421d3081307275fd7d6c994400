The Mai Mahiu –Suswa Road section that was cut off last week due to volcanic activity has dipped in again affecting traffic flow. Kenya National Highway Authority says heavy commercial vehicles are not able to use the road. The Authority has embarked on an immediate emergency exercise to restore the road. Motorists using the highway are being warned to expect traffic interruption for close to four hours as the Authority undertakes the refill exercise. In the meantime, KeNHA is exploring the area to create a traffic diversion should the problem persist. The movement of the Earth crust and volcanic activities are to blame for the current cracks in the region. Geologist David Adede last week said the volcanic activities in the region is a clear indication of future disasters if not mitigated immediately.

"The Great Rift splits Africa into two plates. With what is happening we have established one plate which is the Somali plate is moving away from the other plate at a rate of 2.5cm. In the near future if this happens, we shall have Somali plate separating from the other Nubian plate," Adede said.

"There is a great need for researchers to conduct a comprehensive study on the terrain of this region so that they can advise on where roads and residential buildings can be established. This can play a key role in dealing with such natural disasters should they happen," he said. Click here for the latest political news
