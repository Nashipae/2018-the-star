The construction of Mwaririro Market has started, following an outcry of city dwellers to relocate hawkers from the CBD. Starehe Mp Charles Njagua yesterday said hawkers will soon have a permanent place to operate from. “The hawkers should be assured they will have a secure place to conduct their businesses,” Njagua said. The market will have at least 350 stalls. Governor Mike Sonko has been urged to add more floors to accomodate more hawkers. City centre alone has 7,000 stalls. Njagua urged hawkers to be patient while the market is constructed. He condemned police brutality during swoops to remove hawkers from the CBD. Located in Kariokor ward, Mwaririro Market lies on four acres previously turned into a car wash and shelter for street children. In January, the county government received Sh650 million from the World Bank for the construction of Mwariro and Karandini markets to relocate hawkers from the CBD. Construction of Mwaririo market is among projects funded by the World Bank under the Nairobi Metropolitan Services Improvement Project. The project, which was started in December 2012, is expected to be completed by end of May 2019. Sonko said, “My administration has a comprehensive plan to ensure hawkers’ interests are taken care of.” There has been a recurrent public outcry about hawkers who had taken over key roundabouts and roads, worsening congestion and traffic jam within the city centre. Last month, in a bid to drive hawkers and boda boda operators out of the CBD, county askaris and the police launched a crackdown. Following orders by regional commissioner Kang’ethe Thuku, the operation has been ongoing to ensure hawkers and boda boda riders do not operate from the city centre.
