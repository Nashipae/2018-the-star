Horticultural farmers in Kinale, Kiambu county, are counting losses after hailstones destroyed their vegetables. Rains have pounded the area every day this week accompanied by hailstones, destroying spinach, cabbages and kale crops. Farmer Samuel Ndore said the leaves cannot be harvested and are now pruned and fed to livestock. He planted three acres of spinach, from which he usually harvests 10 bags and sells them for Sh18,000 each. “I had spent Sh20,000 to prepare the land for planting. They are harvested every two weeks. I had only harvested twice since I planted them,” Ndore said. Pastor John Kiarie urged residents to pray that the rains will be a blessing and not rebuke Him.
