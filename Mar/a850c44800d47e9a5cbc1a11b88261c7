Despite seeing his Kakamega High School Green Commandos team fall to a third successive loss in the National Super League at the hands of former topflight outfit Ushuru, coach Brenden Mwinamo remains proud of his boys’ efforts in their debut campaign in Kenya’s second tier league. “The competition is very tough but if we get our first win, things will be easier for us. We played well despite their (Ushuru) experience. We will, however, work to improve our performance so that we can get our first win as soon as possible,” said Mwinamo. He was also elated by the fact that the team has produced five players to the national U20 team, the Rising Stars. “We have a very young squad as compared to Ushuru and we do not have a sponsor. I believe with these matches being aired live on Bamba Sports, it will not only be a motivation to our young players but will also attract sponsorships,” reiterated the coach. Commandos have managed a paltry return of two points so far having not won a match this season in an unwanted record they share with basement club Nakuru All Stars. Ushuru coach Ken Kenyatta on the other hand is too happy to see his side return to winning ways after a frustrating start to their quest for a quick return to the Premier League. Kenyatta was elated with his team finally getting their second win of a campaign that has not been what they had expected. The match against Commandos was very tough, but all I needed was three points, and I am glad I got them,” he said. “I’ll come there (top of the league) as time goes by. No cause for alarm. The league is still very young,” he added. With eight points Ushuru are five adrift of surprise league leaders Kibera All Stars.
