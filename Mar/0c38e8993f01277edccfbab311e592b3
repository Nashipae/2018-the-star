The beneficiaries will be drawn from technical training institutions in Nairobi, Machakos, Kilifi, Nakuru, Nyeri, Uasin Gishu, Kisumu and Mombasa counties. They will undergo vocational training for up to six months at such institutions across Kenya. The Foundation's Executive Director Jane Mwang said those interested should be in agribusiness, automotive engineering, beauty and personal care, building and construction and domestic services. “[We are seeking] to develop a new cadre of youthful entrepreneurs in the informal sector to ease the country’s unemployment crisis and to provide a bridge to the unemployment gap that exists among the youth,” she said on Thursday.
