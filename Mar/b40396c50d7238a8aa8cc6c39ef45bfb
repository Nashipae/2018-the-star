Has the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga caused more division than unity? This is the questions many in Kenya have asked since March 9 when the two were shockingly all smiles, outside Harambee House in Nairobi, after reaching a deal. The agreement is aimed at national healing and reconciliation but some Kenyans are of the view that it has resulted in more harm than good. Matters have been worsened by happenings since Monday when lawyer and National Resistance Movement leader Miguna Miguna's second round of troubles started. Miguna was forced to leave for Canada on February 6 after stamping documents for the swearing-in of Raila as the People's President. He intensified his fight against Uhuru and DP William Ruto whom he has dismissed as dewpots. Raila is now working with Uhuru but some Opposition supporters expected him to help Miguna like he did people including businessman Jimi Wanjigi when his homes were raided and many guns found. The political ceasefire has come under sharp scrutiny after Raila failed to secure Miguna's freedom. The lawyer was detained at the JKIA as soon as he landed and the Nasa boss could not do anything to help him. He was seen running after Miguna but was not allowed to talk to him at the airport. Leaders, including Raila's political lieutenants and advisers, are now questioning the significance of the handshake that has split Nasa but given the President a smooth ride into his second term. Raila has not spoken publicly of the issue but he appeared in court to witness the sentencing of government officials who were responsible for Miguna's deportation.

Raila enjoys massive support in Nyanza and since the handshake, he is planning a tour with Uhuru. Some of the comments that numbered at least 1,000 included views that Raila had no right to treat his supporters they way he did by agreeing to work with the President. Raila had been stepping on Jubilee Party's toes alongside Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (Amani National Congress) and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya). But even they didn't know he had been having talks with Uhuru. Aa'yshah Abdulaziz wrote: "Raila should just exit the political scene. His presence is no longer needed. He can proceed wherever and enjoy the billions he signed for with Uhuru, as witnessed by his daughter and lawyer. When will we open our eyes?" Lukevester Ochola told Baba that he has outlived his usefulness so he "should be gone like yesterday", while Hannington Otieno said he fights for selfish gains. "[He is] just another nobody," Otieno said.

His pretentious handshake has aroused more hatred than love." Raila said the handshake was difficult but that he did not have a choice.

That handshake just reversed everything you ever achieved. You are the General who joined the enemy's camp. Do not lie to us about some plan." He added: "Mt Kenya mafia have you. They have mastered how to tame you. I wish you had just retired peacefully. Its certainly not a happy Easter with Miguna suffering like that."

"He has demonstrated that he cannot be trusted and will keep toeing the line of imperialism and big business," he said. "We want our country back. We are sick and tired of being controlled by vultures from the West scrambling for our resources and anchoring despots. Raila's adviser Salim Lone once said he is not naive and  will pt an end to the pact if it turns out to be unsuccessful. "Raila will continue fighting for the goals his base ardently seeks. He is not naÃ¯ve enough to believe that success is guaranteed, and will of course immediately call it off if it is not yielding results," he said on March 14.

Why sneak to Jubilee and come out with egg on the face? When will your lust for money stop? Where are Msando and Jacob juma?" Opiyo added: "They died defending you. Are you expecting Miguna to be killed by despots while you enjoy yourself?" Chris Msando had been working at the IEBC at acting ICT Manager when he was murdered in July last year. Investigations have not been included and his widow Eva Buyu has pleaded for a job saying she is facing challenges taking care of their children. Juma was a controversial businessman who was murdered on the night of May 5, 2016. Police said they found him dead in his vehicle on Lenana Road in Nairobi. Judith Matoke told Raila: "You have really failed Kenyans. How much did they pay you to forget about Msando, baby [Samantha] Pendo and all innocent lives lost fighting for you. How much? "Our only hope is in the Lord. He is the only one who can save us from this mess. You are not saying anything about Miguna, the man that swore you in. That handshake must have been the real deal."

"But you failed to defend a true Kenyan who stood firm while despots violated rights, laws and courts, and raped the entire system," he said. "You went silent. You betrayed me and the rest of us, Baba. No Easter to celebrate ... Isetiyo gi joluo moromo (you have used the Luo community for long)." Jacob Oketch said: "You single-handedly stopped a dozen of GSU officers from arresting Wanjigi but can do nothing to secure our own Miguna." But Amos Onyango said: "Happy Easter, former Lang'ata MP. You are a hero of your own kind. May God grant you more years to continue serving as a statesman. "Those blaming you for the Miguna issue must understand that you did all you could to release the General. Remind them that the law is clear and that Miguna should have followed due process." Charles Mosoti also sided with Raila and wished him a long, enjoyable life. 'Thank God you are alive to see your family. All the torture many years ago plus the political disappointments all along ... Baba, you are a shujaa (hero). Away from politics, enjoy your holidays too." Click here for the latest political news
