Some 1,800 Early Childhood Development Education teachers in Baringo county have joined Knut. “We will soon have all the nursery school teachers in the county registered in Knut so we can champion their plight, the most urgent being the TSC should employ them on permanent terms,” branch executive secretary Joshua Cheptarus said yesterday. He said they have started registering nursery school teachers and have distributed forms to the Koibatek-Mogotio branches in Eldama Ravine, Baringo Central, Tiaty, Baringo North and Baringo South. The teachers are paid Sh7,000 by the county government. Cheptarus urged the Teachers’ Service Commission to fast-track the review of their terms of service.

Kiptis, who is former Knut executive secretary in Koibatek, was addressing 800 teachers at the Boresha Sacco annual delegates’ meeting in Eldama Ravine town. He asked why the nursery school teachers were handed TSC numbers yet they still earn peanuts from the county governments. “The teachers’ names do not even appear in our county staff payroll, so we only pay them through vouchers,” Kiptis said.
