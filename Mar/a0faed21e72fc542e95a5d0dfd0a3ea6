â€‹â€‹Rights activists on Thursday implored upon Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho to ban charcoal sale. The group, led by Muslim for Human Rights, said this will deprive loggers of a market and consequently conserve the region's water catchment areas. In their message for the World Water Day, Muhuri said charcoal sale has negative impact on forest cover in Kwale and Kilifi making Mombasa prone to water shortages. Muhuri executive director Hassan Abdille said Mombasa will play a major role in environmental pollution if it continues to provide ready market for charcoal dealers. "Mombasa should join the likes of Tana River and Kitui which has banned charcoal trade. Let the county promote alternative biodegradable fuel products." Abdille made the remarks during a press conference at their offices in Nyali. The theme of this year's World Water Day is: "Nature for Water -- exploring nature based solutions to the water challenges we face in the 21st Century". Abdille said efforts to conserve the environment is a necessary venture and urged the government to invest in best practices in protecting it. "Initiative like logging should be minimised and must be environmentally friendly," the activist said. The government in February suspended logging in all forests in the country for the three months. Water levels in major rivers had dropped at alarming levels. Muhuri also faulted the Lamu Coal Plant project terming it a "setback to our continuous agitation for environmentally friendly initiatives". "We request the government to stop the construction with immediate effect," he said. The Jubilee administration says the plant will inject 1050MW into the national grid with a view of ensuring a stable power supply. There are fears that if the venture is implemented, the Lamu and neighbouring habitat will be severely damaged. The Muhuri boss vouched for wind, solar and hydro energy which he said are efficient and economical. "Experts warn that once the plant is constructed, it could severely damage the marine environment and impact on air quality," he said.
