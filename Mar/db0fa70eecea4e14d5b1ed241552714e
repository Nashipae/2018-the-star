Mandera county government and the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) are exploring partnerships that will see the establishment of a regional disease control and research center in the area. Speaking in Mandera town after meeting a team from KEMRI, Governor Ali Roba said that it was unfortunate that the county has no capacity to conduct preemptive cross border surveillance even with people from Somalia and Ethopia coming to Mandera for healthcare. Roba said the construction of a regional research center would go a long way in finding long term solutions for the population of Mandera and those from across the border. "I immensely appreciate the positive gesture by KEMRI to have a base here. We shall provide equal commitment and support in making this program a success,‚Äù he said. Before devolution, the governor said that Mandera county had suffered the worst health indicators that not only surpassed the national averages but also global ones. The county had a rate of 3,795 deaths per 100,000 lives births ,as compared to the national average of 488 deaths per 100,000 live births. The county also inherited the worst maternal mortality rate indicators not only in the country but in the world. This figures have since improved due to an increase in the number of health facilities that provide basic emergency obstetric care from 18 to 70 all which he said were operating at 100 per cent capacity. The county has also increased the number of health workers from 154 to 833 including 34 medical officers Roba said that the county inherited from the national government 154 health care workers many of whom he said were unskilled. he however said that the county had managed to increase the number to 833skilled health workers including 34 medical officers.
