Daniella and her husband Jose Chameleon are currently expecting their fifth child. Ugandans were left shocked months back when the couple sparked rumours of getting a divorce. However, the two settled their differences and seem to be getting along just fine. Lately, Daniella has been posting photos without makeup, and I must admit she looks beautiful. "Who said we all feel good with make up?" Daniella captioned her photo. Last week, she caused a lot of controversy when she posed nude for a pregnancy shoot. Some Ugandans questioned her morality, claiming the celebrity wife disrespected their culture. Regardless, she still looks stunning in the photo.
