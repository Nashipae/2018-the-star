Kuppet has sued the Teachers’ Service Commission over demarcation and non-remittance of its members’ dues. The union has accused the TSC of colluding with its rival Knut to recruit 16,014 of its members, in breach of a 2016 Recognition Agreement. “TSC has been collecting dues from our members and remitting the same to Knut despite the fact that 16,014 members enjoy benefits from our CBA,” the union said in court papers filed yesterday.  Kuppet wants the court to compel the TSC to transfer the teachers to it, and remit their dues to it without fail. The unions have been fighting over billions of shillings collected from teachers as membership fees. Some 312,000 teachers contribute two per cent of their basic pay to the unions monthly. Those who do not belong to any union pay agency fees. Kuppet says it is the sole representative of post-primary teachers while Knut represents primary school teachers.
