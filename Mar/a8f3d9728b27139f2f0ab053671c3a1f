Kirinyaga governor Anne Waiguru has filed a notice of appeal at the Supreme Court after an appellate court ordered a petition against her be heard afresh. On Friday, Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua got a reprieve after the Court of Appeal set aside a decision by a Kerugoya High Court dismissing her petition. But hours later, Waiguru, through her lawyers said that she is dissatisfied with the outcome hence her appeal at the Supreme Court. "Take notice that being dissatisfied by the Court of appeal ruling intends to appeal at the Supreme Court against the whole of the decision," her lawyers said in the notice. In the ruling, three Appeal judges Justice Mohammed Warsame, Daniel Musinga and William Ouko said Karua was not accorded justice when her petition was dismissed without hearing.
