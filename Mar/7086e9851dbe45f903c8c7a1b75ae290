Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has promised to fight for the seat of deputy minority whip in the National Assembly saying it belongs to the constituency. Odhiambo said he has intensified lobbying for the seat, saying he cannot shy away from claiming what is rightfully his. The seat, currently occupied by Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa has become the next battlefront between NASA affiliates as wrangles in the opposition alliance continue. Last week, senators ousted Moses Wetang’ula from his position as Minority leader and replaced him with Siaya Senator James Orengo. The move has caused divisions in NASA with Wetang’la saying he’s no longer interested in the position despite NASA chiefs asking the senators to retreat and resolve the matter. On Monday, Wamalwa backed Wetang’ula’s decision and said he was ready to let go his seat. “I’m ready to let go my seat if the NASA marriage is not working,” Wamalwa told KTN News during an interview. Speaking to the Star on Phone yesterday, Odhiambo said the seat belong to him because it was previously occupied by former MP Jakoyo Midiwo. Odhiambo beat Midiwo is last year’s elections. “Ford Kenya do not have the numbers to claim any seat in the House,” Odhiambo said. Odhiambo criticised Wetang’ula for threatening NASA leader Raila Odinga over his predicament. He said it was wrong for the Ford Kenya party leader to blame Raila because his ouster was approved by all NASA senators, including those from Wiper and ANC. “If Wetang’ula thinks his interest is not taken care of in NASA, then he is free to walk out quietly without threats,” Odhiambo said.
