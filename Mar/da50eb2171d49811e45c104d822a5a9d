Colours is a World Cup anthem by Jason Derulo, who collaborated with Coca-Cola. Now, local artistes in select markets will translate and localise the anthem. Tanzanian heavy hitter Diamond Platnumz will translate a Kiswahili version of the anthem featuring Derulo, and Uganda’s Budumbu hitmaker, YKEE Benda, will have a local version for the market. From South Africa, Cassper Nyovest will add a touch of hip hop to the anthem for the Southern markets. “This is an opportunity for East African football lovers and non-football fans to share in the worldwide frenzy through a locally infused touch to the global anthem,” said Rodney Nzioka, senior franchise brand manager, Kenya. “The anthem is a call to action to celebrate and be proud of everything you represent.”
