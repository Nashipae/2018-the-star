Fans of musician Kidum, born Jean Pierre, were saddened by the news that he is unwell. In a Facebook post, Kidum asked his supporters to pray for him leaving many in panic. "I was about to be discharged but the hospital has just changed that decision because they have just discovered that the poison has spoilt my kidneys. Pray for me. My enemies have to be defeated by your prayers. Yesterday I was discharged but the officials of Kenya Airways decided not to let me travel because of my condition. So I was brought back to hospital," he wrote on his social media. Well, Kidum was discharged on Tuesday evening, saying, "I am going to be discharged in 45 minutes. My God is a true God."
