Kenya is set to collaborate with Tanzania on fresh demarcation of the 760km international boundary for the first time after colonisation. Survey officials from the two countries are meeting opinion leaders across communities living at the border. The documents used for the meetings have been jointly produced by the two countries, the Kenyan head of the international boundary team Justan Koroi said. She said the exercise will avert boundary conflicts. “We will jointly have the exercise later to erect pillars to mark the boundary along the border,” she said. The Kenya International Boundaries Office indicates 238km between Lake Victoria and Lake Natron will be demarcated and reaffirmed in the current financial year ending June.
