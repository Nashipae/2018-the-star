Two senators yesterday criticised three NASA co-principals for crying foul for being left out of last Friday’s meeting between President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition chief Raila Odinga. Vihiga Senator George Khaniri and Kakamega’s Cleophas Malala, said they support Uhuru and Raila’s pact. The two spoke at a press conference at the Panafric Hotel. Uhuru and Raila agreed to bridge the political differences between the government and opposition. The pact revealed on Friday came after the two held a closed-door meeting at Harambee House. Khaniri and Malala said the move is a step to the right direction.

Khaniri told off NASA co-principals Kalonzo Musyoka and Musalia Mudavadi for distancing themselves from the pact. “This is not the time to cry foul about consultations and dialogue. We want all Kenyans to join hand and support the government for the sake of unity and development,” he said. Malala said despite the pact, the opposition will continue to call for dialogue to end electoral injustice, reconstitute the IEBC and end police brutality. “The NASA quest is not dead. We have to solve all the issues affecting Kenyans. Only that we will do it a different way this time not by going to the streets but through peaceful talks that will be agreed on by both parties,” he said.
