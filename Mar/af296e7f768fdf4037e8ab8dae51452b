Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari has said that security will be beefed up in schools to ensure the safety of teachers and students. Boko Haram militants reportedly warned the freed Dapchi schoolgirls not return to the school. The girls were freed on Wednesday. In a statement, Buhari said: "To the rescued students, we want to reassure you as our daughters, that you will freely live and pursue your dreams in Nigeria of peace and order, without fear of violence or molestation." The statement said that 107 students from Dapchi were released by the militants. The number includes two other students kidnapped in the town. At least five girls were reportedly killed when the militants raided the girls' school last month in the northeastern state on Yobe. One remains in captivity because she has reportedly refused to convert from Christianity to Islam.
