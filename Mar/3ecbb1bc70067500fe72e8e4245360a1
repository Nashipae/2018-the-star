The Roads ministry in Bungoma has set aside Sh200 million for roads and emergency bridges repairs in the county. Roads executive Collins Mukhongo on Tuesday said bridges and roads are in a pathetic condition. He said since the rains have begun and there is going to be a lot of damage the county government needs to be prepared. “We are repairing three bridges that were damaged and we will soon complete them. Students are having problems going to school and residents are facing difficulties,” he said. Due to negligence, some bridges that could have been repaired earlier to avoid huge costs are being worked on now, Mokhongo said. He said the ministry would construct and repair several roads in partnership with the national government in rural areas. “We have managed to remove cartels who used to do shoddy road jobs,” Muhkongo said. He said special groups that include women, the youth, the disabled and widows will not be left behind in roadworks. Contractors who will not finish work in time or do a poor job will not be paid, Mukhongo said. He said the ministry has more than 24 works officers who will inspect construction work to ensure diligence. Mukhongo said the ministry is working with the national government to repair the Mt Elgon road that is in apathetic shape. “Mt Elgon is the food basket of our county. It supplies foodstuff to Chwele and Kimilili markets. The road must be in good shape to ease transport for farmers,” he said. ”We have asked for Sh300 million from the Equalisation Fund for the roads in Mt Elgon,” he said. “We are appealing to ward representatives to support us. We are asking for enough funds to improve our roads,” Mukhongo said.
