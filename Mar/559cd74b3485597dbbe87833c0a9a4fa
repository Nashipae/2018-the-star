"The attack happened more than forty kilometres away from Marti area. Local administration officers are yet to arrive at the scene," a police officer who is not authorised to speak to the media said. However, Nachola ward MCA Lawrence Lorunyei said the raid might have been caused by community conflicts. He asked area residents to remain calm and maintain peace. The MCA urged interior CS Fred Matiangi to visit Samburu North to get first-hand information on cattle rustling and insecurity. Area OCS Alphonse Munga said he was not aware of the incident.
