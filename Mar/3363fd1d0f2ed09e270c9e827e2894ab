Embu Water executive Patrick Waganagwa on Thursday was shouted down at a meeting for failing to facilitate election of a committee to vet the local water company directors. The meeting was at a hotel in Embu town. For almost an hour participants interrupted his speech and engaged him in arguments. They were angry at the last-minute cancellation of the election to pick eight members of a committee that would select and vet new directors of the Embu Water and Sewerage company. Waganagwa said the election was put off to allow for more consultations but was jeered. Participants accused the county government of scheming to instal politically connected individuals in the vetting committee and in the company.
