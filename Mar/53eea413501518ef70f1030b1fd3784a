Lawyer Miguna Miguna has remained adamant that he won't fall into government's "trick" by applying for a tourist Visa. The self-styled NRM General, who was still held up at JKIA's International Arrivals lounge by press time, said applying for the Visa would take away his rights. "There is no way I will agree to what they are asking because what it does is that it waives rights that will never be restored. I know the mischief," Miguna said. He said the Immigration department was acting against a court order issued by Justice Luka Kimaru on February 15. The orders were that immigration should provide him with alternative travel document or allow him enter Kenya on a Canadian passport. "I will not fall into the trick. If I was advising a client as an immigration lawyer, I would not do it. So why should I do it for myself?" Miguna posed. Foreigners who enter Kenya on tourist Visas cannot enjoy certain privileges including participating in political activities. Miguna arrived into the country on Monday aboard an Emirates flight and was denied entry owing to the visa debacle. His lawyers Nelson Havi, Julie Soweto, and John Khaminwa were at the airport to the facilitate his entry. Also read: Miguna Miguna denied entry after refusing to apply for Kenyan visa
