An accomplice of the suspected mastermind of the Mt Elgon killings was on Friday arrested in Swam, Eastern Uganda. Benjamin Juma is believed to be the second in command after Timothy Kitai alias Cheparakach. Police have placed a Sh1 million bounty on the head of the man said to be behind the attacks which have left dozens dead and several others injured. Interior cabinet secretary Fred Matiang'i had declared a curfew in the troubled area following the attacks.

Bungoma county police boss Charles Munyoli said Juma will be charged with among others murder, robbery, and rape. He at the same time called on residents to continue volunteering information leading to the attackers' arrest. "We are doing everything earthly possible to ensure that we restore normalcy," he said. Meanwhile, Bungoma senator Moses Wetang'ula demanded the transfer of all police officers who have overstayed in the region. Speaking after meeting MCAs at his Kanduyi home, the legislator opposed the curfew saying it was now targeting innocent people. He said the curfew should be vacated and police patrols heightened in the area. "Why should we have a curfew in some regions that are not affected by the mayhem?" he asked.
