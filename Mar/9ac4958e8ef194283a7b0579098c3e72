Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru will face her political nemesis Martha Karua after the Supreme Court declined to stop
a petition challenging her win. Waiguru had asked the highest court in the land to stop the
Kirinyaga High Court from proceeding with the hearing of the petition to allow
her appear, but her application was rejected. In a decision read by Chief Justice David Maraga, the
Supreme Court ruled that it cannot stop the proceeding, saying it would be
unprocedural for them to interfere with the case. Read: Martha Karua petition against Waiguru to be heard afresh Maraga, judges Smokin Wanjala, Mohamed Ibrahim and
Justice Njoki Ndung'u said the presiding judge is due to rule on an application challenging her jurisdiction
to hear the case. Waiguru approached the Supreme Court after the Court
of Appeal set aside a decision by a Kerugoya High Court dismissing Karua’s
petition. Judges Mohamed
Warsame, Daniel Musinga and Otieno Odek directed Justice Lucy Gitarito to hear and determine the petition afresh. The judges also quashed an earlier decision directing
Karua to pay Waiguru and the electoral commission Sh10 million. Aggrieved by
the decision, Waiguru had argued the High Court no longer has jurisdiction
to hear the case, arguing that the mandatory six months’ timeline set by the Constitution had lapsed. However, the judges said the presiding judge is competent to
determine the issue of jurisdiction of her court. They were of the view that it is unnecessary for the
Supreme Court to be invited to rule on the matter while the same application
was before the court which is scheduled to rule on April 6. Related: Address me as learned petitioner, Karua tells Waiguru's lawyers  Click here for the latest political news
