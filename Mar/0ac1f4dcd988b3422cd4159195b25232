A Nairobi court has given Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria a month to settle his incitement to violence case out of court. When the matter came up for mention, the legislator through his lawyer informed Milimani senior principal magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot to give them more time to reconcile with the National Cohesion and Integration Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions. “I give the parties herein more time until April 18 for the parties to reconcile,” the magistrate ruled. In the case, Kuria has since denied charges over the infamous “panga” remarks he allegedly made while addressing a crowd in his constituency. The politician is accused of uttering words to the effect that “it was desirable to bring death and physical injury to certain persons in Kenya” while addressing a crowd on June 26, 2015, at Gatundu Stadium. He is alleged to have been urging youth to attack politicians opposed to Nation Youth Service projects. Earlier, on November 26, 2014, the prosecution had asked the court to restrain Kuria from making statements that amount to violence and ethnic contempt. The prosecution also said that, despite the reprieve in which he was released on Sh2 million cash bail, “the accused had continued with the same conduct that now forms the subject matter before the court.” Kuria was later granted a bond of Sh1 million and warned not to makefurther remarks of incitement. The lawmaker faces another hate speech case which is pending before another court. He allegedly told a crowd in Kiambu County to flush out a community which opposed the outcome of the August 8 General Election. Kuria is said to have committed this offence in September last year. He reportedly threatened to have his opponents shaved.
