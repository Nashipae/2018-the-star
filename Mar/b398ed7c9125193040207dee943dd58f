Kenya has just emerged from an unprecedentedly prolonged electioneering period, full of sound and fury, signifying things that we are still pondering. The country needs to recover from a General Election that featured not one but two Presidential elections, was preceded by violence, marked by violence and followed by violence, among other aspects of conflict. A secessionist impulse produced a resistance movement and Raila Odinga swore himself in as the People’s President. And then came the Harambee House handshake and the ongoing unravelling of NASA. The country needs to recover from many aspects of Election ’17. The President and the Opposition leader shook hands and resolved to put the past behind us and achieve a new purpose. It is time for MCAs, senators, MPs and other key political players to work in concert to provide a stable environment to grow the economy. Deputy President William Ruto has been urging Kenyans not to focus on the next electioneering cycle in 2022, yet he is busy travelling up and down the country to that end and his supporters are basically daily campaigning. Our considered view is that it is too early to start politicking again. All political players should go slow on politics for a while. Let Kenyans focus their energies on pressing national matters. Let’s get the economy going again.
