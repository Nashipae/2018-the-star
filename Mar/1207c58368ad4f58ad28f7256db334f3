The government will roll out the Inua Jamii cash transfer programme in two weeks. It is meant for those aged 70 and above and targets 520,000 new beneficiaries, bringing the number to 1.2 million. Each person will get Sh2,000 a month. Labour and Social Protection CS Ukur Yatani yesterday said they intend to spend about Sh30 billion this year on the programme. He spoke when he toured the Kenya School of Monetary Studies, where the ministry will hold a national conference on social protection from Tuesday next week. President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to open the event. PS Susan Mochache said they have enrolled 220,000 elderly people into the NHIF scheme. “We have shared all the data and it’s now upon the NHIF to roll out the programme,” she said
