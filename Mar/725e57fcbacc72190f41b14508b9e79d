The hearing of Baby Samantha Pendo’s public inquest will continue on April 6. Twelve more witnesses are expected to testify. The six-month-old baby died in August last year after she was allegedly hit on the head by police officers who were quelling protests in Kisumu. This was after Uhuru Kenyatta was announced winner of the presidential election. During the hearing on Friday, witnesses said police officers refused to help people who were rushing Pendo to hospital on August 12. Pendo’s uncle Thomas Oluoch told Kisumu resident magistrate Beryl Omollo the officers only said they sympathised with them.
