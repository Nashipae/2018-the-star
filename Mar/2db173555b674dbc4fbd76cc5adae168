Western Stima maintained their top spot in the National Super League after a resounding 4-0 thrashing of visiting Kangemi All Stars in Kisumu. John Oruko, Austin Ochieng, Hubert Kopany and John Mwita were on target for Stima, who are consequently perched at the top of the 19-team log, with 10 points from four matches.
