Kenya Sevens Rugby team on Monday lost 31-12 to Fiji in the final of the Vancouver Sevens in Canada. The two sides were meeting in a cup final for the second time after facing each other two seasons ago in Singapore, a match in which Kenya won their first IRB trophy. Willy Ambaka gave Kenya a perfect start scoring under the post with Samuel Oliech getting the extras. However, seconds later, Fiji were on level thanks to Josua Vakurunabili try. Oliech handed Kenya their second try but a poor kick from Kenya saw Fiji respond once again before the break thanks to Sevuloni Mocenacagi try. Fiji came back in the second half looking much better and scored three more tries to all but seal their second title of the season and move to the second place in the IRB rankings with 101 points, eight points behind South Africa. Captain Oscar Ouma says he was impressed by the teamâ€™s performance and he is certain the win is a build up to greater things to come. "Our targets remain the same, we are building towards the 100 points target wet at the start of the season," he said. The defeat saw Kenya pick nineteen points in Canada to remain in eighth place with sixty four points, six points behind seventh placed England. Earlier, Kenya had beaten United States 24-19 in the semi finals thanks to a last minute try from Ouma. Kenya had to dig deep after falling 19-12 in the second half with less than two minutes to go. Willy Ambaka started the comeback after his exchanges with Collins Injera and Eden Agero made no mistake as he added the extra two points to level the scores. And with less than 20 seconds to go, Collins Injera set up Oscar Ouma who raced to score at the far end to hand Kenya the crucial victory. The team is expected back in the country on Tuesday where they will start preparations for the Hong Kong Sevens as well as Commonwealth games. Click here for the latest political news
