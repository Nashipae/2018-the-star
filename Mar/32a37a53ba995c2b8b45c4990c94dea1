There is a great deal of confusion in the Opposition concerning the role of the Orange Democratic Movement in the National Super Alliance since the March 9 handshake between Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga. The removal of Senate Minority leader Moses Wetang’ula of Ford Kenya yesterday further compounded the confusion in the Opposition. Its merits aside, the move has further widened the schisms in the coalition, which for all intents and purposes is now dysfunctional. Kalonzo Musyoka’s Wiper Party, Musalia Mudavadi’s Amani National Congress and Ford-K have resolved to band together as Opposition, and alienate ODM, whose deal with ruling Jubilee is being viewed as tantamount to moving into government. We underscore for the umpteenth time the importance of the Opposition in a functioning democracy — to hold government to account and offer alternative policies.This function should not be undermined by any sweetheart arrangements, however politically correct they may seem. While the Uhuru-Raila deal has been applauded as a great stride in resolving the post-election standoff that was choking the country, we must be careful it does not morph into an undefined adulterous political relationship that is counterproductive to the country's good governance in the long run. The relationship between ODM and Jubilee must be stated clearly. The two parties must shun doublespeak and double-dealing. They must not have a secret deal about Kenya.
