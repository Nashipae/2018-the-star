The Homa Bay county government has threatened to sack extension officers who do not perform. Agriculture executive Aguko Juma on Thursday summoned the alleged underperforming officers. Juma said the majority of the officers do not report on duty, despite the many problems farmers need help in dealing with. “Farmers’ problems require help from extension officers, but they’re nowhere to be seen. Some haven’t reported to work since the beginning of the year,” Juma said. The county government has given the officers motorcycles for easy movement to farms. Juma warned that some officials will be reprimanded. The extension officers were expected to meet Juma at his office yesterday. “We’ve marked some names of those who will be reprimanded. Some will even be sacked,” the executive said. Speaking to journalists on Thursday in Homa Bay town, Juma said no extension officer will earn a salary without performing their duty. “Everybody must remain accountable.”
