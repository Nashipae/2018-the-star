About 5.2 million Kenyans capable of being economically active are unemployed or under-employed, a new household budget survey shows. This is about 27.2 per cent of the 19.3 million Kenyans who are considered economically active and are between 15 to 64 years. The base population of those economically active was reported at 25 million Kenyans. The ‘Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey’ is the second in 10 years and was released yesterday by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. It is aimed at providing a range of national and county-specific indicators necessary for assessment of the living standards of the population, give updated parameters for sharing national resources, monitoring and evaluating government programmes. According to the survey, unemployed Kenyans constitute 7.4 per cent or about 1.4 million Kenyans while the under-employed population were reported at 20.4 per cent or about 3.9 million Kenyans. “Looking at the strict definition of unemployed, it means those who are available, not working and are looking for a job,” KNBS director general Zachary Mwangi said. About 85 per cent of the unemployed were aged below 35, while the largest unemployment rate was recorded in the age group between 20 to 24 years at 19.2 per cent. Females constituted 64.5 per cent of the unemployed. According to the survey, the under-employed refer to those who work less hours than desired, but are willing and available to work for longer. It was revealed 26.6 per cent of this group are from rural areas, while 11 per cent from urban centres. The majority of the under-employed were females and made up 61.8 per cent of the group. POVERTY LEVELS While the rate of employment was reported to have increased to 17.9 million from 12.9 million reported 10 years ago, the report revealedabout 36.1 per cent of Kenyans still live below the poverty line. This was a drop from 46.6 per cent reported in 2005-06. “This means that those below the poverty line live under ( $1.9 ) Sh192.28 per day,” Mwangi said. The survey reported households whose overall consumption expenditure fell below Sh3,252 and Sh5,995 in rural and urban areas, respectively, per person per month were considered to be poor. Households whose adult equivalent food consumption expenditure per person per month fell below Sh1,954 in rural areas and Sh2,551 in urban areas were considered to be food insecure.
