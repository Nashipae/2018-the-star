A standoff is looming at Dago Primary School in Uriri constituency. A standard two pupil was sent home allegedly for not contributing money for the teachers’ porridge. Brighton Odhiambo, eight, has been at home for two weeks following the suspension. He was locked out of the end term exam for failing to pay Sh460. His father Erick Odhiambo said initialy, the reason for suspension was not communicated clearly. When the press visited the school, head teacher Joshua Opee refused to comment. Later he said the matter was blown out of proportion. He added that the child was taken from school by his father. Attempts to meet over the isse failed, the head teacher said. Opee said the school is not charging extra levies and the decision to serve teachers with porridge was passed through the Parents’ Teachers Association. Kennedy Okoth, the PTA chairman, said parents in the school decided to go an extra mile to ensure the school passes in exams. He said Odhiambo’s is an isolated case.
