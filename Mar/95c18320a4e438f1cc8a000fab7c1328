More than 250 families have been displaced by the raging floods in Magarini, Kilifi county, after River Sabaki broke its banks. Three children lost their lives after being swept away by floods in Kisiki cha Mzungu in Magarini. Kenya Red Cross Society volunteers toured affected areas on Saturday. They told journalists one sub-location three schools and a dispensary were marooned. Red Cross said in Bate 103 households in Kolobani, Kaya Dagamura, Mikuyuni and Kisiki cha Mzungu are affected. Bate can neither be accessed from Karimboni nor Dagamura. Families are stranded. Kolobani - one of the routes - is impassible. A culvert built to prevent flooding is almost broken because of water pressure. Pupils of Mgumoni, Bate and Dhololo Primary cannot go to school. The institutions are flooded. Mwangatini resident Kazungu Thoya, a milk distributor, could not reach Bate as the only access route was cut off. Myeye resident in Dagamura James Mwaringa Ngoa said he fled from his home with his family four days ago after his home was swept away by the floods.
