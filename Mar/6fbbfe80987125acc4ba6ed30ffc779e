The supremacy battle between the Senate and the National Assembly may be headed to the Supreme Court. Majority leader Aden Duale (Garissa Town) and his Senate counterpart Kipchuma Murkomen (Elgeyo Marwakwet) took the war on the roles of the two houses to social media. “Time has come for the National Assembly to return to the Supreme Court. There is confusion in the legislative work and the line ought to be drawn so the Senate knows its work,” Duale wrote on his Twitter page. In his response, Murkomen noted many problems bedevil this nation, so fights between the National Assembly and the Senate should not take centre stage. "I urge my colleagues Duale and Otiende Amollo to see the bigger picture. Don’t fear us. Come, let’s work together," he said.
