Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has declared a 90-day 6pm to 6am curfew in Mt Elgon following deadly attacks that have put residents on edge. Matiang'i made the announcement on Tuesday during a tour alongside Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa and their Lands counterpart Farida Karoney. "The curfew begins today ... I have gazetted this region as a disturbed area," he told reporters. Matiang'i noted that a major operation will be carried out during the period to ensure gangsters who have been killing and injuring people are brought to book. "I have ordered IG Joseph Boinnet to carry out a total reshuffle of police in the region," he said. When Deputy President William Ruto toured the constituency on February 25, he warned that security officers shielding or colluding with criminals will be investigated, sacked and prosecuted. Ruto asked residents in the Bungoma constituency to cooperate with security agencies in combating rising cases of insecurity. He said the Interior and Lands ministries will collaborate with the aim of reaching a permanent solution to the property disputes in the region.
