Mt. Larvena Girls brought Moi Girls’ appearances at the national arena to a halt with a 1-0 win in the finals the hockey finals staged at Nairobi School on Sunday. The newcomers will represent Nairobi Region to the Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association national Term One games next month in Embu. After playing to goalless first, second and third quarters, Joy Mwangi slotted in the all-important field goal in the 56thminute, four to the final whistle to ensure Mt. Larvena makes their maiden appearance at the nationals in 2018. But Moi Girls will have no one to blame for the defeat because they hit misses on three occasions in the opening five minutes of the game. The Ngong Road based outfit was awarded three penalty corners in the first quarter which they missed, and were punished in the dying minutes of the match. Mt. Larvena's Lilian Mutegi said: “The Game was very tough but we thank God for the win. We now shift our attention to the nationals and we look forward to giving a good account of ourselves. We beat an equally formidable team and so we have to make an impact in Embu,” Upper Hill Boys hockey lineup reclaimed the regional title by beating Dr. Ribeiro Parklands 3-1 on post match penalties in their finals. The two sides had settled for a 1-1 draw in regulation time. It must be a sweet revenge by Upper Hill who were dethroned as the regional champions last year by Dr. Ribeiro Parklands in a thrilling 3-1 defeat in the finals.
