Journalist Joseph Jamenya, who is in a 400km run to build a cardiac centre, arrived in Limuru on Wednesday evening. The reporter, who works with the Star newspaper, is seeking to raise Sh60 million to build the centre in his home county of Vihiga. He came up with the idea to run from Vihiga to Nairobi after his father died of a heart disease in December 26, 2016. Jamenya began
the run, whose theme is 'Your heart
your life' on March 5 at Vihiga County Referral Hospital, Mbale. Limuru is 28km from Nairobi. Yesterday he met Limuru subcounty administrator Peter Gichuki, who congratulated him for the initiative. “The centre will
cater for people you don't know. Your vision is broad, some children
who will benefit might become very important, respectable and famous
in this country. You are a great person to think about that,”
Gichuki said.
