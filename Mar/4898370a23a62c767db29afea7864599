The Kikuyu Council of Elders yesterday defended Health CS Sicily Kariuki against attacks after she sent KNH’s chief executive officer on compulsory leave. Kariuki has been criticised by Rift Valley leaders, who want her to reinstate CEO Lily Koros. But the elders said the CS should not be judged before an investigation of brain surgery on the wrong patient is completed. “The KNH saga has taken a tribal shape. This should be condemned. CSs should be given time to settle in their positions and streamline services,” chairman Wachira wa Kiago said. Speaking at the elders’ headquarters, Kiago said the rule of law should be upheld to unearth problems at the country’s largest referral hospital. Kariuki did what was necessary, he said. “The CS is doing her mandated job. If sending someone on compulsory leave to pave way for investigations is what she deemed fit, let the outcome judge the actions,” Kiago said, warning against politicising the issue.
