Debutants Simon Kipkorir (middle blocker), Nicholas Matui (outside hitter) and Abiud Chirchir (opposite attacker) have been named in the 16-man General Service Unit provisional squad ahead of the men’s Africa Club Championships slated for March 27 to April 5 in Cairo, Egypt. The three will get their first feel of continental volleyball if they make the cut to the final 14. Other players in the line-up are 2017 best setter Brian Melly, who will partner with Nicholas Lagat, middle blockers Wesley Rono, Cornelius Lagat, Cornelius Rotich and Shadrack Misiko, left attackers Cornelius Kiplagat, Bonifentry Wekesa, Naftali Chumba and Jacob Kirwa and veteran opposite hitter David Kirwa. “The team is talented and I am looking forward to see the players make our work harder when selecting the final team. Players must compete for the available slots because we will only shortlist the best,” said GSU coach Gideon Tarus. The police outfit’s technical bench, headed by national team head coach Moses Epoloto, named two setters, two liberos and two right attackers. They also named five players each in the middle blocking and outside hitting departments. However, Tarus intimated that he will travel with 14 best players among the 16, regardless of their home/ preferred positions. “It is not a must that we pick a certain (standard) number of players in a given position. We will mainly shortlist all-round players for the championships,” he said, adding: “After our friendly match again Kenya Prisons tomorrow, we will gauge our players and identify which departments we still have to fine-tune before traveling.” The team leaves Nairobi for Cairo on March 23.
