Scores of passengers on Sunday were forced to spend the night on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway following a major traffic snarl-up. The jam, which started around Kinungi trading centre in Naivasha, stretched for over 20km, and it took police over seven hours to clear. The problem started at around 4pm, when an accident involving two personal cars completely blocked the highway, forcing motorists to use alternative routes. The accident happened near Kinungi trading centre, a few kilometres from Naivasha town. Local leader James Kabono said a family of three in one of the vehicles was seriously injured as police moved in to try and clear the wreckage. He said matters were made worse by unruly motorists, mainly matatu drivers, overlapping. “It took us more than four hours to remove the mangled wrecks from the road, and by this time another three slight accidents had occurred, further worsening the situation,” he said. Taxi operator Louis Gakure, who was rushing a customer to catch a plane at JKIA, said most users had been forced to cancel their engagements. “This is a serious issue because some of the users of this road were forced to incur huge expenses to cater for sleeping arrangements, as the road was completely impassable,” he said. Naivasha deputy county commissioner Isaac Masinde blamed overlapping motorists for the gridlock. Masinde said police had a rough time controlling traffic, adding that they could not reach the scene where the accident happened. A snarl-up also arose on the Mai Mahiu-Narok road after a section was completely cut off following heavy rains. “The road has warning signs for motorists to be cautious when it rains. So when we approached one of the sections near Suswa, we stopped to avoid a catastrophe,” stranded motorist Pareiyo ole Munkat said.
