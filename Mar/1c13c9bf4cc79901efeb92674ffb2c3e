The Universities Academic staff Union wants Education CS Amina Mohamed to appoint a substantve vice chancellor for Moi University in Eldoret. Professor Laban Ayiro was appointed the acting vice chancellor in September 2016. Branch UASU chairman Jack Abok said Ayiro and other top managers working in an acting capacity have been unable to work effectively. “The interviews for the VC position were done long ago and the process should be completed as soon as possible so the university gets a substantive VC for proper and effective management, especially when it comes to decision making,” he said. Abok said the university has earned a reputation for appointing top officials, including deputy vice chancellors, in an acting capacity. “Even top officials in the finance department are acting. This does not augur well for the running of our university,” he said. Ayiro’s term has been extended three times. Interviews were done last year, but a row erupted over the award of marks amid claims some members of the interview panel had been influenced to downgrade Ayiro’s score.
