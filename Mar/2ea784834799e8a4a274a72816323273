The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission is developing a curriculum for voter education in schools. The commission said on Tuesday via twitter that the program will empower the youth to participate in elections. The electoral agency is working with the Ministry of Education and Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development on the project. "The curriculum will cover governance, electoral systems and processes," IEBC said. Prior to general elections, IEBC normally embarks on voter education to reduce errors during the conduct of polls. In June last year, at least 2,900 ward-based voter educators were hired to teach Kenyans how electronic identification of
voters and results transmission will work on the election day. The commission also usedÂ  live television interviews to explain the voting process to Kenyans. Click here for the latest political news
