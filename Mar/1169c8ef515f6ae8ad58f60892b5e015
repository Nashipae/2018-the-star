Property owners in Kakamega town have been told to paint the exterir of their premises before the devolution conference starts next month. The fifth devolution conference will be held in Kakamega between April 23 and 28. The event will bring together 6,000 participants. President Uhuru Kenyatta will open the week-long conference. The conference aims to create a forum to share experiences, challenges and lessons learnt since devolution started. It will also set targets for the next five years and provide a platform for players to identify opportunities for partnership. Town manager Benjamin Orwa, in a circular sent to all property owners, said the conference will be a good opportunity for the county to market itself and attract investors.
