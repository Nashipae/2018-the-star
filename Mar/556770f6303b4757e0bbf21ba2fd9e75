Rape cases must no longer be settled by traditional maslaha compensation  that makes the victim suffer, an MCA has said. And Garissa county nominated MCA Fatuma Abdi on Thursday said she will table a motion to ban use of maslaha to settle rape case. Speaking during International Women’s Day, Abdi said rapists should be subjected to the law andpunished. “The bill we intend to table will also ensure elders promoting maslaha for rape cases are jailed, regardless of their social status,” Abdi said. Kamuthe Women Network chairlady Makka Kassim condemned maslaha, saying it was previously used with good intentions by elders but has become a self-seeking venture. They accept payment from families who don’t want to be shamed by the public judicial system. “Elders are more interested in their personal gain and not justice since the victim is never part of the negotiation during maslaha,” Kassim said. “The victim is left to suffer and in most cases become traumatised because she is rejected by the community. This might lead to suicide,” she said. Abdi said women legislators will come together to convince their male counterpart to pass the bill. She asked the county executive to allocate more funds to the department of Youth, Women, Sports, Culture and Gender for programmes promoting women’s well-being. “Women have been treated as second-class citizens and denied the opportunity to vie for political positions,” she said. Assistant county commissioner Amos Onchari said the national government will assist women in the fight against rape, FGM and other criminal and oppressive practices. “I urge women to come out and report such cases. The law is explicit on how to deal with them,” he said. Women leaders and activists later held a procession through the streets. This year’s International Women Day theme was ‘Press for progress’.
