Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has vowed to act firmly against MPs who precipitate inter-community clashes in the counties. Matiang’i yesterday told the National Assembly committee on Cohesion and Equal Opportunity his team has mapped out the country and identified leaders fanning violence at the grassroots. The ministry will also crack the whip on police and administrators taking sides with rogue politicians, he said. “We have been to places where elected leaders are fomenting trouble. We will come down hard on them. This is not a banana republic. We know who is likely to cause problems,” he said. Matiang’i told the committee chaired by nominated MP Maina Kamanda his ministry will act on scrupulous owners of land buying companies who fuel conflicts. “The issue of squatters often causes conflict, but we should understand they are engineered by some politicians. Unscrupulous land buying firms mislead Kenyans. Warlords use squatters to cause problems We are contemplating drastic action. Some land buying companies have become sources of conflict,” he said.
