Water and Sanitation Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui yesterday announced the launch next month of the National Water Harvesting and Storage Authority to tap rainwater (see P14). This is a commendable move and would go a long way to help meet many of Kenya’s water deficits. Kenya’s annual droughts and floods have been worsened in recent years by the depredations of climate change. Efforts are ongoing to reduce this adversity but it bears noting that it is a situation that we can only manage but not avoid. Hence, the announcement is a timely proposition, but how this is to be assisted by the formation of another parastatal is not clear. We already have too many of those. Harvested rainwater can be used for domestic, livestock, irrigation and industrial purposes. Kenyans live in a water-scarce country with a per capita water availability of less than 600 cubic meters, well below the global threshold of 1,000 cubic meters per capita. Urban Kenyans in particular need to familiarize themselves with rainwater harvesting, a simple and old method of self-supply of water that is in most cases financed by the user. This management of water has many advantages, including use during droughts and alleviating flooding in low-lying regions. Mass water harvesting would be a good habit for Kenyans to adopt, particularly as it would help lessen storm water in sewer systems.
