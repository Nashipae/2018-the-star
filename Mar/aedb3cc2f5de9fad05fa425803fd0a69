Western Stima’s journey back to the top flight league a year after they were relegated is gathering steam after they dethroned Bidco United from the summit of the Football Kenya Federation National Super League with a 1-0 win over the weekend. The win courtesy of a strike from Dan Otie saw Stima improve their points tally to 17 from eight matches.
Following the loss, Bidco dropped to third on the log with 14 points, also from eight matches, while in second are Kenya Police — who have a game in hand. Police confirmed their status as the only unbeaten side after breaking St Joseph Youth’s unbeaten run in a 2-1 win. The loss was the first for the Nakuru-based side, having won once and shared the spoils six times.
Police have 15 points. In fourth are KCB, who, despite the absence of star striker Chrispin Onyango and head coach John Kamau - who are away in Uzbekistan with the national under 23 team - continued their hot-streak with a 3-1 win over GFE 105.
Kibera Black Stars lost ground on the title chase when they lost 2-1 to Nairobi City Stars. Black Stars, having been at the summit early this season, has dropped to fifth on the log. They are, however, only three points short of leaders Western Stima.
Also in winning form was Ushuru, who dismissed Nairobi Stima 3-1. A brace by Bill Oporia, coupled with a first half strike from Benson Amianda, saw Ushuru bounce back from a 3-0 upset by Coast Stima in their previous match.
Coast Stima also managed a 2-1 win over Isibania in Awendo while Kangemi All Stars got back to winning ways with a 2-1 win over Green Commandos at the Hope Centre. At the Mbaraki Sports Club, Talanta forced hosts Modern Coast Rangers to a 0-0 draw.
Nakuru All Stars remain bottom after suffering their eight straight loss of the campaign this time at the hands of Administration Police.
