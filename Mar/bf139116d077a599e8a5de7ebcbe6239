NASA Co-principal Raila Odinga has been urged to move with
speed and save the self-proclaimed National Resistance Movement leader Miguna
Miguna from harassment by immigration officials and the police. Speaking to The Star on Tuesday at Harambee trading centre, Siaya 
Usonga Ward ODM youth leader Michael Onyango said the ODM leader is fully aware
Miguna Miguna was deported to Canada for presiding over his (Raila) swearing
in on January 30 He said Raila should take advantage of his 'handshake' with
President Uhuru Kenyatta and save the NRM leader from persistent harassment and
intimidation by immigration officials and the police the same way he did to
ensure all NASA MPs were given back their security which had been withdrawn. “The humiliation Miguna Miguna is undergoing is because he
had braved strong political storms and sworn in Raila Odinga as the Peoples
President at a time when his co-principals deserted him. So Raila should move
with speed and save him [Miguna Miguna] from humiliation by the immigration
officials and the police,” said the youth leader. The youth leader at
the same time expressed displeasure at the manner in which the NRM leader was
handled by immigration officials and the police on arrival at the Jomo Kenyatta
International Airport on Monday night. Miguna Miguna's arrival in the country caused a stand-off at the airport as security personnel tried to deport him to Dubai. Miguna was jetting in at 2.30pm aboard Emirates EK 719 flight from Toronto to Kenya via Dubai. Immigration officers blocked his exit until he produced his passport. He was then asked to apply for a tourist Visa but refused leading to the standoff that saw journalists injured in the process.
