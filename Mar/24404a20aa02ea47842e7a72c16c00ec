Opposition leader Raila Odinga went to Milimani Law Courts on Thursday in a show of support for deported lawyer and NRM leader Miguna Miguna But he left shortly before proceedings into the sentencing of Interior CS Fred Matiang’i, Immigration PS Gordon Kihalangwa, and IG Joseph Boinnet for contempt of court. Miguna was not presented to the court as earlier directed. Raila had been pictured with businessman Jimi Wanjigi and law professor Makau Mutua. Human rights officials wore yellow ribbons in their own show of solidarity amid their demands for the government to respect court orders. Justice George Odunga convicted the three officials on Wednesday and ordered that they appear in court today for sentencing. The judge further ordered that Miguna be released unconditionally, warning that if the state officials fail to release him, the court will not grant them audience when they appear. Miguna has been deported to Dubai and his lawyers want the three jailed for six months.
