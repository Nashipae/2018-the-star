The High Court in Kiambu has stopped bar operators within the county from renewing their licenses pending the hearing and determination of a suit. The orders were issued following a petition by Governor Ferdinand Waititu who said the sale of alcohol is ruining the lives of many residents of the county. The Alcoholic Beverages Association of Kenya and their agents have also been barred from distributing and selling alcoholic drinks to bar owners within the county. Justice Joel Ngugi also gave conservatory orders prohibiting the Kiambu Liquor Welfare Group from disbanding itself. This was after Waititu expressed fears in his application that the group may disband itself and give its members the leeway to apply for liquor licenses without disclosing the location of their businesses. Kiambu county assembly passed the Alcoholic Drinks Control Bill on Wednesday, thereby, prohibiting the unregulated sale of alcohol within the county. Read: Kiambu passes Bill to control alcohol business Waititu said the Kiambu Liquor Welfare Group has failed or neglected its duty to influence its members to self-regulate the sale of alcohol thereby leading to loss of lives of residents. He also accused the Alcoholic Beverages Association of Kenya of failing to regulate the sale of alcohol thereby allowing unscrupulous businessmen to supply illicit alcohol. "In the absence of self regulation of the industry players, the sale and consumption of illicit brew substandard and adulterated alcoholic beverages will continue to thrive even with the existence of water tight laws," Waititu said.
