More than 500 former government employees persuaded into retirement with a promise of a golden handshake and other retirement benefits will know their fate on April 9.Court of Appeal judges Kathurima M’inoti, Fatuma Sichale and Sankale ole Kantai will deliver their ruling in the battle by the ex-employees for compensation.  The former workers across the country were promised more than Sh1 million each in a golden handshake, housing and transport allowances and gratuity if they signed the retirement letters. They say they had more than 10 years of pending service but were duped into early retirement.The semi-literate permanent and pensionable workers were retired in October 2012. The promise was not honoured, prompting them to move to the Labour and Employment Relations Court in Nakuru seeking reinstatement.Their petition was dismissed by Justice Bryam Ongaya on May 30, 2014 on grounds that the retirement was lawful and it had their consent.
