Tisa said police plan to press three charges on each student. "The charges include attending the illegal party, being drunk and disorderly and also drinking outside stipulated hours,' Tisa said. The owner of the bar was held for operating outside stipulated hours and he will be charged in court. The bar was also shut down during the incident which took place after midnight. Uasin Gishu County Commissioner Abdi Hassan said parties for students and children in bars have been banned in the region. “We banned such parties because they are used to sell drugs and illicit alcohol to students and children apart from the occurrence of immorality”, said Hassan. Tisa said they were working with the university administration to have the students released. “The students are innocent and were just attending the party and then head back to college,” he said.
