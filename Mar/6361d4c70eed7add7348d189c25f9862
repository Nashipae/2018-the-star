Teachers have threatened to stage a nationwide a strike soon over what they termed "poor terms of operation". This was after a reconciliation meeting between their unions and the Teachers Service Commission failed to kick off on Friday. TSC representatives failed to turn up for the meeting. On March 13, the Labour ministry's appointed Hellen Maneno as the conciliator of teachers and TSC. The group was to agree on contentions over promotion of teachers who have attained higher qualifications and the appraisal system of grading teachers performance (TPAD). The teachers are also opposed to the delocalisation policy introduced during Fred Matiang'i's time at the ministry. Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion told journalists in Nairobi that the union has applied for a certificate of disagreement to initiate the process of calling the strike. "Talks with the Ministry of Labour and that of Education have been fruitful but the employer has decided to frustrate the work done by teachers by shutting their ears," Sossion said. The conciliation process is supposed to take 30 days. "We are not going back to that negotiations table. We are moving forward and we are asking the conciliator to give us that certificate of disagreement so that we can deal with the employer in order to wipe off the rot in the TSC," he added. According to KNUT, over 30,000 teachers are yet to be promoted since 2014. "All these new policies adopted by the TSC is against international standards and cannot continue to be practised in Kenya. We are ready to fight them," Sossion said. The certificate of disagreement will allow the union to invoke Section 76 of the Labour Act that will give way for the union to move to a protected strike.
