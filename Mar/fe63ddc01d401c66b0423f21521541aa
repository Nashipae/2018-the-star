Whichever way you look at it, the push for gender parity is increasingly becoming a mainstream issue, as far as policymaking is concerned, in private and public organisations globally. Focus is shifting on the gains made so far in bolstering women’s participation in all spheres of life, and the unfinished business. This year’s International Women’s Day theme ‘Press for Progress,’ was not only timely but also indicative of the assignment ahead in the realm of advocacy and activism that has been the bedrock of transformation. When Japanese PM ShinzÅ Abe assumed office in 2012, his immediate task was to revive Japan’s stagnant economy. To achieve this, he adopted a strategy that emphasised greater utilisation of women’s skills as part of his policy, which became popularly known as ‘Abenomics’. By promoting the participation and advancement of women in the workplace, Abe demonstrated his belief in the power and value of women in economic development. Six years later, ‘womenomics’ is pushing Abenomics forward. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Japan’s female labour force participation rate has risen to 66 per cent, with women’s unemployment rate dropping to a low of 3.5 per cent. In Kenya, our Constitution advocates two-thirds gender representation in an attempt to level the playing field for women. The country has also cultivated a strong affirmative action culture and other progressive public sector policies being implemented by individual institutions. These have increased the number of women in the workplace. Globally, efforts to end all forms of discrimination against women to, among other things, enable them to achieve full and productive employment and decent work is in full gear. The Sustainable Development Goals that were globally adopted in 2015 set target for gender parity. Goal Number Five on Gender Equality explicitly calls for equality and empowerment of women and girls. In many parts of the world, significant progress has been made in women’s development and gender equality. Women like IMF director Christine Lagarde, Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, Vanessa and Serena Williams, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid, Zambian economist Dambisa Moyo and our very own Lupita Nyong’o have all excelled in various fields, making extraordinary contributions to the world. Consequently, today, young girls are growing up imagining their unlimited potential in any area of their interest. Despite this progress, women struggle to make their voices heard in local and national matters. There are still cultural and structural barriers hindering women from occupying corner offices. Efforts to reinvent the workplace for greater gender diversity have mostly degenerated to talk about pay. But diversifying leadership roles is more than just the pay gap, it is the opportunity gap. As leaders, we need to encourage, promote and support women at every turn to ensure their success, even in professions that are male dominated. Gender parity is not just a women’s issue. It’s a leadership issue. As a community, we stand to gain more from gender parity. According to the African Development Bank’s report on The State of Gender Equality in Africa, opening up economic opportunities for women would move them to formal employment. This would improve their earnings, and help families to move out of poverty while benefitting the economy. At KCB, we are a signatory to the Women Empowerment Principles gender statutes, including the SDGs, that mainstream gender and empower women. Our responsibility as a nation is to promote greater diversity and support broad and inclusive participation. This would enable gender mainstreaming to fulfil its transformative potential as a catalyst for development, but this requires sustained effort, rigorous monitoring and continual reflection. Leaders from across diverse sectors of the economy should play their part in recognising women as equal to the task. Diversity has value and empowering women to participate fully in economic activities is essential in building stronger economies and improving the quality of life for all. So, let us press for progress, collectively we can all a play part.  KCB Group Head of Corporate and Regulatory Affairs
