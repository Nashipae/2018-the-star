Doctors have threatend to boycott work if the government does not end the ongoing lecturers’ strike. Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists’ Union chairman Ouma Oluga on Wednesday said doctors at the Kenyatta National Hospital and the Moi University Teaching and Referral Hospital are overworked as a result of the strike. Oluga said doctor lecturers at the medical schools should be paid their clinical allowances to resume work. “We are giving the government notice that we may be forced to call for a strike if they don’t sort out the lecturers ‘work boycott,” Oluga said. Oluga spoke when he met more than 80 lecturers who are also doctors at the Moi University School of Medicine in Eldoret. He said the doctors have not been paid their allowances since last year. “Perhaps the government wants a total shutdown so that it understands what we are saying. We have the capacity to get to that level and the government knows it,” Oluga said.
