The Kenya Plant health inspectorate service (KEPHIS) has closed down a go down in Nakuru town for selling fake seeds. Kephis found the godown has stocked 13,200 kilogrammes of uncertified Freshco company seeds worth Sh 2.4 million. In an operation led by KEPHIS managing director in industrial area, uncertified maize seeds were found packed in bales and sacks. “The godown owners had been warned before about irregularities in the packaging of seeds. This is not the first time they have failed to adhere to the set down regulations of selling certified seeds,” Kephis MD, Dr. Esther Kimani said. The seeds seized ranged from maize, sorghum and green grams. KEPHIS has invented a special code through which farmers can distinguish genuine seeds from fake ones. She said that unscrupulous seed dealers were taking advantage of innocent farmers to sell uncertified seeds. Such seeds she said were being packaged in isolated places in order to avoid detection by investigating agencies. Kimani said that the KEPHIS labels stuck on the seized products were used fraudulently. She said that KEPHIS had a similar case with last year but they lost the case. She advised seed dealers to seek registration with KEPHIS so that they can do clean business. Most of the uncertified seeds had been sold in Molo, Nyahururu and Homabay.
