The government and private sector have been urged to consider investing in the creative art economy. This came out during the fifth Sankalp Africa Summit 2018 held in Nairobi. Creative investment includes investing in arts, artistes, musicians, and graffiti people among other talents which the youth possess. This kind of investment is wanting because it has not been taken with the seriousness it deserves in Kenya. “There is great opportunity which is yet to be tapped in the creative investment sector in Kenya which contributes to the bigger economy because the ideas are converted into products and services of the whole economy.,” Godown arts centre executive director Joy Mboya said. On his part Boniface Mwangi, an activist said that the government should support the creative industry because the arts in Kenya lack government investment and support. It should work hand in hand with the private sector to boost creative economy because lack of support has driven up unemployment as youth sleep on their talent. “Denmark has always worked with the Kenyan government in many projects and we will continue supporting it to create more job opportunities to its youth through promoting various innovations,” Danish ambassador to Kenya Mette Knudsen said. The forum aims at connecting entrepreneurs with investors, corporates and policy makers to facilitate growth strategies for the region. Kenya’s pap-mobile money access, Kopa gas from Tanzania and mhogo food emerge first, first runner up and second runner up consecutively in the innovations competition.
