It is unfortunate that lecturers have resorted to industrial action again after the government failed to table
counter-proposals to their pay demand. The strike was to start at midnight. The Universities Academic Staff Union
(Uasu) insists their members will not resume work until the 2017-2021 CBA is
concluded. From where students are standing, this is a dreadful prospect
indeed. It is not hard to imagine the disruption this will cause to campuses across this country. Learning will be paralysed, tuition and exam schedules will be in
disarray â€” all to the detriment of the students. With the high cost of
living, many students are scratching by to make it. Any extra day spent
in a university is classified as torture. Yet many are spending a year
or even two longer than scheduled. How could things come to such a
pretty pass? Who are the unthinking hardliners in government whose abdication of duty results in sweeping strike action? It
is actions like these that are making our higher education lose lustre
in comparison with other countries that used to trail us. There is no
longer certainty on when you graduate once you enroll in a public
university in Kenya This is incompetence or poor planning. Government should save face by
swiftly returning to the negotiating table with workable
counter-proposals.
