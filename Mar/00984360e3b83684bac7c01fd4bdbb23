Nyandarua assembly majority leader Kamau Gathungu dramatically escaped carjackers who had blocked the road in Ndaragwa Forest on Saturday evening. Gathungu was driving home from his farm at Magutu at 8.30pm in a downpour when he found boulders on the Nyahururu-Nyeri road. Four men shone their torches in his face. He put the car in reverse in an attempt to escape. Then his car was struck on the side by another vehidle. As he reversed, his car veered off the road and tore through bushes before hitting a eucalyptus tree and coming to a halt. “I jumped out of the car and left the engine running. They realised I escaped and chased me for about 300 metres. They gave up when I ran down a slope heading to the nearest home in a place I know well,” he told the Star yesterday afternoon. The men ransacked the vehicle, stole his phone and personal documents, including his identification card and wallet. Gathungu got help from residents who gave him a phone. He called his wife Rachael Gathungu, speaker Wahome Ndegwa and Gathanji MCA Ngumo Ngamau. Police rushed to the scene. The operation was coordinated by Ndaragwa OCS Peterson Ngare and his Ngano counterpart James Muita. Gathungu, who appreciated the swift response, said the area has been relative safe in the recent past. There is speculation that Gathungu could have ben targetted beause he is fighting illicit and second-generation liquor. On February 14, he tabled a bill in the assembly. It would compel the county government to strictly regulate the alcoholic drinks business. However, the MCA said he doesn’t want to speculate, saying it was up to the police to investigate and establish if it was a “normal” crime. A resident who spoke to the Star said the area where the legislator was attacked is a danger zone where people were attacked even in daytime. Gathanji MCA, Ngumo Ngamaucalled on the government to increae the police presence in Ndaragwa area, adding that Ndaragwa Forest is vast and needs constant patrol.
