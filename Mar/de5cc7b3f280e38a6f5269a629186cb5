Twenty-year-old Khaaliqa Nimji will be making her third appearance at the Commonwealth Games slated for between April 4 and 15 in Gold Coast, Australia. This follows High Court Judge George Odunga’s decision to uphold Sports Disputes Tribunal’s order to have fresh trials to select Kenya’s representatives, a move the Kenya Squash and Racquets Association had appealed against at the High Court. She will represent Kenya alongside male players Hardeep Reel and United Kingdom-based Chirag Shah. Chirag, who settled for position three in the fresh trials as ordered by the Sports Disputes Tribunal held last weekend, will double up as a player-coach for the squash team. He holds a Level Two coaching certificate. Second-placed teenage top brass Muqtadir Nimji (men) and former Kenyan international Violet Luchendo ( women) too are in high intensity training as reserves. In her previous Commonwealth outings, Khaaliqa, who is coached by Nairobi-based Zambian tactician Mordecai Kabamba, has not won a single match but she is positive to do much better, counting on the experience she’s gained over the years. “Hopefully from the experience I have gain and the training, I am looking forward to do better than I have achieved in the previous games. Like anyone else, I will be targeting gold medal,” said Khaaliqa, who first competed at the Commonwealth Games in the New Delhi, India 2010 edition when she was 12 and later the 2014 Glasgow, Scotland showpiece at age 16. “Well, we do not have much time left but for the that which is remaining, I’ll do what I can,” added Khaaliqa who had appealed to the SDT petitioning the manner which KSRA selected squash players James Dalidi and Eliabeth Mulwa were selected. The High Court decision is, however, a big blow to Dalidi who had invested personal resources to travel to South Africa for training ahead of the Club Games.
