Mandera security agents yesterday held day-long talks with their Somalia counterparts and urged them to share information. Mandera county commissioner Kutswa Olaka, who headed the talks, said itwas time Bula Hawa security agents in Somalia shared information with Mandera. Olaka said the porous border remains a threat to security interventions because of al Shabaab militants who cross over. He expressed confidence that once the Kenya-Somalia border security wall is complete, security will be greatly improved. Construction started in 2015. “We will neutralise the al Shabaab menace with this wall from Mandera to Kiunga in Lamu, “ Olaka said. So far, only 10km has been built.
