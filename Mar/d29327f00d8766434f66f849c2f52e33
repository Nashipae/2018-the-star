A worrisome trend is creeping back into the conduct of public affairs. It is the frequent exclusion of the media from processes that are public or require public participation. The first was the National Police Service's exclusion of the media from the interviews of the two Deputy Inspectors General of Police. That bad example was emulated by the Public Service Commission in the recruitment of the Director of Public Prosecutions that ended early this week. And now the National Police Service Commission is at it again. It has said it will not allow the media into the latest session of police vetting. Chairman Johnson Kavuludi claims that the Press focused mostly on the negative revelations in past vetting sessions. This is unacceptable. No one should prescribe for the media what to write or not. It is offensive to Article 34 of the Constitution on media freedom. “Access to information” is the right of every citizen and cannot be circumscribed in such a flippant manner. The Constitution is clear: “Every citizen has the right of access to information held by the State and information held by another person and required for protection of any right or fundamental freedom" (Art 35). Public matters must be open to public participation and those who seek or hold public office must be prepared for rigorous scrutiny. The Police are not a secret society.
