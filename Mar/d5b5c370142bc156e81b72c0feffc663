Football has always united people from various backgrounds but few use it for therapy sessions yet it offers immense physical and medical benefits. But for Everton charity arm – Everton in the Community – it is one of the best tools to help address some physical and mental health issues that cost patients dearly as they strive to access the proper treatment. It is for this reason that the charity arm of the English Premier League Club Everton camped in Uganda last week in a bid to address some health issues through football therapy. “Football is a very accessible engagement tool, very therapeutic complementary offering non-clinic intervention that has limited costs,” said Everton Football Club’s Health and Wellbeing Manager Jonathan Garside Garside was speaking during a meeting with the clinical team of Uganda’s Babutika Psychiatric Hospital with main club partner SportPesa where the they had gone to deliver a football therapy session for the hospital’s patients, many of whom are refugees experiencing post traumatic disorder. Everton in the Community intends to use sport to address the holistic psycho-social needs of both refugee children and humanitarian workers in Uganda. The charity used the opportunity to officially commence distribution of kits in Uganda under the ‘Kits For Africa’ project. The project which is a brainchild of SportPesa and its partners that aims to distribute football kits donated by football communities in Europe for distribution to grassroot teams in Africa.
