Sofapaka goalkeeper has expressed his confidence in winning the 2018 Kenyan Premier League despite being written off at the beginning of the season. The shot-stopper rubbished assertions that Sofapaka lacked the title winning mentality and sent a warning to their fellow contenders that his side had the ingredients to be crowned the new champions. Early defeats to Bandari and Mathare United saw Batoto Ba Mungu veer off the race to claim the title they won nine years ago but wins over AFC Leopards, Kakamega Homeboyz, Posta Rangers and Tusker perfectly redeemed them. “We have what it takes to win the league. The players and the bench are determined to get the crown at the end of the season. We started badly but we have gained momentum rising from the relegation zone to position five. There are no favorites in KPL and I want to caution those who feel the league is theirs to lose to think otherwise. Our focus as a team is to lay hands on the league trophy and we know it’s only victory in our matches that will guarantee us. I am happy we have no money issues in our team and this has helped us to concentrate on playing good football.” Kigonya praised the input of the new signings brought at the beginning of the season to improve their credentials. Having finished behind Gor Mahia last season, Sofapaka signed a dozen of experienced players, giving Sam Ssimbwa a welcome problem in identifying his starting 11. “They have gelled well with the rest and their contribution has been good. Most of them walked straight to the starting 11 courtesy of their hard work. Our major problem thus far is conceding easy goals and we must get a solution to this. Our defenders are good but when they expose me, I can do little to help the team from conceding. We are the second team which has allowed in many goals and as the goalkeeper, I am not happy with that. I think the coach will address that once we resume training,” he added.
