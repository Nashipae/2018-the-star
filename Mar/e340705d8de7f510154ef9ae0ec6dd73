Students are concerned about the quality of education they are receiving and lost time as the university staff strike entered the seventh day. This is the fourth strike in 14 months. Lecturers went on strike three times -106 days of work - in the 2017 academic year. They were pushing for signing and implementation of the 2013-17 CBA. Accordingto the Vice Chancellors’ committee, they will have to reschedule classes and other student activities on the timetable because of the strike be the staff. The entire academic programmes calendar of operations in the institutions will have to be rearranged. However, students feel the make up time created is negatively impacting the quality of education. They claim adjustments are done to ensure the calendar timelines do not fall far apart. The hours of contact between the students and lecturers varies for different courses. However, each unit gets at least six hours in a week. Farida Mwangi a student of Kenyatta University told the Star yesterday the make up time allocated after the last three strikes was less than the time consumed by the strike. James Mureithi, a student at Multimedia University,said the strikes “messed up” some students who were to graduate.   Moi University student leader Isaac Choge said some students have had to stay in campus for more than five years.
