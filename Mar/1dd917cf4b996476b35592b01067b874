Actor Gerald Langiri will be the face of Vazzi Clothing Line for the next one
year before talks for renewal happen. The partnership between Vazzi
Clothing and Gerald Langiri will run across TV, print and online
channels, as well as in-store as soon as the Vazzi Clothing Line roles
out its own stores in the coming year. Speaking to Word is, he explained how he got the deal. "A
close friend of mine and entertainment promoter, Anthony Kimani,Â  introduced me to Brian Onami, the owner of Vazzi Clothing Line. It just
started off after I was dressed for the show Talk Central," he said. "I asked Brian if I can be the brand ambassador
for Vazzi. He gave it a thought and later on agreed."
