Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri on Friday warned unscrupulous traders exploiting farmers that their days are numbered. He said at Kilimo House, Nairobi, that the government is committed to supporting farmers and solving their problems. The government had projected to buy two million bags of maize for Sh7 billion, but by March 22, it had surpassed that and bought 3.4 million bags for Sh10.4 billion, he said. Kiunjuri said farmers have been paid Sh7.05 billion, but are still owed Sh3.93 billion. He said the government projected low production because of prolonged drought and the invasion by Fall armyworm. “I had promised the ministry will reallocate Sh1 billion to pay the farmers and provide other resources through a supplementary budget, which is yet to be passed,” he said. The CS has directed the National Cereals and Produce Board to relocate maize from North Rift depots to other storage facilities to make room for more produce delivered by farmers. “Last week, we had 150 lorries queuing at our Nakuru stores, 124 in Eldoret, 150 in Moi’s Bridge and 35 in Bungoma. Given this situation, I directed the board to speed up the process of clearing this backlog. By last Tuesday, all these trucks had been offloaded. But queues have become longer again,” he said.
