Mathare United will occupy top spot at least for the Easter weekend after they pipped Chemelil Sugar 1-0 in a Kenyan Premier League at Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos. However, the fete could be shortlived as dethroned Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards honour their round nine matches tomorrow and Monday against Vihiga and Tusker respectively. Mathare looked a more stable side from the early stages as they looked to pick a win and continue from where they left after beating Sony Sugar in the last league action. Chemelil had a scare early in the encounter as John Waw went down after colliding with Cliff Nyakeya but was lucky to recover and continue with the proceedings. Shortly after, Nyakeya went for a long range but his strike was not strong and clinical enough to trouble Waw. But in the first half minutes added on, Nyakeya beat Waw to score his fourth goal of the season courtesy of a sublime assist from Martin Ongori, who was making his first league appearance. Chemelil, with 11 points, sit seventh on the table but may go down further should Ulinzi Stars beat Kariobangi Sharks today. Champions Gor Mahia host Vihiga United at Moi Stadium, Kisumu as they seek redemption at the local level. A draw will be enough to send Dylan Kerrâ€™s unbeaten side back to the top but a point will not be enough for their supporters in Kisumu.
