Like many stars in the world, Jane Muthoni did not have a smooth life while growing up. "When growing up, I always wanted to be an artiste. I was born into biting poverty, burdened with no secure place to call home," she tells Jeremy Damaris on a US-based TV station (Kikuyu Diaspora). At the age of seven, she started formal education at Gachoka Primary School in Gatundu, Thika district. She later dropped out due to lack of school fees but joined another school after two years where she did not manage to complete high school. "I came to Nairobi and I was employed as a house girl in Jogoo road taking care of children and doing all house hold work."
