Only 754 Kwale youths have been picked for the Kenya Youth Employment and Opportunities Project out of the 6,000 who applied. County director of youth development Charles Ayako yesterday said those picked were thoroughly scrutinised. KYEOP is a national government project aimed at empowering youths. Only those aged between 18-29 qualify. They must be those who failed to join tertiary institutions. The project will cost Sh15 billion. SH40,000 GRANT “The government launched this project last year. We asked youths to apply and picked the best 754 after thorough scrutiny,” Ayako said during a workshop in Ukunda. Of those picked, 464 will receive vocational skills training and given a five-month paid internship. The training also prepares the youths for self-employment. The rest will undergo entrepreneurial training. After that they will be given a grant of Sh40,000 to start their own businesses. Ayako said the amount will later be increased to between Sh900,000 and Sh3 million to enable the beneficiaries expand their businesses.  Beneficiaries  must participate in a business plan competition to qualify for the grant. “Youth unemployment is a major challenge and a collective responsibility that we must address,” Ayako said. National Youth Council chairperson Boniface Chege said the National Industrial Training Authority  will train the participants. The authority is one of the partners in the countrywide project.
