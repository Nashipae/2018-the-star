Tigania East MP Josphat Gichunge has said NASA leader Raila Odinga should be given a good retirement package and a state job. He applauded the unity between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila. Gichunge spoke on Saturday at Antuanduru High School during the school’s prize giving day. Gichunge said, “Raila should also be given a state job as a peace ambassador to foreign countries.” He said Raila’s image internationally had started to deteriorate when he refused to recognise Uhuru and took an oath as the people’s President on January 30. “He did good to hold talks with President Uhuru Kenyatta. It is good for development projects,” Gichunge said.
