Some 209 traders were arrested in Nyanza for selling illicit alcohol. This followed a government crackdown on the production, sale and consumption of illicit brews. The Nyanza regional commissioner Moffat Kangi yesterday said in Kisumu that a multi-agency team involved in the exercise also closed down 150 illegal premises. He said those arrested will be charged in court with engaging in illegal businesses. They will face the wrath of the law, Kangi said. He said they have identified some individuals they suspect of involvement in smuggling the illicit brews from the neighbouring countries. Kangi spoke after meeting with security officers. Traders have to produce their certifications of premises and goods. Officers involved in the crackdown include those from national security, the Kenya Revenue Authority, the Anti-Counterfeit Agency, the Kenya Bureau of Standards, Nacada and police. Kangi said some of the impounded liquor includes Waragi and Samba sachets. They will be destroyed after being presented in court as exhibits, he said.
