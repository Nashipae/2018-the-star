Nyeri county university student leaders yesterday threatened to demonstrate if the government fails to arrest the police officer who shot dead their Meru University colleague on February 27. Speaking to the press, they gave the state a two-day ultimatum to explain to Kenyans how far it has gone with the investigations. Ipoa is probing the killing. Evans Njoroge, 23, a fourth-year student leader, was shot dead by a police officer during a protest over fee increment. Dedan Kimathi University Students Council Secretary General Langat Kipkoech accused the state of dragging its feet and called on Ipoa, the Education and Interior ministries to act fast. “The witnesses are saying the perpetrator, a police officer, was seen but no arrest has been made,” Kipkoech said. He said the senior officer who gave the shoot-to-kill orders should also be charged. The youth was shot at point-blank range at a farm, witnesses said. The students also accused the Education ministry of remaining silent.They called on university leadership to undertake dialogue to solve issues rather than use police force. They called on the state to compensate Njoroge’s family for loss of their only sone. Mohammed Ali from KMTC said officers are eliminating innocent and unarmed students instead of maintaining law and order. “We shall go to the streets if that is what the government wants us to do. We have given them two days to give us clear information,” Wandemi Muchemi from MKU said. He said they won’t wait until the deceased is buried and then start following up on the matter. Njoroge will be buried in Longonot this week.
