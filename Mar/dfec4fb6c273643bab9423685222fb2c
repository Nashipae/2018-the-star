The ongoing street lighting project has steadily reduced crime cases within the city centre and in residential areas, Bunge la Wananchi chairman Henry Shitanda has said. “The street lights have made it possible for businesspeople to transact even late in the night,” Shitanda said. He told the Star on Sunday that since the lighting project was launched, cases of petty crime and robberies within the CBD have drastically declined . Umoja One MCA Mark Mugambi also said the installation of lights in residential areas has not only reduced the crime rate but also boosted business among small-scale traders. “The lights have been beneficial in my ward, especially to the Mama Mbogas, who sell their products till late,” Mugambi said. However, a few Nairobi MCAs have protested the slow rollout of the project.
