Three people believed to robbers were killed in Nairobi's Umoja 3 Mowlem area on Saturday. Police said they had been asked to surrender but opted to fire at them, prompting retaliation in the incident at about 4am. A report filed at the Buru Buru division of Dandora police station, under OB 06/31/03/18, says the three had been with a group that stole a civilian's firearm in Lang'ata. It says special crimes officers and teams from Buru Buru, Kayole and Starehe had been alerted about the Lang'ata attack. In that area, they arrested three suspects named Carlos Sunday, Eliud Maina and Caroline Njoki. "They were bungled into a white fielder which led police to Capitol Hill and later to Umoja3 where they encountered their accomplices," the report states. The suspects and their vehicle were taken to Kayole police station pending collection and interrogation by officers from the Lang'ata crimes division. Those who were killed were in their mid-twenties. They all died at the scene and their bodies were taken to City Mortuary. An invisible revolver, four 38mm gun bullets and two homemade pistols were recovered in the operation. A corporal from the Starehe division was slightly injured on the left thumb. He was taken to hospital, treated and discharged. Click here for the latest political news
