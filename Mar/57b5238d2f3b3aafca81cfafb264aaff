In February, the Association of Petrol Station Dealers, Transporters and Wholesalers threatened to sue the ERC over fuel prices. The traders accused the energy regulator of only publishing retail pump prices and not wholesale prices as required by the Energy Regulations 2010. Association chairman Francis Wanyange said fuel prices were determined without public participation as required in the Constitution. He said this has made traders to incur huge losses.
