Lobbying for the Nyeri Deputy Governorâ€™s post spilled to social media as the 14 days given by the Supreme Court elapsed on Thursday last week. Residents expected that Governor Mutahi Kahiga would have named his deputy this week. Several proposals were floated on social media on who should be deputy governor. Njeri Njoori was among the names listed. He was the running mate for governor aspirant Patrick Munene in the last election. Njoori has managed multinational companies and has a rich network of local, regional and international businesses. Some Aguuthi Gaaki ward residents want Kahiga to pick a deputy from Tetu constituency since the former governor, Wahome Gakuru, promised to allocate two executive slots to the community. By the time of his death, only one role had been issued. But the governor has said there is a lot of underground lobbying but no amount of pressure will make him pick a deputy before he is ready.
