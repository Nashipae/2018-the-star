Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya (pictured) has said ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang’ula are not his competitors for the 2022 presidential race. Oparanya has declared his interest in succeeding President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022 on the ODM ticket. He has served as governor for two terms. Oparanya said he met Musalia in Nairobi on Friday and plans to meet Wetang’ula today. On Saturday, the Kakamega governor said he would support either Mudavadi or Wetang’ula to succeed Uhuru if they stood a better chance. He said he expects the two to support him to work together in representing the Luhya community.
