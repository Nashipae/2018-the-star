Two-time national basketball champions and Nairobi region holders Buruburu Girls are targeting to bring down Kaya Tiwi at the Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) Term One Games next month in Embu. The ambitious Buruburu coach Julius Otieno said he is preparing his charges to stage a revenge on the coastal region side at the nationals competition. Last year, Kaya Tiwi under the tutelage of Phillip Onyango, eliminated Buruburu in the semis, beating them 34-21 on their way to claiming a second national title. Otieno said despite Kaya Tiwi being drawn in a tough pool, they expect them to top Pool ‘B’ while they will endeavour to come out of their group unbeaten so as to evade the coastal side in the semis. “Our main aim is to qualify for the East Africa Games. But to get there, we first need to top the pool in order to play runners up in Pool ‘B’ hoping Kaya Tiwi advances from the second semis,” he said. “They (Kaya Tiwi) have beaten us all through but this year I have prepared the team very well. We are okay in all departments and we are ready for the defending champions,” added Otieno, whose outfit won the nationals in 1995 and 2000. Buruburu are drawn in Pool ‘A’ alongside Eastern, Central and North Eastern, while Pool ‘B’ comprises of teams from Rift Valley, Western, Nyanza and Coast with Kaya Tiwi facing very minimal opposition. In the past two years that they have featured in the school games, Kaya Tiwi basketball team has won the national title unbeaten from the sub-county level. In their debut season in 2016, the squad from Kwale county only lost one match to Burundi’s Lycée du Lac Tanganyika but won the East Africa Games title. On the other hand, Buruburu have not reached East Africa Games finals despite making several appearances at the showpiece in the past 15 years.
