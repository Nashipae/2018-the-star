The Competition Authority has said it cannot confirm whether products by Eco Energy Solutions Limited save energy and are safe. The products include ‘Eco gas saver’, ‘Diesel fuel saver’, ‘Petrol saver’ and ‘Kerosene saver’ which are said to be ‘magnetic liquid’ packed in plastic containers of 30ml and should be tied around a gas cylinder to improve efficiency. The fuel saver is said to save up to 40 per cent of gas and reduces toxic fumes from the cooker. Advertisements state the liquid is not harmful to children in case it is ingesed. “We wish to notify the public that the said advert by the energy manufacturer has not been confirmed by the relevant government agencies and may cause harm to consumers,” the Competition Authority said in a statement. The authority said the magnetic liquid may not meet the requisite standards. It warned dealers stocking the product, including manufacturers, sellers, distributors and promoters they risk arrest and being jailed for five years, a fine of up to Sh10 million or both. The authority’s mandate is to improve the welfare of citizens by promoting and protecting effective competition in markets and preventing misleading market conduct.      ...
