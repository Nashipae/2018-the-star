Kisumu leaders and sugarcane farmers have opposed the selling of Chemelil Sugar Factory to a private investor as proposed by the Privatisation Commission. The stakeholders instead want the government to pump in enough money to modernise the factory and make it more productive. During a consultative meeting at Chemelil organised by the Privatisation Commission chaired by Henry Obwocha on Wednesday, they said companies such as Mumias Sugar, which have been privatised, are struggling. Present were Muhoroni MP Onyango K'Oyoo, Kisumu MCAs and former Muhoroni MP Onyango Midika. Nandi leaders were represented by county assembly speaker Joshua Kiptoo. The leaders said the land where the factory is built belongs to the community and cannot be sold without proper legal work. They said if the factory must be privatised, then whoever wants to buy it should only buy the structures, not the land. Some stakeholders say the factory should be revived to profitability before it is privatised. K'Oyoo said the government should write off loans in the sugar factories, just as it did for coffee and tea, if it is genuine about revamping the indstry. He said land issues and farmers' benefits must be tackled adequately before privatisation. “The mill is currently in low production due to obsolete machines and inadequate funds. The government should modernise it first. If it is sold now it will be at a throw away price,” K'Oyoo said. He warned the government against hastening the process, saying the livelihood of thousands of farmers depends on cane farming. The MP told the commission to do an intensive research in the sugar sector to establish the exact problems ailing the factories. K'Oyoo said selling public mills should not proceed until proper mechanisms are put in place to ensure major shareholders remain farmers.
