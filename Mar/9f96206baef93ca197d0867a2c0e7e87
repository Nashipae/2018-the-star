Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet, Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti, the Communication Authority of Kenya and the top managers of Safaricom, Telkom and Airtel Kenya will appear before the Committee on National Security. Recipients of the videos and photographs or victims of con artists who create social media pages using their names will present their cases for investigations. Speaker Justin Muturi said the matter will not be taken lightly. He told the MPs to appear before the Paul Koinange-led committee. “It is fair that when the committee sits.. you better appear before it so you present your allegations,” Muturi appealed to the legislators. Majority leader Aden Duale his Minority counterpart John Mbadi, Suna East MP Junet Mohamed, Kimani Ichung’wa (Kikuyu) Tongaren MP Eseli Simiyu and Kiminini’s Chris Wamalwa said they have been victims of the scam. “I’m sure our women colleagues will speak for themselves. My colleagues will agree with me. I was told she lives somewhere in Dandora. It is very ugly. She sends very obscene photos. If you allow us to give the number and write a statement with the police, we are ready,” Duale said. Murang’a Woman MP Sabina Chege said she has been a victim of an online con artist who used her name to solicit for funds. She said some register mobile phone numbers in their names.
