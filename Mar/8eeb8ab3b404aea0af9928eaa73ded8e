A case against five people accused of defrauding TSS has started after being delayed for a year. James Mwangi, Aweys Mohamed, Zein Ahmed, Zahir Abbas and Victor Were are charged with conspiring to defraud TSS companies of billions of shillings. They are also accused of forgery and transferring shareholders’ details without consent. First on the stand was the son of Tahir Sheikh Said, popularly known as TSS, who died in South Africa in January last year. Sabir Tahir said TSS died a shocked man after he learnt of all the loans his companies owed banks. Senior employees at his father’s companies took loans without his knowledge. The companies were used as security for the billions of shillings taken from the banks. Sabir told senior principal magistrate Francis Kyambia they had unserviced loans at the National Bank of Kenya, Habib Bank, NIC Bank, Imperial and KCB. His father was displeased when an official from NIC Bank informed him the company owed the bank Sh7.1 billion. The bank official said three companies under the TSS group of companies had taken different loans at the same bank. Juja Coffee obtained a Sh2 billion loan, TSS Grain Millers (Sh2.5 billion) and Cab Investment (Sh2.6 billion) from NIC. The official warned they risk losing the companies if they failed to pay the loans. Sabir said Aweys, one of the employees who was one of the signatories, told TSS they were expecting payment from an Egyptian company to pay the loans. Aweys and Zein left the company weeks later, leaving behind the huge debt. Upon searching Aweys’s office, documents found showed he transferred some of TSS’s shares to his wife Aisha Noor. The TSS companies owed Bank of Africa unserviced loans worth Sh1.6 billion. In January 2016, KCB advertised the sale of TSS Grain Millers to recover its money. Upon the tycoon’s death, NIC also advertised the sale of Cab Investment.
