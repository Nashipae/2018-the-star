Cement consumption also declined 8.12 per cent to 6.30 million tonnes, signalling reduced activity in the sector. KNBS data is supported by fourth quarter CBK Credit Officer Survey that polled 41 banks. Almost a half of respondents (42 per cent) reported to have tightened credit to real estate sector.

Devki Group who own National Cement that produces Simba Cement and controls 20 per cent of the market decried unhealthy competition in the market due to inflow of substandard products from regional firms “The cement being imported into the country is substandard and below the normal 50 kilogrammes. This is killing the local industry and I do not understand why the Kenya Bureau of Statistics and Kenya Association of Manufacturers are not taking action on the regional manufacturers,” Devki Group chairperson Narendra Raval said. Currently, a 50kg bag of cement retails at between $5.94 (Sh600) and $6.44 (Sh650), down from $6.93 (Sh700) two years ago. Sellers explained that the low prices are raising fears of increased low quality cement entering the market among some builders.
