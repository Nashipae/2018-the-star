Lecturers yesterday sought Parliament’s intervention to help bring the government to the negotiating table for their 2017-2021 CBA. The dons, who have been on strike since March 1, will today hold demonstrations in Nairobi to protest against the State’s failure to table a counter-offer to the deal. They want Sh38 billion factored into the 2018/19 budget to cater for pension, medical insurance, car loans, mortgages and salaries which they said are grossly distorted. “We appeal to Parliament to increase capitation of public universities.

He said the universities did not remit Sh1.56 billion and Sh2 billion to retirement benefits under the 2010-2013 and 2013-2016 CBAs, respectively. Wasonga told the committee lecturers are overworked.
