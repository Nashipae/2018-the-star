Terryanne Chebet was a business news presenter at Royal Media Service before losing her job there. She has recently ventured into business full-time. During an interview with Ebru TV, she said the experience shook her.Â "When
you think you are good at your job, then you face retrenchment, you
start losing confidence in yourself, and that is what affects most
people. It is the biggest challenge. "I had a fallback plan, I had
two business plans. You know such things when they come, you want to
deal with them privately, but this was too public and most people knew
about it. Until today,
I walk in places and even the security guards tell me 'Terryanne, aki
pole sana. Usijali, Mungu ako na plan.' I would get strong, then I get into the car and the tears come, but I had
to look strong at that time. It has taken a long while but I have had a
very strong support from some group of friends, and my family was right
there for me from the beginning. It was difficult and the most emotional
period I have ever gone through in my life." Asked if she hopes to go back to media, Terryanne said: "I
say never say never, although I think things happen the way they should
happen. If I did not lose my job, perhaps I would have to wait a couple
of years to get another baby. It was difficult balancing family and
work, though I still think everything happens in its own time. "If I do go back into media, it has to be something that will excite me again. As a media
person, you have to network, and that is what I have been doing."
