More than 50 farmers
on Wednesday accused Mumias Sugar Company for failing to honour their pledge to pay on
time for sugarcane delivered. They camped outstide the company claiming their payments from December. Mumias restarted milling in October last year after a six month closure and
pledged to be paying farmers two weeks after harvesting of the crop. However, the
farmers now claim it was a public relation stunt to woe them back to sugarcane
farming. Salimu
Namasti from Matungu, who is seeking Sh200,000 from Mumias says the procedure the miller is following in payment was
not an open one. "We
have been trying to talk to the management but every time they promise to pay
us by placing our names on the emergency list of payment but nothing has
happened" said Namasti. Other
farmers are said to be owed payment backdated three years ago. Paul
Orone from Busia is owed Sh142, 000 for sugarcane he delivered in 2016. Mumias communication manager Moses Owino said that the company never discriminates on farmers. Owino acknowledged that there were few cases of farmers who haven't
been paid since December but maintains they still pay two week after cane
delivery. "The
farmers are our number one stakeholders and all efforts are been made to make
sure that they won't be any delayed payments" said Owino.
