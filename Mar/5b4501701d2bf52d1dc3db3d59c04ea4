The government did not regard my warning in 2015 to stop borrowing carelessly and as a result, our economy is now crippling, Cotu boss Francis Atwoli has said. Atwoli said the current financial crisis has been aggravated by unethical hiking of projects from millions to billions of shillings. "The projects that had been initiated by former President Mwai Kibaki had budgets of millions, now they are being implemented at a cost of billions," Atwoli said in a statement on Thursday. Atwoli noted that the Kenya shilling has lost strength against other International currencies a situation that made Kenya be rated poorly by International Financial Institutions. "The new report by auditor general has proved right that we are in a financial crisis..... In deed we proved right as announced by both the Auditor General Edward Ouko and by the CS Treasury Henry Rotich," Atwoli said. On Wednesday, Treasury CS Henry Rotich told the Senate Finance committee that the government is 'broke' and unable to raise much in terms of revenue. He said he has petitioned Parliament to reduce county allocations by between Sh15 billion and Sh18 billion in the next financial year.

Atwoli said President Uhuru Kenyatta should be assertive and stop corruption among political leaders. "The President needs to be assertive and put his foot down to stamp out the misuse of public funds by the people he trusts," he said. He said COTU is prepared to assist the President by naming unscrupulous fellows who are pegged on leaving Kenya listed among the poor African countries.
