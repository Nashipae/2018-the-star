A case in which seven people are charged with violently robbing former Kabete MP George Muchai, his two bodyguards and a driver yesterday was adjourned to April 19. Defence lawyers sought the adjournment from Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi, saying they have moved to the High Court seeking orders to compel the prosecution to supply them with Safaricom data. They are also accused of murdering Muchai, his two bodyguards Police Constables Samuel Kimathi and Samuel Lekakeny, and driver Stephen Ituu Wambugu on February 7, 2015 in Nairobi.
