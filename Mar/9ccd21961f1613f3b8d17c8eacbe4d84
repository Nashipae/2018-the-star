Businessman Jimmy Wanjigi has filed an application at the high court seeking to quash summons requiring him to avail himself before a Nyeri court to take a plea. He says, in the application filed by lawyer Nelson Havi, that the summons are procedurally unfair. Wanjigi was this morning charged in Nyeri with importing a prohibited gun.

He argues that the action was taken with an ulterior motive or purpose calculated to prejudice his legal rights. "It is in bad faith without authority, unfair, and violates Wanjigi's legitimate expectation," Havi adds. On Wednesday more than 30 plain clothes police officers pursued and waylaid, ambushed, and stopped Wanjigi on Museum Hill. Havi said the intention was to have him seized for detention, tortured, and harassed "as was in the case for lawyer Miguna Miguna". The heavily armed officers pinned an arrest warrant on the windscreen and left. The businessman further says he has not been summoned or even questioned by anyone in respect to the offence he is alleged to have committed to warrant the plea-taking or issuance of the summons. He wants the court to stop police and the DPP from either arresting him or instituting any criminal proceedings. The court told the lawyer to supply the businessman with the charge sheet and appear in court on March 5 for directions. "They will be no need to serve him afresh. The summons are genuine and worth issued, signed and stamped. He should appear here on Monday," the judge said.
