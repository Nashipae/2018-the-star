Kisumu MPs have opposed the government’s plan to privatise sugar firms, saying there hasn’t been proper public participation. Legislators Onyango K’oyoo (Muhoroni), Jared Okello (Nyando) and Rose Nyamunga (nominated Senator) said hastening the factories privatisation will hurt cane farmers. They said farmers and leaders must be properly engaged before privatisation takes place. Kisumu hosts Chemelil, Miwani and Muhoroni sugar mills. The lawmakers spoke during the national jiggers’ awareness day themed Social Economic Empowerment for Jigger Eradication at Chemelil market in Muhoroni subcounty, Kisumu. “When I took over as the MP I found a bill in Parliament almost making the sugar industry ready for privatisation,” K’oyoo said. “The whole set up was going to be a rip off to the public that own shares.”
