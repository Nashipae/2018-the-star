Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa has said he is ready to deal with those angling to oust him from the position of Deputy Minority leader in the National Assembly. In a heated TV interview on Sunday night, Wamalwa said his position was not yet under threat. Mbita MP Millie Odhimabo is said to be preparing to take over the seat following disagreements between Ford Kenya and ODM. Ford Kenya Party leader Moses Wetang’ula was last week ousted from his position as Senate Minority leader and replaced with Siaya Senator James Orengo of ODM. “I am ready to deal with anyone salivating for my position anytime, anywhere and accordingly. I’m not a desperate politician,” Wamalwa said.
