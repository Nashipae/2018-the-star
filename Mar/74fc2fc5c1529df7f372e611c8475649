The Japanese say, if the flower is to be beautiful, it must be cultivated,” Lester Cole, American screenwriter, said. One of the flowers the Japanese have cultivated well is their culture. It revolves around cinema, cuisine, anime, manga, attire and music, all of which retain older artistic and literary traditions. Many of their themes and styles of presentation can be traced to traditional art forms. The culture of Japan has evolved greatly over the millennia, from the country’s prehistoric time JÅmon period, to its contemporary modern culture, which absorbs influences from Asia, Europe and North America. Today, their culture stands as one of the leading and most prominent cultures around the world, mainly due to the global reach of its popular culture. And there is a reason.  SPREAD OF JAPAN CULTURE In an article in the Discuss Japan forum headlined, “Japanese culture takes on the world”, KÅkami ShÅji writes: “Japanese culture has a much more prominent position in the world today than most people in Japan realise. The ‘Cool Japan’ phenomenon has really started to take off around the globe.” In his explanation of the spread of this culture, ShÅji — a Japanese playwright, director, actor, and filmmaker — notes that Japanese culture is simply regarded as something interesting and fun, and it is able to find a niche for itself overseas much more naturally. Artists were the first to become aware of Japanese culture as “cool”. And this awareness, he says, has started to become widespread in mainstream society, so that anyone who is even slightly knowledgeable about film or interested in culture in general will naturally be exposed to the pleasures offered by Japanese culture as a matter of course. This includes here in Kenya. One of the ways the Japanese have made their culture popular is through their diplomatic missions. In Kenya, for example, they have the Japan Information and Culture Centre. According to the website, this is the cultural and public affairs section of the Embassy of Japan, and as part of their cultural diplomacy efforts in Kenya, their mission is “to promote better understanding of Japan and its culture by providing a wide range of information, educational services and events to the Kenyan public”. Some of their clothing, such as the popular Kimono attire, have inspired fashion design in the country as well. Jemima Kebedi, one of the Kenyans who enjoy this culture, tells me her experience started with anime and manga, Japan’s two different storytelling media. Anime are Japanese animated cartoon videos, while manga are comics. “I am an avid watcher of Japanese anime of all genre. J-pop and especially Japanese composers were a huge influence on me after high school. I think after that, everything fell into place naturally, from learning Japanese and enrolling for aikido classes to costume play or cosplay, which I really enjoy,” she says. Kebedi is a student in the martial arts classes held at the Embassy of Japan every week. She is self-teaching Japanese language and is an enthusiast of cosplay.  COSPLAY, MANGA ENTHUSIAST Kelvin Irungu is a Japanese costume play, animation and manga (Japanese cartoon) artist/enthusiast. He sells his Japanese-inspired comics, which he has authored to fellow lovers of Japanese culture, also known as Otakus. He, however, rues a lack of comic book reading culture in Kenya. “Although the Japanese festivals are creating some interests in comics, there is generally not much interest. Only those who have interest in culture will come up and ask, ‘Hey! What’s this about?’ We are, however, making some progress,” Irungu says. Last year, he visited Japan for the 2017 Japan Language Programme for Overseas Students under the Japan Foundation. “Since I went there during summertime, it was pretty nice. And since I had already identified some of my interests in the Japanese culture, it was great to see it firsthand,” Irungu says. He is currently learning Japanese language. Eddah Gichuru, a participant of the Japan Exchange and Teaching Programme, recalls her experiences in Japan as “nothing short of amazing”. “Everything: from the selection process to getting to this beautiful and clean country, to learning the language, the amazingly rich culture and to interacting with my students. It is one journey that no money can ever equate,” she writes. She was in Japan for five years, starting August 2006. She was chosen from a group of well-qualified teachers to go and teach English. “Whilst in Japan, I was able to learn the culture, the language and make very good friends, some of whom have been here to visit. Some of the things I admired about Japan is how they take pride in themselves as Japanese. They all try to make the best out of where they are,” she says. “Their food was a little hard to get used to, as it tastes so unlike ours, but once I got used to it, I was glad; so healthy and yummy. I still remember onigiri whenever I go to the supermarket here and I want something quick to eat. I also enjoyed other dishes like okonomiyaki, katsudon, karaage and curry rice. I was also able to learn karate and for a short while, I did taiko (Japanese drumming). I really enjoyed my stay there.”  JAPANESE PROGRAMMES The Japan Foundation conducts programmes in the three major areas of arts and cultural exchange: Japanese-Language Education Overseas, Japanese Studies and Intellectual Exchange and Strengthening Cultural Exchange in Asia. In each of these areas, there are programmes supported by the government of Japan and individuals and organisations involved in the international exchanges. Arts and Cultural Exchange, for example, organises programmes to introduce aspects of Japanese arts and culture across the globe. It benefits many, among them Irungu. Under the Japanese–Language Education Overseas, the Japan Foundation develops infrastructure and environment to teach the Japanese language. During the annual Japanese Cultural Festival in Kenya, guests have an opportunity to experience old and new aspects of Japanese culture, such as martial art demonstrations, which include judo, karate and aikido, Japanese pop culture, performing arts and exhibitions. Movies are screened for free at the Cultural Centre on a monthly basis. So what is the benefit of learning the Japanese culture or language? It is a plus when looking for employment or business opportunities, or when learning in Japan. Some of the students say it is by itself an adventure.
