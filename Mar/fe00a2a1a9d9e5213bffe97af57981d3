Kenya Pipeline launch their Africa Club Championships campaign with a tricky tie against El Shams of Egypt in Pool ‘C’ as the 2018 women’s tournament gets underway at the Ahly Club Hall in  Cairo, Egypt today. Shams finished second last year behind Carthage in Tunisia last year while the Kenyans settled for the fifth. The national champions head into today’s match well aware of the threat posed by the North Africans, who have been on the rise in the recent times, and that a win will put them in a favourable position to finish top of the pool. Other teams in Pool ‘C’ are FAP (Cameroon) DGSP (Congo) and Vision of Uganda. Kenya Prison’s, who have been drawn in relatively easy Pool ‘D’ against Injis (Cameroon), Donnes (Burkina Faso), Customs (Nigeria) and Asec (Cote D’voire) start the competition with a rest day. Customs take on Injis as Asec play Donnes. However, Prisons, the reigning bronze medalists, take to the court tomorrow with a clash against Customs. Prisons’ coach Josp Barasa observed that they have been thrown into a favourable pool but noted they will not underrate their opponents. Barasa said: “On paper, we are in an easy pool but that does not mean we will be complacent. We have seen some of our opponents’ training sessions and we just have to be cautious when we play them.” “On Wednesday, we look forward to start the campaign on high. Our objective is to finish top of our pool and see what happens thereafter. I know it’s not going to be easy but it can be done,” added the national women’s team assistant coach. Pool ‘A’ has four teams where hosts and last year’s fourth-place finishers Ahly of Egypt take on Nkumba of Uganda today in the opening match while Rwanda Revenue Authority take on Nyong of Cameroon. Chlef of Algeria face off with champions Carthage of Tunisia in Pool ‘B’ opener today as Harare City (Zimbabwe) square it off with Botswana Defence Force (Botswana) while Bafia of Cameroon take a rest day.
