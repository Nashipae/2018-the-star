KCB Group’s full year net profit for 2017 stagnated at Sh19.7 billion on political uncertainty in East Africa, the interest cap regime in Kenya and high restructuring costs. The regional lender, however, defied the tough economic environment to push its operating income to Sh71.4 billion during the year under review compared to Sh69.5 billion in 2016, while its net interest income rose three per cent to Sh48.4 billion up from Sh47 billion. CEO Joshua Oigara attributed the growth to the bank’s innovative digital platforms. The lender will continue to invest heavily in innovative products in line with the sector’s vision to go branchless. He revealed KCB is working with technology firm Huawei to upgrade its digital system that will see its transactions rise threefold, from 30 to 100 transactions per second. “The business maintained a strong capital position enabling continued focus on our core lending segments in retail and corporate banking,” Oigara said. He said the bank invested in key strategic themes focussed on delivering top-notch customer service and leveraging digital channels for delivery of financial solutions resulting in the sustained growth in shareholder value. Eighty-seven per cent of transactions were handled outside the branch network, causing high redundancy costs.
