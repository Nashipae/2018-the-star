Nema officers arrested three people found using the banned plastic bags in Bungoma on Thursday. The shopkeeper and two fruit vendors were arrested at Chwele market in Kabuchai Constituency during a crackdown on business people at the county's markets. Kipkoech Rop, Bungoma's director of the National Environment Management Authority, said the three were found packing items into these bags for their customers. He said they will be charged to stamp the seriousness of protecting the environment. Rop said they had received reports on the smuggling of plastic bags from Uganda through Lwakhakaha border. But he noted police and county enforcement officers were effecting the ban. "I urge residents and businessmen in markets in Kimilili, Chwele, Bungoma, Webuye and Kapsokwony to abide by the law since the penalties are very stiff." The official cited Section 140 of the Environment Act which notes fines of between Sh2 million and Sh4 million. "Resident must just obey the law," he said, noting the value of their stock is too little compared to this. "The other day we arrested fruit vendors and realised those who break rules have stock with a gross value of less than Sh1,000." He noted the people were educated after the ban came into force in August 2017. At least seven people have been arrested and charged for the offence since then.
