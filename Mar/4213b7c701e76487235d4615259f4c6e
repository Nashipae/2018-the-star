Kenya Sevens head coach Innocent Simiyu will be seeking to bolster the team’s defence ahead of the next month’s Hong Kong, Commonwealth Games and Singapore Sevens tournaments. Shujaa face Australia, Canada and Spain in Hong Kong next month before travelling to the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast and later in the month to the Singapore Sevens. “The team has performed well in the past legs and I am happy with their progress. I want the defence to be a bit stronger for the events ahead of us as we are pitted against strong teams. If we could reduce the rate in which we concede tries, then our chances of winning the Main Cup would be very high,” added Simiyu. The tactician said he is not under pressure to select teams for the upcoming assignments, noting that he had depth in his squad. “I am not under pressure to select squads for next month’s assignments. I have depth and all the boys are fit apart from long term absentee Dennis Ombachi who might return after Singapore Sevens,” he noted. Meanwhile, Ministry of Sports director of administration Haroun Komen has challenged Shujaa to motivate their women’s side, Lionesses to actively participate in international tournaments. The administrator said that a joint training would boost the confidence of the Kenyan girls. “ I begin by congratulating you the men’s side for the good job you did in Canada. It wasn’t by luck and it came through hard work, team work and self belief. I challenge you to inspire the ladies to actively play rugby and help us show the world that there is rugby played in Kenya. I suggest a joint training program would help boost their confidence and endurance,” added Komen.
