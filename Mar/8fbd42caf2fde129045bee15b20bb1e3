The national government is implementing water projects worth Sh3.3 billion, CS Simon Chelugui has said. He said the projects will make Murang’a one of the first counties in the country to attain 100 per cent water connectivity. Chelugui said the government is constructing eight water projects. They include Ithanga water supply (Sh1.2 billion), Gatanga (Sh300 million), Murang’a (Sh800 million), Gatango (Sh250 million) and Kayahwe (Sh150 million). The ministry is constructing Ichiche-Kiruri-Makombi water project at a cost of Sh280 million and Murang’a distribution networks project worth Sh300 million. The water projects are being constructed as a way of giving back to the county for the construction of the Sh6.6 billion Northern Collector Tunnel. It will channel water from three rivers into Ndakaini Dam and boost Nairobi water supply. Chelugui met Murang’a leaders on Thursday. He said some of the projects are already completed, while others are in the construction process. Murang’a, he said, is endowed with many permanent water sources. The projects are being done in collaboration with partners to ensure the majority of locals can access tap water. He added that the ministry is working with the Murang’a county government to develop a master plan to establish a long-term water investments for up to 2042. “We are constructing Maragua Dam to increase water supply in Murang’a,” he added. Chelugui said the ministry will facilitate continuous rehabilitation of water catchment areas. The local leaders demanded that the government should supply the tunnel’s water to Murang’a residents before it is channeled to Nairobi. Led by Governor Mwangi Wa Iria, the politicians said residents still struggle to access clean water.
