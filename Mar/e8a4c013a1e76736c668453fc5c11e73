Kakamega Deputy Governor Philip Kutima and member of county Public Service Board Maxwell Shamalla have recorded statements with the police after allegedly threatening two MCAs two weeks ago. Lazaro Anaswa (East Kabras) and Kevin Maelo (Chimoroni) recorded statements at the Kakamega central police station on March 5, claiming their lives were in danger after goons allegedly hired by Kutima and Shamalla threatened them. They said the two threatened them with unspecified consequences for supporting Lugari MP Ayub Savula’s 2022 governor bid. Kutima and Shamalla were summoned by county DCI Carey Nyawinda on March 6, recorded their accounts last Sunday and denied having any problem with the MCAs. They said the MCAs are their relatives and they would not think of harming them. PODIUM ATTACK Nyawinda said investigations are ongoing and more statements will be recorded. He said once investigations are complete, the file will be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Anaswa said the Chimuche chief and his assistant Chimoroni rescued him at a funeral last week after two goons - who earlier warned him against supporting Savula - attacked him on the podium. Maelo said goons were hired on January 24 during his homecoming party to block Deputy President William Ruto and Savula from attending, but their plans were thwarted by police. Though Kutima has not openly declared his interest in the governor seat, incumbent Wycliffe Oparanya endorsed him two weeks ago at a funeral in Malava subcounty. “It’s my wish that I be succeeded by a person from Kabras and find a running mate elsewhere. I retained Kutima as my running mate in the 2017 polls because he now knows how the government works,” Oparanya said. This set the stage for a succession battle. Though ODM has the majority in the assembly, many MCAs feel are said to feel Oparanya is coercing them to support his choice. Oparanya has declared he will run for President in 2022.
