Online land information management systems will be rolled out countrywide on Tuesday. Going digital is expected improve services, increase transparency and reduce fraud. The Lands ministry closed the Nairobi and Central registries at Ardhi House for 10 days from March 18 to clean up records and validate data. Coordinator of Government Digital Payment Nick Wambugu says the system will improve response time, services and eliminate fraud. The system provides a base for land markets, development and other economic activities. Land information management systems would benefit public programmes such as land planning, infrastructure development and maintenance, environmental protection and resource management, emergency services and social service programmes. Services to go online include transfer of ownership (transfer of lease and transfer of land), payment and issuance of land rent clearance certificates, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, consent fees, application and withdrawal of caution, registration of land documents and searches. Issuance of consent for transfer and charge will be created automatically upon application. Ministry staff and members of key stakeholders have been trained on the new system. The ministry and the government digital payment scheme trained the Law Society of Kenya and the Kenya Bankers Association this week. Both organisations are key stakeholders in land matters. They will also have access to the new Land Information Management System. All property owners in Nairobi with titles under the Registered Land Act (Repealed) and Registration of Titles Act (Repealed) who wish to make transactions on their land are required to access their details online. They have to confirm their land is listed in their profile under the ‘Manage Property’ menu by logging into LIMS via the eCitizen portal, if it is not, they need to validate it.
