Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya yesterday hinted at the possibility of ODM seeking new alliances ahead of the 2022 election. “We have decided to re-organise our party and other NASA affiliates are free to do the same for their parties. Now that in 2022, we may not have the same partners we had in 2017,” he said. "We have said there will be no riding on others’ backs." Oparanya appeared to amplify his party leader Raila Odinga's assertion a week ago that ODM will go it alone if pushed to the wall. ANC and Wiper recently said the January 30 swearing-in of Raila as People’s President was an exit strategy by ODM out of NASA. NASA comprises of ODM, ANC, Ford Kenya and Wiper Democratic Movement. Wiper and ANC said Raila is plotting to break free from the NASA agreement, which bars ODM from producing a presidential candidate in 2022, so he can run on his party ticket. Speaking during the swearing-in of county executive committee members, Oparanya said there is nothing wrong with ODM strengthening itself because the election is over. “We cannot talk about the 2022 for the next four and a half years. It’s time to build our parties,” he said. Last Saturday Oparanya said he will run for president in 2022. He said he has helped presidential candidates from Western and it is time they returned the favour. Oparanya told the county executives anyone who will be found drinking in bars and leaking government secrets will be sacked. He disclosed the county had received Sh400 million for urban development from the World Bank. Half of the money will be spent on Kakamega town and the other half will be used to instal street lights and road repairs in Mumias town. Oparanya said Kakamega town's spatial plan is ready, while the one for Mumias is being developed. “We shall carry out a major beautification of Kakamega and Mumias town and I know it will affect business people. We shall give you alternative sites for operation,” he said.
