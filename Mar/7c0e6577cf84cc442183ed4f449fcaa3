The Employment and Labour Relations Court yesterday dismissed an application by a former Kisumu Barclays Bank manager who sought Sh11 million compensation for unfair dismissal. Kennedy Maina filed the suit in 2015. He served the bank for 27 years. Justice Mathews Nduma (pictured) said the application had no merit. He also threw out a counterclaim. “The respondent did not pursue the counterclaim. The claimant demonstrated he had paid all the loans advanced to him by the company and the counterclaim is dismissed,” Nduma said.
