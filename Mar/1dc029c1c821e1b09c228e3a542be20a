University lecturers have accused vice chancellors of failing to remit deductions from their salaries. The University Academic Staff Union yesterday said the institutions have not remitted Sh3.56 billion — Sh1.56 billion in pension deductions for the 2010-13 CBA and Sh2 billion for 2013-2017 CBA. Moi University has not remitted about Sh600 million for pension funds, Uasu said. “Universities deduct money for sacco and loan clearance, but those funds have yet to reach the designated institutions,” secretary general Constantine Wasonga said.

Technical University of Kenya owes Sh15 million to unions. Appearing before the Senate Committee on Education, two unions — the University Academic and Staff Union and the Kenya University Staff Union — blamed the vice chancellors and the Salaries and Remuneration Commission for sabotaging negotiations on the 2017-21 collective bargaining agreement. This is after the Vice Chancellors Committee took over negotiations from the Inter-Public Universities Council Consultative Forum. “The government has failed to comply with the negotiation requirement by failing to produce a counteroffer. We’ve been taken in circles with the IPUCCF seeking more time to complete negotiations,” Wasonga said. The unions want the Education ministry, the National Treasury and the Office of the President to be included in the IPUCCF negotiations. “The IPUCCF has been delaying the negotiations because the council lacks important representation from the ministry, the Treasury and the OP,” he said. Uasu and Kusu have raised concern over ghost workers in the public universities. They say the university bosses have bloated the institutions’ workforce.  Click here for the latest political news
