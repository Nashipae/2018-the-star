The country is reaping the benefits of the open sky policy. It saw a low-cost carrier, Silverstone Air, introduce direct flights from Kisumu to Mombasa. Tourism industry players say the direct flights, the first in the country, will benefit at least 13 counties and save travel cost and time. Kenya Tourism Federation chairman Mohammed Hersi yesterday said the open sky policy is a game changer. “It will connect the Western circuit to the Coast. The more connections we get to the destination, the better for us,” Hersi said. On Friday, during a dinner to launch the new route in Mombasa, Silverstone Air sales manager Patrick Oketch said the Mombasa-Kisumu route was introduced due to the demand and desire to promote local tourism.
