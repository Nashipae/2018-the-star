Marigat in Baringo South have complained of harassment by police while transporting their charcoal. They said though police were acting on Deputy President William Ruto’s ban on cutting of trees in the forests, they were harassing them alathough they were using the Mathenge weed. “It is three weeks now since my 200 bags of charcoal have been stuck in the farm. I cannot transport the charcoal for fear of being arrested,”resident Charles Ol’ Lelebo told the Star on Thursday. Ol’ Leleboappealed to the government to intervene and stop police from harassing them, terming charcoal trade his sole livelihood. “Since I lost all my livestock two years ago to bandits and cattle rustlers from the negibouring community, I was happy to trade in charcoal after the state legalised charcoal burning using Mathenge, but I am now frustrated,” another resident Bernard Sambui said.
