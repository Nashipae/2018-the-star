Kitui acting county secretary Alex Kimanzi may be haunted out of office if recent utterances by Governor Charity Ngilu’s close allies are anything to go by. Kimanzi worked under former governor Julius Malombe, a fact that Ngilu’s close associates are unhappy with. Miambani MCA Alex Nganga was elected on Ngilu’s Narc party in the August election. He wants Kimanzi replaced. The overnor’s political aide Bishop Joseph Kyavoa has also made public his dislike for Kimanzi. He said Kimanzi is Malombe’s mole. Ngilu’s stand on Kimanzi’s position is still unknown. She is in the US and may respond to calls to fire Kimanzi when she returns. The Kitui county government communications team that also served under Malombe was sent on leave last week. The seven, headed by assistant director Munyasya Musya was on Monday ordered to take leave. The group could not access the office as the chief of staff ordered that the locks be changed.
