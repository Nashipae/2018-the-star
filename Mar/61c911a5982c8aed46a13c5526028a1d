The government has warned youth who joined al Shabaab to take advantage of the amnesty offer to surrender. A number of youths are believed to be leading some terror attacks in Northeastern after they were radicalised. Regional commissioner Mohammud Saleh yesterday said the government has the names of those working with the terrorist group to cause mayhem in the region. “We’re engaging elders to talk to youths and prevail upon them to surrender. Three have surrendered and two have been arrested,” he said. “I appeal to those at large to give up. We’re ready to rehabilitate them. If they ignore this, we shall go for them.” Many in Northeastern communities are sceptical of amnesty, saying they fear those who surrender may e killed. Security forces say there are no extra-judicial killings.
