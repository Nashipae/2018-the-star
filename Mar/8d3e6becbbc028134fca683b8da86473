These are crimes that require thorough investigations, she said, adding: “These are people with no fixed aboard and who should not be given bond. They have been on the run." Juma and Sichei objected the prosecution's request noting they were already in court and ready to carry on with the case. The court ordered that they be held at Bungoma GK Prison until March 19. Juma was arrested in Swam village of Eastern Uganda while on the run. He is said to be the second in command after Timothy Kitai alias
Cheparakach who is the suspected mastermind of attacks that have caused national concern. Police say a gang of 17 has killed or injured at least 35 people and raped some of the women. The government placed a Sh1 million bounty on Kitali and a special police unit has launched an operation in the area. To end the crime wave in Mt Elgon, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i declared a 6pm to 6am curfew but there have been objections, some saying a curfew is not the best approach.
