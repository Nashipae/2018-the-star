Kisumu assembly Majority whip Gard Olima on Thursday got a reprieve after the High Court suspended MCA’s request to replace him. He will occupy the position until a case filed by a group of ODM lawmakers is concluded. Thirteen petitioners sought orders to compel speaker Onyango Oloo to enforce removal and have Kisumu West MCA Paul Okiri take over. Justice David Majanja on Thursday declined to issue the orders. He said the court was exercising restraint regarding internal affairs of the assembly, especially in interpretation of its Standing Orders. In a suit filed under a certificate of urgency, the MCAs accused Oloo of refusing to effect the changes and dismissed reports that had been tabled by Olima in his capacity as the Majority whip. They also wanted the quashing of Oloo’s decision to commit to a report and resolutions tabled on March 6 by the Selection committee for debate. submissions The MCAs, led by Kaloleni Shauri Moyo’s Prisca Misachi, also want the assembly compelled to carry out a fresh selection of committee members. They want Oloo ordered to comply with the terms of the letter from ODM appointing Okiri the Majority whip. Majanja ordered the two parties to file submissions within seven days ahead of the mention date slated for May 9. The ward reps say Olima was never appointed by ODM or elected by the members of the party as required by the Standing Orders. They say the party appointed Okiri by a letter dated September 15 last year, and received by the clerk of the assembly on September 18. The leaders accuse Oloo of ignoring the letter and failing to disclose its contents to assembly members. The report presented to the House by Olima grossly violates the Constitution, the County Government Act and the Standing Orders because it purports to remove and redeploy some committee members, contrary to the requirements of the Standing Order 159, the petitioners say. The case will be heard before Justice Majanja at a date to be set.
