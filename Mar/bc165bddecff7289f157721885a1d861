The government is set to introduce a county peer review mechanism to monitor the progress made by counties after devolution. Planning PS Julius Muia said the review will also provide counties with a tool to assess themselves on their strengthsÂ and weaknesses as well share their finding with other counties. "Kenya is preparing for the launch of the second country review report. This covers the findings of the review including milestones Kenya has achieved in order to improve governance and social-economic development," Muia said in a statement. Muia said the government will focus on the recommendations made in the report in order to address any emerging issues that will be cited. The move comes after the Kenya Secretariat that has been chairing the African Peer Review Mechanism APRM under the NEPAD issued a proposal to the government for implementation. "Kenya was retained as a member of the steering committee alongside South Africa, Mozambique, Chad, Senegal, Sudan and Egypt. This committee is an executive body of the council of ministers through which the latter steers the overall agenda of the APRM," Muia said. Kenya has been chairing the committee over the last two years before it was handed over to Chad. During President Uhuru Kenyatta's leadership, the committee recorded an increase in the number of African countries who had expressed willingness to be reviewed by their neighbours.
