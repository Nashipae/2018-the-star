Farmers have been urged to grow fast-maturing crops and adopt technology to beat climate change. "If
the farmer is in agribusiness, he will be in a position to earn better returns
from several harvests in a year," East African Seeds sales and marketing manager Chege Macharia said. He spoke at Wambugu ATC in Nyeri county last Friday during the annual East African
Seeds National Farmers Day. The field
day was meant to offer solutions to challenges farmers face, such
as climate change, low production, pests and diseases. "These challenges have compelled us to come up with the field day to enlighten
farmers on importance of using the farming technology we are showing them today
so they can mitigate their effects," Chege said. Some 5,000
farmers attended the event.
