Buildings on sewer and water lines will be demolished, the Gusii Water and Sanitation Company has said. GWASCO managing director Zachary Moguche said there has been rampant mushrooming of buildings on sewer lines. He said they have asked owner of an hotel build on a sewer line to demolish it before they take action. "The company is not going to hesitate in demolishing any building constructed on the lines," Moguche told the Star in Kisii yesterday. According to Moguche, the constructions have caused blockages of sewer lines. Those found guilty of putting up their buildings on the lines risk a jail term of two years or a fine of Sh2 million or both. Moguche asked the county to consult the company before approving construction of any buildings.
