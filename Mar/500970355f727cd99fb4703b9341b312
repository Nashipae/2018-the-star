Butere MP Tindi Mwale has called on President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga to involve civil society, religious leaders, media and workers' unions in their planned talks. The MP suggested there be an all-inclusive committee that will reflect he face of the nation to handle the talks. “Uhuru and Raila should know they are not the only ones affected by the current issues in the country. They should involve everyone in solving them,” Mwale said. The MP said it is impossible to roll out reforms without involving other players core to development such as media, and the Frifday meeting should have included other individuals from across the political divide. “We don’t have to see only two people on TV deciding what’s good for the whole nation,” he said.
