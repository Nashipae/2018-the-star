School managements have until the end of today to paint their buses  yellow. Basic Education PS Belio Kipsang said buses that have not been painted yellow will not be allowed on the roads next week. He was addressing education stakeholders at St George’s Girls’ High School, Nairobi, on Wednesday. Kipsang said the Interior ministry will enforce the law without favour. “If by next week your bus has not met the standards set by the ministry, please ensure you don’t put in on the road. The rule came into effect on August 28 last year, so you had more than seven months to comply,” he said.

The Traffic (Amendment) Act, 2016 requires that all school buses and vans be yellow in colour and the name of the school written on them in black In January, the then Education CS, Fred Matiang’i, directed schools to paint buses yellow by March 30. He directed schools to use some of the Sh29.5 billion free secondary education released for first term to make the changes. The law bars school buses from operating between 10pm and 5am. Matiang’i directed traffic police to ensure the buses operate between 6am and 6pm. Kipsang said school heads found charging illegal fees will be “excluded from administration”. “If you are charging extra levies other than those stipulated by the system, you are walking on a dangerous path,” he warned. All motorists approaching schools are required to observe the 50km/h speed limit. These changes were aimed at improving the safety of pupils and teachers who use the buses.
