The National Assembly committee on Environment and Natural Resources toured the Aberdare and Mau forests to assess the extent of damage caused by illegal logging. The tour is part of a committee’s three-day engagement that will also involve meetings with members of the community forest associations and Timber Manufacturer’s Association. Committee chairman Kareke Mbiuki paid Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui a courtesy call. “There’s need for total patience from all stakeholders as far as the moratorium is concerned,” Mbiuki said.
