The two principals of the political divide – President Uhuru
Kenyatta and Opposition chief Raila Odinga – should be praised for finally
meeting and resolving to tackle some of Kenya’s abiding and seemingly
intractable problems. But they need to put the country first – there is nothing
personal about the emergent new deal. They need to carry all the other
principals alongside them, the overriding goal being to build national cohesion
and inclusivity. The hard work begins now. Many of the fundamental issues
raised in the run-up to the 12th General Election and its two
Presidential polls and in the post-election stalemate had to do with
constitutional reforms. The two principals’ deal offers a perfect opportunity
to get down to action to refine the Constitution of Kenya 2010 and make it better
so that it meets the expectations of as many Kenyans as is humanly possible. The deal should not become merely a matter of sharing
positions. It should provide a real opportunity to make a good Constitution
even better by initiating fundamental changes. Refining the Constitution calls for impressive delicacy and
skill and putting into practice all the lessons learnt since 2010. This
finessing should pay particular attention to the political system; defeating
negative ethnicity and corruption; and dealing with crime and insecurity in a completely
lawful and deterrent manner. Quote of the Day: “Leadership – leadership is about taking responsibility, not making excuses.”  — American businessman and politician Mitt Romney was born on March 12, 1947.
