Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has been granted one more month to settle his incitement to violence case outside court. Kuria is accused of uttering words to the effect that “it was desirable to bring death and physical injury to certain persons in Kenya" while addressing a crowd on June 26, 2015, at Gatundu Stadium. The case was filed by the National Cohesion and Integration Commission and the Director of Public Prosecution. In a ruling on Thursday, Milimani Senior Principal Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot said: "I give the parties until April 18 to reconcile." On November 26, 2014, the prosecution asked the court to restrain Kuria from making statements that amount to violence and ethnic contempt. The prosecution said despite the reprieve from the MP's release on a Sh 2 million cash bail, he had continued with the same conduct. Kuria was later granted a bond of Sh1 million and warned not to issue remarks that amount to incitement. Another one of the lawmaker's hate speech cases is pending in court. He allegedly told a crowd in Kiambu County to flush out a community which opposed the outcome of the August 8 general election. Kuria is said to have committed this offence in September 2017. He reportedly threatened to have the opponents shaved.
