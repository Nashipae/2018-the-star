The Public Investment Committee of the National Assembly yesterday pinned down the management of a roads agency over variation of tenders in violation of the law. The watchdog committee grilled Kenya National Highways Authority director general Peter Mundinia over the Auditor General’s report. It questioned the authority for single-sourcing the tender for the construction of the Mombasa–Miritini road. Committee chairman and Mvita MP Abdulswammad Nassir told Mundinia, who was accompanied by other Kenha senior officials, to explain why they opted for single-sourcing. The tender cost taxpayers more than Sh200 million. Nassir said construction of the road was not urgent and Kenha did not meet the laid-down procedure on when to opt for single-sourcing. “Kenha violated the law in opting for single tendering, yet the situation was not urgent, nor was the contractor the only one with expertise, he said at the meeting with the officials at Parliament Buildings. “As a committee, we will get to the bottom of this matter to ensure the public interest is put into consideration and no taxpayers money misappropriated.” Nassir told the officials that the Public Disposal Act does not allow the variation of the result in increment of the total contract price by more than 25 per cent. But Mundinia said no money was lost and the authority only opted for single-sourcing because the road was to be built within 90 days. He told the committee that President Uhuru Kenyatta had directed Kenha to construct the road as soon as possible to ease movement of goods from the port. “We had 100 days to construct the road to get the vehicles moving. No one circumvented the law. There was a direction from the President. I want to assure the committee that there was no money lost,” he said.
