Comedian Smart Joker is at pains to explain how racy sexts between him and a female companion were leaked online. The married comedian spoke to Word Is and explained, "I am aware of those screenshots, but that is not the real Smart Joker, that is not what I do, I am not the one who did that. When I was sent those things, I wondered, too." Asked about his phone number being on the racy WhatsApp screenshot messages, the comedian said that is easy to achieve with photoshop. "I am still wondering about those screenshots. All I can say is, the issue is still under investigation. There are people under the ground who are working to find out who did that." Smart Joker added, "You have seen many things happen to comedians. Utaskia 'Ohh, Churchill amefanya hivi, na unaona number yake iko hapo.' But ukimuuliza anasema si yeye alifanya hivyo. That is the same case with me." He warned that the culprit who is destroying his good name "anaenda kupata punishment, na nataka apate punishment kubwa. The person is spoiling my name. Those people, I am investigating them, and I know them but the problem is how to arrest them. They are not my friends but I know them." Asked what his wife thinks of those racy text messages, he said, "My wife knows about that but she is busy and she knows her husband. What is there for her to comment about and she knows her husband? When you are married you know your spouse, and when something happens, the spouse will know how to handle that issue because you already know them more. "I want that person who leaked those fake screen shots to face the consequences," he concluded.
