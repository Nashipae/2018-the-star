Ense Properties moved to the Nakuru High Court yesterday to block the DPP from withdrawing a malicious damage case. The issue concerns destruction of a perimetre wall belonging to Ense Properties on May 19, 2016, at Naka in Nakuru county. The company says it was worth Sh19 million. Accused of destruction are Nakuru East MP David Gikaria, activist Boniface Mwangi, former Flamingo MCA Moses Gichangi, retired journalist Elijah Kinyanjui and Naka primary head teacher Francis Kihoro. They were protesting the alleged grabbing of Naka Primary School Playground. Ense says attempting to withdraw the case, despite witnesses to testify, is an obstruction of justice. The DPP says evidence is lacking. High Court judge Maureen Odera allowed the firm to serve the accused before hearing of the application.
