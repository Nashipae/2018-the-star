Facebook shares plunged 7% on Monday, their biggest fall since September 2012. Facebook is under pressure from lawmakers in both the United States and the UK after more than 50 million users' data ended up in the hands of data firm Cambridge Analytica. “We have rebranded the entire party twice, written the manifesto, done research, analysis, messaging. I think we wrote all the speeches and we staged the whole thing,” Cambridge Analytica's Turnbull was quoted as saying by Channel 4 News of Kenya. It’s all in plain sight now but what will be done? It’s a pivotal moment for Western democracies. The Central Bank cut its benchmark lending rate by 50 basis points to 9.5 per cent on Monday, the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee said, the first cut since September 2016. Kenya's foreign reserves jumped to $8.83 billion from $7.09 billion in January, reflecting receipt of proceeds from a Eurobond issue last month, the Central Bank said. That stock, coupled with $989.8 million in a precautiounary International Monetary Fund facility, provides some buffer against exogenous shocks, according to the statement.

Kenya Airways eased 5cents to close at 11.35 ahead of its full-year earnings release today at the Crowne Plaza (where I must admit I enjoyed a delicious Lobster Thermidor at the Sikia Restaurant yesterday). These results are keenly anticipated and leadership chairman Michael Joseph and his CEO Sebastian Mikosz now own the situation. The banks have seriously outperformed in March. Counterintuitively the catalyst was the spat with the IMF which indicated that a rolling back of the rate cap was in fact imminent.
