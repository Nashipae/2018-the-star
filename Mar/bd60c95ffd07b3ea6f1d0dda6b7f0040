Kenya’s Emmanuel Korir will be hoping to take his impressive early season form to the Birmingham World Indoor Championships as he lines up in the 800m heats tonight. Following his swift 1:44.21 African record and world-leading performance in New York at the start of February, the 22-year-old head into the competition as one of the top contenders. The 2017 NCAA indoor and outdoor champion has only contested one 800m race this winter—where he recorded a two-second improvement on his previous PB. However, the feat was enough proof that will be among the men to watch in Birmingham. He will come up against experienced Polish Adam Kszczot. The Polish is unbeaten in all six of his 800m outings and clinched the event title during the IAAF World Indoor Tour. The two-time world outdoor and 2014 world indoor silver medallist notched up victories in Dusseldorf, Madrid, Lievin, twice in Torun and in Glasgow last weekend. Davis Kiplangat, the 2015 world U18 silver medallist, will be hoping for an easy passage during tonight’s 3000m heats where he will be joined by compatriot Bethwell Birgen. Birgen won the 1,500m in Glasgow while Kiplangat finished fourth in the 3,000m at the same meeting with a 7:40.12 indoor PB. Notable challengers include Kenyan-born American Paul Chelimo and Ethiopian trio of Selemon Barega, Hagos Gebrhiwet and Yomif Kejelcha. Beatrice Chepkoech, who famously lost her way at the water jump with two laps into the 3000m steeplechase final at last year’s World Championships, will be Kenya’s representative in the women’s 1,500m heats tonight. Chepkoech has scored impressive victories in the IAAF World Indoor Tour, winning with national indoor records in Dusseldorf (4:04.21) and Glasgow (4:02.21) to settle for the overall series title. Genzebe Dibaba, who made her mark on the indoor track at Arena Birmingham in February 2014 when he demolished Meseret Defar’s two mile world best with a 9:00.48 performance, remains the favourite in this event. Others are Dutch Sifan Hassan and Ethiopians Dawit Seyaum and Gudaf Tsegay.
