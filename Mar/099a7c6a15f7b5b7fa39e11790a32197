The Sh50 million Chickengate scandal case against former IEBC boss James Oswago will be mentioned on April 23. Milimani Anti- Corruption Court senior principal magistrate Lawrence Mugambi fixed the date to allow parties to agree on preliminary issues and the duration the case will take to conclude. “Come back on April 23 for recording a pretrial agreement and fixing of hearing dates,” Mugambi said. Oswago is accused alongside former IEBC official Hamida Kibwana and Trevy Oyombra. Deputy DPP Jacob Ondari said they have supplied the defence with all copies of witness statements and any other documentary evidence the prosecution will rely on during trial. The accused are facing charges of receiving Sh50 million as bribe from UK firm, Smith & Ouzman, on behalf of the defunct Interim Independent Electoral Commission to facilitate the award of tenders. Oswago is accused of failing to comply with procurement laws and receiving Sh2 million from Kibwana as inducement.
