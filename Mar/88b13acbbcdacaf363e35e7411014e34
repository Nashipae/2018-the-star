Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has put 10 new executive and 16 chief officers on notice saying they can voluntarily exit if they cannot deliver. Speaking on Thursday after the swearing-in of the executives, the Governor told them they will be monitored thoroughly. "We shall put COs under close watch to ensure they discharge their duties diligently. Some outgoing COs engaged in unnecessary looting and disrespected CECs," he added. "This  should not happen again. CECs should build rapport with the public. They should know, for example, when water pumps or ambulances have broken down instead of waiting several months or for wananchi to petition me before they act." Ojaamong said  he was shocked while in Kakamega to get reports that spare parts for county tractors were easily available. "The CEC in charge of the tractors should fire drivers who sell government property," he said. But the county boss noted the officials were talented, competent, balanced in terms of gender and representative of the whole county. "The office you are assuming should not be taken for granted. It is a rare calling for the lion-hearted. Residents expect much from me in my second term," he told them. "The role you will play in discharging your mandate will be directly proportional to my quest to leave a legacy at the end of my term in 2022." Busia Registrar Martha Wanzushi and the Governor's legal adviser, retired justice Alex Etyang, presided over the ceremony. The CECs are Isaac Alukwe (Water), Janet Manyasi (Public Service), Judith Maketso (Trade), Moses Osia (Agriculture), George Okwara (Public Works), Bernard Yaite (Culture and Sports), Grephas Opata (Lands), Phaustine Barasa (Health), Leonard Obimbira (Finance) and John Mwami (Education). Speaker Bernard Wamalwa said the Assembly will play its roles of legislation, oversight and representation. Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi and  Ojaamong's wife Judy were among those who attended the ceremony. Click here for the latest political news
