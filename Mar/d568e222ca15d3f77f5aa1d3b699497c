Outgoing Attorney General Githu Muigai said the judge was a brilliant mind, further challenging everyone to emulate his life. His classmates through Llwyer Wilfred Ndiritu also eulogised him as a peoples’ person and very friendly throughout their years in campus and even after they were admitted to the bar. Justice Hellen Wasilwa lauded Onguto for fighting for their pension scheme, which he was personally overseeing. Wasilwa also said that the judge did not benefit from the pension even though he worked on it further urging that his family is remembered so that they don’t become destitute. “He was a darling to many and a judge with an intelligent mind. As Kenyans, we have lost a strong member of the bench,” Wasilwa said. Judge George Odunga also paid tribute to his late colleague and said the best tribute to give Onguto was to emulate his life.
