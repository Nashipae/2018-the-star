Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi yesterday said health workers’ strike has been a major problem across the country. Maangi (pictured) said the workers have been boycotting work because of unpaid dues, which has resulted in Kenyans’ suffering. He said it is necessary to motivate skilled workers who form the backbone of the health system. “Health workers’ unrest has been a major problem for three months,” Maangi said at Itibo Resort. He opened the Lake Basin Inter-County Human Resource for Health Stakeholders Forum, which brings together Kisii, Nyamira, Siaya, Homa Bay and Migori.
