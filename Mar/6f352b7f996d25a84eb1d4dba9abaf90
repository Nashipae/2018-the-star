The Lands ministry yesterday unveiled plans to construct a one-stop customer care centre. Cabinet Secretary Farida Karoney said the ministry has often made headlines for wrong reasons. That will change, she said. “The reputation of the ministry has not been so good, especially the way customers are being served,” she said. Karoney made her remarks at her Ardhi House officer when she handed over the site for the proposed new customer care centre to the contractor. The CS said officers from various departments will be at the centre to help customers. The construction of the customer care centre comes against the backdrop of a report by  the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission released March 14. It showed service seekers were not adequately guided. “ Failure to establish customer service points, provide feedback and provide directions to service points are weaknesses that may lead to hoarding of information, infiltration by cartels, extortion, bribery and poor service delivery,”the EACC report
