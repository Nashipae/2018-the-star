Kenya Sevens head coach Innocent Simiyu is likely to rotate the squad for next month’s Hong Kong, Commonwealth Games and Singapore Sevens events. Speaking on arrival from Vancouver on Tuesday night, Simiyu said that with three tournaments to tackle, the players in the squad will be given a chance to prove their worth. “It’s going to be tough month but I am glad to say we have depth and we have tested some of our youngsters who have come in and will sit down with the technical bench and see who is on form to be picked for the three events,” added Simiyu. The Hong Kong Sevens is slated for April 6-8 with the Commonwealth Games rugby event kicking off on April 13-15. Singapore Sevens is scheduled for April 28-29. Simiyu said the squad will be looking to improve their performance after finishing second to Fiji in Vancouver. This was the best ever performance for Simiyu since he took over the team in 2016. “We are quite proud of how they played. For the next leg, we are looking to improve our performance and amass as many points as possible to give us momentum before heading to Gold Coast,” he added. Kenya face Canada, Spain and Australia in Hong Kong and Simiyu expects a competitive three-day event in the City state. “Nowadays, there is no easy pool. The key focus is just recovery then we can see the areas we can work on before heading to Hong Kong,” he noted. Simiyu has set his sights on winning a medal at Gold Coast during the Commonwealth Games. Kenya face New Zealand, Zambia and Canada in Pool ‘C’ and Simiyu is optimistic of winning a medal. “We stand a good chance based on our form so far in the circuit and the mental strength of the boys,” he added. Unlike the last two Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and Delhi, where the top two teams went through from each pool, the event will see only the top-ranked teams from each pool qualify for the finals. The team resume training next week.
