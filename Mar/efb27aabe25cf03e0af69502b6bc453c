Education CS Amina Mohamed will this week name the new vice chancellor for Moi University in Eldoret ending a row over the position. The tenure of acting VC Laban Ayiro ends today and officials at the ministry told the Star Prof Isaac Kosgey will be appointed as the substantive VC. Kosgey topped during interviews last year which were marred by claims some members of the panel downgraded Ayiro. Ayiro came in second, but the claims of bribery to deny him the position caused former CS Fred Matiang’i to put the appointment on hold. An Education ministry official said Kosgey’s name will be gazetted this week.
