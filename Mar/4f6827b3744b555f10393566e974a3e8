Close to 8,000 learners are now back in school in Kerio Valley after armed police officers were deployed to guard at least 100 institutions. But Education officials say some 2,000 children remain unaccounted for in Elgeyo Marakwet, West Pokot, Turkana and parts of Baringo. Heavily armed security officers are patrolling most areas in Kerio Valley to keep away bandits who have been terrorising the region. Last week Interior CS Fred Matiang'i ordered an armed police officer deployed in every school. NCIC chairman Francis ole Kaparo is expected to visit the region for peace meetings with local communities The Kenya National Parents Association said it is impressed with Matiang'i's measures. At least 50 schools were closed last month due to banditry. “We have about 2,000 children who are yet to report back to schools and we urge all parents to ensure they take the children to schools with improved security in Kerio Valley,” KNPA chairman Nicholas Maiyo told the Star on the phone yesterday. He said most of the children fled with parents from Pokot and Marakwet. Matiang'i visited Kerio Valley last week to implement new security measures to end banditry attacks. West Pokot Knut executive secretary Martin Sembelo said most schools have reopened, but there is a shortage of teachers. “Some teachers asked for transfers due to the frequent attacks along the border with Elgeyo Marakwet county, but we hope all of them will return,” he said yesterday. Some of the primary schools that have reopened include Chesegon, Cheptulel, Arpolo, Kokwo Meses, Anet, Tilingwo, Cheratak and Chemale. Secondary schools include Cheptulel Girls’, Cheptulel Boys’ and Chesumbur Mixed. County Education director Jared Obiero said classes are going on in most schools. “Schools are back to work and we have most learners in class after the government moved in to restore security,” he told the Star yesterday.
