The Kilifi government has launched a plan to mechanise farming to increase production 10-fold and improve food insecurity. The programme is meant to replace traditional farming methods that have contributed to famine. The programme was launched yesterday in Matsangoni, Kilifi North constituency. MP Owen Baya was present. The county has allocated Sh600 million for the project. Baya said his constituency can produce food to feed the entire county. Thousands of farmers will benefit. They will plough, prepare the land and plant their farms using tractors. Agriculture executive Luciana Jumwa said they have 53 tractors. More will be bought and distributed all over the county. “We want to support farmers who are willing to produce crops,’’ she said. “We intend to increase the allocation to Sh1 billion so we can fulfill our strategy,’’ Jumwa said.
