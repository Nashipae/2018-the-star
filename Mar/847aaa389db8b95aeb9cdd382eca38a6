Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula has been urged to end his ‘marriage’ to Opposition chief Raila Odinga. Speaking separately, Bumula MP Mwambu Mabonga and businessman Ledrix Waswa said Wetang’ula should not wait to be embarrassed. “We told our senator a long time ago to stop associating with Raila, but he failed to heed our advice. We ask him to leave him,” Mwambu said. They said the squabbles in NASA are not healthy. Waswa said the plot to kick Wetang’ula out of the Senate Minority leader position is an indication he is no longer welcome in NASA. Last Thursday, 16 ODM Senators voted to remove Wetang’ula and appoint Senator James Orengo. Mwambu said, “ODM leaders have armed themselves and are ready to sacrifice him. He should read between the lines and see he is unwanted in NASA.” He spoke at Kabula Secondary School. Mwambu said Raila has betrayed Luhyas many times before and wondered why Wetang’ula had forgotten this quickly. He said Raila betrayed the late and former Vice President Kijana Wamalwa, ANC’s Musalia Mudavadi, former ODM secretary general Ababu Namwamba “and has now turned his guns on Wetang’ula”. Mwambu and Waswa urged Luhya leaders to unite and speak in one voice if they want to remain relevant in 2022. Mwambu said disunity is making other communities to “play with us”. PROTESTS “We have become the laughing stock of other communities because we have failed to unite and speak in one voice,” he said. Elsewhere, Ford Kenya supporters in Bungoma on Saturday protested against ODM’s move to dethrone Wetang’iula. They said the move was a betrayal by Raila who “used and dumped Wetang’ula”. They warned him against frustrating Wetang’ula. Ford Kenya county secretary Peter Wakhuleka, youth leader Wafula Wakoli and nominated MCA Luke Opwora criticised ODM. “We can’t sit and watch as Wetang’ula is threatened. He is our leader and should be respected, he got the post courtesy of NASA, not ODM,” Wakhuleka said.
