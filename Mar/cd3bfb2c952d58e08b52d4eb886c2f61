The appeal challenging the decision to uphold the election of Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong'o will be mentioned on April 11. A notice by the Court of Appeal said the matter will be heard regardless of parties presence. Nyong'o's election was challenged by his predecessor Jack Ranguma. Ranguma has cited nine ground for his appeal. He wants the election nullified, saying the High Court misinterpreted the grounds of his petition. He also accuses Justice David Majanja of making errors by disregarding witness statements. Majanja dismissed the petition, saying Ranguma failed to prove his case against Nyong'o.
