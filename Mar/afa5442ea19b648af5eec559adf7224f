Tana River Governor Dhadho Godhana wants residents to give him space to work and stop congesting his office for him to deliver quality services. Residents flock his office to be served by him in person, instead of going to the relevant departments. The governor said the congestion is making it difficult for him to work. He said people want to be servied by him directly, which is impossible. Godhana spoke at Mikinduni trading centre in Galole constituency when he launched the distribution of 280,000 treated mosquito nets. The mosquito net programme will be carried out in the entire county in five days. “Approach the county secretary, chief of staff, my economic adviser, department executives, chief officers, directors and subcounty administrators I appointed,” he said. Since he took office in August last year, the governor served the people in person because there were no executives and other officers yet. He said now that they are available, Godhana urged residents to visit their offices instead. Only cases that require his attention should be referred to him personally, he said. “I will soon appoint a political advisor, a government spokesman and a director of communication together with chief officers to manage information flow and communication within my government,” the county boss said. Godhana said soon there will be direct and indirect county jobs. Some people will get jobs while others will be hired once development and economic structures are put in place. Vacancies which were advertised will be filed in two weeks. More jobs will be created when systems are put into place, the governor said. The governor said he would soon move to subcounties to assess development at the grassroots. Subcounty and ward administrators were urged to offer quality services. The County Integrated Development Plan is in its final draft stages and would soon be presented to the county assembly.
