The Kenya Tea Development Agency risks losing at least Sh5 billion if the government does not allow it to harvest its own trees for tea processing. Board chairman Peter Kanyago said the 68 tea factories run by small scale growers will be affected by the logging ban. “The ban affected us badly, despite the fact that we have been growing our own trees which we harvest for tea processing,” he said. The firewood is used in the factories for tea manufacturing. The only alternative is furnace oil, which is expensive. A factory like Iriaini Tea Factory has been growing trees on 494 acres, which it is now not allowed to harvest. Deputy President William Ruto banned logging after a public outcry. A task force was set up to look into illegal logging. Speaking at Iriaini in Othaya, Nyeri, on Friday, Kanyago urged the government to consider such parties that cut down trees. He cautioned authorities that issue licences to tea dealers who hawk tea, saying it disrupts the industry. Kanyago said if the matter is not handled carefully, the tea industry will collapse. The chairman also said the ongoing rains are a blessing to tea farmers since the production will double. He added that KTDA hydropower projects are also producing more than expected. Kanyago was on Friday re-elected as board member for the seventh time representing zone IV. He garnered 28 votes while his rival Paul Gitonga got two.
