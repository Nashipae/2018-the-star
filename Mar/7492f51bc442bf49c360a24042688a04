Kakamega
governor Wycliffe Oparanya has started inspecting projects funded by his
government in the first term before payments are effected. Oparanya said during swearing in of
his new executive that contractors who will be found to have done substandard
work will not be paid by the government. Oparanya was in Mumias East, Mumias
West and Matungu on Tuesday and toured Ikolomani, Lurambi and Shinyalu
yesterday. Some of the projects include schools, roads,
bridges and buildings spread across the 12 sub-counties in the county. “The Government will deploy an
electronic project monitoring system which will capture progress in
implementation of projects. This will reduce the phenomenon of stalled, incomplete
or poor quality projects,” he said. We will also adopt a value –for money
approach in implementation of projects which will reduce the widespread
practice of inflated bills of quantities and collusion between contractors, merchants
and Government Officers, he said. Oparanya is keen on his legacy as governor,
which he hopes to use as a springboard to seek higher offices in 2022 after
serving his second and final term. Oparanya said that he had established
a service delivery unit in his office that will be responsible for monitoring
service delivery across the various ministries and devolved units. He said the unit will also monitor
implementation of projects and recommend appropriate measures to ensure timely
completion of them. He said that the government will
strengthen the contract management system to weed out briefcase and incompetent
contractors. Oparanya said that his government will
also implement a centralized system of receiving, tracking and processing
invoices from contractors or merchants to create transparency in payments and
reduce the rampant delays in payments which have caused untold suffering to our
contractors and merchants.
