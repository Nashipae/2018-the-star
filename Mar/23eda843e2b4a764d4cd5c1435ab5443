Wema Sepetu has spoken out for the first time after she was accused by her nemesis, Zari Hassan, of stealing her man, Diamond Platnumz. “Diamond and I are just good friends. We have not been talking since we broke up, and we just decided to grow up. We are both mature, we decided let’s put things behind as life goes on. There is nothing surprising in me talking to him or he inviting me to his events. What shocked people is that I was invited to a Wasafi records show, so I went and he came and greeted me,” she told Tanzanian media. Zari dumped Diamond after photos of Wema and Diamond looking cozy went viral online. “Me and Diamond did not kiss or do anything ya kuonyesha mapenzi. I hug my friends, it doesn’t mean we are dating,” Wema said. “Diamond is going to be my boss because I have a show on Wasafi TV.” Asked why she looked all cozy with Diamond at the Wasafi event, Wema said, “Maybe it’s just the chemistry between him and me. There are no strings attached at all, I can assure you. The chemistry between lovers is just there, but there is nothing between us.” Asked if she would advise Zari on her relationship issues with Diamond, Wema said: “I cannot advise Zari, no, I cannot,” adding, “She has a reason for panicking over Diamond because of his past not because of me hugging him at an event. Maybe there is something else linked to that, not me. She should sit down na mwanaume wake amuulize vizuri. I have nothing to do with Diamond right now. He is just my good friend, whom we support each other.”
