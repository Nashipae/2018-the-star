Bungoma county medics yesterday ran free medical camps in troubled Mt Elgon after reports emerged of a diarrhoea outbreak. Most hospitals, including main facility Kipsegon, were closed because of insecurity. Staff had also fled. Residents have been suffering over killings, rapes and attacks by a gang. The government imposed a 90-day dusk-dawn curfew. County director of medical services Sylvester Mutoro led a team that toured Banantega and Kispegon in Chepyuk. Residents thanked them for responding to their distress call. Many of them had resorted to traditional herbs. They had complained of diarrhoea, stomach upsets and bloody stools. “We have collected stool and blood samples for testing in our laboratories, but clinical diagnosis rules out cholera,” Mutoro told reporters. Preliminary investigations showed most homes have hygiene problems and lack latrines. The officers said this was to blame for the outbreak. Mutoro said there was no cause for alarm. He urged residents to visit operating health facilities to get help as soon as they are infected. “Don’t wait for us to come and treat you from your homes. Try to reach the medical facilities such as Kubura and Rwanda that are opened. It will be very difficult for us to reach all of you,” Mutoro said. Assistant county commissioner Nicholas Ewoton said normalcy has returned and medics who fled would be back. He said they are doing all they can to exterminate the gang. “Everything is now all right. We expect every civil servant to get back and serve the people,” he said. Residents must not fear seeking services because of the curfew, because it is only meant to protect them from criminals, Ewoton said. Security officers are hunting down a criminal gang of 22 men. They say the SLDF has not returned.
