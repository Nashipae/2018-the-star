Police in Homa Bay are looking for armed thugs who stole Sh350,000 from a National Oil petrol station on Monday. County Police Commander Marius Tum said the criminals stormed the station at around 2.30 am and threatened to kill a security guard. They were armed with machetes, metal bars and a hammer, which they used to break the locks at the station's offices. Robert Achoki, a manager, said the suspects also destroyed fridges. "The robbers threatened to kill the guard before they tied him up and took his mobile phone and Sh700," Achoki said. "Our CCTV cameras were also destroyed." The police boss said the suspects also robbed a woman of her Sh2,200 as she passed by the station at the time. He asked locals with information on the whereabouts of the suspects to give it to them.
