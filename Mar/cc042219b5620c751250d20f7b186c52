"CPA provides the participating members with an excellent opportunity to learn about parliamentary practice and procedure and to gain a better understanding of the parliamentary systems and democratic processes in other Commonwealth jurisdictions,' a communication from CPA said. The CPA Secretary-General, Akbar Khan, will also address the opening session. Khan said, “elections as a demonstration of democracy have the potential to bring a tremendous diversity of backgrounds to our Commonwealth Parliaments". He said this necessitates the need for MPs to receive induction and development to enable them to get to grips with discharging their representative and constitutional functions. "The next few days will provide an excellent opportunity and a forum for members of the Kenya National Assembly to engage with their colleagues from across the Commonwealth and to learn from their experiences and practices," he said. Hon. Alexandra Mendès, MP, CPA Vice-Chairperson and Member of the Federal Parliament of Canada, Rt Hon. Dr Patrick Matibini, MP, Speaker of the National Assembly of Zambia; Senator Lucy Gichuhi, Federal Parliament of Australia, Tom Duncan, Clerk of the Legislative Assembly for the Australian Capital Territory and CPA Australia Regional Secretary and Jerry Hartz, Director of Government Relations at the National Democratic Institute are expected to grace the seminar.
