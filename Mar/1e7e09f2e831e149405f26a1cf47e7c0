Meru University Vice Chancellor Japheth Magambo has been sent on terminal leave following the killing of student leader Evans Njoroge. Education CS Amina Mohamed, who toured the institution on Tuesday, said Deputy Vice Chancellor Charity Gichuki will take over as investigations go on. Gichuki had been serving as Deputy VC in charge of finance and administration. Amina asked her to work hard to stabilise the unrest at the institution. "We encourage the acting VCto engage with other stakeholders, including the community and students, regularly to uplift the university." Amina noted that a postmortem had already been carried out. "We hope the rest of the investigations will be completed as soon as possible to give the family peace," she said. Njoroge, who served as Secretary General of the student council, was killed on February 27 at around 1 pm during demonstrations against matters including school fee hikes. The incident took place at a farm about a kilometre away from the institution. The Independent Policing Oversight Authority is looking into the incident as a plainclothes officer is said to have committed the cimes. After Njoroge's murder, protests and calls for Magambo to resign followed but he said he did not see why he needed to. On school fees, students have accused him of failing to honour a pledge to reduce it by Sh8,500 as agreed in a meeting between management and student leaders.
