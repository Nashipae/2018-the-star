A new Bill on changing the election date, from the second Tuesday of August to the third Monday of December, is expected to be tabled on Wednesday. Nasa legislator Chris Wamalwa (Kiminini), the sponsor of the Bill, argues that the August date disrupts the country’s crucial activities such as education. “The current date unduly disrupts the education calendar, and most importantly, the conduction of national examinations in case of either a fresh election, a run-off or an invalidation of a presidential election."

Wamalwa further states that the tradition of reading the Budget concurrently in East Africa has been disrupted by the August date. He adds: “The amendment seeks to restore the tourism high season and the aspirations of a section of Kenyans who are not able to get time out of their busy schedules to take part in the general elections at their places of preference,” he says. “The amendment will also clarify and put to rest all doubts regarding the exact date of the general elections and the term of the current Parliament.” Wamalwa’s bid is the second attempt to change the election date - a similar Bill by former Ugenya MP David Ochieng flopped in 2015 since it did not garner the requisite two-thirds majority. Some top lawyers, including former IEBC chairman Isaack Hassan, previously noted that the change of date will require a referendum because it extends the term of the President. Opposition leader leader Raila Odinga was among opponents of the proposed change of dates, saying it has been used by previous regimes as a “secret weapon” against the opposition.
