Kirinyaga Governor Ann Waiguru has moved to cut off brokers, middlemen and "tenderpreneurs" following the launch of a garment factory for women groups. The women will, going forward, make linens to be supplied to all hospitals in the county, a move that has been viewed will save the county millions of shillings. The county governments' plan is to cut off the middlemen who have been supplying the hospitals at exorbitant cost. Waiguru said the women groups have been organised and facilitated with sewing machines and fabrics to make the linens for patients. The governor said that the project, dubbed "Tuwezeshe Wamama", is aimed at cutting cost and at same time empower women in commemoration of World Women's Day on March 8. She was accompanied by deputy governor Peter Ndambiri and a number of CECs. The governor revealed that her administration is determined to cut off "tenderpreneurs". "The time when one individual was making millions of shillings by supplying low quality hospital linens is long gone," Waiguru said. She said the county will spearhead the construction of a six-storey building at Kerugoya county hospital to bed capacity from the current 250 to 500. "We are looking forward to providing quality health services so that our people do not have to seek help in private hospitals," she said. Click here for the latest political news
