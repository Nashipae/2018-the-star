STARRING: Alicia Vikander, Dominic West, Walton Goggins, Daniel Wu, Kristin Thomas DIRECTED BY: Roar Uthaug RELEASE DATE: March 16  Lara Croft is a poor billionaire. After the disappearance of her father seven years earlier, Lara decides to have nothing to do with the Croft empire. She makes a living as a bike courier. When Lara gets involved with a police incident, she calls Ana Miller to bail her out. Ana was Richard’s partner and manages the day-to-day running of the Croft empire. Ana informs Lara that if she doesn’t claim her inheritance, the company and all their holdings will be sold off. Lara doesn’t sign the papers as she refuses to admit her father is dead. Lara finally decides to sign the papers as she doesn’t want to lose the family home. But before she signs it, she receives a key from her father’s lawyer. Lara takes the key to the family crypt and finds that the key opens her father’s hidden office. Inside the office, Lara finds her father’s research on the mythical Japanese queen Himiko. Although Richard requests Lara (through pre-recorded message) to destroy the research, Lara uses it to retrace her father’s steps. The film is based on the 2013 video game of the same name. Gamers might find the movie interesting as it is more action than sequential plot. And of course, being that it is a reboot of the Tomb Raider series, a comparison cannot be helped. Swedish actress Alicia Vikander plays a younger and vulnerable Lara. She is, by comparison, totally different from the confident and sultry Lara portrayed by Angelina Jolie in the previous films. The main issue with Vikander’s on-screen performances is her inability to let her Swedish accent disappear on-screen. Lara Croft was raised in an autocratic British family; her accent is essential in the embodiment of her character. Other than that, the film is an unremarkable two-hour action-driven sequence.  Star Rating: 3/5
