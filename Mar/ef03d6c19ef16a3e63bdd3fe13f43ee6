Business came to standstill in Marigat town, Baringo, on Thursday as residents protested against what they called police brutality, bribery and harassment. The demonstrators barricaded the Marigat-Loruk road and burnt tyres . They demanded justice because of alleged mistreatment by police officers. “for the last three months, we have not had peace, especially from cops who collude with the administration and regular police to demand bribes along Marigat-Nakuru highway,” resident Kipchumba Bowen said. Protests started after police allegedly demanded a bribe from a driver at a roadblock on Marigat road. “I am a Seventh Day Adventist and my faith does not allow me to give or take bribes,” the driver said — and drove off.
