The ODPP has asked a court to set aside orders stopping businessman Jimi Wanjigi's arrest and prosecution at a Nyeri court. The DPP, through lawyer Daniel Mule, says the orders were based on non-disclosure of material facts, concealment of key documents and misrepresentation. “Owing to the nature and seriousness of the offences facing Wanjigi, the orders issued on March 1 should be set aside," Mule told the court on Friday. He added the businessman is likely to commit "serious and heinous crimes using firearms and weapons in his possession" so he is, and should be treated as a threat to public safety. The lawyer also noted that is is "imperative, lawful, just and proper" to recover firearms and ammunition which were neither seized during the search of Wanjigi’s house in Muthaiga on October 17, 2017 nor surrendered in line with a letter dated January 30. The letter was from the Secretary of the firearms Licensing Board. Court documents state that the IG is investigating Wanjigi for the offences of having firearms and contradicting dictates of the Firearms Act. Earlier in March, High Court judge George Odunga stopped the criminal case lodged in Nyeri against Wanjigi. Odunga also prohibited police from arresting him until his case is heard and determined.

According to the charge sheet at that court, Wanjigi is facing 11 charges, among them being possession of illegal firearms.
