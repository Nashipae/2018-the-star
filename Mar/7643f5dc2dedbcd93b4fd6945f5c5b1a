Supporters of Mombasa Jubilee governor candidate Suleiman Shahbal are furious after the businessman was excluded from government appointments. Shahbal was one of the Jubilee Party’s point men at the Coast. President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to reward his point men with state jobs, provided they delivered votes. Supporters said Mombasa delivered more votes to Uhuru than any other county in the region. Shahbal’s supporters accuse Uhuru of sidelining the politician. They say Shahbal devoted resources and time to campaign for Jubilee and should be rewarded. Uhuru’s only Cabinet appointment from the Coast is Najib Balala, who was retained as Tourism CS. Shahbal also missed out on Uhuru’s list of Chief Administrative Secretaries; former Tana River Governor Hussein Dado was among the appointees. “We feel this is the highest level of betrayal,” Mombasa Jubilee activist Mohamed Subow said. Subow said Shahbal sponsored many Jubilee campaigns and ought to have been given a state appointment. “He spent his money on the Jubilee campaign trail. Anyone telling us that Shahbal does not deserve an appointment is lying to us,” Subow said. Jubilee county chairman Matano Chengo warned leaders in Nairobi against underrating their support. “We won’t take this matter lightly. They should know that we are watching,” Chengo told the Star on the phone on Sunday. “As the party chairman, I demand that Shahbal be appointed. We know everyone’s contribution and it would really bother me if Shahbal is left out.” SENSED BETRAYAL He asked Uhuru to consider Shahbal when he fills 10 vacant positions for heads of parastatals. Chengo said Uhuru had promised to pick at least three Cabinet Secretaries from the region. “We sensed betrayal after only one was picked,” Chengo said. He said it was unfair for the President to reward people who did not campaign for his reelection.
