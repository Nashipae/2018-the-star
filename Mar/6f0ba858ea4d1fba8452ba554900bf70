A Naivasha teacher has confessed on Facebook that he burned his wife to death for cheating on him and said he was ready to surrender. Lawrence Gitau, 42, in a post on his Facebook page, also said he was ready to spend the rest of his life in jail. Yesterday, police said they expected to arrest him soon. Gitau has been on the run since March 15 when his wife, Elizabeth Wanjiru, was locked in their house in Longonot Centre, Naivasha. It was torched. The 36-year-old victim had one child. Gitau accused her of having had relationships with many men over the years, which strained their marriage. The situation got worse after he lost his job, he said. “I burnt her alive as she screamed my name. I did all I could to make things work, but it was not meant to be. I’m now ready to present myself to police anytime and spend the rest of my life in jail,” the Facebook post read. Ironically, hours before her death, Wanjiru had held reconciliation talks with her in-laws, with whom she had disputes. Gitau listed the names of the men, including a relative, whom he suspected of having had affairs with his wife. “It’s only God who knows why it went that way, but you cheated on me with your boss for five years. At one time, I gave you permission to marry him, but you always said he was just a friend,” the Facebook message read. Wanjiru was to be buried yesterday in the Nakuru public cemetery. A day earlier, her relatives described their horror at learning of the online confession and accusations of adultery. Relative Michael Njoroge said they reported it to Naivasha police. “The husband, who has been missing since the incident took place, has laid a list of issues he had with the wife and says he is ready to spend the rest of his life in jail,” Njoroge said. Though Gitau has been in hiding, police said they are hunting for him.
