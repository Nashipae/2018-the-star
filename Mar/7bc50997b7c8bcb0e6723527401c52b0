The seven-member Kitui county communication team has been sent on compulsory leave after being locked out of their office for two days. County officials said they did not “synchronise” with Governor Charity Ngilu’s new agenda. County chief of staff Crispus Ileli yesterday said the public relations and communications department was being restructured. They had to take leave of 30 to 45 days. Ileli said the officers were locked out of office because they were also under probe for unethical practice. He clarified that all the officers would be redeployed to other fields as deemed appropriate. “We had to surprise them by locking them out of office because of the exercise,” he said. The team headed by the assistant director Munyasya Musya received orders on Monday to apply for leave after the lock to their office was changed last Friday. The offices were still closed yesterday morning. “The team did not synchronise well with the governor’s agenda. They appear to stick to the old order without realising there is a new governor around,” he said. Ileli said officers in the recently created governor’s press service handle any public relations assignments in the meantime. Musya termed the action unfair, ill-advised and driven by mischief. “My team was loyal to the new governor and served with dedication. As public servants, we can only serve the governor in office,” he said. “It is a polite way of asking us to go after offices were locked,” Musya said. He said the “unfair treatment and humiliation” his team was going through was the work of individuals surrounding Ngilu who want to take up positions in the PR and communications departmnt.
