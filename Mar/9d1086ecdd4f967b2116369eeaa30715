The Meteorological Department has warned people living in landslide-prone areas of Elgeyo Markwet of possible landslides as torrential rains continue. There have been downpours in many parts of the North Rift in the past oweek. Elgeyo Marakwet Met director Simon Cheptot said on Friday that areas along the Kerio Escarpment may experience landslides. He said the intensity of the rains will increase this weekend. “There has been a lot of degradation along the escarpment. People have cut down trees and this may trigger landslides,” he said. Embolot, Embobut, Endo, Kaben, Mumol, Kapcherop, Chebororwa and Kipsaya in Marakwet are prone to landslides. Others are Kapchemutwa, Anin, Keu, Kabechei, Epke, Kocholwo and Turesia in Keiyo.
