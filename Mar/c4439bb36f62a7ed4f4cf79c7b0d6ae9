Three people, including a Laikipia county driver, died on the sport following an accident involving six vehicles in Marula, Naivasha. Also injured in the morning accident on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway was the leader of Majority, who was on his way to Nakuru. There was a traffic snarl-up. The accident involved two buses, a Nissan matatu and two personal cars. Two drivers from the personal cars died on the spot, while the third victim passed on while undergoing treatment at Naivasha Subcounty Hospital. Witness Bernard Karani said one of the bus drivers was to blame after deciding to overtake a fleet of vehicles. Karani said the driver of the bus swerved back to his lane to avoid a head-on collision with an incoming trailer and in the process hit the Laikipia county vehicle. “The driver of the county vehicle died on the spot and in the process four other vehicles were hit leading to the injuries,” he said.
