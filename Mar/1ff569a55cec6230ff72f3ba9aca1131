Some Jubilee MPs from Mt Kenya have praised President Uhuru Kenyatta and Nasa leader Raila Odinga for working together. The MPs yesterday said the two shelved their own interests and put those of Kenyans first to foster peace and unity. The lawmakers are Gatanga MP Joseph Nduati, Murang’a Woman Representative Sabina Chege, Igamba Ng’ombe MP Patrick Munene and Kipipiri’s Amos Kimunya. They said the partnership will spur development. Speaking in Gatanga during a tree planting project, the MPs said Kenyans only want peace. Nduati urged the President to give Raila a government job through which he can serve Kenyans and make his supporters feel included in the administration. The MP also praised the opposition for putting off activities of the People’s Assembly. On Monday, the People’s Assembly Steering Committee chairman David Ndii said the decision was made in the spirit of unifying the country. But he said NASA will resume should the Uhuru-Raila agreement be breached. Nduati said the tension between the two national leaders caused conflicts that wounded the economy. “Now the government can work for its people and complete projects it started in the last term,” he said. Chege added that the country has been under destructive politics since last August elections. “Everyone is happy to see the two working together and we hope it will help heal the country and bring Kenyans together,” he said. The MP said the opposition is still welcome to criticise the government and offer solutions. Kimunya questioned why NASA’s co-principals Kalonzo Musyoka, Moses Wetang’ula and Musalia Mudavadi were complaining of not being consulted, yet they abandoned Raila when he swore himself in as the People’s President.
