Savings and Credit Cooperative Societies have been urged to adopt inter-county ventures to increase their membership for financial stability. Deputy commissioner for saccos Stanley Ongeti (pictured) said the sector is an essential instrument for achieving sustainable economic growth. “Unlike banks, saccos must take financial access closer to citizens in the rural areas,” Ongeti said. He spoke on Saturday during the 27th Annual Delegates Meeting for Boresha Sacco in Eldama Ravine, Baringo. Governor Stanley Kiptis attended the function.
