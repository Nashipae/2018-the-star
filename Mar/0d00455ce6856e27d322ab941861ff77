Shujaa resume the hunt for points as the World Seven Series reaches the half-way stage tomorrow in Las Vegas. Innocent Simiyu’s charges have amassed 35 points from five tournaments and are currently eighth in the standings on the log. They hope to continue with their good run at a sold out Sam Boyd Stadium in sin city. Kenya are in Pool ‘A’ and face France in a tricky opening match at 2:44 am (Kenyan time) tomorrow. The two sides have clashed twice with the Europeans, winning 21-14 in Cape Town and Shujaa exacting revenge in Sydney with 17-14 win. Simiyu said he expects a close contest in Vegas. “We have settled well and the boys know it will be tricky match. If we follow the basics well and execute on defence and attack, we will be in a good position to win,” he added. Kenya face Russia at 5:45am. The Kenyans have won three of their past four encounters and Simiyu expects a physical contest from the Russians. “They are a physical side and will be keen on winning. They have not had a good season and we must be well prepared for them,” noted Simiyu. Kenya will wind up their preliminary assignment against top seeds Fiji at 11:36pm tomorrow night. Fiji edged out Kenya 24-5 in Sydney last month. Shujaa welcome back top try scorer and talisman Collins Injera from a hamstring injury and centre Billy Odhiambo. Kenya have had a poor record in Vegas, failing to make it to the main cup quarters for the past five seasons.
