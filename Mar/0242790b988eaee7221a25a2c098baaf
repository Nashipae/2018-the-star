NASA leader Raila Odinga is a political conman, Mwingi West MP Charles Nguna has said. Speaking in Nguutani on Saturday, Nguna criticised Raila for agreeing to meet President Uhuru Kenyatta without the involvement of his co-principals. He said it was selfish of Raila to meet Uhuru without involving Kalonzo Musyoka. As such, he said Raila has betrayed the trust of his supporters. “He failed us and we are not happy about it. Loyal supporters have died for Raila. We even refused to vote in last year’s presidential election because of our loyalty to him,” Ngunasaid. Nguna spoke at Nguutani Secondary School where he launched the Kitui county secondary school games. Nguna asked elected leaders to concentrate on working for their people, saying the community lacked political direction.
