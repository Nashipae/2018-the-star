She wants "any job at any organisation" in order to educate her children. In the letter, Buyu complains that the IEBC has abandoned the family. "I don't want to submit myself to another man in order to feed my children. I will appreciate any decent job that will enable me cater for my family,'" she said. In her tribute to Msando during the funeral on August 19 last year, Buyu noted he loved and cherished his family. She said her husband's killers might be on the run but will not hide forever as it is just a matter of time before they are caught.
