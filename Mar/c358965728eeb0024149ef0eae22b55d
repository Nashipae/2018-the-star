A 60-year-old woman is hospitalised in Baringo after her drunken son attacked her. James Rutto also set the house on fire during the Sunday incident. Sote Rutto sustained deep cuts on her neck, head and left hand. James attacked her using a panga at their home in Sibiloi, Baringo North subcounty. “I don’t know his reasons but he suddenly descended on me with a sharp panga and left me unconscious,” Sote said from her hospital bed on Wednesday. James arrived home drunk at around 6.30pm and threatened to kill her. Chief Joseph Chemitei said James surrendered himself to the police. He attributed the incident to alcoholism and unresolved family disputes. Kabarnet Referral Hospital nursing officer Paul Kandie said Sote is in stable condition.
