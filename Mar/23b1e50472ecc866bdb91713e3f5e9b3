Security agents in Mandera are on high alert and will punish crusaders of tribal conflict, Governor Ali Roba has said. Addressing a county dialogue forum in Mandera town yesterday, he said peace and security are paramount to development. He said tribal conflict had torn the region apart before the advent of devolution in 2013. “We cannot be cheating ourselves of any meaningful development if our people continue fighting for the meagre resources in our region,” Roba said. “My government has laid bare opportunities for tapping by development-conscious residents, and it loses meaning if some leaders continue feulling tribal animosity and hatred for selfish gains.” The governor enumerated development success stories during his first tenure in office. He said it is time the region shunned negative ethnicity to realise the fruits of devolution. “We have done over 1,000km of tarmac and murram roads, built over 50 new health facilities and over 200 Early Childhood Development classrooms, and it has been made possible by enhanced peace and security by our security agents,” Roba said.
