Korogocho-based football academy Acakoro were yesterday handed back part of their pitch occupied by National Youth Service following President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive to have the paramilitary vacate the field. The Cabinet Secretary for Public Service, Sports and Gender Affairs Prof. Margaret Kobia who was tasked by Kenyatta to ensure the land was surrendered back to the academy, spearheaded the implementation of the directive with the land successfully being relinquished to Acakoro. NYS were further directed by the CS to level the field, plant grass and put goal posts as well as rehabilitate a community building bordering the field, which had been occupied by the NYS personnel who have been carrying out community service in the area. President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered the NYS to vacate from the piece of land when hosting the Fifa World Cup trophy at State House in Nairobi, where Acakoro were invited. “The young man I was sitting next to tells me their pitch in Korogocho was taken away by the NYS and now we have agreed today and Madam CS is here and will rectify that situation. NYS will relocate to a new place and make sure you fix their field and sort it out so that they are able to play their game,” President Kenyatta said, directing the orders to Kobia Acakoro, famed for its U-11 side’s victory over Barcelona in the Donauauen Cup in 2016, had been forced to either train in shifts in the squeezed field or seek alternatives, thus hindering their training regime.
