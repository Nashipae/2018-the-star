Mathare United’s race to win the Kenyan Premier League was dealt a major blow after their first choice goalkeeper Wycliffe Kasaya suffered a right hand finger fracture. Fortune was not on Kasaya’s side as he picked the injury while on a KPL duty against Sony Sugar over the weekend at Awendo Stadium. After undergoing a knee surgery in September last year, which ruled him out of action for two months, the former AFC Leopards goalkeeper made a return against Sony Sugar on Sunday but he fractured his finger which will see him stay away for four weeks. In his absence, Levis Opiyo and Mark Kioko were tasked with filling his space but a series of poor goalkeeping from the duo forced Francis Kimanzi to recall experienced Robert Mboya from Kariobangi Sharks as well as bringing in the promising Job Ochieng from Kakamega High School at the beginning of the season. Kasaya collided with Sony Sugar’s forward George Abege while jostling for an aerial challenge but it was the latter who bore the brunt of the collision. A scan on his right hand revealed that he suffered a fracture on the ring finger and according to reports from the club’s medics, the gloveman will be sidelined for a month. Despite the setback, he vowed to come back stronger. “I am disappointed because I had just come out of injury and it was such a difficult period for me because I missed so many matches. But this is football and as a keeper, you have to deal with such injuries. It’s all about picking myself up and staying positive during the recovery process,” said Kasaya. He heaped praises on his fellow goalkeepers at the club whom he predicted to star in his absence. “We have a very strong goalkeeping department so there is no cause for alarm. Mboya has been doing well and Job has also been pushing us very well in training as he learns. They have what it takes to do a good job for the team,” added Kasaya.
