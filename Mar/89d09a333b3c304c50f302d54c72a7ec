Kenyans started the ITTF Africa Continental Cup on wrong footing, falling in their opening matches at the Moi International Sports Centre Kasarani. The country’s representatives Brian Mutua and Sejal Thakker lost their Group Two opening matches despite enjoying the home advantage. Kenya’s top seeded player Thakker was the first on court, succumbing 3-0 (11-7, 11-4, 11-3) defeat against Algerian Katia Kesacci in her first match. The home player couldn’t redeem herself in her second match as she went down 3-1 (9-11, 11-7, 11-8, 11-3) Bristol Christy of Seychelles’. Thakker admitted that she was nervous in the first match against the Algerian, whom she described as a great player. “I was a bit nervous and the game was tough too. She troubled me throughout with her left hand heroics. I need to relax in my subsequent games and be more positive,” she said. Her coach Jans Berner also noted that Thakker had difficulties in handling a left handed player. “She is not used to playing left handed players and she has to learn that. Returning serves from her was difficult,” he added. Thakker is pooled in Group Two alongside Nigeria’s Oshonaike Olufunike, Algeria’s Kessaci Katia and Bristol Christy of Seychelles. In the men’s category, home player Brian Mutua surrendered a 1-0 lead to succumb 3-1 to Congo’s Saheed Idowa in a match that lasted for 16 minutes. Mutua started on a winning note, taking the opening set 11-7 but the Congolese recovered to down the home boy in the successive sets 11-6, 11-3, 11-3. The Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) student observed that his services were his undoing and vowed to rectify in the subsequent matches. “I made mistakes especially in the serves and I gifted him points but I will correct that in my next matches,” he said. Mutua is pooled in Group Two alongside Derek Nyoh (Cameroon), Aruna Quadri (Nigeria) and Saheed Idowu (Congo).
