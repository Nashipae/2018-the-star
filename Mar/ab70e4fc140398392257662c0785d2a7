Extra sitting will be installed at the RFUEA grounds for this year’s Safari Sevens tournament slated for November. Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) chairman Richard Omwela said he had spoken to the Ministry of Sports to have the extra seats ordered for RFUEA ground. “This year’s Safari Sevens will be held in the first week of November and we have began the process of inviting teams. I have further met the ministry officials to have the extra seats ordered for the event and future tournaments.” Omwela disclosed that negotiations are at advanced stage to have shirt sponsors Bidco take the front part. “Bidco have shown commitment in supporting our team and negotiations are at advanced stage to have them take the front part of the shirt. We are grateful to all our partners and we urge those willing to come on board to do so since the remaining bit of our calendar requires a lot of finances,” added Omwela. Omwela thanked the government for the financial support accorded to the team in paying the team. “ Thanks to the government, we have already paid allowances and salaries for this for the first quarter following the withdrawal of sponsors SportPesa at the beginning of the year,” he said. Terming the intervention timely, he said: “On behalf of the board, I wish to extend my gratitude to the government for their financial support to our team. I am happy to announce that the players have been paid their salaries and bonuses, thanks to the government. I have written to the president, seeking his audience once he returns from Cuba with the board and the players keen to meet him. I am glad his deputy has accepted to host us and the sole objective of meeting the two is to get more financial support. We forwarded our budget of Sh124 million to the government and we are grateful for their response,” added Omwela.
