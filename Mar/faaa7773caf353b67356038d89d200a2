DP William Ruto has chided Nyandarua and Laikipia leaders over the simmering battle concerning the location of Nyahururu town. This followed a public exchange between Olkalou MP David Kiaraho, Laikipia woman representative Catherine Waruguru and Laikipia Senator John Kinyua over who should benefit from the millions of shillings collected in the town as revenue. Each county claims ownership of the town. “Nyahururu is in Kenya and you’re all Kenyans,” Ruto (pictured) said. He said the government will build Nyahururu, Olkalou and other towns in the region, hence, the fight over Nyahururu is “unnecessary”. He urged the counties to cooperate and work in the interest of all Kenyans.
