Kiambu MCAs have bowed to pressure and dropped an impeachment motion against speaker Stephen Ndichu after Governor Ferdinand Waititu said they’d be punished. A source told the Star the governor threatened the ward reps of “dire consequences” if they went ahead with the plan to impeach Ndichu and the Leader of Majority Anthony Ikonya. The MCAs held a retreat in Naivasha during the weekend to discuss the motion and Waititu intervened. “The governor read the  riot act. He warned MCAs of unspecified consequences if they don’t toe the line. They have retreated tactically,” the source said. Fifty-one of 92 ward reps had signed a motion to impeach Ikonya and Ndichu, saying they lack confidence in their leadership. They claimed the two had put them at loggerheads with voters. Trouble started when MCAs missed a medical scheme after a insurance firm was paid Sh25 million. They wrote a letter to the speaker, but the matter has not been addressed. “We have had difficulty accessing medical services and consultants in the scheme. Medical cards were rejected or suspended in several hospitals since October 2017,” reads the letter. The MCAs also opposed a proposed Sh355 million budget for building a speaker’s house, canteens and a lounge. This sparked an uproar among Kiambu residents. “The speaker is supposed to represent the interests of the people and advise the house. Residents are furious. We are not the ones who came up with the budget,” the MCAs said. Residents have branded the MCAs as greedy and selfish. Speaker Ndichu asked for forgiveness, but residents are angry. MCAs accused Ikonya of pursuing selfish interests and being arrogant.  They said Ndichu stays in his chambers and lacks rapport with assembly staff. In 2014, Kiambu was the first county to impeach its speaker, Nick Ndichu. He was accused of financial impropriety, violating procurement rules and the Disposal Act. He was also accused of using derogatory language to staff.
