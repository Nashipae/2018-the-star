About 1,300 Kenyan babies born every year with cleft palate cannot benefit from the NHIF cover because the condition is congenital. Cleft lip and cleft palate are birth defects that occur when a baby’s lip or mouth does not form properly during pregnancy.  Nairobi-based reconstructive surgeon Dr Meshach Ong’uti yesterday said most patients cannot afford surgery and treatment and only rely on NGOs for help. “Most insurance firms, including our NHIF, do not cover cleft lip and palate deformities, as they are considered congenital, yet the surgery and treatment is not affordable to many,” he said in Nairobi during the ongoing PAACLIP’s Sixth Scientific Congress. Pan-African Association of Cleft Lip and Palate president Dr Asrat Mengiste said the meeting would set better treatment standards and protocol. Ong’uti, also the PAACLIP secretary general, said the government must address this policy gap to support victims. The congress brings together more than 200 medical experts from across the globe. Ong’uti urged the government to create a policy that would resolve cleft lip and palate problems and entrench it in the healthcare system.
