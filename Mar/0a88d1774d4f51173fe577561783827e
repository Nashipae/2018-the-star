Budalang’i MP Raphael Wanjala has hit out at Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula, saying he should not blame NASA leader Raila Odinga for his woes. Wanjala said Wetang’ula should stop blaming Raila for his removal as Senate Minority leader. Speaking to the Star on Saturday, Wanjala said Wetang’ula did not respect fellow senators. They lost faith in him and removed as their leader, he said. “Wetang’ula does not have more than two senators in the House and he is trying to fight Raila who has more than 15 senators. Can he manage?” Wanjala asked. ODM has sacrificed positions for Ford Kenya in the Senate and the National Assembly, If Wetang’ula continues attacking Raila, ODM may consider taking them back, he said. “We will strip them of the posts if they are not going to respect Raila who has sacrificed so much for NASA affiliates parties,” Wanjala said. On Saturday, Wetang’ula declared war against Raila. The Ford Kenya boss said he and other NASA co-principals will make Raila’s union with President Uhuru Kenyatta very uncomfortable. He accused Raila of betraying him, together with co-principals Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Wiper’s Kalonzo Musyoka. “We have regrouped to teach you a lesson,” Wetang’ula said. There has been a rift in the opposition after Raila met the President for dialogue on March 9 without involving them. Wetang’ula said the decision by Raila to meet Uhuru without their knowledge and his removal as Minority leader on Tuesday last week won’t go unpunished. “Despite us fighting relentlessly and some of our supporters losing their lives, the conduct of our presidential candidate is shocking,” Wetang’ula said.
