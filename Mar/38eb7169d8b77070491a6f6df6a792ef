The National Assembly has taken a short break and extended the period for the vetting and approval of the Solicitor General nominee Kennedy Ogeto. MPs adopted a motion to amend the House calendar and proceed for recess until March 13. Justice and Legal Affairs Committee chairman William Cheptumo (Baringo North) told the House yesterday they will vet Ogeto today, but will table the report when the House resumes. The committee was supposed to table its report on Tuesday next week but Majority Leader Aden Duale moved a motion, seeking to extend time for consideration of the nominee. “In conformity with Section 13 of the Public Appointment Parliamentary Act, I am seeking for extension of seven days to ensure the committee presents its report on March 13,” Duale said. The National Assembly, in conjunction with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, will hold a three-day Post-Election Seminar for MPs in Mombasa. Click here for the latest political news
