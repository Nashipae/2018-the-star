Commission on Human Rights has asked IPOA to investigate the assault of Journalists at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on Tuesday. Police allegedly beat up journalists as they covered the return of Miguna Miguna. KNCHR chairperson Kagwiria
Mbogori said those found should bear
individual responsibility. “Together with the
Law Society of Kenya and the Media Council, we condemn in the
strongest terms possible and take issue with the threat to the safety
of media practitioners," Mbogori said. Journalists assaulted at JKIA included Stephen Letoo of Citizen TV, NTV's Robert Gichira and KTN's Sophia Wanuna. Letoo and Gichira
sustained injuries and their broadcast equipment were damaged. Read: Journalist injured as police, residents clash in Kariobangi The commission has

their respect for citizens' rights and freedoms,”Mbogori said. Kagwiria said the
journalists were at the Airport legally guaranteeing the public right
to know and posed no security threat to the operation at the airport
