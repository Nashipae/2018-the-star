There was joy at Gaturi Primary School after a family came out to buy the entire school uniforms, shoes and bags. The Shanga family also distributed one year’s supply of sanitary towels to 70 girls in the school. The family visited the school under the invitation of county commissioner John Elungata. The family said giving to the pupils was its way of giving back to the society. Each of the 400 pupils in the school went home with a new uniform, shoes and a bag on Wednesday. Neetu Ubbi who spoke on behalf of the family said it is their doctrine to go to rural areas economically challenged and help the needy. “We make all these donations from our pockets as our way of making the world a better place,” she said. The sanitary towels will ensure girls do not miss classes every month because they cannot afford them. The girls also received soaps and other items for personal hygiene. Neetu said their efforts are aimed at promoting primary education and ensuring pupils are empowered to learn. She said the Shanga family has greatly invested in the engineering industry and is ready to work with school heads to help poor children. “We are ready to provide sanitary towels to needy students. We are asking school heads to reach out to us through the provincial administration,” she said. Murang’a East deputy county commissioner Kepha Marube praised the family for supporting education. He said many pupils in the school are from extremely poor backgrounds and do not have food, clothes and other basic needs. The Shanga family visited the school and took the pupils’ measurements before buying the uniforms and shoes. They also bought 400 bags worth Sh500 each. The girls got a year’ssupply of sanitary towels.
