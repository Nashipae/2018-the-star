Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has denied reports that he ‘ordered shutdown’ of bars in Kiambu County. "There is no time I ordered the closure of bars in Kiambu county or any other part of the country during my public address at Makwa Trading Centre," Matiangi said. On Wednesday, there were media reports indicating that the government had ordered tall bars closed with immediate effect.

He said this would ensure only those bars that meet the requisite legal conditions will be allowed to reopen. The CS maintained that alcoholic beverages have nothing to worry about because the campaign targets illegaloperators and purveyors of counterfeit products. "The Alcoholic Drinks Control Act (2010) clearly defines under what circumstances manufacturing, sale and consumption ofalcoholic beverages should take (or not take) place," he said. Matiang'i said whereas the Government is resolute and unyielding in its fight against illicit and counterfeit brews to protect the lives of Kenyans, the government is also committed to protecting all legitimate business enterprises in all sectors and in every corner of the country.
