We support the Declaration of Wealth by all Cabinet Secretaries, Principal Secretaries, Cabinet Administrative Secretaries, Principal Secretaries and other State officers as they enter office. However, some Presidential appointees, including politicians, seem to be stagnating on getting into power (see story P6). There are clear disparities between wealth declarations made in 2013 and in 2018 that the public will find need clarifying. They are implausible. There will be questions whether those declaring their wealth took the exercise at all seriously and whether they over-declared or under-declared, or lied outright, for whatever reason. Wealth declarations are good for checking on people and tracking their lifestyle changes for indicators of corruption. But in Parliament they are locked up for years and inaccessible to the media, researchers and the public. Kenyans will want to know that they can trust the information in the wealth declaration forms is fully transparent and accountable. In advanced countries, you have to not only list your assets but also sources of income outside your pay. For this to happen in Kenya, the wealth declarations should be made public and property, for example houses and farms, should be identified right down to location and LR number. The implementation of The Public Officer Ethics Act, under which wealth declarations are made, will not be complete if Kenyans are denied full access to the information that is now so secretively held by Parliament.
