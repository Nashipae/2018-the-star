Kiambu woman representative Gathoni wa Muchomba has urged women to work hard and protect their families against domestic violence She said alcoholism and drug abuse among married couples are a recipe for disagreements, which tear down families. Muchomba spoke last Friday at Mama County Social Hall in Wangunyu Primary School, Kiambaa constituency, where 1,000 women were screened for cancer. “Let all rise up in protecting our families. When we do that, we create space for our children's growth and education while we give us space and time to develop ourselves,” she said. “By so doing, learn when your man is happy, what angers him and let him know you.” Muchomba urged parents to expalin to their teenage children the dangers of drug abuse and alcoholism.
