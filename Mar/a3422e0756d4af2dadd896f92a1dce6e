Nairobi police are investigating the "untouchable" Meru tout who left a traveller near dead over his choice of a matatu. On Tuesday, DCI boss George Kinoti ordered an immediate probe on Felix Mwingirwa who reportedly brags about having links to senior police officers. The conductor came to the limelight after Kenyans on social media demanded his arrest. This was after he smashed the passenger's head on a car's windscreen and then hit it on a steel metal barricade that cracked his skull, according to a witness.

Mwingirwa has also been accused of collecting bribes from drivers, bars, clubs and hotels at the Tea Room stage. He allegedly does this on behalf of some senior police officers. On Wednesday, city police chief Joseph ole Tito said the DCI will establish the activities the conductor has engaged in and whether he is working with officers of Central Police Station in particular. "We are calling on members of the public to share information on accusations against the tout. We are aware the accused has three assault cases pending in court, one dating back to 2004," Tito said. Tito said the tout attacked the passenger, on January 30, after differing with his colleagues on management grounds. Mwingirwa confessed to having police protection, an aspect said to have likely contributed to his arrogance and other questionable behaviour. The tout has filed a case against his colleagues, who he accuses of destroying his car. Click here for the latest political news
