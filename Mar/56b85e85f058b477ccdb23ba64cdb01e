On Friday
morning, February 23, social media was suddenly buzzing with news that
contractors with armed military security had moved into the Nairobi National
Park on the Eastern boundary. They were rapidly progressing with Phase 2 of the
Standard Gauge Railway directly through the park, even though a legal stop
order was in place. This is another
very sad moment for Kenya as a nation, in that with the SGR being constructed directly
through the park, it is effectively being split into two sections and divided
forever. There will be
bridged sections that are elevated to allow animals and vehicles to pass under
in places. However, this railway line will become an ugly landmark that will
permanently scar the Nairobi National Park. Conservationists are naturally very
upset that the railway line is going directly through the park, especially when
there were alternative routes that would have bypassed the park. What if this was
2046, the hundredth year of the Nairobi National Park? Would it be a sober
moment of reflecting on the sad, lost past, when Kenya lost part a priceless national
asset? Forever! A priceless treasure is a treasure that is so valuable and
unique that no money or any item of value can replace it. The
Nairobi park is a priceless treasure that needs to be kept for future
generations. Yes! 2018 will prove to be a critical year. Railway development is needed to grow the economy. It
should, however, never be at the irreplaceable expense of destroying national
parks. Concerned citizens and environmental organisations need urgent action to
ensure environmental damage is minimised as the Nairobi National Park is
divided forever.  The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00. For more information on the park, you can link to the following websites: www.kws.org or www.nairobigreenline.com or on Facebook: Nairobi National Park
