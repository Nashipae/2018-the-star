Read: Five to face off in Kitui West MP by-election, says Chebukati On Sunday, Edith dismissed the claims saying they were shows of "overt desperation by people who have sensed defeat" after realising she is "exceedingly popular". “I have not violated the electoral code in any way and I have not met the Kitui West election coordinator since I presented my nomination papers," she said. "How dare they accuse him of campaigning for me. The must call the bluff and accept that they have been rejected by the electorate." Edith's competitors Mutiso Leli and Elijah Kilonzi claimed IEBC officials, led by the constituency boss, and security personnel campaign for her. The duo claimed the officials’ actions tilted the contest in her favour. By phone, Ikonge told the Star: “I have already filed a protest with the Kitui West election coordinator. We want a level playing ground." He further claimed Edith has been addressing his campaign gatherings, an action which he said the IEBC and Edith with a view of seeking legal redress. But Nyenze's widow said she has been strictly following the campaign schedule she presented to the electoral agency. “All these allegations are unfounded and baseless. They are from people who are crying wolf because they have realised I will beat them on election day. Let them prepare for defeat because it has become overt that I am more popular than they are." She added her popularity is clear at social gatherings where residents have cheered upon her arrival. Nasa principal Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) ha been campaigning with the politician.
