Regardless of the resolution made by the lands department, Dominion firm is on the brink of closing down. The firmÂ laid off over 300 works early this year. They claim that they have been forced to close down the company due to political intolerance in the county. At some point,the company blamed former Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga for making their operation in Siaya unbearable. Both Midiwo and Raila dismissed the accusations as political gimmick aimed at tinting their image and political career.
