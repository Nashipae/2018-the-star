Chuka University has been compelled to re-admit 18 students who had been expelled for disciplinary issues. Kennedy Waringa, Cornelly Onyango and 16 others had moved to the High Court on March 13, 2017, to contest their expulsion. They were seeking orders quashing the decision by the university taken on April 14, 2016 and December 16, 2016 as communicated in letters dated April 15, 2016 and December 22, 2016,- addressed to them. The students had also sought orders compelling the university to re-admit them so that they can continue with their education and sit for examinations. Omondi said he was vying for the chairmanship for Chuka University Students Association in the elections conducted on January 29, 2016, which he lost. “The elections were marred with irregularities and after I disputed the results, the university arrested me and I was arraigned before Chuka senior principal magistrate’s court where I was accused of taking part in unlawful assembly together with my colleagues,” Omondi said. He said his agents declined to sign the form that confirms the results declared. Omondi claims Chuka University caused their arrest. “The criminal charges were, however, withdrawn by the prosecution on April 13, 2016 and after that we were invited to appear before the disciplinary committee from March 21-24, 2016, and on April 15, 2016, we were expelled,” Omondi said. The students said they appeared before a disciplinary committee that was not fully constituted as required. They alleged the committee included a non-member Senate representative and Omondi’s opponent in the poll, Harrison Maina, who was the chairman of Cusa, was a member of the disciplinary committee. Judge Roselyn Aburili ordered Chuka University to take all necessary steps and measures to facilitate the students’ re-admission.
