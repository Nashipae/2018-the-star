Women are still disadvantaged in land ownership, despite a progressive legal framework in Kenya, a survey has revealed. The Kenya Land Alliance disaggregated and analysed 1,000,099 out of 3,200,000 title deeds issued by the government from 2013 to last year to compare ownership between men and women. The report shows that women only got 103,043 titles, 10.3 per cent, while men had 865,095 titles — 86.5 per cent. The glaring disparity is made clear when looked at against the actual land sizes for women and men. The data sampled shows that out of 10,129,704 hectares of land titled between 2013 and last year, women got 163,253 hectares, a paltry 1.62 per cent, while men got 9,903,304 hectares — 97.76 per cent. KLA CEO Odenda Lumumba said the five-year duration of land title issuance is a pointer to the reality that gender disparities continue to go unnoticed. “It’s our hope that this disaggregated data of land title issuance during the period 2013 to 2017 will not be read simply as a “women’s issue”, but an important societal issue. It’s not a question of a few women being added to the land register. Rather, it’s a recognition of the significant part women play in agricultural production as the mainstay of food-crop production,” he said. The report was launched on Thursday during the International Women Day event. NGEC head of communications Daniel Waitere said the commission found a clear pattern of discrimination in allocation of land to women. “There is every reason for concern that despite the existence of a robust legal framework in the form of the Constitution of Kenya and several statutes, the distribution of land has not adhered to gender equality and social justice,” he said. Lumumba stressed that the campaign theme of ‘Press for Progress’ in gender parity should not end on International Women’s Day 2018, but be the beginning to engage in the land ownership transformation agenda that includes land rights and interests of women and men. Part of the data sampled in Bomet county revealed only 18 per cent of titles were issued to women and 75 per cent to men during the five-year period. In Machakos, which had the highest number of title deeds issued, 98,124, women received only 13,622, 13.8 per cent, while men had 78,353 — 79 per cent. In Embu’s 122 titles, women got 75 while men had 42. The total land size was 2.79 hectares. Lumumba said it is imperative that the government begins to address the huge inequalities in land and property through effective implementation of constitutional provisions to secure women’s land rights. He said women make up 80 per cent of the workforce, yet they only hold 1 per cent of registered land in their names and around 5-6 per cent in joint names.
