There is a need to ensure all maize farmers are registered in cooperative societies to access farm input during planting seasons. Cherangany MP Joshua Kuttuny on Friday said farmers cannot access the governmentâ€™s subsidized fertiliser and other materials as individuals. He said farmers, who are supposed to be planting, cannot do so because the government failed to take appropriate statistics on the number of farmers so it can supply enough planting material. Trans Nzoia is currently receiving heavy rains, but farmers are having difficulties accessing the government fertiliser. Ensuring all farmers are registered will help the government know the quantity of fertilizer to supply.
