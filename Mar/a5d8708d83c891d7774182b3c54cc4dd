Timmy Tdat and Otile Brown have a lot in common, from their well-maintained physiques to their huge egos. But another thing that they also have in common is their collaboration on the song Wembe. The song did well on YouTube, with over 750,000 views. Spizoo claims Otile Brown's song sounds similar to "Wenge", a song that had been posted on YouTube a few months before "Wembe" was put up. The creator of "Wenge" goes by the name of Spizoo, and he gave an interview to another website where he discussed the issue. He said he had created the song and had given it to Otile and Timmy so they could collaborate together on it. He said that they, however, demanded Sh200,000 each to be on the collaboration. After that, he did not hear from them again. Then a while later, he saw the song had been done but as "Wembe". When we called Timmy Tdat for a comment, he responded with shock and ignorance. He said, "I have never heard such allegations. I don't know that guy, labda uulize Otile." When we added that the artiste claimed they demanded Sh200k each for their services, he said incredulously, "How? I don't even know the artiste. I have never heard of the song (Wenge). No one has ever paid me for a collabo."
