Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet yesterday revealed a cross-border terrorist plot to attack a Nairobi law court and police station with a suicide car bomb. The purpose was to free a terrorist suspect facing trial in Nairobi, the IG said. Boinnet revealed that the cache of weapons found in Merti, Isiolo county, last month was destined for the Nairobi attacks. Although the IG did not identify which court and station were targetted, he said an elaborate plan had been hatched. It included purchase of a vehicle in Nairobi and acquisition of Kenyan documents by the terrorists. At least five people — including a woman and a man who operate a cyber café in River Road, Nairobi — have since been arrested and prosecuted. The two are said to have prepared fake Identity cards for three male suicide bombers from Somali. Yesterday, the IG revealed that the vehicle found with the weapons had been bought from a yard in Nairobi on January 7 and driven to Somalia where it was fitted with explosives. It took the terrorists close to a month to fit the vehicle with the explosives. It was discovered in a thicket in Merti, Isiolo, on February 15. Boinnet did not reveal the names of the suspect whom the Somali terrorists wanted to rescue but sources said the attackers were linked to a sheikh arrested in Marsabit in January. In January, angry youths had demonstrated after sheikh Guyo Gosa was arrested by anti-terror police. Police said the sheikh was in constant communication with some of the arrested suspects. He was first arrested in 2014 in Mombasa and rearrested early 2015 in Marsabit. He is accused of having links with al Shabaab. Click here for the latest political news
