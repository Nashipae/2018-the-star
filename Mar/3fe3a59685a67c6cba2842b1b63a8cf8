The government should quell brewing tension between Somali pastoralists and Kambas in Endau-Malalani and Kyamatu wards, Kitui East. Area MP Nimrod Mbai made this request on Sunday after the body of a Somali camel herder was discovered in the area at around 1pm. “Herders were spotted armed with AK 7 riffles. It is believed the display of guns is a sign that they plan a retaliatory attack on locals. It is time security teams moved with speed to prevent any killings,” he said. Related: 2 brothers killed in Kitui by armed Somali herders Mbai, who spoke at Kinanie, said the Somali herder may have been killed by a fellow herder in a brawl as he had stab wounds in the neck and chest. “It would be wrong to assume the Somali herder was killed by Kambas. Had it been an attack by the Kambas, he would have been shot with an arrow. Therefore any revenge attack by the armed herders on Kamba’s would be misdirected." The MP noted many residents have fled their homes for fear of any revenge attacks. Unless the government sends a contingent of security officers to the volatile area, he said, normalcy is unlikely to return soon. Mbai further said the government should flush out the herders who have infiltrated Kitui to end frequent killings and other acts of lawlessness. Last week, a man and his son were attacked with knives by tsuspected Somali herders in Kaningo area of Tseikuru district. Musyoka Kalonzo and his son Mwendwa were repulsing herders who had driven their camels into their farm in Wikitoo area of Kaningo location when they were attacked on March 5. After the attack, the two men were taken to Mwingi Level 4 Hospital but since their situation deteriorated, they were transferred to KNH.
