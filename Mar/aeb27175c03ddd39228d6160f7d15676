Seven Kenyatta University students charged with arson and property destruction in 2016 face additional charges of incitement. David Kebaso, George Nyamweya, Erick Masinga, David Amisi, Trevor Agoi, Ochieng Dominic and Victor Wafula had been charged with two counts of destroying property and malicious damage. Prosecution counsel Maurice Matwa told the court the charge sheet was amended to add incitement after investigating officer Joseph Keter said the suspects were caught on CCTV. Matwa asked the court to warn the suspects not to visit the institution. He said some of them live at Kambi ya Moto, which is adjacent to the university. He said it violates bond and bail terms. Students’ lawyer David Ochieng said they respect the court order and they had complied with bond and bail terms. He objected to additional charges. He called it an attempt by the prosecution to pile pressure on the suspects. He said the application was in bad faith. ADMINISTRATION BLOCK BURNT Senior principal magistrate Stella Atambo said nothing prevents the prosecution from amending the charge sheet or pressing additional charges if there are new findings. She ordered the suspects to stick to the bond terms as the court had directed, saying failure to do so is contrary to the law. “I don’t need to remind any party about the bond and bail terms. If there is evidence I won’t hesitate to cancel the bond terms,” the magistrate warned the suspects. MALICIOUS DAMAGE In the first count, the suspects were charged with commiting arson on November 16, 2016, at Kenyatta University in Kiambu. Jointly, with others not before the court, they are accussed of setting fire to the old administration block and destroying property worth Sh82,889,564. In count two they were charged with incitement to violence. In the third count, they were charged withmalicious damage to property worth Sh13,000,000. The case will be mentioned March 29 and heard on June 7.
