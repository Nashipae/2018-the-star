The Jubilee administration is not ready to discuss electoral reforms with NASA — as claimed by some opposition leaders — National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale has said. He was referring to the recent show of unity between President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga. “Jubilee is also not ready to discuss amending of Constitution,” Duale said yesterday. Raila’s allies have insisted that electoral reforms must form part of the dialogue. “What we know is that the two leaders came together to bring about harmony, inclusivity, economic stability and unite the country after a protracted divisive election. It was also to help Raila preserve his legacy and make him the statesman he ought to be,” Duale said. Duale also hit out at NASA co-principals Musalia Mudavadi of ANC and Moses Wetang’ula of Ford Kenya who have accused Raila of being “a traitor”. “Raila has for far too long babysat Kalonzo, Wetang’ula and Mudavadi. He has been providing them with Cerelac and milk like small babies. They are crying because they have missed the milk after their mother left,” he said.
