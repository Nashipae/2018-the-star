The hunt for Kenya Open Pro-Am slots heads to Nyali Golf and Country Club this weekend with a big field expected to feature in the fifth leg of the Barclays Series . Golfers at Nyali are expected to play their hearts out as the winner in each tournament will be rewarded with an automatic slot in one of the two Pro-Ams for the forthcoming Kenya Open. But the hot and humid sea level conditions will mean that the coast amateurs change tact in pursuit of prestigious slots. Andrew Chelogoi, who is the Kenya Golf Union North Rift representative, won the opening leg in Eldoret late last year while veteran Bhupen Shah won last weekend’s tour at the Par 70 Nyanza GC with an impressive 41 stable-ford points to claim the fourth leg. Nakuru Golf Club’s Lady Captain Halima Mwende booked her Kenya Open slot after emerging the victor in Nakuru. Handicap 21, Shah, who has never won any major event over the past five years, recovered from a scratch at the fourth hole to pat five holes for 19 points in the opening nine. Meanwhile, Ruiru Sports Club will today host one of the biggest tournament in its 70 years of existence as the captain Antony Kamau (Tosh) calls it a day. The record breaking 2018 Captain’s Prize, sponsored by giant oil marketer Vivo Energy has so far attracted over 280 golfers. “Despite the dry season, the course is in good shape and a number of local golfers are equally good, setting the stage for a big competition,” said Kamau, who is exiting the captaincy after a successful one year tenure. “We are keen on giving golfers an excellent experience.” The game has attracted some of Kenya’s top amateurs from across the country including Ruiru’s SM kihiro, Isaac Nguku and Joseph Mugo, who are currently enjoying top form.
