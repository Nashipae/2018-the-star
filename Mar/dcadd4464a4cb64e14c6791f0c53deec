Water pumps supplier Davis and Shirtliff has partnered with American company DOW Water Technologies and other international partners to develop a range of Ultrafiltration systems designed to treat surface water supplies in East Africa. “The systems have already become quite popular in the regional market with customers ranging from domestic, commercial, and industrial, Relief as well as the military operating ultrafiltration plants in harsh environments with great success,” Davis & Shirtliff technical director Philip Holi said in a statement. The emerging technology is aimed at ensuring water found in nature contaminated with chemicals, pesticides, human and animal wastes can be filtered through a membrane containing tiny holes much smaller than that used by sand filtration technology. It enables the removal of suspended matter, bacteria and most viruses. It can provide water virtually free of pathogens and turbidity without the need for disinfecting chemicals such as chlorine. “With the launch of these products the water treatment sector in East Africa now has direct access to this powerful but cost-effective and viable water treatment technology,” Holi said.
