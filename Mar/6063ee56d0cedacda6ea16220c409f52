The government has directed the NCPB to vet farmers delivering maize to its depots in the North Rift. This follows an increasing number of trucks delivering maize at the Eldoret and Moi’s Bridge depots. Most is suspected to have been bought cheaply in Uganda by unscrupulous traders. NCPB officials are concerned the maize owners are not farmers but traders. The importers could be making as much as 100 per cent profit since they buy the maize for Sh1,600 per 90kg bag and selling it to the NCPB at Sh3,200. “The queues are getting longer but we are now vetting the owners of the lorries to ensure that only genuine local farmers deliver maize to the depots,” CEO Newton Terer told the Star on the phone yesterday. The queue at the Eldoret depot is almost two kilometres long, but Terer said they plan to clear it in two weeks. Last month the government allowed import of 6.6 million bags of maize from Uganda. But Kenya Farmers’ Association director Kipkorir Menjo said this was a blunder as it led to the current crisis. “Farmers are seriously frustrated because traders and well connected people have taken advantage to import cheap maize and sell it to the NCPB at double the price,” he said. It is feared the NCPB may not buy maize at the end of the year because its stores are full. “The next harvest is just six month away, yet the board is still buying maize. It should plan where to take the maize before farmers are ready to sell the next harvest,” Ben Chelimo from East African Grain Council said. because traders and well connected people
