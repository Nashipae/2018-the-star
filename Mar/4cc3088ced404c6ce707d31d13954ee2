Two Bomet Jubilee leaders have dismissed claims the recent meeting between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga will spoil Jubilee’s 2022 gameplan. Governor Joyce Laboso and Bomet Central MP Ronald Tonui said Deputy President William Ruto remains Jubilee’s favourite to succeed Uhuru, despite the Opposition team being ‘accommodated’ in government. Speaking separately, the two leaders said the meeting between Uhuru and Raila was for the country's unity and peace, and should not be misconstrued to mean they might be planning to scuttle Jubilee’s 2022 plan. “This was just but a ‘party’ of bringing our people together…Raila’s entry or acceptance to work with Jubilee will not affect the 2022 political equation,” Laboso told the Star. She said Rift Valley and Jubilee Party have already settled on the 2022 plans and are now only focusing on development. Tonui urged Opposition leaders to work with Jubilee for better service delivery. He said, “As leaders we should also follow suit. Stop unnecessary debates and bring people together because this is not the time for politicking, but for development. The only way that can be achieved is through together." “Political differences that have existed for long among our people should end … we are happy and we should forge ahead in building our nation." Tonui asked Jubilee leaders to stop delving much into the matter and instead continue pushing for unity.  Click here for the latest political news
