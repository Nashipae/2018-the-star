A man of stature does not
look for torrid affairs with younglings because he is a happily
married family man, Tigania East MP Gichunge Kabeabea said yesterday. He spoke at Kalantina EAPC, Meru, during a fundraiser for Pastor Kiriko to buy a boda boda. Kabeabea amused congregants when he got on the podium and said his
wife Carol looks beautiful and young because ''I have maintained [her]
and catered for her well." He said people should not misconstrue his friendly demeanour to mean he is having affairs. "Don't believe in rumours. I have only one wife and three children. I
have always maintained her and this is why she looks beautiful and
young," the MP said. Carol steered off the issue of affairs and thanked residents for overwhelmingly voting for her husband last year. She said she will ensure every promise her husband made is fulfilled.
Carol said she will start holding meetings with women to push the
development agenda forward. "I promised to grind and cook porridge for all of you. I will always
do that... You're a blessing to us God increase you," Carol said amidst
laughter from locals.
