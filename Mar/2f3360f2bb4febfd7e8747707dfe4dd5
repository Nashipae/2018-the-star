AFC Leopards are considering handing Dennis Kitambi head coach job on permanent basis following the sacking of Robert Matano. Kitambi took over from the axed coach three weeks ago albeit on temporary basis and his performance has prompted his bosses to take him seriously. Under Kitambi, Leopards have had a one hundred percent record in their matches and the board has expressed its willingness to employ the Tanzanian as head coach. Kitambi guided Leopards to a 2-0 win over Sony Sugar before leading them to a dramatic 4-3 win against Mathare United. In his third match, Leopards’ clawed Wazito 3-2 and he is set to guide his side against misfiring Kakamega Homeboyz tomorrow. Leopards’ chairman Dan Mule revealed that a series of good results would guarantee Kitambi permanent terms. “We are not looking for a new coach at the moment since we have Kitambi and so far he has delivered. If he extends his good run with the team and he is willing to be our head coach, we will hand him the contract. If he doesn’t want the position on permanent basis, then we will bring in a new coach in June. So far, we are pleased with his performance.” Matano was axed over poor results despite being given a free hand to sign players. Mule also disclosed that controversial midfielder Collins Okoth risks to have his signing fee revoked if he doesn’t abide by the terms he agreed in on his contract. He said the holding midfielder would remain sidelined until his two-week ban elapses. “We decided to suspend Gattuso for two weeks in order for him to rethink his commitment to the club. Should he fail to abide to the terms agreed, we will have to demand the signing fee back.”
