Two people were charged in Mombasa on Tuesday court with being in possession of a two-month-old monkey. The court heard that Feisal Salim and Mbarak Feiswal were found with the animals at Nakumat area in Likoni on Monday. It was said the two had hidden the Vervet monkey inÂ a
compartment of a scooter, in violation of the Wildlife Conservation and Management Act. Kenya Wildlife Services officer Jackline Maiyo said Salim and Feiswal were apprehended after auctioning the monkey on Facebook. Salim posted a photo of the animal on his page, prompting the officer to approach him for negotiations for a sale. He agreed to sell it for Sh6,000 and took it to a meeting place they had agreed on. "Salim brought the monkey to Nakumat
supermarket in Likoni in the company of Feiswal who was
driving the motorcycle," Maiyo said. KWS officer swung into action before Maiyo made the payment and arrested the two. The prosecution said the monkey was not presented in court as an exhibit as there are plans to release it to a forest. Senior Principal Magistrate Francis Kyambia released the accused
on a bond of Sh100,000. The case will be mentioned on March 27. Click here for the latest political news
