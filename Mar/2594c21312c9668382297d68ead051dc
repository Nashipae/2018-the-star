The government has defended its move to bar journalists from accessing JKIA to cover the dramatic return of Miguna Miguna. Interior Ministry spokesperson Mwenda Njoka on Tuesday told KTN that JKIA is classified as a restricted area that requires no filming. Njoka said media should not have been allowed to capture Miguna's return from Canada in the first place. "Entry of journalists at the airport is not a requirement. You are either allowed or denied and that is part of security measures." "By them filming the return of the drama queen by the name Miguna Miguna was not supposed to have happened in the first place," Njoka said. On Monday night, journalists covering the proceedings were roughed up by officers when the stand-off persisted late into the night. A number of them sustained injuries during the commotion that ensued. Citizen TV's Stephen Letoo was seen writhing in pain, ostensibly after he was assaulted by an officer. But Njoya said the media had blown the whole thing out of context hence strict regulations needed. Njoka reiterated an earlier statement by the immigration department that Miguna automatically lost his Kenyan citizenship in 1998 after he applied for a Canadian citizenship. He said the NRM general will only be readmitted after he complies with all the stipulated IATA regulations.

According to him, IATA regulations require that when you land at JKIA you present your travel document for clearance which Miguna refused. "Miguna must be told he is not special and we cannot breach the law because of him. The court in its orders did not waive the requirement for citizenship and with the move, we have taken we are not in contempt," he said.
