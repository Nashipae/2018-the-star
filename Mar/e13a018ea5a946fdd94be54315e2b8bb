Kenyan travel and tourism industry players will participate in the ITB Berlin expo this week. The fair will take place between March 7 and 11. Kenya will send 42 tourism players. Participants include hoteliers, tourist boards, tour operators, system providers, airlines and car rental companies. Traders will network with top travel agents and get information on the global tourism sector. About 100,000 exhibitors from 180 countries will attend the expo and seek to get a share of Europe’s tourism and travel market.  “Although Europe is the leading tourist source market for Kenya accounting for a 36 per cent share of the total international arrivals in 2017, the German market, ranked six, is among the most resilient source markets for Kenya,” KTB chief executive Betty Radier said yesterday in a statement. She said the board aims to attract the youth, extended families and honeymooners to visit Kenya. The German market recorded 13.2 per cent increase in arrivals to 49,247 visitors compared to 43,502 travellers in 2016. Last year, Kenya shrugged off uncertainty associated with the long election season to record a 9.8 per cent growth in total international arrivals by air, sea and cross-border to top 1,474,671 visitors compared to 1,342,899 arrivals in 2016.
