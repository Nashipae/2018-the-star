Police on Tuesday released 132 youth who
were arrested with fake KDF calling letters at the Moi Barracks in Eldoret. Eldoret West police boss Samuel
Mutunga said KDF has not
provided necessary documents for which they can charge the suspects. He said most of the suspects were freed unconditionally,
others on police bond while a few were released on after depositing bail. Mutunga said it was not possible to
charge the young men without evidence. The suspects were arrested at the KDF training college on
Sunday after presenting the fake documents and were handed to police for further investigations. Read: 132 recruits arrested with fake KDF admission letters at Moi Barracks, Eldoret "We cannot charge the suspects without
proper statements and documents from the military. It will be a waste of time
on cases that will flop," Mutunga said. He said they needed statements from
vetting officers and others involved in admissions at the college where the youth
were arrested. Mutunga said that he has written to
military police to avail necessary documents that police can go ahead and
charge the suspects. He said the law does not allow
police to hold suspects for more than 24 hours, hence the decision to release
them. State counsel Zachary Omwenga said his office had 
not received files for the suspects to allow the DPP prefer charges
against them. "We just learned of the arrests through the
media. So far, we have no files about them and we cannot thus process any
prosecutions," Omwenga said. He 
said the police had taken the right move by writing to the KDF to seek
full details about those arrested before prosecutions can go on. Omwenga said the case would have proceeded
well if it was handled by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC). Click here for the latest political news
