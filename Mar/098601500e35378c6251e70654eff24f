Deputy President William Ruto yesterday urged farmers to invest in dairy farming. He said it is the single-largest agricultural enterprise, contributing about four per cent to the countryâ€™s GDP. This is about Sh300 billion annually. Ruto said the sector has remained under-exploited. Dairy farming is a source of livelihood for 1.8 million Kenyans living in rural areas. The county governments are yet to support agriculture fully, despite it being a devolved function, Ruto said. This was in a speech read on his behalf by Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri during the Third Annual National School Milk Conference in Mombasa.
