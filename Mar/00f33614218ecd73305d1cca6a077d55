Garissa Deputy Governor Abdi Dagane on Friday urged the county assembly to pass the Water Bill to enable the county to ensure proper water use. The bill seeks to stop illegal pipe connections. It proposes stiff penalties for violations. It is drafted by the executive. Dagane said it will ready in two months. It will help streamline the sector, he said, after inspecting and opening renovated water tanks in Bulla Sagarey. “For a long time, we’ve had issues with the manner in which the water sector is run. This has led to residents suffering for lack of water,” Dagane said. The Garissa Water and Sewerage Company has said it loses more than Sh25 million monthly because of illegal piping.
