Jubilee and Nasa MCAs came to blows yesterday in the Garissa assembly over a simple motion to adjourn for an educational workshop. The three-day workshop, which started yesterday and ends on Friday, aims to educate MCas on the county’s Integrated Development plan to be tabled soon. Trouble started when some Nasa MCAs tried to oppose the motion to ajourn, saying it was against the house’s standing orders. According to procedure, the majority leader is supposed to move the motion and in his absence, the minority leader does it. Yesterday, the majority leader was absent, hence, minority leader Mohamed Ali would have automatically moved the motion. However, because Ali is from the opposing side, Jubilee didn’t want him to do so because they would have lost. Sensing defeat, Jubilee MCAs proposed Mohamed Gabow to move the motion. This move angered Nasa MCAs who were led by Dadaab MCA Mohamed Abdi. They decided to grab the mace and disrupt the house proceedings. Abdi was, however, intercepted by the sergeant-at arms who managed to snatch back the mace and put it in place. BRAWLS NOT UNCOMMON  Then the two sides started shouting at each other. The Deputy Speaker managed to restore order and ruled in favour of Ali who said it was wrong to adjourn without sufficient notice. The deputy speaker said a workshop did not warrant adjournment. This is not the first time MCAs from the region have engaged in fist fights. The same happened in Wajir county assembly last month and also in Mandera county Assembly in November last year. Clan politics and interference by the executive have been blamed for the scuffles. Click here for the latest political news
