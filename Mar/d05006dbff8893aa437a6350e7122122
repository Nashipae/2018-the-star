The President of Mauritius resigned from the ceremonial position on Saturday amid accusations of financial impropriety that triggered a dispute between her and the Prime Minister. President Ameenah Gurib-Fakim's lawyer Yousuf Mohamed told local Radio Plus that she had decided to resign "to prevent a constitutional crisis". "She doesn’t want the country ... to suffer. In the country’s best interests she has decided to leave," the lawyer said. On Wednesday the President - who denies wrongdoing - rejected calls to resign, saying she was ready to provide evidence in court to debunk the accusations, prompting a rebuke from the prime minister.
