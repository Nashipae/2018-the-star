Kirinyaga county government has come up with resourceful project to cut off brokers, middlemen and tenderpreneurs being used by corrupt officers in supply lines. Governor Anne Waiguru yesterday launched a garment factory for women groups to be making hospital linen for all hospitals. Middlemen have been supplying the hospitals at exorbitant cost. Governor Waiguru said the women groups have been organized and facilitated with sewing machines and fabrics to make all linens for patients, doctors, nurses and subordinate staff. The project dubbed ‘’Tuwesheze Wamama’’ is aimed at cutting costs and at same time empower women in commemoration with World Women's Day on Maech 8. Waiguru was accompanied by her Deputy Peter Ndambiri and number of county executives. She emphasised her administration will cut off tenderpreneurs at all costs. ‘’The time when one individual was making millions of shillings by supplying low quality linens to hospital and they are long gone. We are changing how things are done to ensure we benefit all and get quality services,’’ she said. The county boss revealed she will oversee the groundbreaking for construction of a six storey building next month Kerugoya county hospital to increase bed capacity from the current 250 to 500. ‘’The services which will be provided in our hospitals will be of high quality like any other major hospital. There will be no need of going to private hospital,’’ she said. ‘’With commencement of this project I hope we will keep off corruption and cut off middlemen who have been exploiting us for long,’’ she added.
