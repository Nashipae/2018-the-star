A forest lobby wants the reintroduction of customary laws to train the community in environment conservation. Northeastern Forest Conservancy chairman Ahmed Mohammed yesterday said the county government should, through the county assembly, come up with relevant legislation. He said anyone cutting down a tree should be fined three goats. The community, primarilymade up of pastoralists, moves from one point to another. Mohammed said they should be given seeds to plant in the grazing fields. Dr Mohammed said cutting down a 300-year-old tree should not go unpunished. Some of the indigineous trees are used for charcoal, which Mohammed says needs to be controlled. The regional conservancy coordinator said such projects in Garissa Township and Ijara may lead to more than 2,000 trees being planted. He urged the community to conserve trees to reduce the effects of climate change.
