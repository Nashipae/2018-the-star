The Mbagathi Hospital will carry out its first kidney transplant next week, Governor Mike Sonko has said. The public hospital is scheduled to carry out the complex surgery with the help of surgeons from India. The hospital has been fitted with state-of-the-art theatre equipment. Sonko said it is unfortunate that majority of Kenyans have to travel abroad to seek medical attention when they have kidney problems, which is costly. Sonko said the first four kidney transplants will be free of charge but the hospital will be subsidise the costs in the future. The only other public hospital able to carry out complex kidney transplant is the Kenyatta National Referral Hospital. Rajesh Chaudhary from India said a programme to train local doctors in kidney transplant will be put in place. The governor at the same time said the Kayole II Maternity Hospital will also be commissioned next week after its completion to decongest Pumwani Maternity Hospital. The well-equipped new modern maternity has a 24-bed capacity and two delivery rooms. County Health Executive Hitan Majevdia has already inspected the Kayole II Subcounty Hospital Maternity wing set to be commissioned next week on Tuesday.
