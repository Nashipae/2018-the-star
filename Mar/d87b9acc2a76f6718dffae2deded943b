Just a day after the National Assembly’s committee on Health tabled its report recommending the disbandment of KNH board, MPs yesterday said they will now proceed to impeach Health CS Sicily Kariuki. Addressing a press conference at Parliament Buildings, MPs Nelson Koech (Belgut), Bashir Abdullahi (Mandera North) and Rehema Jaldesa (Isiolo Woman Representative) said the motion of impeachment will be tabled next week. Abdullahi will move the motion. He said they have presented the special motion plus the signatures to the office of Speaker Justin Muturi and clerk Michael Sialai. “More than 100 MPs have signed the petition. By next week, after seven days, as required, the House will be discussing this matter,” Abdullahi said. Koech said the legislators had asked the committee on Health to probe the matter before proceeding with the impeachment. The Belgut legislator said it appears Kariuki influenced the report which has put the blame in the office of Kenyatta National CEO Lily Koros. Jaldesa accused the CS of arrogance and disrespect of MPs. She said she was once asked to leave her bag at the reception before being allowed inside Kariuki’s office when she was Public Service and Gender Affairs CS. “Power has gotten into her,” she said. Two weeks ago, the momentum to impeach her gained momentum until Deputy President William Ruto told the MPs to withdraw.
