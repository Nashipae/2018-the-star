Police in the Central have started a crackdown on notorious miraa drivers who act as if they are above the law. Central regional coordinator Wilson Njega on Tuesday said numerous complaints have been made about the drivers' carelessness. "These vehicles are driven at very high speed and with a lot of impunity and end up causing numerous accidents," he said. Njega directed police manning the Nyeri-Kirinyaga-Murang’a road to be extra vigilant. The drivers, he said, do not respect other motorists and ignore police orders to stop for checks. Njega was addressing administrators in Murang’a town. He warned Probox owners against converting them into public service vehicles. The vehicles are used to ferry more than 10 passengers, endangering lives.
