Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata has praised the proposed removal of Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula as Senate Minority leader. Kang’ata said Wetang’ula deserved to be replaced with Siaya senator James Orengo. He added that he was the loudest in insulting President Uhuru Kenyatta during campaigns. The senator on Saturday said Wetang’ula, a NASA co-principal, is the only senator elected through his Ford Kenya party and does not deserve to lead NASA members in the Senate. Kang’ata said it is unfortunate that Wetang’ula and principals Kalonzo Musyoka and Musalia Mudavadi are against the unity forged by opposition chief Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta. Kang’ata said the co-principals do not have a strong support base and will have to eventually back the pact between Raila and Uhuru as they have nothing to bring to the negotiations table. “Wetang’ula was one of the most vocal Nasa leaders in mudslinging Jubilee and causing confusion in the government, so I do not sympathise with him,” he said.
