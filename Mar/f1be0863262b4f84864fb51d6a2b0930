A Kirinyaga family want justice for their son who died in an accident involving Nominated MCA Maureen Muthoni. Area police boss A. Chome confirmed the Tuesday accident and said action will be taken once investigations are completed. Victim Derrick Nyagah had just graduated from Kerugoya University and started working as a casual employee at Kukena Sacco. He died after the accident that took place at about 9am at Kaitheri village Kirinyaga Central Sub-County. Muthoni is said to have been driving her private care from Mikinduri area to Kerugoya town using Mbaricho-Kerugoya Road when it occurred. Nyagah's family has demanded the arrest of the MCA. His sister-in-law Regina Muthoni said they don't understand why she has not been arrested since the accident took place. "Witnesses said she had been driving at a high speed when she lost control of the car and hit Nyagah, who ended up motionless on his motorcycle on the other side of the road." Regina said the victim suffered injuries to his head and legs and that doctors at Kerugoya Level Five Hospital were unable to treat him. They referred him to Tenri Hospital in Embu County. At Tenri, the family said, a CT scan found Nyagah sustained serious head injuries so he was referred to Karira Mission Hospital In Kerugoya for specialised treatment. "He was confined to the Intensive Care Unit at the Kerugoya hospital and succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday," Regina told the Star on Thursday. "We are very sad became the man in whom we had high hopes is no more. Worse still, the person who caused his death [has seemingly] gone Scot-free." The family demanded justice by way of speedy investigations and the arrest and prosecution of the MCA. Click here for the latest political news
