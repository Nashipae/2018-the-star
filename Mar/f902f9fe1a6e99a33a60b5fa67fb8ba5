The state has asked Mumias Sugar Company managers to prepare a revival plan before more money is pumped into the firm. Deputy president William Ruto urged the Kakamega County Government and firm to outline measures that would save the miller. The national government has used Sh3.7 billion to bailout the cash-strapped company since 2015. Speaking in Kakamega on Saturday, Ruto said the state may withhold further support unless the miller accounts for the money given during the Jubilee administration’s first term. “We are asking the government to please address the Mumias Sugar issue. Our farmers are suffering,” Ikolomani MP Bernard Shinali said. The leaders present vowed to unite and ensure the miller is up and running. “At least Sh5.6 billion is needed to revive the company. It is up to leaders from the region to fight hard for the survival of the company,” Busia Senator Amos Wako said. Some leaders blamed the previous managers of misusing cash. We are asking the government to address the Mumias Sugar issue. Our farmers are suffering,” Ikolomani MP Bernard Shinali said. “I know the Jubilee government will not let the firm collapse. It has previously bailed it out ,” Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali said. Errol Johnston stepped down as CEO in May 2017 and was replaced by Nashon Aseka. The firm resumed milling, but lacks raw materials. Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has shown interest in helping revamp the sugar firm.
