Kenyan muslims risk being locked out of the annual pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia over a Sh 23 million debt. The money for transport and accommodation in Mecca is owed after Supkem’s Kenya Hajj Mission failed to remit the cash to their Saudi counterparts last year. Supkem’s Abdullahi Salat told Friday Bulletin - a Muslim weekly news journal - that the debt had been incurred by their predecessors voted out of office late last year. Officials, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Star those intending to go for Hajj book their trips through travel agencies, which remit their cash to Supkem and through its Hajj Mission committee, which then acts as a contact organisation.
