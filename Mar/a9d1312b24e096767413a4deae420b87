A police officer who on Wednesday shot dead his wife and their five-year-old daughter after a domestic quarrel was charged in a Nakuru court yesterday. Cosmas Biwott appeared before Judge Maureen Odero. “Being the first appearance before this court, the accused is not required to take a plea, but he is being made aware of charges facing him,” Odero said. He committed the offence at the Anti-Stock Theft Unit camp in Subukia, Nakuru. Biwott will take a plea on March 15. The judge ordered that he be taken for psychiatric examination and be remanded, pending plea-taking.
