The High Court has been asked to send a parastatal boss home over alleged falsification of birth date and compel him refund Sh10 million illegally earned as salary. Joseph Gitonga and Carolyne Wanja sasy Tana and Athi River Development Authority acting MD Steven Githaiga altered his birth year from 1953 to 1958 to illegally extend his tenure. Also sought is an order to stop the Environment Cabinet Secretary and Tarda board from renewing Githaiga’s contract which expires next month. The two want Githaiga prosecuted and compelled to refund the money he drew as salary illegally as a result of falsification of year of birth. In their suit papers filed at the Milimani law courts, the two said the MD also changed his name from Stephen Maina Githaiga, which is captured on his national ID card, to Stephen Ruimuku Githaiga on his passport. The alleged decision by Githaiga to change year of his birth amounts to criminal action, they say. Githaiga also faced accusations of hiring 37 employees without the board’s approval. The two want him to pay Sh13.7 million, the total basic pay earned by the 37 he allegedly hired.
