Matatu operators in Naivasha and Gilgil are protesting against the poor state of roads in the two subcounties. The roads have deteriorated in the heavy rains. Most of the roads in Naivasha town are impassable. The drainage system has also been clogged, further worsening the situation. Naivasha PSV Owners Association chairman Stephen Mungai on Friday issued a one-month notice to the county government to fix the problems. He spoke when members of 22 saccos from Naivasha, Gilgil and Nakuru towns met and elected their leaders in Threeways Hotel in Naivasha. Mungai said the sector that employs hundreds of youths had been shortchanged for years. He said they want to be involved in decision-making. “The county is keen to collect parking fees from us, but we do not get quality services. Transport gets disrupted in and around the town whenever it rains,” Mungai said. He said Moi Ndabi, Maella and Ndabibi roads are the worst-hit. He said matatu operators incur huge losses every day because they must repair vehicles damaged by bad roads and flooding. Association treasurer James Kiiru said transport is always crippled during the rainy season. He urged the county government to engage the matatu sector on improving transport. “Whenever it rains, there are some parts of Naivasha town which become impassable,” he said. Association organising secretary David Kimani said new office bearers will engage county leaders on problems facing the sector.
