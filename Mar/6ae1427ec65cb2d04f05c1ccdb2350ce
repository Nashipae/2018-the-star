Two suspected machete-welding gangsters were shot dead on Tuesday evening in Mombasa's Likoni area. They were killed in Mtongwe area by police officers as they planned to stage a robbery in Soko Mjinga. Likoni police boss Benjamin Rotich said they were in a group of five that used motorcycles to ambush police officers on patrol. “We received reports of a planned robbery and mobilised officers. The two were shot dead after they attempted to attack police officers while three of their accomplices escaped." Rotich said two machetes and a motorcycle were retrieved from the “notorious gang behind a series of robberies within Likoni". Police launched a search for those who escaped. Early this year, police released the names and photographs of at least eight notorious gangsters who have been staging attacks. Gangs in Mombasa include the Kapenguria six, Wajukuu wa Bibi, Young Thugs, Chafu, Watalia, Wakali Kwanza and Wakali Wao (Kisauni), . Last Tuesday, security agents shot dead the suspected gang leader of the Wakali Kwanza gang in a foiled robbery in Kisauni. The suspect identified only as Jilo was gunned down by officers on patrol after attempting to attack them at around 5.30 am in Swalihina area. Kisauni police boss Sangura Musee said the officers were alerted by residents who saw gangsters armed with machetes robbing traders heading to Kongowea market. Mombasa residents have protested runaway crimes carried out by juvenile gangs craving lavish lifestyles.
