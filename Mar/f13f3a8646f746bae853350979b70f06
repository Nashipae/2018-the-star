North Rift governors want the county governments to be given powers to distribute subsidised fertiliser to weed out cartels who have hijacked the distribution. Uasin Gishu Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno and his Trans Nzoia counterpart Stanley Tarus separately said the state should allow the counties to distribute the fertiliser because agriculture is a devolved function. Chemno said the shortage of fertiliser being experienced might affect maize production this year. He spoke in Eldoret during a meeting with farmers on Wednesday. Regional governors led by Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu) have discussed the proposal with the national government. Director of the Kenya Farmers’ Association Kipkorir Menjo said farmers have only received 50 per cent of the supplies needed. “We have faced the worst challengers in the distribution of fertiliser this year. Production will definitely be affected,” Menjo said. More fertiliser will be provided availed at the Eldoret NCPB depot by next week, following a meeting between the board’s officials and the governors in Nairobi. STRUCTURES Chemno said the county will also provide subsidised certified seeds to farmers. “For every 1kg, we will pay Sh30 for the farmer. The county will also offer transportation to farmers who are members of cooperative societies,” Chemno said. Chemno said devolving agriculture would end delays in the delivery of fertilisers. “We have structures in place up to the village level to handle fertiliser distribution,” he said. Tarus urged the national government to gazette the Fertiliser Guidelines Act to avoid future delays. The county chiefs also called for the registration of farmers to get rid of cartels. “The time has come for us to clearly identify genuine farmers who should benefit from government programmes,” Chemno said. Chemno urged farmers to diversify to expand their sources of income and end over-reliance on maize.
