The National Environmental Complaints Committee has called on the Busia county government to address deforestation and sand harvesting that have led to environmental degradation. NECC member Isabella Masinde, who was in the county to hear complaints from residents, regretted that Busia has the lowest tree cover at 2.2 per cent compared to other counties in Western Kenya. “Residents should be involved in planting trees. They should be sensitised on the importance of conserving the environment,” she said during a meeting chaired by Busia Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi.
