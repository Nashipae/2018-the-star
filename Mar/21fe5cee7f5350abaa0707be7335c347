My dear people of Nairobi, my heart goes out to all of you who have been forced to bear the dire conditions brought about heavy rains pounding in our region. It is indeed sad that all over the country the situation is similar and Kenyans have been forced to deal with damage, floods, road snarl-ups and even death. Rains are supposed to be a blessing and not a curse. Towards this end, my government has hit the ground running to mitigate against the adverse effects we have seen since the rains started. As a start, I have today directed the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company to hasten the process of unlocking the drainage system all over the county.

In the same vein, I am shocked that some Sh10 billion set aside by the previous administration for unblocking the drainage system did not go to the intended use but ended up in the pockets of some unscrupulous characters. I am putting them on notice that these monies must be recovered through sweat and toil and put into good use for Nairobi residents. As my long term plan, I will be exploring ways of how we can harvest this water and put to use when the dry season- which is sure to follow soon- catches up with us. It is indeed heart wrenching that we leave all this water to go to waste yet we can store it and with good treatment we can have it for our domestic use. Meanwhile my emergency teams are forever ready on a 24 hour stand by alert to serve you in case the situation deteriorates. Thank you Click here for the latest political news
