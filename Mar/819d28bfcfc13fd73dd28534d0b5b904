Kisumu Central MP Fred Ouda has defended himself against criticism and asked for time to deliver on his campaign pledges. The MP urged residents to desist from cheap propaganda aimed at tarnishing his reputation and instead focus on steering development growth. The MP has been facing a lot of criticism from locals who accused him of doing little to initiate development. They say he has no time to listen to their plights, adding that they made a mistake in electing him. But Ouda dismissed the allegations terming them “witch-hunt” by those who are not development oriented and only want him to fail. Ouda said elected leaders should be accorded necessary support to deliver their manifestos.
