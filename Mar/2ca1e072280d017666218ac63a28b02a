The number of deaths and hospital admissions due to non-communicable diseases is on the rise. The ministry of Health yesterday said that 55 per cent of the deaths and 50 per cent of hospital admissions have been a result of non-communicable diseases, NCDs. Health CS Sicily Kariuki sayid 25 per cent of the population was either on treatment or unknowingly living with high blood pressure and other heart-related diseases. The CS spoke at a meeting bringing together players in the health sector and the donor community at the Enashipai Resort in Naivasha. Kariuki said NCDs have continued to increase, despite efforts by the government and private sector to reduce them. “NCDs already represent a major proportion of the disease burden in Kenya and this proportion is likely to increase over the coming years,”she said. The CS added that the cost of treating the diseases outweighed the cost of prevention. She said community medics must be empowered to drive the preventive option. “Unless we do more and make concerted efforts towards preventing and affordably treating NCDs, the attainment of universal healthcare is unlikely,” she said. She called on the private sector to enhance its activities in areas such as procurement of drugs, which she termed as the most expensive. “We know that a major driver of the cost of treatment of NCDs is the cost of medication, which often exceeds 40 per cent of the total cost of treatment,” the CS said. She called for introduction of technology to ensure access to preventive measures in the rural areas. “With that investment, it will be possible for doctors and nurses in rural areas to screen patients, relay results to specialist doctors in urban areas and for specialist doctors to interpret the results and give clinical guidance remotely,” she said.
