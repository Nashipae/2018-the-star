Migori county sugarcane farmers are abandoning the crop because the sector has collapsed and are turning to eucalyptus farming. Farmers said they have been discouraged by the low cane prices. They said planting sugarcane is labour-intensive, the crop takes more than two years to mature and the cost of inputs is high. On Sunday, a group of 20 youth led by Wycliffe Okong’o from Nyakwere area in Rongo constituency undertook eucalyptus farming, after watching their parents toiling for little gain growing sugarcane. "Most timber yards in Migori are owned by traders from outside the county. We need to change the trend. Residents should be encouraged to venture into tree farming," Okong’o said. He said demand for eucalyptus is high. It grows fast and can be used in many kinds of construction and carpentry. Demand is fed by the expansion of major towns. The group planted more than 3,000 eucalyptus seedlings on an acre previously used for sugarcane. They expect between Sh800,000 and Sh1.5 million. They spent Sh20,000 to buy seedlings, compared to Sh70,000 for sugarcane. Click here for the latest political news
