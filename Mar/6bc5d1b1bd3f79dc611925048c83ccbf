The Kenya Forest Service Board is on the spot for unprocedurally sending home senior officials. Chairman Peter Kinyua said on Wednesday at KFS headquarters most of the officials sent on compulsory leave are yet to receive letters. Chief conservator Emilio Mugo was replaced by Monica Kalenda. The Parliamentary Committee on Environment reads mischief in the changes. Yesterday, Environment CS Keriako Tobiko (pictured) was supposed to appear before it, however, he sent PS Charles Sunkuli to represent him. He was flanked by Kalenda and acting head of administration and HR Alex Lemarkoko. Read:KFS asks EACC for thorough probe, punishes 26 over forest destruction
