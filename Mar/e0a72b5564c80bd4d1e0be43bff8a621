Britam shareholders will earn a 17 per cent increase in dividends this year despite the insurer recording a dip in profits. The firm posted a net profit of Sh527.4 million in the review period, a 78.73 per cent drop from Sh2.48 billion recorded last year. Their gross profit was reported at Sh 865.8 million compared to Sh 4.2 billion reported during a similar period under review last year According to a press statement, the firm attributed the profit decline to a change in valuation method for long-term liabilities to gross premium valuation method. This is despite the one-off change positively impacting the company's 2016 earnings by Sh5.2 billion. However, the drop did not block the board of directors from recommending a Sh756 million in the dividend, or a final payout of 35 cents per share. The increase follows a 79 per cent drop in earnings per share which was recorded at Sh1 from Sh1.26 in 2016. The firms operating expense went up to Sh7.35 billion from 7.09 billion posted in 2016.
