A case in which a man was detained last week for sending threatening messages to Interior CS Fred Matiang’i was closed yesterday for lack of evidence. The prosecution said after investigations, it did not find enough evidence to charge Wycliffe Nyaega, alias Willy Musau Muthusi. Nyaega was, however, charged with impersonation. Nyaega had spent five days in remand to allow the police to complete investigations. Appearing before chief magistrate Francis Andayi, he denied the charge. The court heard that between January 21 and March 1, with intent to defraud members of the public, he falsely represented himself as Willy Musau Muthui by acquiring and transacting on a Safaricom line, which he had registered under Willy Musau Muthusi. Through lawyer Okong’o Omogeni, Nyaega said he needed clarification because he had earlier been presented before another court where he was detained for threatening Matiag’i. “We are now surprised that today the suspect is being charged with impersonation,” Omogeni said. The prosecution said the charge had nothing to do with the threats, as it had new evidence. The prosecution said the sim card was to be analysed and messages extracted by the DCI anti-cyber unit to establish the content. “The suspect is believed to have acted jointly with others still at large,” police officer Gerald Kamwaro said. The prosecution added that the investigations were to extend to Safaricom and establish the registered subscriber. Investigations may also lead them to Kisii and Nyamira so they can arrest others still at large, and recover mobile phones used.
