Kenya Railways has introduced parking fees for all vehicles accessing the SGR stations.
Initially drivers would park their vehicles at the station parking for free. The fee, that came to effect on Wednesday, applies to all classes of vehicles with the charges differing from one class to
class. The saloon cars and pick-up trucks parked  at the modern railway connecting Kenya's port
city of Mombasa to Nairobi will be charged sh 100 while minibuses and Nissans
sh 150 Owners
of buses and lorries which are considered commercial vehicles will part with sh
200. The rates are applicable on daily basis. “The charges
will take immediate effect on our Mombasa, Mariakani, Miasenyi, Voi, Mtito
Andei, Kibwezi, Emali, Athi River, and Nairobi stations,” Kenya Railways said
in a statement. This
development comes barely a month after the management hiked the train fare from
sh 700 to sh 1, 200 after the ministry of transport okayed it. The move comes two weeks after more than 12 taxi drivers operating on online hailing platforms were arrested and arraigned in a Nairobi court, charged with touting at the Syokimau SGR station.
