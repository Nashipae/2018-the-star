At least 20 people have died of cholera in Turkana since an outbreak in January, residents have told the Star. Journalists have been barred from hospitals and clinicsand referred to the Health executive. Resident Gabriel Ekalale told the Star the county should be not should hide the truth while more people are dying. “It’s  sad. I have personally lost friends and relatives in our village because of cholera,” he said. Ekalale said the county is reporting three deaths while over 20 have died so far. The worst-affected areas are said to be Longech village on an island in Lake Turkana and at Kalokol trading centre on the shors. “As I speak, more than 60 people have been admitted in Longech, while others are being referred to Kalokol health centre on the lakeshore,” Ekalale said. “Since the outbreak started,business people have been greatly  affected in Turkana as fish trade has been prohibited,” Longech resident Joseph Esekon said. On Tuesday last week, county Health executive officer Jane Ajele said the first cholera case was reported on January 11 in Katilu, Turkana South. A total of 178 cases were reported, she said. “Two deaths were reported in February at Katilu and another in March at Kalokol,Turkana central. We managed to control it mainly by providing purified water, drugs for treating water and educating the community about health and sanitation,” she said. The disease later spread to Turkana Central on the shores of Lake Turkana. The health executive admitted containing the cholera has been a challenge especially in Longech  where medics are forced to travel by boat. On Wednesday Journalists tried to get access to authorities at Kalokol health centre. But they were turned awayand toldto seek official comment. Residents say whoever talks tot he media is victimised. The national government  recently allocated money to mitigate cholera outbreaks in Turkana. Residents say the funds were misspent and now fighting the disease is a challenge.
