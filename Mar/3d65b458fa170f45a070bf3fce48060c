Nasa leader Raila Odinga has asked Siaya residents to give him the go-ahead to invite President Uhuru Kenyatta to discuss the pact. Raila told supporters to trust his decision of joining hands with Uhuru, saying the move is for the best interest of Kenya. The President has never toured Siaya county since he ascended to power. If Raila makes true his promise, Uhuru will tour Siaya for the first time. While in Ugenya on Saturday, Raila said the agreement with Uhuru is aimed at healing the deep ethnic and political divisions. “Before agreeing to become a team we came up with nine thematic issues that we intend to address ranging from corruption to electoral injustice,” Raila said. He, however, clarified that the journey to Canaan is still clear in his mind. He revealed by the time they were coming out to shake hands in public and declaring their intentions to Kenyans, the two had held lengthy discussions. The Nasa leader called for everyone’s support in realising his new dream of delivering a new Kenya, promising to ensure the President visits the region as a sign of unity. Raila was with Siaya Senator James Orengo. He said as Nasa they support the union. Orengo said the dialogue between Uhuru and Raila is aimed at spurring development to benefit all Kenyans, not individuals. They agreed as Nasa to unite with Jubilee after Uhuru acknowledged Raila’s contribution. The Siaya senator said the dialogue is strictly between the two leaders, and as foot soldiers, they will support any outcome. “I know the meeting is not about seeking small jobs for Nasa members, but for development across the country,” Orengo said. Meanwhile, the senator said the law should be upheld in disbursing funds to counties in good time. He added that the new deal with Uhuru will ensure those who lost relatives or were injured during Nasa protests are compensated.
