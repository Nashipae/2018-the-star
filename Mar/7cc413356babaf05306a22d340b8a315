Kenyans have been urged to harvest rain water. Water Resource Authority CEO Mohammed Shurie yesterday said citizens should adopt rain harvesting to have water for use during the dry spells, which are already being experienced in six counties, including Isiolo, Kajiado, Mandera, Tana River and Garissa. He said despite the rains currently experienced across the country, it is uncertain that they will adequately stabilise the existing water bodies. “All water users, especially commercial irrigators, landlords and industries are encouraged to invest in storage facilities to last them not less than 90 days. This is one of the conditions before acquisition of a permit,” Shurie said. “We should be able to cope with the situation,” he said, highlighting the current water situation.
