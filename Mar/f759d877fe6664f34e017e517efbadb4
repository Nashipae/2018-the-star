Three Mt Kenya MPs now want NASA leader Raila Odinga to join the government. MPs Gichuki Mugambi (Othaya), Paul Kimari (Mathioya) and Moses Kuria (Gatundu South) said having Raila in government will hasten development. They congratulated President Uhuru Kenyatta for reaching out to Raila for a political truce. Uhuru and Raila met at Harambee House, the Office of the President, in Nairobi last week and later addressed a joint press conference, where they called for unity and reconciliation. The three MPs want Uhuru to assign Raila a role in government. They spoke at Kariki ACK in Othaya on Sunday, during a fundraiser for the church. “I appeal to Raila’s co-principals in NASA to join him and the President. Politics are over and we must now focus on the task of development,” Kimari said. The co-principals - Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang’ula - have said they were not privy to the Friday meeting between Uhuru and Raila. Kimari called for unity, saying the President cannot implement his Big Four agenda when leaders are wrangling. WAIT FOR 2022 “We are happy because the truce will allow the country to develop. Our prayer is for NASA to joins hands with Jubilee so we can move forward,” Kimari said. He asked politicians to end politicking until the next election cycle in 2022. Kuria asked local leaders to tame excessive alcoholism in the area, saying brewing and drinking of illicit brews had returned. He said youths were wasting away their future due to drunkenness. Mugambi promised to ensure the Othaya Level Five Hospital is equipped and operationalised by next month. “We are pushing to have hospital funds released,” Kuria said.
