Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama has urged residents to join him in the journey of development. He spoke on Wednesday after the petition challenging his victory was dismissed. Nyagarama urged residents to ignore petty politics and focus on growth. “I am proud to say we have greatly improved service delivery and now as we carry on with our second term in office, we promise to do more for our people,” he said. “I envisage being that leader who at the end of my tenure in 2022 will not just be remembered as the first governor of Nyamira, but as the leader who brought change to his people.”
