The 2018 Kenya Open Golf Championship received Sh50m boost from Kenya Tourism Board towards the 50th edition of the event. KTB chief executive officer, Betty Radier underscored KTB’s commitment to support sports as a means of marketing Kenya as the preferred tourism destination. Speaking during the cheque hand over ceremony, Radier said: “As the organisation mandated with the task of inspiring the world to visit Kenya, we are committed to supporting sports events such as the Kenya Open that provide exposure to the destination on the local and international scene.” Among the engagements that will fall under KTB’s sponsorship include sponsorship of a game drive and cocktail event for local and international golf players as well as familiarisation tours during the course of the Kenya Open to expose the players to Kenya’s tourism offering. The KTB CEO hailed the Kenya Open Golf Limited as a key partner in the board’s efforts to showcase the diversity of Kenya’s tourism products which include golf tourism. “Our efforts to market Kenya as a golf tourism destination will not end with the 2018 Kenya Open Championship. We will intensify our efforts to ensure that Kenya is known more than just its globally acclaimed beach and safari product among others that have attracted many to place the destination into their bucket list,” Radier added. KOGL chairman, Peter Kanyago, said the sponsorship will go a long way in raising the standards of the championship. This year’s championship will be the most lucrative tournament on the European Challenge Tour, boasting of a total prize kitty of Sh62.5m. A total of 156 participants — 22 local pros and four amateurs.
