The Court of Appeal has dismissed an appeal application challenging the election of Kandara MP Alice Wahome. Justice Fatuma Sichale dismissed the application filed by Jane Mwaura, who contested the election of Wahome. Mwaura had asked the judge to give her more time to file the appeal. The petition was dismissed in November last year after the court found that Mwaura failed to serve Wahome with the court papers. But through lawyers Stephen Gitonga and Elisha Ongoya, Wahome said the court has no jurisdiction to extend or reduce time. They further argued that no memorandum of appeal has been filed yet and the petitioner was guilty of inordinate delay. In her ruling, Justice Sichale said it was clear that an appeal has to be filed within 30 days. The judge said election petitions are governed by a special self-contained regime of civil procedure rules, which were inapplicable except where expressly stated.
