More than 70 people have been arrested by the Pharmacy and Poison’s Board for operating illegal chemists shops in Nyanza and Western. The board has launched a sting operation to rid the region of illegal pharmacies. Jecinta Wasike, the board’s director of inspection and surveillance, yesterday said in Kisumu that 36 suspects were from Nyanza and 43 from Western. She said the crackdown will end today. It started on Monday. “We will be taking to court those arrested to be charged with various counts, including operating chemists illegally,” Wasike said. Chemists must be -registered by the board and given health codes through which they are identified. Customers can verify the codes by sending them through SMS to 21031. “We appeal to the public to continue sharing information with our inspectors to enable us to apprehend those running illegal chemists,” Wasike said. Senior inspector of drugs Julius Kaluai, head of the Nairobi region, warned against sale of expired drugs. He said such drugs must be disposed of properly.
