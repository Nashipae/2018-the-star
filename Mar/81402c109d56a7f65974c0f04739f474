Water rationing will continue despite the rains, the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company has  said. Acting managing director Nahashon Muguna said the company can supply only 505,000 cubic meters against a demand for 760,000. According to Muguna, supply is expected to increase following projected normal rains in the Aberdare region.The rains will raise water levels in the Ndakaini Dam, which supplies 84 per cent of the city’s water needs. “We expect to produce up to 526,000 cubic meters of water per day when we receive normal rains,” Muguna said. The NCWSC has partnered with the national government to rollout 24 underground water projects at Sh160 million each, to counter the deficit. Six boreholes are already operational. Muguna said 14 boreholes have been equipped while the others will be completed in the next three weeks. Muguna said the city’s water demand increases by 20,000 cubic meters per day. He attributed the increase to a rise in population. Nairobi has an estimated population of 3.8 million and it is projected to grow to 4.5 million by next year. “Water has to be pumped from locations outside Nairobi to meet this growing demand,” Muguna said. The NCWSC is depending on the Northern Water Collector Tunnel in Murang’a for more supply. The plant is expected to produce 100,000 cubic meters per day by 2020. Muguna said the NCWSC will continue producing the same volume of water until the onset of the long rains in April. As  such, the company will rely on rationing for equitable distribution. “Through this programme we have ensured the city central business area, all hospitals, the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and major security installations receive water 24/7,” he said. Water rationing affects informal settlements, exposing many to threats such as typhoid, cholera and other diseases as a result of poor sanitation. However, Muguna said the NCWSC will strive to ensure slums receive adequate water to avoid such outbreaks.
