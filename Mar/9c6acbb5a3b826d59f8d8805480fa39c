Kabras Sugar have set their sights on toppling champions KCB in the Kenya Cup final set for this weekend. Kabras beat Homeboyz 29-13 at Jamhuri Park while KCB edged out Impala 15-0 at the Lions Den in Ruaraka to reach the final. This will be the third meeting between the two sides in the final with the bankers holding the upper hand after winning the last two. In addition, the sugar millers are yet to register a victory over the bankers in the longer version of the game since promotion to the top flight in 2015. Kabras coach, Charles Cadovillis, revealed that they had acquired the services of former Kenya Simbas coach, Jerome Paarwater in the run up to the semifinal against Homeboyz. “We are looking for a partnership with him and Western Province to see how we can improve our game and get some structures to our play in addition to improving our players mentally ahead of the final,” added Cadovillis, He added that Paarwater had an intense one-week session with the team which paid dividends against the deejays. Cadovillis said they will need a good start against the bankers if they are to win their second Kenya Cup title in three years. “In our last match against KCB, we gave them a head-start of 24 points at half-time and we can’t afford to do that again, especially in a final. We have to start well and control possession and territory to get a chance of winning the title,” added Cadovillis. He said the final will come down to mental strength and best execution in both attack and defence. “In our previous matches against the bankers, we had possession but failed to convert into points and that’s why we must be keen to convert all the chances that come our away,” noted Cadovillis.
