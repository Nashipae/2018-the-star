Stella Mwangi, alias STL, has since moved on past the biggest impropriety in her music career. We all witnessed when US rapper Xzibit called her out on social media after she avowed on live TV that they had been involved in a series of rap battles together. Well, it turned out that her narration lacked veracity and was a complete fabrication. Perhaps that incautious idea was going to earn her some extra street cred. However, that aside, the Norwegian-Kenyan rapper has not relented from stirring the music scene with her endless efforts. Instead, she is getting more ambitious and ferociously soaring heights. While Stella has proven herself to be a consistent talent, she is constantly putting out music with the aim of solidifying her spot as the best female spitter from East Africa, as she tries to make herself even more relevant globally. Her diverse audience seems particularly impressed with her hip-house sound and mind-blowing visuals every time she delivers something new. Her catalogue is thriving on a more internationally recognised arrangements, as opposed to any upheld African sounds. We are less than halfway through the year, and she has about six new tracks out already, with her latest video being “10 Toes”. Supposedly, she is on to something. She could be working on a new album, but only time will tell. There’s no doubt that Stella is an experimental woman and a great influence to both male and female rappers in the country. Most upcoming artistes want to share in her glory: they want create like her and work with big acts; they want to grace big stages and perform to massive crowds. She’s come a long way since her early days. She’s constantly built a reputation and placed herself among the most influential Kenyan acts doing it right globally. And that is the thing about Stella Mwangi, she still puts out consistent work, and each release feels like a reminder of how good she can be.
