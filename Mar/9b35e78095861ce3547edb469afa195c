Scientists are banking on semen from Sudan to sustain white rhinos. Sudan, who died on Monday at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, was the world’s last male northern white rhino. The 45-year-old rhino died of old-age related complications. Ol Pejeta Conservancy CEO Richard Vigne yesterday told the Star the semen has been stored in anticipation of in vitro fertilisation. Sudan’s offspring Najin and Fatu are the only white rhinos remaining at the conservancy. “We have the samples stored in Europe and America and other zoos where northern white rhino used to be,” Vigne said on the phone.

Vigne said available eggs are those Najin and Fatu have. IVF is a new procedure on rhinos. It has previously been done on horses and human beings only. Left with no options, scientists will attempt to develop artificial reproductive techniques, including IVF to rescue the northern white rhino subspecies. Ol Pejeta Conservancy and DvÅ¯r Králové Zoo, in the Czech Republic, have partnered with the Institute for Zoo and Wildlife-Research Berlin, Avantea Cremona, Italy, and the Kenya Wildlife Service to conduct the first-ever procedure. Eggs cells will be extracted from the two females. They will be fertilised before the resulting embryos are transferred into female southern white rhinos who will act as surrogates. Sudan developed age-old-related infections on his back last year before his health deteriorated on March 1. A team of vets from around the world took care of him. Vigne said Sudan was euthanised after his condition “worsened significantly”. “He was a great ambassador for his species,” Vigne said.
