Invasion of public and private land in Kisauni has plagued the national and Mombasa county governments. But squatters (pictured) on the 177-acre Loma parcel in Kiembeni say they have found a solution to the problem. “We will eject them [grabbers] from the land because they are known,” Kisauni Squatters CBO chairman Hashim Mwakazi said on Sunday. The CBO has about 88,000 members. The Loma land is said to be owned by the late tycoon Swaleh Nguru. Plot 224/2/MN chairman Hassan Mkala said they have lived on the land for about 15 years and want the government to help them acquire title deeds for the parcels they occupy. He said invaders will be dealt with ruthlessly, accusing them of derailing their efforts to get titles. “We’ve been going round in efforts to acquire titles but these invaders make us look bad,” Mkala said. Some 6,000 people live on the Loma parcel, he said. Mwakazi said two of the 22 parcels occupied by squatters in Kisauni have been verified for possible issuance of titles. These are plot 331/1/MN in Utange, which is public land, and 350/2/MN in Barawa. The National Assembly Lands Committee has visited several parcels occupied by squatters, including Nguu Tatu. Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo has presented petitions of the squatters to the committee. Mwakazi, who addressed the Loma squatters in a meeting at Loma ground, said they are hopeful the government will find a solution. He told the squatters to be ready to pay a fee for the titles.
