A secondary student was killed by flash floods that also cut off the Narok-Mai Mahiu road on Tuesday night. Motorists and passengers were forced to spend the night in the cold after heavy rains swept away a section of the busy highway. The student from Governors Secondary School in Mai Mahiu was killed near the Karima trading centre. According to area chief Zachariah Igeria, heavy rains started at midday leaving a trail of destruction in farms and homes. Flash floods swept through the school as students left for home. “Three students were rescued. We have also recovered the body of the student who died. We are still searching for other students,” Igeria said. Tabitha Waithera, a resident, said their children could not go to school because of the rains. “Nearly all roads are impassable. We are asking for quick intervention so that normal operations can resume,” Waithera said. “We saw some cattle being swept away while occupants of a small car were rescued. We don’t know how long it will take us here,” passenger Peter Tobiko said. Infrastructure PS Julius Korir said the road would be opened in 48 hours. He blamed the damage on the heavy rains. It was the second time the road had been cut-off in a year. “We have a contractor on the scene and plans are underway to construct half a kilometre overpass to permanently address this problem,” Korir said yesterday. “We have a budget to do the repair. We are looking at redesigning the road in future so that we can fully address this perennial problem,” Kenya National Highways Authority director general Peter Mundinia said.
