Lamu East MP Athman Shariff yesterday asked the government to upgrade national schools in Lamu before allowing them to admit students. The MP said the current state of national schools in the county is wanting and there is need to improve their infrastructure to reflect their status, which is not the case at the moment. Lamu county has only two schools that have been elevated to national status. They are Mpeketoni Boys High School and Lamu Girls High School. He said it is unfair to admit bright students in the schools, yet they have not attained a national learning institution status. Shariff urged education players in Lamu to work towards ensuring students deserving national schools are admitted in institutions outside Lamu county. “When a student from Lamu scores 350 marks, you can’t admit him or her at Mpeketoni Boys or Lamu Girls just because they were recently elevated to national status,” he said. “We have the likes of Lenana School, Alliance, Mang’u and others. Let our children from Lamu get admitted there too. We shouldn’t limit our kids to schools here. National schools in Lamu need to first be upgraded.” In 2015, a county official urged the government to properly equip the schools that had been elevated to national schools. Former Deputy Governor Eric Mugo said the schools should be given enough funds to enable them measure up to their established counterparts. “It’s one thing to promote a school to national status and it’s another to ensure the schools live up to the title. How can a national school not have an ordinary science laboratory? Lamu especially needs special attention. Underdeveloped counties like Lamu need more focus,” he said.
