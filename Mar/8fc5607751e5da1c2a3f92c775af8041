The oldest Nyandarua MCA will have to lobby to be renominated by JP after county assembly speaker Wahome Ndegwa declared his seat vacant. Geoffrey Ngaruiya, 79, is among the four MCAs whose nominations by the Jubilee Party were nullified by the Nyahururu chief magistrate’s court on February 27. Judith Wanjala ruled in favour of Monicah Githae (disabled) and Solomon Kuria (youth). Ngaruiya said he represents the elderly and the business community, both minorities. Githae and Kuria challenged the nominations of Margaret Ireri, Ngaruiya, Wanjiku Muhoho and Joseph Kariuki. They said the four were nominated under the ethnic minority category, yet they do not belong in the group. Ndegwa on Wednesday said the court served his office on March 9. On March 14, the speaker’s office was served with another court order from the High Court in Nyahururu that stayed the execution of Wanjala’s ruling. This came after the MCAs appealed. Ndegwa said he considered the developments from both courts and declared Ngaruiya’s position vacant. “A vacancy has arisen with respect to the membership of the Nyandarua county assembly currently held by Geoffrey Ngaruiya,” he said. Ndegwa said he would notify the IEBC of his decision. Ngaruiya was immediately barred from entering the assembly by the serjeant-at-arms. Ngaruiya told the Star on the phone that he did not understand why Ndegwa vacated only his seat. He accused Ndegwa of applying the law selectively and settling a score, blaming the decision on personal differences. “Thirty days are allowed for lodging an appeal and they are not over yet. I have also appealed. That is everybody’s right,” Ngaruiya said.
