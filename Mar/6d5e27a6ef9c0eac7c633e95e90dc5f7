Members of the Embu county assembly’s budget committee have denied claims they fake retreats to pocket allowances. The members have been accused of pocketing up to Sh400,000 every month in allowances from fake retreats. The committee said the claims are fueled by malice. Chairman Robert Ireri yesterday said the accusations were unfounded. Last week, the committee was in Nairobi for a five-day workshop by the parliamentary budget office. Ireri said other MCAs failed to attend despite receiving invites. In December, the committee attended two retreats in Nairobi. Ireri said the retreats were necessitated by the supplementary budget. “There is nothing suspicious about the retreats,” Ireri said. He said there was nothing wrong for members to go for a retreat to consider an executive document. Ireri refused to divulge the amount members earn in allowances, but said the figures touted were ridiculous. Members have also complained of quorum hitches whenever the committee is away on a retreat. “It is only the committees on administration and finance that have quorum problems. Others have enough members to transact their businesses even in our absence,” Ireri said. He asked leaders of the other committees to create agenda for their teams instead of blaming the budget committee.  Ireri told aggrieved members to seek dialogue, saying it was needless to fight over assembly duties. MCAs last week accused members of the budget committee of greed and arrogance. The ward representatives said members of the budget committee recieve more allowance cash compared to what other committee members get.
