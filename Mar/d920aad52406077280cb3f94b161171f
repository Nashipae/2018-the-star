The Miguna Miguna saga has become a total embarrassment to the nation. While it is true that the vast majority of travellers do not enter or leave JKIA without valid travel documents, quite a number of State, Intelligence and military high-level officials known to the Government of Kenya come and go through JKIA and other points of entry and exit without travel documents, on a need basis. In these cases, the government goes to a great extent to facilitate their coming and going. The government knows Miguna better than it knows these American, Israeli, Chinese or British operatives. The spectacle of the four-day-long stand-off at JKIA, an airport that is currently under scrutiny by the US Federal Aviation Agency and the Department of Transportation prior to approval of direct flights to the US, is totally uncalled for. Nor is the protracted fight with the Judiciary through flagrant disobedience of lawful directives. Deploying hundreds of paratroopers at Terminal Two for mote than 72 hours, delaying an Emirates flight with 400 passengers aboard and bludgeoning journalists and their equipment on-camera are acts of abject poverty of thought by the State. The continued incarceration of a citizen of Kenya, in the guise of obedience to bureaucratic procedures, is unconstitutional, immoral and dictatorial. Miguna could have wanted to make a point but the State has only helped an obdurate man make a much bigger point. We have a rogue Executive.
