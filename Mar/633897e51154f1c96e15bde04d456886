The roads leading to the Dandora dumpsite are full of garbage and potholes, despite Sh210 million allocation for repair, a ward representative has said. Dandora IV MCA Francis Otieno said John Osogo and Muigai Kenyatta roads are impassable. In 2016, City Hall set aside Sh180 million for John Osogo and Sh40 million for Muigai Kenyatta. Otieno said trucks cannot access the site and instead deposit waste along the roads. “The situation worsens when it rains, resulting in huge losses to traders and wasted work hours,” he told the assembly Transport committee last Thursday. Otieno demanded answers from the Transport department, which he accused of taking him in circles. “Users increasingly find it difficult to undertake business,” he said. The two roads are six kilometres in length. Speaker Beatrice Elachi directed the department to respond in two weeks or she would personally intervene.
