Non-native teachers from Mandera county pledge not to return, saying they could be killed by terrorists. They also told Parliament they suffer discrimination from residents. They fled because of attacks directed at them. Last month, three teachers and the wife of one of them were murdered by al Shabaab militants in Qarsa village, 70km from Wajir town. More than 100 teachers have camped at the TSC headquarters in Nairobi, demanding transfers. The TSC agreed. On Friday, they said it is their right to work in a secure environment. On Thursday, teachers appeared before Parliament’s Education committee and narrated how they are discriminated against by residents because of their skin colour and hair texture. They cited sexual harassment and fear of attacks by students. Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion blamed the TSC. It said it had failed to manage teachers properly. He told the TSC to hire teachers from local communities in terror-prone areas. Emotions ran high as some teachers broke down. They said locals call them dehumanising names “We don’t take pride in being off duty. We love teaching and educating children,” one teacher said. Millicent Otieno said she was sent on forced leave after rejecting sexual advances from an education officer.“Racial discrimination is still alive in Mandera and other areas in Northeastern. As a union our stand is that teachers be transferred to safer areas as resident teachers take charge while the situation is handled,” Kuppet secretary general Omboko Milemba said. The House team led by Paul Melly (Tinderet MP) told the teachers to document their hardships and provide evidence. It directed the TSC to reduce the minimum number of years teachers should serve in a region from five to three. MPs faulted the KNCHR for failing to investigate discrimination. KNCHR programme manager Elizabeth Kariuki said this was labour rights issue reported. Teachers said they are afraid of reporting because of reprisal.
