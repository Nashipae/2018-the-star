Northeastern regional commissioner Mohamud Saleh says high level stakeholder discussions are ongoing to ensure that non local teachers transferred from Wajir are brought back. According to reliable sources within TSC, at least 960 non local teachers have since received their transfer letters although majority of them who are in safer areas within the county have not left. The transfers were issued after an increase in terrorist attacks that targeted non-locals. Speaking to the media after touring housing units for administration police officers in Garissa that are set for renovation, Saleh said the government will ensure that leaning is not disrupted. “It is unfortunate that TSC decided to carry out the transfers without proper consultations with all the stakeholders. Right now the government is discussing the issue and sooner rather than later teachers will come back,” Saleh said. He further said that they are in agreement that non local teachers along the boarder should be taken to safer areas. “Leaning should continue even with the limited number of teachers. We have candidates in class eight and form four who will be sitting for their exams at the end of the year whom we cannot neglect,” he said. The commissioner termed the Qarsa attack that left two non local teachers and spouse to one of them dead as unfortunate and an isolated one, adding that TSC should however not have used it to make a unilateral decision to transfer all non local teachers from the area. So far three people have been arrested in connection with the Qarsa attack among them the financier believed to be a Somali citizen. “As a government we are trying our level best to secure the region. civil servants and all the residents residing in the region have no reason to worry,” he said. Meanwhile, leaders and education stakeholders now want a constitution amended to curb the powers of TSC from the unilateral transfer of teachers at will.
