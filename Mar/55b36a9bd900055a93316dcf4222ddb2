Tiaty MP William Kamket has said constitutional amendment bills are inevitable ahead of the 2022 elections. Kamket has sponsored a radical bill to create a powerful Prime Minister and figurehead President. The MP who won on a Kanu ticket addressed the public in Baringo Central on Saturday. “In as much as I accept the need for some few corrections in my bill, it has to be passed before Kenya goes to the next polls,” he said. The legislature hinted that the imminent law is currently experiencing resistance from some parties, but nonetheless has to crossover the line.
