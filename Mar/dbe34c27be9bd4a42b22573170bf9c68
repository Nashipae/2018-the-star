Murang’a DCIO Japheth Maingi said this was the second attempt as the lawyer was abducted three weeks ago. In the first incident, it is said he was dumped at Gakonya area along Murang’a-Sagana road after wiring Sh1.2 million into a creditor's account The police boss said the lawyer had reported receiving threats from unknown people. He recorded a statement on February 21 and from then on, police kept a close eye on him. Maingi said officers trailed the kidnappers from Murang’a town at about 8.30pm. They intercepted them at Mathioya river as they attempted to exchange vehicles and number plates. “A the river, they opened fire when we ordered them to surrender," he said, adding this forced them to retaliate. Officers seized an AK47 rifle, a toy pistol and two vehicles the suspects had been using. Three members of the gang fled on foot carrying what is believed to have been a bag of weapons.
