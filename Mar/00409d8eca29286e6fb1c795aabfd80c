Kakamega Homeboyz head coach Mike Mururi is a man under siege after the club demanded that he wins their next two matches or face the sack. Club chairman Cleophas Shimanyula made the announcement while cooling down irate fans who demanded an explanation why the team was performing dismally. The angry fans chanted “Mururi must go” following their 1-0 loss to Ulinzi over the weekend at Bukhungu Stadium, something they had not expected. However, Shimanyula asked them to be patient with Mururi as he tries to fix things at the club, in their next two matches. The team has lost two matches in a row, 3-1 against Nzoia and 1-0 against Ulinzi. He observed that if Mururi doesn’t register convincing back-to-back wins, he will have no option but to let him go. He also called on the players to pull up their socks since a winning performance doesn’t solely rely solely on the coach. “Let’s all unite and support the team since fans, players and officials have different roles to play in order for a team to excel. We also need to embrace fair play and shun hooliganism that can taint our image and scare away our potential sponsors who have shown interest in working with us,” Shimanyula appealed. The fans also accused Mururi of lack of loyalty after trying to engineer a move to Vihiga United adding that it is this lack of concentration and commitment that is leading to the poor results. However, Mururi insisted he is committed to his work and is keen to see the team performing well again. “We lost our key player Charles Momanyi to Gor Mahia during transfer period and we are yet to settle down. I believe we have equally good players who can fill the gap as seek to fix the situation before our next game against AFC Leopards,” said Mururi. Homeboyz is currently 10th on the log with seven points.
