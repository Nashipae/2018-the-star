A woman was charged on Wednesday with assaulting and torturing her househelp for four years in her Kasarini Runda home, Kiambu town. Beatrice Nderitu appeared before senior principal magistrate Stella Atambo and denied that between 2017 and March 24 this year she assaulted Mercy Mwake and caused her bodily harm. The househelp escaped on Tuesday and reported to police. She said her ID card and phone were taken away when she was hired. Prosecutor Christine Mbevi requested for one more day to add more charges. She also sought to have Nderitu denied bond. Defence lawyer Masika requested the court to uphold the Sh10,000 police cash bail for the accused, adding she had a sickly one-year-old baby. Atambo ruled that the accused be detained, while her defence lawyer applies for bail.
