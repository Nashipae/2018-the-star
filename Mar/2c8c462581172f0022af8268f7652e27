All doctors must soon take insurance covers to protect them in case they are sued by patients. Currently, the professional indemnity cover is optional, but the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board plans to amend regulations and make it mandatory before any doctor’s licence is renewed.

The urgency was made apparent after speculation Samuel Wachira, the high school cook who was wrongly operated on in the brain at Kenyatta National Hospital last month, could be suing for compensation. “We have not decided to sue, but we have already secured a lawyer who is helping us,” his brother Amos Wachira told the Star.
