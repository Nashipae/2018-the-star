Baldev Chager clinched onto his lead in a dogged campaign as he searches for a maiden Top Fry Classic Safari Rally title in Laikipia County. Navigated by Ravi Soni Chager in a Kabras Porsche 911, the ‘Flying Singh’ won the opening long and grueling stage to stay ahead of the pack for the second day running. Carl Tundo, who recently equaled Shekhar Mehta’s record of five wins dipped quite a bit on the first stage but was back in the groove when he won the second stage to salvage his fortunes. Chager widened his lead with a massive 13 minutes over Alastair Cavenagh on the opening stage. Cavenagh, incidentally, was fourth fastest on the first stage, a clear indication that his Porsche 911 will be a car to watch. Chager, a three-time former Kenyan champion cleared the opening stage in 1:40.43 ahead of Kabras Sugar Racing teammate siblings Onkar and Tejveer Rai who came in second and third fastest. The going wasn’t that rosy for Tundo who dipped from second to seventeenth after returning 23rd fastest, which was quite detrimental to his campaign. Multiple Kenyan champion, Ian Duncan, restarted the rally after an excruciating day one which saw him run into early problems. After a grueling run yesterday, the cars had an overnight stay at Sweetwaters in Nanyuki. Today, the drivers will take a deserved rest after which they will resume action tomorrow morning. Crews will spend some time trying to repair their machines ahead of the final two legs in Baringo. The Top Fry Rally is one of the three events introduced to the 2017 KMSF Motor Spots Calendar with a possibility of running a full championship next year.
