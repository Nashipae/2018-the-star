Elgeyo Marakwet county has diverted Sh31 million allocated for a fire engine to pay salaries, the assembly has established. Residents of Elgeyo Marakwet will have to wait longer for a fire engine despite funds being set aside for it since 2016. Finance and planning committee chairman Wilson Cheboi told the assembly that the previous assembly had allocated Sh31.5 million for the purchase of a fire engine in the 2016/17 financial year. Cheboi  said a tender was awarded to ACE motors but the company delayed to supply the equipment beyond the stipulated time. The Cherangany/Chebororwa MCA said the funds were diverted to pay salaries after delivery of the engine were delayed. The current assembly had intended to provide funds for the fire engine in the supplementary budget for the current financial year but was unable due to so because of financial constraints occasioned by increased wage bill for doctors and nurses. “The funds for the fire engine were therefore reallocated to cater for the increased wage bill,” he told the assembly. Cheboi however, gave an assurance that the county will prioritize purchase of a fire engine in the 2018/19 financial year.  The budget process is yet to commence. Residents have been calling on the county to buy a fire engine as they have been suffering loses whenever there is a fire incident. Demands for a fire engine intensified after an inferno razed several shops in Iten town and Chebulbai trading centre in June 2016. Sh50 million worth of property was destroyed during the incidents as a fire engine from Eldoret was being awaited upon.
