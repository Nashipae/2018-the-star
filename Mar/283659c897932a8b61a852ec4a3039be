When exhaustion led to Akothee's admission to hospital, she was down but not out. She bounced back to shoot her latest music video, Oyoyo, featuring MC Galaxy. "I, madam boss, the president of single mothers, is urging all women to get off their pity party and stand for their rights," Akothee said. "I shot the video at a time when I was meant to be in hospital and on bed rest for exhaustion. Never stop believing in yourself. My fans should expect more hits and entertainment. After all, my life, your entertainment." The music video was released yesterday at 9pm on her YouTube page.Â Akothee did not spare any expenses in shooting the video. She went all out to showcase her lifestyle as a boss. A showbiz boss. In the music video, there is a private jet, a luxury car waiting to pick her once she walks down the blue carpet, and a presidential suite to chill in at a top hotel. "I can tell you for sure the budget came up to Sh5 million," Akothee's manager Nelly Oaks said. Akothee explained why this time round she has shot the music video not only in Kenya but also in her home county, Kisumu. "I stopped shooting videos abroad because I want to promote my culture and my country, let the resources revolve around my country. The video was shot in my hometown of Kisumu and I am proud of that." The video shoot brought Kisumu to a standstill. The set of the music video that was shot on the street was swamped with spectators.
