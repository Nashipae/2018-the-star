A parliamentary committee has cleared the PSC of any wrongdoing despite the Auditor General raising queries on payment of millions of shillings as mileage claims without proper guidelines. The Public Accounts Committee of the National Assembly, in its report tabled on Wednesday, gave the Parliamentary Service Commission a clean bill of health. It had been in the spotlight over the payment of Sh569.3 million to MPs as part of mileage claims. Auditor Edward Ouko, in his reports of 2015-16 and 2016-17, said Sh298.8 million and Sh270.5 million respectively were paid to some MPs. “Examination of records has revealed some of the MPs were paid mileage allowances without clear guidelines,” the report says. Committee chairman Opiyo Wandayi recommended that the PSC chaired by Speaker Justin Muturi implement the Salaries and Remuneration Commission circular of June 11, 2013. It outlined a deal between the SRC and PSC, which provided guidelines on how the mileage claims should be paid. SRC’s circular says mileage claims be based on the applicable AA rates and the distance from the member’s home. The deal provided that for the first 750km per month, a fixed rate of Sh356,525 is paid to all MPs. Any mileage claim beyond 750km be paid at the applicable AA rates. "Noting that the SRC circular is clear and precise on the processing of the mileage allowances, the committee resolved the PSC be guided by the said circular, resolving the audit query,” the committee recommends. In the report, the PSC accounting officer said the payments were based on the interpretation of the first circular guided by the MoU.It justified the Sh569.3 million to both members of the national assembly and senators.The auditor also questioned an outstanding Sh49.4 million imprest that is yet to be surrendered.
