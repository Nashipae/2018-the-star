President Uhuru Kenyatta has chosen Noordin Haji to replace Keriako Tobiko as the Director of Public Prosecutions. The significance of the office of DPP cannot be gainsaid: It is crucial for the rule of law and general governance. The last two DPPs were not effective because they got sucked into power struggles and other distractions that make it hard now to remember any landmark prosecution against high-level corruption. The President has stated several times that he is determined to make a lasting mark in his second and final term. A legacy that will be remembered for long does not come from the so-called Big Four alone. It will be the product of a system of government where the rule of law reigns supreme. Because, after all, nothing prospers, and no one invests where there is no accountable justice system, of which the DPP is part and parcel of. The new DPP starts off without a blemish; a hard-working man with an Intelligence background whom the Public Service Commission has found fit to serve. But he has to prove that he is not anyone’s stooge and will be beyond political manipulation and the corruption cartels that subvert justice. The country looks forward to new vigour in the investigative and prosecution arms of the Executive — all now in new hands — and to ruthless prosecution of crime.
