The National Police Service Commission has recommended removal of about 10 per cent of traffic police officers from the service after they failed vetting. NPSC chairman Johnston Kavuludi yesterday said the officers failed the integrity and financial probity test. He did not give the exact figure but sources said more than 400 police officers would be affected. The department has close to 5,000 officers. “We finished the decision-making as concerns the traffic police officers on Thursday last week, and those to be removed have been informed,” Kavuludi said. He said the suitability of the officers to either continue serving or be removed had been determined though a rigorous process. He was speaking in Eldoret after visiting Governor Jackson Mandago, before commencing the vetting of chief inspectors of police in the region for the next 12 days. The commission has been split in several groups, and Kavuludi is leading the group that will be in Uasin Gishu and Trans Nzoia for the vetting. Kavuludi said the removal rate of 10 per cent for the traffic department was the highest compared to other departments in the service. “It’s because the traffic departments has been the worst affected by graft,” said Kavuludi. He said most of the officers could not explain their source of wealth, including finances in their accounts. “They either gave explanations which did not add up or we investigated and found out details they had not revealed,” the NPSC boss said. He said officers aged below 50 will be removed from the service, while those above the age would be retired on public interest. All of them will be paid part of their dues. Kavuludi said a few officers had tried to avoid the vetting process by moving from the traffic department, but the NPSC will catch up with them.
