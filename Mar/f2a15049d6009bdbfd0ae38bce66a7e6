One hundred and ninety students whose 2017 KCSE results were cancelled got a reprieve yesterday after the decision was quashed. The results of the former candidates of Chebuyusi High School were cancelled by the Kenya National Examinations Council a month after their official release because of cheating. The school had been ranked 16 nationally and position one in Kakamega county. Justice George Odunga said Knecâ€™s decision was not done in accordance with the law. Odunga directed the council to conduct fresh investigations into the cheating allegations within 14 days to determine whether the results should be cancelled or not. Knec has powers to cancel results, but Odunga said the cancellation must adhere to the law. The cancellation had been challenged by parents who said it was arbitrary and unfair. They also argued the move would block the students from joining universities. Student joining university had until February 15 to choose their courses. Speaking after the judgement, the parents said they will oppose a fresh probe. They said Knec regulations do not allow investigations after results have been released.
