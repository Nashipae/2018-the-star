The Kenyatta National Hospital yesterday lifted the suspension of the surgeon who operated on the wrong patient. Doctors had boycotted work and called for his reinstatement, saying he was not to blame for the mix-up. The hospital has also suspended the letters it issued to the anaesthetists, ward and theatre nurses who were part of the team conducting the surgery. “Effective immediately, the board is not going to engage in this matter. We have left it to the Medical Practitioners and Dentists’ Board whose mandate is to look into such issues,” KNH board chairman Mark Bor told journalists.

The meeting was at the Ministry of Health Annex at KNH. The two patients in the mix-up, Samuel Kimani and John Nderitu, were released from hospital on Wednesday. Doctors said they are out of danger and can recuperate at home. Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki told investigators looking into the March 19 events to conclude the probe as soon as possible so the hospital can return to normalcy. “We expect the board of KNH to fully cooperate [by] availing all the necessary files that are needed relating to the case,” she said. Sicily and Bor remained silent about KNH boss Lily Koros and director of Clinical Services Bernard Githae, who were sent on compulsory leave after the surgery mix-up sparked public outrage. Sicily said an independent investigation will be conducted by the medical board and their findings presented to the ministry after seven days.  Click here for the latest political news
