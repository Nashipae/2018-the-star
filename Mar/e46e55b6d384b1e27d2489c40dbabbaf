A Nairobi court has summoned IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati and six other officials to give evidence on a case concerning politician Solomon Gichira. Gichiria, who was an independent presidential candidate in 2017, was arrested for attempting to jump out of a window from the sixth floor of the IEBC's office on May, 27 2017. He is charged with attempting to kill himself, creating disturbance and destroying IEBC property worth Sh134,386. The case was to be heard on Thursday but it could not proceed because of the absence of the witnesses. Milimani Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi issued the summonses after the prosecution sought an adjournment. Prosecutor Solomon Naulikha had noted that all the witnesses failed to appear since they are attending a seminar in Mombasa. "I therefore seek summonses to all witnesses in this case, including Chebukati, to appear in court on the next hearing date." The defence had opposed the prosecution's application saying the team was delaying the matter. Lawyer Dedan Wachira also noted they were ready to proceed. Gichira is accused of damaging an internet socket, a window, an air conditioner machine and an aluminum window, all property of the IEBC. The politician spent two nights at Nairobi's Central Police Station following his arrest. He denied causing disturbance by shouting his demands for an explanation on why he could not present his papers despite a High Court order. Gichira won a case against the commission so the court gave him the green light to present his nomination papers so he could run as an independent candidate. He denied all the charges and was released on a cash bail of Sh200,000.
