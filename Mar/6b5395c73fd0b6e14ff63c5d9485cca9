The government has started rolling out its urban programme of upgrading towns to municipalities in 45 counties. The $1 billion Kenyan Support Programme is funded by the World Bank. It will be spread across all counties except Nairobi and Mombasa. Housing and Urban Development director of administration Mabeya Mogaka yesterday concluded his tour of Kajiado, where he met Governor Joseph Lenku. The programme which started last October will see the upgrading of Kajiado and Ngong' towns into municipalities. “I have had fruitful talks with Lenku and assured him that Ngong' and Kajiado have met all the requirements set by the World Bank to qualify for upgrading," Mogaka said. Kajiado has qualified to get the first Sh20 million for institutional and capacity building for officers on the ground to start the upgrade. Under the programme, Ngong' will receive Sh215 million, while Kajiado will receive Sh50 million annually. “I met Lenku and he has assured me his county has set up boards, appointed managers and opened an account in readiness for the money to be released next week,” Mogaka said. The World Bank programme, he said, will run up to 2023. Kajiado is the first county among the 45 counties countrywide to rollout the programme. The money will be used in upgrading amenities to the standards requirement set by the World Bank. Click here for the latest political news
