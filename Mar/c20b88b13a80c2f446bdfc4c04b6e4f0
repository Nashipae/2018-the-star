Chief Justice David Maraga’s recent request to elders to help courts clear a backlog of land cases has been received with mixed reactions. Embu elders said the plan might not succeed because of frustrations they have faced from judicial officers and lawyers. Nyangi Ndiiriri Council of Elders chairman Andrew Ireri said they were willing to resolve land cases in Embu where poor people’s land has been grabbed by the wealth, but they face major challenges. Speaking to the press at Gikuru village in the controversial Mwea settlement scheme, Ireri said some lawyers and judicial officers in Embu are involved in the irregular sale of land belonging to the poor.
