The impeachment motion against Health CS Sicily Kariuki has been dropped, Majority Leader Aden Duale has said. He said the House leadership has resolved to handle the matter internally as the issues raised against the CS are not amount to gross violations of the constitution. “We will address those matters with the relevant government hierarchy, at the presidency (and) the government. We have serious other business to deal with like healthcare, manufacturing, food security, devolution and budget,” Duale said.
