An MCA in Embu wants Kirinyaga governor Ann Waiguru to help in footing bills for Embu level five hospital as the majority of patients are from her county. Margaret Lorna Kariuki, a nominated member on Thursday said 60 per cent of the patients visiting the facility are from Kirinyaga county. Kariuki said Kirinyaga residents are seeking medical services in Embu because their facilities are not well equipped. "Embu county has to pay for their healthcare from our small budget, I guess we should think around this Kirinyaga inflow to Embu, Waiguru should foot part of our medical bills in that facility," Kariuki said. Kariuki said she will push a motion to force Waiguru to pay for such expenses. "Political embarrassment to Kirinyaga county is paramount, the county should work on improving their health facilities," she said. However, other residents are of the opinion that all Kenyans have rights to be treated at any health facility in the country. Elias Mugendi said, "you can't deny anyone rights to be treated, actually Embu Level 5 serves Kirinyaga, Tharaka Nithi and some parts of Machakos andKitui." Embu level 5 CEO Moses Njue affirmed that the facility receives a large number of patients from the neighbouring Kirinyaga county on daily basis.  Click here for the latest political news
