The Kenya National Examinations Council has defended the credibility of last year’s KCSE and KCPE examinations criticised for being flawed. In an affidavit filed in court through the chief executive, Knec says the 2017 examinations and subsequent investigations were conducted objectively, fairly, in compliance with all laws and regulations and without malice against any candidate. Activist Okiya Omtatah wanted the court to compel Knec to release marked answer scripts to candidates. However, CEO Mercy Karogo objected to Omtatah’s petition, saying the rules don’t allow the scripts to be released after marking.

According to Knec, the awards and grade settings of the 2017 KCSE exam was done as per the Knec rules and regulations similar to previous years. “The petitioner lacks a fundamental understanding of what constitutes the norm and criteria- referenced examination,” the affidavit reads. Knec says it conducts all examinations in full adherence to the Constitution. Omtatah said, “Candidates who sit KCPE or the KCSE examinations have a right to receive certified copies of their marked answer sheets.” He alleged Knec’s failure to release the marked sheets to schools is arbitrary and shrouded in secrecy.
