Akatambala is the latest hit by Tanzanian star Saida Karoli and Ugandan star Hanson Baliruno. Speaking to Word Is, Hanson talked about how he met the Tanzanian artiste and how it was working with her. "I began my music in church. I legally launched my music in Europe. I have been solo but we recently did a collabo with Saida Karoli." So how was it working with Saida Karoli? "First of all, it would not have been 'Akatambala'. I wrote the song and sent it to her. When she came to Uganda, we did it but with another title. We remixed it because she noticed that I loved Akatambala. She wrote her part and I did my part. "Akatambala means handkerchief. It is a traditional song. In other traditions, when a girl is being set for marriage, she is given different gifts, but for Saida's cultre, they give her a 'Katambaa', so in the song she is telling the girl, Katambaa, use it, and always be with it and put it on. "Working with Saida was so amazing because she is a down-to-earth person. She is someone who loves performing and very easy to operate with. "She liked me as a person and had always wanted to work with her. I am also working on how I can do some collabos with Kenyans like Sauti sol, Nameless and even Victoria Kimani."
