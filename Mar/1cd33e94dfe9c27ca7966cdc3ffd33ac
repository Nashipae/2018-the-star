Janet Mbugua has let it slip that she would like to get twins, while responding to a question from one of her followers on her Q&A video with her husband on YouTube. Janet is twins with her brother Timothy Mbugua, while her husband Eddie Ndichu is twins with his brother Paul Ndichu. “We love being twins. We want twins, by the way, if it is in God’s plan,” Janet said. Janet is not one to open up about her life, but on a rare occasion, she also spoke about the pressure from society to live her life a certain way. The former news anchor for Citizen TV said she is no longer fazed by people's opinions and has opted to live her life as she pleases.
