It also involves offering relief to victims and survivors. Karua called for unconditional dialogue to address electoral justice, protection of human rights and restoration of security of all Kenyans. She said her party supports the process of building inclusivity, shared prosperity, fighting corruption, supporting devolution and fighting ethnicity and hatred.
