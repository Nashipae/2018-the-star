Cambridge Analytica, the firm involved in a row over its use of Facebook data, has suspended its boss Alexander Nix. In a statement it said Nix's comments, secretly recorded by Channel 4 News, "do not represent the values or operations of the firm". In news reports shown on Monday, Nix suggested tactics his company could use to discredit politicians online. However, Cambridge Analytica said the report had "grossly misrepresented" the conversations caught on camera. In Kenya, the Opposition's Nasa coalition has demanded a thorough investigation into the UK consultancy firm which helped take President Uhuru Kenyatta to victory. National Super Alliance official Norman Magaya accused Cambridge Analytica and the ruling party of trying to "subvert the people's will". Cambridge Analytica bosses were apparently caught on camera boasting of the control they had exerted in Kenya. The company denies any wrongdoing.
