New Bomet county commissioner Geoffrey Omoding has promised to prioritise eradication of illicit brews and cattle rustling. Cases of insecurity have decreased due to heightened security surveillance. His main objective will be to deal with those engaging in the sale, consumption and distribution of illegal brews. Omoding said he will work with local administrators, the security team and the public in finding a lasting solution. “The greatest challenge is with illicit brews. We will map all hotspots across the county,” he told the press at his Bomet office. Omoding is taking over from Erastus Ekidor, who was transferred to Nairobi in a reshuffle. Omoding’s statement comes in the wake of a national crackdown on illicit alcohol and drugs, where a multi-agency team was told to offer a lasting solution in 100 days.
