A supremacy battle between two trade unions could ground services at Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company. The Kenya County Government Workers Union and the National Union of Water and Sewerage Employees have written to the firm’s management, each seeking to be recognised as a union with the majority of members. On Thursday, Nuwase wrote to NCWSC acting managing director Nahashon Muguna asking him to start engaging and dealing with it on all matters affecting the welfare of employees. Through Maumo and Co Advocates, Nuwase general secretary Elijah Awach cited last month’s Court of Appeal decision that overturned a lower court’s ruling that KCGWU was the only union recognised at the company. But in a quick rejoinder, KCGWU secretary general Roba Duba wrote to the MD, warning him against recognizing or engaging Nuwase. Duba claimed his union has the majority of members.
