France 24 has become the first international news channel to get onto a digital free-to-air platform in Kenya, jostling for 2.3 million homes. On Wednesday, the broadcaster signed a partnership with SIGNET, a subsidiary of government-owned media house, Kenya Broadcasting Corporation The launch comes as Kenya continues to attract international attention from investors looking to tap into its strategic location, pool of talented entrepreneurs, burgeoning middle class and infrastructural growth. These and the discovery of natural resources have fanned an appetite for information which France 24 seeks to fill. The news channel also seeks to meet rising needs for diversified and trusted sources of international news among Kenya's growing middle class. In its flagship technology show, Tech 24, that seeks to celebrate Kenya’s pole position in championing innovation, France 24 will visit Nairobi’s iHub which has been the cradle of many successful tech start-ups.
