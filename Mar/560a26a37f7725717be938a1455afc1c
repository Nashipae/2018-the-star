Six major entry jetties in Lamu county face closure due to poor maintenance and rehabilitation. Some are too dangerous to use. The main Mokowe Customs jetty, Manda Airport jetty, Lamu island Customs jetty, the Mtangawanda, Kizuke and Jetty ya Ngo’ombe and are dilapidated. Rusted metal collapsed and wooden boards are rotting. They are too dangerous to use, the ramps and steps are unsteady. Travelers coming in and out Lamu island are putting their lives at risk when using the jetties — the only entry and exit points into and out of Lamu town. Last week, boat operators in Lamu town shut down a section of the Lamu customs jetty by force. It is supposed to be maintained by the ministry of Transport. The government has been criticised for using cheap and easily corrodible material in constructing the jetties. Lamu Coxswains Association chairman Mohamed Shee said boat operators now scramble for the remaining single lane in order to dock. Many boats are forced to dock at the shore. “The government has completely abandoned our jetties here in Lamu. The government can’t even renovate the Manda Airport Jetty which gives a bad image of Lamu since it is mostly used by international tourists landing at the airport. Locals and tourists’ lives are endangered and hurt daily tourism,” he said. Lamu deputy governor Abdulhakim Aboud said they have done a survey of all the six jetties and have submitted a report to authorities for action. Chief structural engineer in the state department of Public Works, Hillary Nyaanga, said he was aware of the situation. He said a team will soon assess the problem and submit a report for budgeting.
