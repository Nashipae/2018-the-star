NASA leader Raila Odinga’s swearing-in as the ‘People’s President’ has achieved nothing, Sports CS Rashid Achesa has said. He said on Saturday the event was illegal and will add no value to the lives of wananchi. Achesa accused Raila of engineering the removal of Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula as the Senate Minority leader. He spoke in Namawanga village, Webuye West, during the burial of Loice Maora, 94, the mother of Nzoia Sugar chairman Joash Wamang’oli. “We can’t have Raila victimise one of the Mulembe sons simply because he didn’t attend his swearing-in — something that achieved nothing beneficial to him or his supporters,” he said. Achesa praised Wetang’ula, Musalia Mudavadi and Kalonzo Musyoka for snubbing the event. “Raila got a lot of support from Western. He should not take the community for a ride,” he said.
