Details of the deal between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Nasa leader Raila Odinga are still unknown, but a joint committee will consider possible political reforms. Aspects of the new Constitution do need to be reviewed - land, the number of counties, the role of the Senate, the number of MPs, etc. But it may also be time to revisit the idea of a parliamentary system, something that many Nasa leaders advocate. A parliamentary system was only smuggled out of the new Constitution at the last minute in 2010. It would end the winner-take-all of the 'imperial' presidency. An executive Prime Minister in Parliament would constantly have to work with other parties to keep a majority. A Prime Minister could stay in power indefinitely, but could also be toppled overnight if MPs ceased to support him or her. A parliamentary system would hopefully lead to coalitions based on policies, rather than sharing of the cake. The ethnicity of presidential candidates would become irrelevant, as we would only elect governors, MPs and senators. Let's look at it again.  Quote of the day: "Every man of action has a strong dose of egoism, pride, hardness, and cunning. But all those things will be regarded as high qualities if he can make them the means to achieve great ends." - Greek poet Giorgos Seferis was born on 13 March, 1900
