The officers attributed the outbreak to weather changes occasioned by the ongoing rains. Dr Mogoi said children and the elderly are the most vulnerable owing to their low immunity. The disease is spread through the air. “Our public officers will be out there in the field and especially in the learning institutions to create awareness of the disease,” Dr Mogoi said.
