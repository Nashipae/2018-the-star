Embakasi West subcounty is building a labour centre to create employment. The project is being funded by Embakasi West leaders, friends of the subcounty, Governor Mike Sonko and Senator Johnson Sakaja. The project targets single parents, persons living with disability, the elderly and the youth. Embakasi West MP George Theuri yesterday said the project is a way of giving back to the community. “The labour centre will contain various trade units,” Theuri said. The centre will have tailoring and laundry units. A bakery and printing area will also be part of the labour centre. Theuri said the centre will provide employment to many people. There will also be a printing area to be used by any constituent who does not have a working space. The MP said the centre will be structured in such a way that people with disability can easily access it. Umoja One MCA Mark Mugambi said, “We care about the welfare of residents. The centre will improve the livelihoods of many people.” Kariobangi MCA Robert Mbatia said the labour centre will provide services according to the needs of the people in that ward.
