Kenya will have enough food in three years thanks to the dams and irrigation projects coming up, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa has said. He spoke on Monday at the Port of Mombasa, where he received 55,000 bags of relief rice from China. Eugene said Kenya has the potential of becoming a food-surplus country. He had been taken to task by journalists, who asked him why Kenya has become so dependent on other nations such as China and Mexico for rice and maize every year. China has donated 154,000 bags of relief rice so far. Last year, the state imported maize from Mexico after unga prices skyrocketed. “We have put up strategies that are going to work. At the Coast we have the Galana project, in Kirinyaga we have the Thiba Dam, in Kisumu we have Ahero and in Busia  the Bunyala.”
