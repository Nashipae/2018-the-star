Police at the Coast have assured Likoni residents of security during the Easter weekend. Regional police commander Noah Mwivanda yesterday said they are dealing with youth gangs in the best way possible. He warned of dire legal consequences for anyone planning to commit crimes during the Easter weekend. “Someone who would attack you with a knife is not a child anymore,” Mwivanda said, referring to children in gangs. Likoni has been cited as an emerging haven for youth gangs. Children as young as 10 years associate with the groups to look ‘cool’. But on Wednesday, civil society groups led by Muslim for Human Rights and the Kenya Community Support Centre accused the police of killing children. In a week, at least 10 people suspected to be in gangs, aged between 14 and 22 years, were killed by the police. Likoni police boss Benjamin Rotich said all those killed were criminals. Muhuri executive director Hassan Abdille said police should not violate human rights when dealing with surging crime. He said, “This is something to worry about, but killing is not an option. The government should come up with a better way of dealing with the situation. Mwivanda said, “We should work together to deal with drugs and youth gangs, which have children aged between 10 and 17 years.” He said some find themselves in the gangs due to unemployment, dropping out of school and use of drugs. “These are children. When you take them to court they are treated as children. So, the law is not very tough on them,” Mwivanda added. He said crime has declined in Likoni, Kisauni and some parts of Matuga in Kwale county. “In Matuga we had pockets of boys terrorising residents,” he said.
