Khetia’s Supermarket yesterday opened a new branch in Bungoma town, bringing to 13 the number of branches the retail chain has opened in six counties. The supermarket has been taking over former Nakumatt stores in Western after the giant retail shop went under. Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati presided over the branch opening alongside Khetia’s Supermarket director Ashok Khetia. Khetia said Sh150 million was spent in starting the branch, which hired 90 county residents. “More will be employed if the business picks up. We intend to expand more,” he said.
