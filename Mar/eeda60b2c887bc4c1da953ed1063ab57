Having topped their respective pools at the ongoing African Club Championships, Kenyan teams Kenya Pipeline and Kenya Prisons take to the courts today for their respective quarter-finals matches in Cairo, Egypt. Pipeline finished top of Pool ‘C’ with 12 points and without tasting defeat and will this evening battle with  Bafia of Cameroon, who finished second in Pool ‘B’. Prisons, who emerged winners in Pool ‘D’ in another unbeaten run, face fellow East African Rwanda Revenue Authority who finished second in Pool ‘A’. The Kenyan representatives will be seeking to extend the good performances, well aware that a slip up at this stage will deny them a chance to recapture that has remained elusive since 2013, when Prisons won in Madagascar. Pipeline’s win dates back to 2005 in Nairobi. This stage is specifically important to national champions Pipeline since it is here that they succumbed to rivals Prisons during the previous edition held in Tunisia. This saw the oils girls settle for firth while the wardresses went on to grab a bronze medal. Prisons will be facing a familiar face in former Kenyan international Dorcas Ndasaba who will be at the courtside as the RRA tactician. And to ensure that they do not falter where it matters, the knockout stage, Kenyan team will be approaching the matches cautiously without being over confident. Pipeline’s Japheth Munala said: “First things first. We are keen on the quarters first and we will cross other bridges when we get there.” His counterpart and Kenya Volleyball Federation director, David Lung’aho shared same sentiments saying they want to ensure that they sail smoothly into the last four. “Talking of what will be like in semi-finals will be jumping the gun. We are concentrating on our next match against Rwanda Revenue Authority and will see what happens from there,” noted Lung’aho. Other quarter finals today pits hosts Ahly against Customs of Nigeria, while champions Carthage of Tunisia square it out with El Shams.
