Former Nyeri Town MP Esther Murugi and two others on Wednesday escaped death narrowly after their plane crash landed at Nyaribo Airstrip, Nyeri county. Murugi, her son and a daughter in law had just taken off from the airstrip when plane developed mechanical problems. The woman who could not be immediately identified escaped with minor injuries but the plane however extensively damaged on one side after the 4pm incident just after pounding of heavy rains in the area. Panicked Murugi said the plane was taking off when it developed the problems but the pilot who was calm controlled it. “We had come from home in Nyeri where we attended prayers of a bereaved family and we were flying back to Nairobi. We had just finished the run away,” She said. Close sources said the plane belongs to the former MP. Nyeri Central assistant commissioner John Marete said police and other experts have launched investigations into the incident. Shocked locals including school children immediately rushed to the scene before police sealed off the area. Police will at the same time keep watch around the clock until investigations are complete.
