The demolition of unsafe buildings in Nairobi has been delayed by lack of funding, but is expected to start tomorrow after State Department of Housing and Urban development receives cash for the job. Buildings Safety Testing and Quality Assurance acting MD Samuel Charangu yesterday said the demolitions will begin in Huruma and Zimmerman. The demolitions were supposed to have been carried out in January. The National Buildings Inspectorate secretary and chief government quantity surveyor Moses Nyakiongora had said 12 buildings in Huruma had been marked for demolition. He said the structures were built on riparian land and wetlands. But yesterday, Charangu said only six buildings in Huruma will be pulled down and preparations for the exercise are complete. He said the other two deathtraps are in Zimmerman.
