A Bill by President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration that sought to streamline the transport sector within Nairobi and its neighbouring counties was yesterday withdrawn. National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale informed the House the Nairobi Metropolitan Area Transport Authority Bill, 2017 will be redrafted by the Executive to incorporate views from all the relevant stakeholders. The Bill sought to oversee the establishment of an integrated, efficient and sustainable transport system within five counties. According to the Bill, the Nairobi metropolitan area consists of Nairobi, Kiambu, Machakos, Kajiado and Murang’a counties. “I urge the Executive to engage with all stakeholders particular the leadership of the five counties. It will be republished and the concerns of all the leaders incorporated,” Duale said. Minority Leader John Mbadi however said that the Bill should have been published on yesterday’s Order Paper before being officially withdrawn. “The Bill should have appeared on the Order paper and Duale appear to request for the withdrawal,” Mbadi said.
