Four businessmen have moved to court to compel
Nakuru county to approve their multi-million Shilling property
in Naivasha. In a petition filed at the Milimani Law Courts in Nairobi, the traders claim
that the county has put restrictions on their land, thus making it impossible to develop the plot. They also accuse the county government of ignoring recommendations confirming their leases as genuine. They said the county's move is detrimental to
their development plans. The investors said they are planning to put up a Sh300 million development project on the land. They say the county government is relying on false accusations from MCAs to derail their development plans. MCAs claim the land was earmarked for the development of low-cost housing units. The housing project is to be funded by the World Bank. “The applicants have valid titles and certificates of
leases. We are bound to
be prejudiced and suffer loss and damage,” the businessmen said in affidavits. Their lawyer Edward Muchai said the county's decision to
place restrictions of the land was illegal. the Naivasha Sub county Land Registry
acted unlawfully, since they were not and have to date never been given an opportunity
to be heard adding that the County has also not informed or notified them of
the placing the said restrictions on their land. They got to know of the restrictions placed on their land
when they did a search on the property and they obtained a certificate of search
which showed that on January 31 @017 a restriction was placed on their
properties. They say that they acquired ownership of the said properties
pursuant to the issuance of letters of allotment dated December 14 1999 from
the commissioner of lands on of behalf of the Government of Kenya and they duly
complied with the terms of conditions.
