MPs yesterday differed sharply on a motion that seeks to curtail demonstrations and picketing in cities and major towns. Mathare MP Anthony Oluoch questioned the constitutionality of the motion moved by Ruiru MP Simon King’ara, saying it would curtail the rights of Kenyans. King’ara wants the House to allow the government to designate areas and streets for demonstrations and picketing to ensure “the freedoms and rights of others” are not infringed.

Oluoch said gives the Executive powers to limit Kenyans’ freedom to exercise their constitutional right to demonstrate. He said the motion violates the Constitution. “This motion lacks constitutionality. It wants to limit the rights of Kenyans to demonstrate and picket as provided for in our Constitution,” he said. He was backed by Robert Mbui (Kathiani), Omboko Milemba (Emuhaya) and Oundo Mudenyo (Funyula). They sought to have the motion withdrawn. But King’ara maintained he would not withdraw it because it will “maintain law and order”. He was backed by Ngunjiri Wambugu (Nyeri), Githinji Gichimu (Gichugu) and Beatrice Nkatha (Tharaka Nithi). Temporary Speaker Soipan Tuya said she was unable to make a ruling on the matter.
