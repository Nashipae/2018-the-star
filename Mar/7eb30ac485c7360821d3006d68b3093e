Isaiah and Waharaka have drawn ire for their Kikuyu song Ikamba, which aims to mimic Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu and the Kamba community. In a viral video NCIC is probing, the two use unprintable derogatory to describe people from the Kamba community. Reactions online included: Emannuel Mutisya: The two artistes must be apprehended and banned from producing more music. The Kamba and all tribes must be respected. Shrink: That “ikamba” song is full of hate speech. Needs to be banned and the singers jailed for life. Allen Arnold: I highly condemn the song “Ikamba”, where they spew hate on Kamba community. Adnan: Ikamba is a total disgrace, ati maembe yameisha tutakula mbwa. Man, God is great.
