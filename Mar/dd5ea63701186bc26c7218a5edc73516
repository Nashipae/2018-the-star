Nyandarua’s oldest MCA, Geoffrey Ngaruiya,  got a reprieve on Tuesday after house speaker Wahome Ndegw readmitted him to the assembly. He is 64. Ndegwa had declared Ngaruiya’s position vacant on March 21, following orders  by the  Nyahururu chief magistrate’s court on February 27, and March 2. This followed a petition challenging Ngaruya’s nomination  and those of Margaret Ireri, Joseph Kariuki and Wanjiku Muhoho by Monicah Githae and Solomon Kuria. They said the nominations were not procedural. Ngaruiya on Tuesday obtained an injunction saying he was there to “stay until 2022”. Ndegwa had no choice but to readmit the MCA. “I may not know the law, but declaring a position vacant is not  the speaker’s role. It is the prerogative of the IEBC,” he said.
