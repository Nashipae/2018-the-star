Residents of Keturwo in Baringo North have accused Governor Stanley Kiptis (pictured) of neglecting them. Elders of the Arror sub-Tugen tribe crowned and blessed Kiptis to vie for governor on March 1 last year in Keturwo. He thrashed incumbent Benjamin Cheboi in the Jubilee party primaries on April 21 and defeated Kanu’s Isaac Chebon in the General Election. “It is about seven months since he won the seat, but he has never come back to this village to thank his people,” elder Daniel Chepkurui told the Star yesterday. Kiptis said he is planning a big homecoming and appealed to the residents to be patient. “I know it has been a long time, but I thank you all for trusting me with your votes last year,” Kiptis said during an event at Kapsogo, Baringo Central on Saturday. The residents also accused Kiptis of discriminating againstBaringo North while appointing county executives and chief officers. He favoured Mogotio and Eldama Ravine subcounties, they said. Although he hails from Keturwo, Kiptis’ family moved to Eldama Ravine. During his coronation, Kiptis and his wife Ivy Buney were asked to bow down as Mzee Chepkurui conducted the traditional ceremony. Kiptis was draped in an animal skin and handed a whisk and a traditional club as a show of honor and acceptance to leadership. “As your people of Ketuwo we are behind you and we will ask the people in all Baringo to vote for you for governor,” Mzee Chepkurui said.
