After flopping massively in his second stint as Harambee Stars coach, Stanley Okumbi has been demoted to the national Under 20 side. Okumbi had been handed the head coach role on interim basis after the exit of Belgian Paul Put in February. Put, who successfully led Kenya in reclaiming the Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup title, resigned citing personal reasons, prompting the federation to promote Okumbi. But his first assignment of his second stint came out a cropper and FKF had no option but to sack him. Read: Harambee Stars head coach Paul Put resigns Okumbi led Stars to a disappointing North African tour where Kenya fell 2-3 to the Central African Republic and drew 2-2 with Comoros during the just concluded Fifa international week. He managed a total of 21 international matches where he won five, drew eight and lost nine. In between, FKF sought the services of Put who was supposed to take the former Mathare United coach as his assistant. He was opposed to the idea until his departure. The federation’s communications officer, Barry Otieno, confirmed Okumbi’s redeployment. “Okumbi ... has now been redeployed to the U-20. We will unveil a new coach on May 1. We expect him to come with his technical bench,” said Otieno. The Federation further quashed claims that former Harambee Starlets coach Richard Kanyi had been sacked. “We appointed David Ouma as the new head coach after undergoing studies in Germany. Kanyi will act as his deputy.”  Click here for the latest political news
