The Mombasa county government is losing billions of shillings in unregistered parcels of land whose owners are not paying rates. A survey conducted early this year by the Lands registry at Ardhi House and the county has revealed that between 30,000 to 35,000 parcels of land are unregistered. Lands CEC Edward Nyale said Governor Hassan Joho had granted amnesty to all property owners that are yet to register their properties with the county government for rating purposes. "Apart from denying the county government the revenue required to provide much needed services to our people, it is also against the county laws to fail to register any property," Nyale told journalists on Friday. The official noted that non-payment leads to accumulation of arrears and heavy penalties and interest. "Additionally, it will not be possible for any property owner to maximise on his property like approvals on development plans on such land that is not in our records," he said. The amnesty granted by the Governor on all accrued land rates and penalties and interest is to run for one month from Match 1st until month end. The official added that residents who fall under that category need a copy of title deed, search certificate, memorandum of registration of transfers and an assessment fee of Sh5,000. In 2016, the county government had 21,000 land rate defaulters, who owed the county some Sh10billion in land rates. The figure had initially been at at least 30,000 defaulters who had accumulated penalties, but some paid the debts. County Secretary Francis Thoya had said they will orders repossession of all defaulters' land under leasehold tenure. Click here for the latest political news
