Turkana University students on Friday barricaded the Kitale-Lodwar highway demanding the exit of Principal Egara Kabaji. They accused the latter of mismanagement adding that their hostels are in a pathetic condition, the same being congested. The area was tense as the angry students paralysed transport along the route. The students further complained that they have not been taught since the semester commenced two weeks ago. Lecturers countrywide are on strike to press for better perks and allowances pegged on their 2017-21 CBA. "We have been forgotten in the desert..not the desert because this University is found in the desert but that of knowledge," a student said. "We have paid school fees. Why is the administration not paying our lecturers for us to get their services?" another student asked. "We call upon the Deputy President William Rutto who officially inaugurated this university to intervene." Kabaji could not be reached for comment as he is away in Ghana.
