Kwale wood and fuel association has said the government gave a short notice on the ban on tree cutting and charcoal sale. Chairperson Matheka Kimoo said they no longer have interest in planting trees since they are not directly helping them in any way. “Before the ban, we used to plant trees under supervision of the forest department, but now that the trees cannot help us earn a living, we rather divert our energy in other income generating activities,” he said. Regional forest conservator Samuel Wahome on Wednesday said the region's forest cover is at seven per cent instead of the targeted 15 per cent.
