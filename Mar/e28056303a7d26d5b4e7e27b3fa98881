The Pace Africa headphones craze came into the Kenyan market courtesy of J Blessing, and we loved it. President Uhuru Kenyatta was not going to be left behind. He joined the craze and went for the experience first hand. Uhuru tested and used the headphones from Pace Africa during the France-Africa Business Forum at iHub. He could not stop smiling, so he decided to get himself a pair.Â He fell in love with them and also got his staff a pair each. The company is co-owned by J Blessing and Larry Liu. J Blessing has played a big role in advertising. Many celebrities have tested and loved them. Safaricom bought them for customers during the Songa launch. Well if the President owns them, they must be a masterpiece.
