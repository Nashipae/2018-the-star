Poverty, social
injustices and illiteracy are the major drivers of violent
extremism. Gender activist Fatuma Abdi urged the government to come up with
counter-terrorism measures, including engaging the youth more often
since they
are the most vulnerable. She addressed a
workshop for journalists from Northeastern. Abdi said women should be involved in countering violent extremism as they have become
soft targets. “As mothers they are
likely to be the first to notice changes in their children that may be
indicative of their involvement in extremist activities,” she said. She said women have strong networks that, in partnership with
security agencies, can be good mechanisms for gathering intelligence and passing
information to their local communities. Wajir, Mandera,
Kilifi, Kwale, Mombasa, Garissa and Nairobi counties are struggling with radicalisation and violent extremism, and have suffered major terror attacks in the past six years. Besides direct attacks, a growing number of radicalised Kenyans are
leaving the country to join al Shabaab and other terror outfits such as ISIS. Last Friday al Shaabab killed five security officers in an ambush on two camps in Fino, Mandera.
