Kilifi Woman Representative Gertrude Mbeyu has dismissed calls for the formation of a Coast party as “usual funeral talk.” Leaders want to form a regional party to cater for their political and development interests. The calls were renewed on Saturday during the burial of Alice Maitha, the third widow of former minister Karisa Maitha in Mzambarauni, Kilifi. Former Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung’aro said the party will unite the region. Mbeyu yesterday dismissed the calls. “What difference will it make when Mung’aro himself is in the government now? I would be ready but it should be a national party, not a Coast party. There is no way we can move forward with a regional party,” Mbeyu said. Mung’aro said they are organising a conference of all Coast leaders to be held in Kwale in April. “We will discuss the way forward,” Mung’aro, also the Lands Chief Administrative Secretary, said. Mbeyu said Mung’aro is already a member of Jubilee and will not easily decamp from the ruling party. Ganze MP Teddy Mwambire supported the idea of a Coast party, but with reservations. “I support the push to either form or join a political party where we have negotiating power. We must have structured dialogue about it,” Mwambire told the Star yesterday. Kaloleni MP Paul Katana said the search for a Coast party will remain elusive until leaders unite. “Unity is more important. I would like to see Mung’aro shake hands with Governors Amason Kingi (Kilifi) and Hassan Joho (Mombasa) before he calls for the meeting,” Katana said.
