Nineteen people were on Thursday charged before a Mombasa court with using plastic bags in various parts of the city. The suspects were arrested in a crackdown mounted by NEMA officials within Kongowea, Marikiti, Majengo, and Mwembe Tayari markets. "All the arrested persons were users of plastic flat bags. The persons were arraigned before senior magistrate Mutunga in Mombasa," NEMA said in a statement. According to the authority, 18 offenders were fined Sh30,000 each with an option of serving an 8 month jail term. Out of the 18, ten pleaded guilty to the offence. "Kahindi Yange pleaded not guilty and was released on a bond of Sh50,000. Mention date of the case will be on March 29," NEMA said. Two other offenders were set free; one was released on medical grounds while a minor was set free with a warning. Kenya boasts of the toughest world's toughest laws on the use of plastic bags. Offenders found producing, selling, importing or using plastic bags risk imprisonment of up to four years or fines of up to Sh4 million. The anti-plastic legislation became law on February 28 last year but allowed a six-month window for compliance. The ban is aimed at reducing environmental pollution especially of water bodies. It affects users of plastic bags,Â manufacturers who produce carrier and flat plastic bags, manufacturers who use plastic bags to package goods for use in sectors such as food, tea industry, agriculture, fisheries, Livestock, floriculture and horticulture. On Wednesday, two businessmen were arrested in Nairobi's Industrial Area with 75 tons of banned plastic bags at a godown. In April, manufacturers of polythene bags were directed to declare their stock of unsold wrappers and how they would destroy them before the ban took effect on August 28.
