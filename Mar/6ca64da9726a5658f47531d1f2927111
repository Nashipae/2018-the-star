A senior manager of Harambee Sacoo was charged in Nairobi on Wednesday with stealing more than Sh13.6 million. Christopher Bolo, a credit control manager, allegedly committed the crime on diverse dates between December 1, 2017 and February 7 at the sacco's office in Nairobi. The court heard that he and others stole Sh13,645,220 cash which they had access to by virtue of their employment. The suspect denied the charge before Milimani Principal Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot. He was granted a bond of Sh1 million with a surety of the same amount and an alternative cash bail of Sh300,000. The prosecution said Bolo's case will be consolidated with another of the sacco's employee who pleaded to theft charges and was released on the same bond terms. The case will be heard on April 12. Meanwhile, Ekeza Sacco, which shot to the limelight last year after claims of fraud, has assured members that their money is safe. In a statement on Tuesday, chairman David Kariuki said issues raised by the Commissioner for Co-operative Development had nothing to do with the money.
