Naivasha residents are living in fear after a fifth case of cholera was reported in the town on Friday. The group blamed the Nakuru county government for failing to fund efforts towards eradicating the disease. A number of community health workers (CHW) said there is no goodwill and support from the county government in fighting the outbreak. The first case was reported last week. In the latest case, a minor from Kihoto estate, which is home to hundreds of flower farm workers, was admitted to the Naivasha sub-county. A health worker said that the four-year-old has been placed in an isolation ward. "It seems that the bacteria is in the estate. Three other minors were admitted to the same facility after suffering from cholera," the worker said. The outbreak has been attributed to shallow wells dug next to latrines in the populated estate. Lakeview MCA Karanja Mburu admitted that there was a major crisis in funding for the department of public health and community workers across the county. Karanja, who is also a member of the health committee in the county assembly, said:Â  "We shall be meeting the Health CEC to explain why the departments is not funded." "From the information we have, the department of public health has for the last couple of years received zero funding despite the emerging health issues in the county," he said.
