North Rift farmers have asked the state to break up cartels hoarding subsidised fertiliser. They are questioning why the fertiliser has not arrived in National Cereals and Produce Board depots in the region as the planting season begins. “We have information some unscrupulous people are selling subsidised fertiliser at Sh2,200, yet depots are empty,” Keiyo North farmer Samson Kiplgat said. Speaking in Iten on Monday, he said the state has not told farmers the price. “Deputy President William Ruto pledged last year that fertiliser will be sold at Sh1,200, but we suspect some brokers are buying large amounts to sell to peasant farmers at high costs,” Kiplagat said. He said farmers were told by an NCPB official in January they would pay Sh1,500 per 50kg bag. On February 11, Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe said the state purchased 100,000 metric tonnes of subsidised fertiliser. He said the fertiliser would be sold to farmers at Sh1,200 per 50kg bag, down from Sh1,800 in 2017. The PS said the government was ferrying the fertiliser from the Port of Mombasa to NCPB depots across the country. But farmers have said there is none in the depots. Farmer Titus Kosgei told Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri to probe why fertiliser has not arrived. He claimed rogue traders are buying as much as 10,000 bags to sell to outlets at high prices. Elgeyo Marakwet Agriculture executive Shadrack Yatich urged the ministry to hasten dispatch of fertiliser to avoid planting delays. He said the NCPB had promised it would arrive in the county two days ago, but it has not been delivered. Yatich said the NCPB has set the price of planting fertiliser at Sh1,500 and topdressing fertiliser at Sh1,200 per 50kg bag.
