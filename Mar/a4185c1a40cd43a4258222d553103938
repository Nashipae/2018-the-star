Four Bungoma county employees were yesterday fighting for their lives in hospital following a road accident on Wednesday evening. The four, among them a driver and a personal assistant to Deputy Governor Charles Ngome, were involved in an accident at Bukembe along the Webuye-Bungoma road. Their car collided head on with a tractor. The had no lights. It was transporting sugarcane to Webuye. The employees were rushed to Bungoma West Hospital. The four were returning to Bungoma after dropping Ngome at his home in Webuye. "They were seriously when bleeding when they were brought here at about 8.30pm. The driver was unconscious," the hospital's head of emergency services Dennis Sande said. All the victims were in stable condition yesterday. Sande said the driver suffered a fractured spleen. Samuel suffered chest injuries. His three ribs were also broken. Austin suffered a fractured leg. He was yet to be taken to the theatre by yesterday morning. "We are asking well-wishers to come and donate blood," Sande said. The hospital does not have enough blood and had to get assistance from nearby hospitals to attend to the patients. "We are liaising with the national transfusion services to help us get more blood," Sande said. Governor Wycliffe Wangamati and Ngome both visited their staff and promised to support them through the medication. "We are happy that they are out of danger. We thank the surgeon who quickly attended to the victim who had internal bleeding," Wangamati said. The governor said they had just returned from a funeral in Tongaren when the accident happened. He said the count will take care of the families of the four until they fully recover. Wangamati asked sugar companies to ensure their tractors are roadworthy. "We are also asking our driver to be very careful on the road, especially during this rainy season," Wangamatiu said.
