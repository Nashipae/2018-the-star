In recent months, the parks of Kenya had been very hot, dry and dusty, including the Nairobi National Park. The start of the seasonal long rains has been a most welcome blessing from above, as much rain brings new life to so many species. It appears that many prayers have been answered, for we should never take the precious water supply for granted. It should be noted that other parts of East Africa, like Ethiopia and Somalia, and parts of Kenya, are still experiencing very serious drought. Driving in some parts of the park is not advised during the wet season, especially if trying to drive without a 4X4 vehicle. However, some main roads are still in good driving condition, and well worth the effort of visiting the park. Many species behave differently due to the rains. Some seemed to be celebrating by running around in the mud, or splashing in the water. Antelope species start giving birth, while predators tend to adopt different tactics other than waiting at water holes to catch their prey. Some birds appear to be hard at work with nest building. Many beautiful plants start flowering, and interesting insects are in abundance. In the Nairobi National Park, there is always something interesting and fascinating to see! Historically the seasonal rains also result in many species moving south and out of the park boundaries, including predators such as lions, as they follow the herds. We pray for their eventual return into the park. The park is currently starting to transform from a dry, dusty place into a thriving paradise! So the annual seasonal cycles continue from dry to wet to dry to wet, and the struggle to survive continues for all species.  The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00 For more information on the park you can link to the following websites:  www.kws.org or www.nairobigreenline.com  or on Facebook at Nairobi National Park
