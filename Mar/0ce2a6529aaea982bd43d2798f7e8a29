Patients at Lamu County King Fahad Hospital yesterday got a treat after members of the Seventh Day Adventist Church donated foodstuff. The patients were given fruits, water and snacks. The visitora prayed for the patients. Speaking shortly after the exercise, Lamu SDA youth leader Peter Njau said they visited the patients to give hope since their spirits are low because of sickness. “We wanted to remind the patients that God can heal anyillness as long as they trust in Him. We also wanted to show a spirit of love and oneness. We are one before the creator, irrespective of our religion,” Njau said. Monica Ojwang’, the women’s patron, appealed to people with the means in society to help those in need.
