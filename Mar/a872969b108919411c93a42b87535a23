The Busia government yesterday urged the National Anti Corruption Campaign Steering Committee to tackle graft from the source. County secretary Nicodemus Mulaku yesterday said corruption is rampant in the private sector, which he called the source, however, the watchdog agency only focuses on public institutions. “You tend to focus on public officers, yet it is those in the private sector who corrupt these people. If this will be curtailed, corruption will be a thing of the past,” he told NACCSC officers. “As a county, we comply with all the laws and new employees declare their wealth.”
