The election of Ugenya MP Chris Karan has been nullified by a Kisumu court. The court ruled that the MP benefitted from a perverted campaign that affected the integrity of the election. Karan was slapped with Sh3.5 million fine. The IEBC, the returning officer and several others will also pay Sh3.5 million. Former MP Dave Ochieng filed a petition challenging the win of Karan. Ochieng, through his lead counsel Richard Kwach, said their case right from the beginning was never about numbers, but was based on the hijacking of the election by hoodlums, determined to frustrate and subvert their constitutional rights. They said this was achieved through intimidation, fear and scaremongering. Ochieng was linked to Jubilee Party and branded a mole. He was also linked to the death of Chris Musando, the ICT manager at the IEBC. Justice Tripsisa Cherere yesterday held that Karan was not duly elected on August 8 last year. She said Ochieng had convinced the court he could not seek votes during the run-up to the election, because his opponents had sustained a smear campaign. “These results did not pass transparent and verifiable election test,” Cherere said. The petitioner’s grounds were based on malpractices during the campaign period. There were also accusations of canvassing for votes on the election day and intimidation of the returning officers and other IEBC officials.
