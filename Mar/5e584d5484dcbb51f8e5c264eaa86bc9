A woman has been arrested after she allegedly stabbed her husband to death after a quarrel at their home in Umoja Estate, Kiambu on Friday night. Bernard Kinuga arrived home at 11 pm and soon after, his wife, Monica Wangui, called his father James Kiania saying her husband had stabbed himself. “It was around 11 pm when I was called by my daughter-in-law who told me to go to their place because my son had stabbed himself,” Kiani said. Kiania found Kinuga’s body on the sofa with the knife still lodged his chest. The couple's three children were all there. Kiania called the police and the body was taken to Kiambu Level 5 Hospital mortuary. Kinuga’s cousin said he was with him during the day and dropped him home at 11 pm. The two were to go to work together the following day. The cousin, who sought anonymity, said Kinuga showed no signs of being suicidal. Kiania said Kinuga and Wangui fought constantly.
