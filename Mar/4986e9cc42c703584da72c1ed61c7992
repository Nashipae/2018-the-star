Shujaa clinched the Victoria Sevens tournament after beating Zimbabwe 10-5 on Sunday.
The second string outfit, who were mostly composed of fringe players, finished the two-day event unbeaten. Levy Amunga ghosted past the Zimbabwean defence to put Kenya 5-0 up before Brian Wahinya caught the Zimbabweans napping to score from the blind as Kenya went 10-0 up at the break.
Zimbabwe’s Rian O’Neill responded with a try after the restart to half the deficit. This seemed to breathe life to the Zimbabweans as they pressed forward looking to level the match. Kenya, however, held out for the result, winning the Victoria Falls Sevens at their first time of asking. In the semifinals, Shujaa had edged Uganda 17-10. Kenya led 10-0 at the break courtesy of tries from Augustine Lugonzo and Mark Kwemoi before Solomon Okia’s double brought the Ugandans back into the game. Menengai Oilers Samuel Ngethe then scored the winning try deep into injury time.
In the quarters, Kenya made light work of Spartans 43-0. They took a 19-0 lead at the break through a brace from Frank Wanyama and Mark Kwemoi’s solitary effort before second half tries from Ian Minjire, Derrick Mayar, Bush Mwale and Augustine Lugonzo sealed the result. On the opening day, Shujaa beat Lesotho 50-0, Zambia ‘B’ 40-0, False Bay 17-0 and Zambezi Cheetahs 14-12 to finish top of Pool ‘B’. Kenya Sevens assistant coach Will Webster was satisfied with the exemplary performance of the side. “First of all, I am very pleased both with my boys’ performance and winning the tournament. It’s been a phenomenal couple of days for us and this was the best way to cap it all off.”
He cited the match against Zimbabwe as the toughest. “We almost didn’t make it to the finishing line what with Zimbabwe coming back at us strong in the second half and a couple of calls not going our way. Luckily, we had that 10-point cushion and my boys defended with heart today,” said Webster.
