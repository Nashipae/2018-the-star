Non-governmental organisations have called for the gazettement of the Public Benefits Organization Act to improve accountability. The law is yet to become operational five years since it was enacted. National Council of NGOâ€™s chairman Stephen Cheboi on Friday said once implemented, the Act will provide a clear criteria for the registration of NGOs. The NGO's said there is need to have a tribunal and a strong board in place as is required in the Act. They spoke during a consultative forum in Nairobi. The PBO Act 2013 was developed in consultation with civil society. It follows international best practices for civil society regulation. The bill was signed into law by former President Mwai Kibaki in 2013. Cheboi also said they will soon establish a call center and a one-stop shop for better service delivery. It urged the NGO's to maintain a system for recording and submitting all types of financial transactions for purposes of implementing projects and running their organisations.
