The Kenya Urban Roads Authority and President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday launched the Sh2.26 billion dualling of the Ngong Road Phase II. The Japanese-funded 3.4 kilometer project will stretch from Prestige to Dagoretti Corner and is to be completed by July 31, 2019. The Japanese contractor is World Kaihatsu Kogyo Company Limited, which worked on the first phase of the project early this year. It will construct a dual carriageway from the current single carriage way, improve junctions, put up bus bays, instal an Intelligent Transport System and protect the environment during construction. Kura director General Silas Kinoti said expansion of Ngong Road will decongest the city, improve urbanisation and bring economic growth. The project will eventually link to the ongoing Sh1.98 billion construction of the Dagoretti Corner- Karen junction funded by the national government. Last year Kura constructedthe Northern and Eastern By-passes, upgraded the Syokimau-Katani link road in Phase I , rehabilitated Langâ€™ata Road from KWS gate to Bomas section and constructed the interchange at City Cabanas.
