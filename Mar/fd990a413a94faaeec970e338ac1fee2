subcounty for a Huduma Mashinani drive to educate locals on the services
offered at the centre. The exercise culminated in an open plenary session at the centre,
where customers and other stakeholders got an opportunity to ask
questions and seek clarifications. Manager Yonah Nyawir said they offer 17 services at the centre. “The
other 26 services are [offered] online, and we have so far served 80,000
customers since we started operating in 2017,” he said.
