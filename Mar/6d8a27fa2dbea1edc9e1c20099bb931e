'Watu Wote' is a Kenyan film that tells a short story about Northern Kenya and the war on terror. We caught up with director Lorella Jowi
and actor Charlie Karumi, and the two recounted the creative process. "We
are filmmakers and it's all about being creative. Watu Wote is a beautiful story to begin with, a story of courage, a
story of heroism and what it means to be Kenyans." On how they felt after they were nominated for an Oscar Award, they said: "Nobody in the crew thought we would be nominated for an Oscar award and go to Hollywood. We
are very proud of ourselves." Getting the right title for the film was not an easy task.Â "The film had the title changed over and
over. Initially we had 'Mtu Mmoja' and 'Dunia ni Watu' as the titles. Later we needed to find a
title that would sound really nice, both in English and Kiswahili, and that
is how we got to the final title now as 'Watu Wote'." Shooting the film was quite a task, as some of the cast were affected or had relatives who were affected when the bus was attacked. "It
was pretty intense because it is a Kenyan story. It is close to our
hearts and it could have been any one of us in that bus. Some
of our cast were somehow emotionally connected to the story, because
that had happened to them or to their relatives before. We, therefore, had
to find a way to help them go through it," the director said.
