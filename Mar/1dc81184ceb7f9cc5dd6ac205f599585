Environmentalists have raised the red flag over the effluent being emptied into Lake Nakuru. Led by Lake Nakuru and Integrated Lake Basin Management coordinator Jackson Raini yesterday, they said there is a lot of raw sewage that mixes with storm water and flows into the lake. “During rains, surface run-off mixes with domestic effluent and drains into the lake. The waste endangers wild animals, because they feed on plants that are contaminated,” he said. He said most of the raw sewage is from estates neighbouring the lake. They including Kivumbini, Flamingo and Greenfield estates. Raini said industrial discharge also prevents growth of algae that flamingoes eat. Nakuru Water and Sanitation Services Company Ltd managing director James Ng’ang’a also dismissed claims they only partially treat sewage water, which later flows into the lake.
