The
illusion of unity in the Opposition Nasa juggernaut has finally exploded. After
fighting a spirited battle against Jubilee at the last General Election, the
alliance has been going downhill with every passing day. While the details of
what ails the alliance remain the stuff of political punditry, it is no secret
that Nasa’s disintegration is an assured eventuality. Detractors
and opponents may gloat about the Opposition’s misfortunes, but this
development is not one to be celebrated. As a nation, the health of our
democracy depends upon solid political parties that are nurseries for our
current and future leaders. Political cannibalism, betrayal, skulduggery and
other vices of political competition as are being alleged in the ongoings at
Nasa portend ill for the country.  Yes, in politics, the end often
justifies the means, and the strong are glorified. Nasa
is not the first political outfit to face an untimely death. There was Ford, Narc
and other formations whose dreams were shattered by irreconcilable differences
or sheer greed for power. Their failure contributed to our nation’s political
stagnation, and perhaps more. The
state of Nasa is a sobering warning to the nation to refrain from expedient
political arrangements that come with every political season, even between very
strange bedfellows with nothing in common.  They are the bane of our
democracy and quest for good governance.
