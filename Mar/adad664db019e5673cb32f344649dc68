The Law Society of Kenya wants to join lawyer Miguna Miguna's case as an interested party. Miguna, who is being held at the JKIA in Nairobi after jetting back from Canada on Monday, was to be taken to court on Wednesday morning but this wasn't the case. The Immigration department wants him to apply for Kenyan citizenship but he has refused to do so, with the backing ot top lawyers including Siaya Senator James Orengo and Cliff Ombeta. Charles Mutinda, a representative of the government, objected the application by the LSK. Miguna's lawyers are expected to file several of theseÂ before justice George Odunga in relation to the disobedience of court orders for the release of the NRMKe General. Ombeta earlier told the BBC that their client was unwell but was keeping up.
