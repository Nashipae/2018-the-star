National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale wants the Court of Appeal to reject a bid seeking to overturn a decision that upheld his victory last month. The Garissa Township MP told the court yesterday not to allow the case, since his rival, Wiper deputy leader Farah Maalim, filed the appeal outside the statutory timelines. Through lawyer Ahmednassir Abdullahi, he said the notice was filed seven days after the mandatory timelines. The petition challenging Duale’s win was dismissed on February 27. Justice Hedwig Ong’udi ruled there were no irregularities or malpractice that could lead to the annulment of the election as had been sought by the petitioner. According to the documents, Maalim filed the notice on the March 13. An aggrieved petition is expected to file a notice of appeal within seven days after the judgment day. “The hearing and determination of the election matters are to be heard within specific timelines set by both statute and the Constitution,” Duale says. “The said notice of appeal is contrary to the procedures, an abuse of the court process and ought to be struck off.” In the petition, Maalim claimed the election in the entire constituency was not free and fair. He had told the court that voters were bribed to vote in a certain way, thus favouring certain candidates. Maalim, however, admitted he had no evidence to back his claims. “I did not see the bribery or anyone being bribed, but I saw a crowd negotiating,” he told court.
