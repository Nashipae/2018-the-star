A Kitui resident has sought the help of Governor Charity Ngilu in resolving a Sh554,850 accident compensation dispute with Environment executive John Makau. Peter Muthui, 57, said Makau failed to pay him after representing him in a court case where the compensation was awarded. “I’m struggling. Help me get my money from Makau,” Muthui said in a letter to Ngilu. The governor’s office received the latter on March 9. Speaking to the Star on Tuesday, Muthui said Makau’s law firm received the payment from APA Insurance on April 25 last year. The money was awarded for damages caused after Muthui was involved in a car accident in 2015. But Makau said Muthui received his payment. “He has a sinister motive. He want to besmirch my reputation,” he said. Makau said Muthui declined to pick the remaining payment from the law firm.
