The Parliamentary Committee on Energy has assured Lamu residents that the intended Sh200 billion coal-fired power plant in the county will use advanced technology safe for both the environment and humans. The coal plant will be put up at the Kwasasi area in Hindi division by the Amu Power Company. A total of 975 acres have already been acquired in readiness for the project. However, the plan has and continues to receive strong opposition from the community, leaders and activists, who insist the project is hazardous and must not be allowed to take off. Speaking in Lamu during a public participation forum on energy and petroleum exploration, the committee urged the residents and leaders to remain calm as it will not in any way affect the environment and their health. The committee chairman, who is also the Nakuru Town East MP, David Gikaria, said the coal plant will use technology borrowed from countries such as the US, Germany,Israel and South Africa, which have proved coal production can be safe. “Initially, even America didn’t want anything to do with coal production, but with technological advancements, they now have a huge plant in California.This means coal plants are safer now since they use a high degree of technology that makes them safe to humans and the environment,” Gikaria said.
