The husband of a popular TV actress is the topic of bar gossip due his incessant behaviour of coming on to young men. The hubby is a gospel artiste and pastor. That is his brand. His thirst for small, youthful men is an open secret in gospel circles. The pastor, who at times has projects where he has to shoot music videos, lures young men by telling them they can star in his music video and in exchange get paid. One dancer whispered to Word Is that he got a rude shock when the pastor came on to him. "I thought he was a man of God and he was married to a beautiful and successful woman! Why would he then act like he is seducing me? It was all so very confusing. From that day I decided I will not go for any of his production jobs," said the young man, who is part of a popular gospel dance crew.
