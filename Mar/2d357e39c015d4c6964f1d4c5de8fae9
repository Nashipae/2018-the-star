A resurgent Kenya Sevens side will be gunning for a semifinal slot at the Vancouver Sevens at the BC place in Canada this weekend. Shujaa are in Pool ‘C’ at the event and open their campaign against France at 9:46pm today. The two sides have clashed three times this season with the Europeans winning twice — in Cape Town (21-14) and Las Vegas (19-14) — with Kenya winning the Sydney leg 17-14. Coach Innocent Simiyu said they were expecting a close contest in cold conditions. “It will be a tight game. We are still hurting from that loss last week in Las Vegas and we hope to bounce back. Matches against them have been very tight,” said Simiyu. Shujaa will then face Spain at 12:46am tomorrow, first meeting between the two sides this season. Their last meeting was at the Paris Sevens last season with Shujaa winning 26-14. Shujaa finish their preliminary matches against Fiji at 4:40am tomorrow. Simiyu’s charges stunned the Fijians last week in Vegas winning 17-14 courtesy of a last minute try by Andrew Amonde to sail to the main cup quarterfinals. Kenya had lost 24-5 to the Fijians in Sydney in the fifth place playoff. The Kenyans have had dismal displays in Vancouver in the past two seasons, failing to make it to the quarterfinals but Simiyu is optimistic of a turnaround this weekend. “The boys are in good shape. We had a good week adjusting to the cold and windy conditions and we have the momentum from Vegas where the boys played well,” added Simiyu Skipper Oscar Ouma said the boys are relishing the challenge of getting to the semis after coming unstuck in the past three tournaments. “We have learnt our lessons and we hope this weekend everything will come together and enable us attain our targets,” said Ouma. He observed that the circuit this season has become competitive. “We have had five different winers and that shows you the competitive nature of the series. The gap between all the teams has narrowed down and you have to be at your best to win,” added Ouma.
