Kenya Forest Service Board chairman Peter Kinyua has praised the recent transfer of KFS conservators. He said on Wednesday the decision would ensure rehabilitation of destroyed forests. Kinyua toured Embobut and Kapchemutwa forests in Elgeyo Marakwet. He encountered the wanton destruction of forests, especially OF indigenous trees. Kinyua said more changes will be made to save diminishing forests and warned illegal loggers and licensed saw millers against destruction. I’ve talked to Elgeyo Marakwet locals. They are happy to have a new conservator,” he said. “Harvesting in this area has been unsustainable.” Kinyua said Environment CS Keriako Tobiko will tour the forests soon. The KFS will start planting indigenous trees to restore the forests, he said. Kinyua directed county conservator Anthony Musyoka to provide a report on all trees that were felled and abandoned in the forests before the government issued a 90-day ban on logging on February 23. Elgeyo Marakwet contains the Cherangany and Kaptagat water towers. The county has the second highest forest cover at 37.8 per cent, after Nyeri at 38.03 per cent. Governor Alex Tolgos said the county will join the KFS in cracking down on illegal felling of indigenous and other trees. He warned arrested culprits against seeking protection from county officials. The county chief also warned residents against burning charcoal.
