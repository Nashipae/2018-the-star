Cotu has praised last Friday’s meeting between President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga. Union deputy secretary general Benson Okwaro said the two leaders made a wise decision that will unite the nation. “The two leaders have shown Kenyans the country is bigger than any of them. We must not politicise the decision they have taken, but we should rally behind them,” he said.
