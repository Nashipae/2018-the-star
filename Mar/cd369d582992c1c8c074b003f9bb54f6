Chapa Dimba Na Safaricom national finals will be held at the Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega from March 22-25, a culmination of a grass-roots tournament, which attracted over 1,700 teams from all over the country. Winners from eight regions are set to contest for Sh1million in prize money and a chance to spend a week with the Tottenham Hotspurs Kenyan midfielder Victor Wanyama in the UK. The tourney is featuring players under the age of 20 years as the country seeks to nurture talent and building capacity of grass-roots coaches through ground coaching workshops. “The future of Kenyan Football lies in youth development,” said FKF President Nick Mwendwa during the draw that was also attended by Safaricom Head of Nairobi West region Victor Ngumo. “It is for this reason that FKF, in conjunction with Safaricom, took up this initiative (Chapa Dimba Na Safaricom) with an aim of tapping raw talent from the grassroots. “Some of the players we have scouted from the tournament will be part of the U20 national team, which forms the backbone of the senior team, Harambee Stars,” explained the President. Teams that qualify for the semifinals are set to pocket Sh250,000 each, while the finalists will each pocket Sh500,000. The overall winner in each category will pocket Sh1 million, as well as a trip to London.
