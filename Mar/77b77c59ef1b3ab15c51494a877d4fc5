President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to assent to law the Bill allowing governors to appoint new deputies if the office falls vacant. Senators yesterday unanimously passed the County Government (Amendment) Bill, 2017. It was sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen. Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka is expected to take the Bill to Uhuru after the National Assembly concurs with the senators decision.The Bill proposes the setting up of a selection panel by the governor to nominate suitable candidates for the deputy governor position and names submitted to the county assembly for vetting to pick one qualified nominee for approval. The loophole in the Constitution has made it difficult for governors to have deputies whenever the offices fall vacant.
