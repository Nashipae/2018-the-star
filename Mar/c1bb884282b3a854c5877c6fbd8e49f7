Isukha South MCA Farouk Machanje on Saturday clashed with Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya over scrapped bursary cash. The two attended the burial of former MCA Samuel Mwanzi’s wife Elima Sindavira in Ileho, Shinyalu. Machanje asked the governor to reconsider his stand and reintroduce the fund. The county previously spent Sh120 million on bursaries yearly. “Education is a big investment, but many people in this region are unable to cater for their children’s education needs because of poverty,” Machanje said. “Reconsider your earlier decision to scrap bursary from the county budget so our children can be educated and be able to compete with others in the future job markets.” But Oparanya criticised the MCA, saying he was misleading mourners over the bursary issue, yet he understood the law quite well. “What will it benefit you if you talk about bursaries in a funeral, yet you understand the law? If you don’t understand, come slowly and sit with me so I can educate you about the laws that govern the county,” he said. He said bursary allocation is not a county function. But Machanje pledged to continue fighting for the needy.
