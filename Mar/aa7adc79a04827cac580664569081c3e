The withdrawal comes a week after the MP pleaded with President Uhuru Kenyatta on the floor of the house to save his political career in respect of the unity pact he made with Nasa leader Raila Odinga. Babu’s win in the August 8, 2017 election was successfully contested in court by former MP Francis Mureithi. After his election was invalidated, Babu had claimed Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto had a hand in the court verdict. "The whole nation knows that this is a war of the President and DP versus Babu. It is sad that the government is controlling the Judiciary," he said. But he changed tune on March 15, saying: "I would like to tell the President that he has put Babu Owino in fire and that he has burned and he is strong. I do not want to be stronger than this. Let him remove me from the fire." More on this: [VIDEO] Pull me from fire, save my political career, Babu Owino begs Uhuru Click here for the latest political news
