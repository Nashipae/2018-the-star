Farmers have bought 800,000 bags of subsidised fertiliser for planting, Agriculture PS has said. Richard Lesiyampe yesterday said this was out of the 1.1 million bags of planting fertiliser the government targetted to sell by this month. A 50kg bag goes for Sh1,500. “Another 300,000 bags of the planting fertiliser are on transit to the North Rift, which consumes the bulk of the fertiliser in the country,” he said. “Collection of fertiliser at the National Cereals and Produce Board has been slow due to the heavy rains, but distribution is ongoing.” Most farmers from the Western, Nyanza and South Rift regions have planted, but those from the North Rift are waiting for the rains to subside. This week, farmers from Central and Rift Valley complained about inadequate fertiliser. Some said they have yet to get the right fertiliser. Lesiyampe warned against exploitation of farmers. The government is closing loopholes used by brokers to diverse fertiliser, he said. “Some of the farmers complaining of not getting the government fertiliser are agents of the cartels and we are putting stringent measures to ensure only registered farmers have access,” Lesiyampe said. He said 2.5 million smallholders have been registered by the government since mid-last year and they are to benefit from the fertiliser and maize programmes directly to help weed out cartels. NCPB’s Titus Maiyo said that since last September, farmers have purchased 1.58 million bags of assorted fertiliser worth Sh2 billion for both the short and long rains seasons. “We have a stock of 960,000 bags of assorted fertiliser. We sell planting fertiliser at Sh1,500 and top dressing fertiliser at Sh1,500. Sulphate ammonia sells at Sh1,300,” he said. Antony Kioko from the Cereal Growers’ Association said many farmers have yet to get the right and enough fertiliser.
