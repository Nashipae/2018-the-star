Eighteen suspected members of the Wakali Kwanza gang in Kwale were arrested on Thursday night by GSU officers. The group that has committed crimes in Mombasa, invaded Ng’ombeni in Kwale and terrorised residents. Matuga deputy commissioner Benson Maisori said on Friday the suspects are aged between 12 to 16 years. Some are schoolchildren. Addressing media after meeting residents, Maisori said the security situation is bad. He met residents to find solutions. “Residents said they need a police post. Since setting up one will take time, we will ensure we get a mobile police unit at Ngo’mbeni,” he said. Maisori said it will be at the Ng’ombeni chief’s office and police from Kwale, including the OCS, will be working there on Mondays to Wednesdays. REMOVE MIRAA STRUCTURE “Residents will be served the same as in Kwale. In case of emergencies, we have given the residents our numbers to contact us directly. We will arrest culprits when we get reports,” Maisori said. He said they are after 23 wanted men and promised to arrest them even if they have fled from Kwale. Maisori said police will intensify night patrols. “Any youth found roaming the streets at night without a proper reason will be arrested. Some could be part of the gang,” Maisori said. He also said they will remove places where young men idle around and chew mugokaa and miraa. ?These places are part of the problem,” he said. Maisori said plans to set up a police post at Ng’ombeni have begun. He said they have received 20,000 building blocks and have requested the area Member of Parliament to help build the post. The county commissioner has written to th MP. “We were promised assistance, so we are only waiting for the budget to start work,” he said.
