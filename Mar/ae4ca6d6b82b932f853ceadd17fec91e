Sports Cabinet secretary Rashid Echesa has called for speedy investigation into allegations of sexual abuse of athletes by coaches in Uasin Gishu County. A report aired by a TV Station on Sunday highlighted the plight of young girls in Uasin Gishu and Nakuru counties, who are being abused by coaches. In a press statement, Echesa has instructed Athletics Kenya head of youth department, Barnabas Korir to lead investigations into the alleged sexual abuse claims and report back to him. Echesa said the sexual abuse reports have deeply saddened him as they contravened the International Humanitarian Law & Kenya’s Sexual Offences Act of 2006 protecting the Rights of individuals in matters related to sexual abuse. He noted: “Those affected by this mistreatment may have been undergoing psychological trauma, pain and frustration while training. These young Kenyan athletes whose dream is to get to the top may have had their hopes dashed by unscrupulous coaches and officials,” added Echesa. He observed those found contravening the Code of Management will face the law and be expelled from managing any sports activities both locally and internationally. “No Sports persons will in future go through such an abuse and molestation while they are pursuing their future in sports,” noted Echesa. He added that all sports federations must ensure they put in place measures that will deter or protect our young Sports persons especially girls, who are more vulnerable to these kind of conduct. Echesa has also put on notice officials and coaches who have been engaging in sexual abuse conduct. He has appealed to sports persons and members of the public to bring to his attention any such incidences.
