It was pomp and celebration when the High Court in Mombasa on Friday upheld the election of Likoni MP Mishi Mboko. The petition challenging her win was filed by former MP Masoud Mwahima, who said the election as not free and credible. Judge Erick Ogola validated the election, saying Mwahima failed to prove Mboko won because of irregularities. He said even though the court had noted some irregularities,they were minor and could not affect the outcome. Ogola said during the scrutiny and recount of votes in 10 polling stations, a difference of votes was noticed. He said Mboko’s votes decreased by seven while Mwahima’s increased by one. Ogola said if this differrence was observed in 10 polling stations,the former MP should have called for a recount of votes in the entire constituency. He, however, said the margin of votes between the petitioner and the sitting MP was huge and the seven votes could not change the outcome. The judge further dismissed the argument Forms 35As were filled with information supposed to be for Forms 35B. Ogola said such mistakes were not intentional but rather a mathematical error.
