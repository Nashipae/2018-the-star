Mbeere North subcounty has lost four teachers in Northeastern over insecurity. MP Muriuki Njagagua said all non-local workers in the region need to be protected. He said if the teachers are not adequately protected, then their calls for transfers to safer places should be answered. The Teachers’ Service Commission should hire locals to teach in the schools, the lawmaker said. Njagagua said MPs build classes with the Constituency Development Fund, but teachers from Embu and neighbouring counties are posted to Northeastern, where they work under threat from terrorist groups. It is unfortunate that the non-local teachers are killed by al Shabaab, the lawmaker went on. “I have attended the funeral of four teachers from Mbeere North constituency. When our teachers are killed Northeastern politicians oppose their removal, insisting that they should continue teaching in their schools,” Njagagua said. He added that it is wrong for the workers to continue teaching in unsafe areas, urging the TSC to transfer the teachers who have been camping at its headquarters over insecurity. The MP asked the TSC to employ teachers from Northeastern to teach in the area since they will be at home and not targets for militia. The MP was in Kanyueri Secondary School in his constituency during a funds drive. Embu  Senator Njeru Ndwiga, Mbeere South MP Geoffrey Kingangi, Manyatta’s John Muchiri and Erick Muchangi of Runyenjes were present. Meanwhile, the lawmakers said they will this week meet President Uhuru Kenyatta to discuss Emilio  Mugo’s suspension as Kenya Forest Service director. The legislators are bitter that despite persistent pleas, Mugo is yet to be reinstated.
