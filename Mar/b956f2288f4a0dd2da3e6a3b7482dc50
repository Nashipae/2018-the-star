The Kilifi government has launched a 100 days’ Rapid Results Initiative in the department of Health to enhance service delivery in the county. The move is aimed at addressing the effects of medical officers’ strike last year. Dr Omar Anisa, the Kilifi Health executive, said the RRI aims at improving immunization services, family planning, deliveries by skilled staff, among others. Already, the initiative, whose theme is “Accelerating quality service delivery”, will also focus on improvement of outreaches, and surgical camps. Addressing journalists in her office on Tuesday, Anisa said a committee that will oversee service delivery was formed to evaluate the results on a monthly basis, and will announce the overall evaluation results in June. The Health executive said they are working with partners in the health sector such as UNICEF and Aphia Plus, among others, to achieve the objectives.
