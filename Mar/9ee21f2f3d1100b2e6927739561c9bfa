The Senate has put on notice governors who sack or suspend civil servants seconded to their counties. It was illegal for the county bosses to do so. Speaker Kenneth Lusaka said the trend is worrying, as it locks out counties from “accessing the services of professionals”. This came in the wake of increased court cases from civil servants who had either been suspended or laid off by incoming governors. Lusaka said the development had caused fear among professionals keen to work in the counties and must be addressed swiftly. “The Assumption of Office Bill in the Senate will address the current crisis, as there is a lot of hue and cry from civil servants over the sackings and suspensions,” he told the press at the weekend at Enashipai Spa and Lodge in Naivasha, where members of the Roads and Infrastructure committee held a retreat. On roads classification, the former Bungoma governor said, “The electorate does not care who is doing what road and the Council of Governors should withdraw the current case in court.” Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia, who represented the CoG, said the functions of Kura and Kerra should be devolved to improve services. He blamed the court case on lack of proper coordination between state agencies and the counties. “There should be equity in terms of infrastructure funds, as some counties like Nyandarua have only 300km of tarmac against 3,000km of road,” he said, dismissing plans by the Treasury to slash county funds.
