The Kenya National Chamber of Commerce has urged national and county governments to give more support to small and medium enterprises. Chamber chairman Kiprono Kittony said on Friday that SMEs are the main driver of the economy, employing more than 85  percent of the population and accounting for more than 60 per recent of GDP. He spoke during the Narok County Small and Medium Enterprise outreach forum at Oloikirikirai Primary school in Narok North subcounty. “As the private sector, we believe if both national and county governments provided a favourable environment for SMEs to thrive, then  challenges of unemployment, poverty, high inflation, slow economic growth and high cost of living will  be things of the past,” Kittony said. He said to drive the SME agenda in its strategic plan, the chamber, the state and counties will focus on value addition, capacity-building in enterprise skills and help SMEs penetrate international markets through trade fairs and expos. Kittony said the chamber understands SMEs’ challenges, such as double taxation, poor infrastructure, lack of cooperatives and saccos, He said the chamber will engage counties to resolve them and spur development. Earlier, the chairman and chamber officials paid a courtesy call on the Narok  government and met Chief of Staff Fred Nterekei.      Kittony was accompanied by vice chairman James Mureu, local chairman David Mpatiany and Narok Trade CEC Evalyn  Wuapari.
