The first five kidney transplant surgeries at the newly fixed renal centre at Mbagathi Hospital will be free, Governor Mike Sonko has said. The dialysis machines at the ospital, where the first ever kidney transplant will be done, were launched two days ago. Speaking yesterday during a tour at the renal facility, Sonko said a team of kidney specialists from India have arrived in Kenya to team up with county specialists to undertake the first transplant. Four million Kenyans are believed to be suffering from kidney diseases. Each of the six dialysis machines installed has a capacity to dialyse 10 patients during the day and six patients at night. The night sessions will begin later. The team of surgeons will be led by Rajesh Chaudhary.The governor was accompanied by county Health executive Hitam Majevdia. Jeremiah Mwaura, a 16-year-old Form Two student at Kabete High School, will be among the first beneficiary of the kidney transplant. He has been battling with the disease since he was in primary. “It is estimated that one in every ten people has chronic kidney disease,” said Sonko. This will reduce pressure at KNH. Head of renal facility Andrew Saleh, called on Sonko  to address the issue of understaffing. Sonko said eight dialysis machines will be installed at Mama Lucy Hospital.
