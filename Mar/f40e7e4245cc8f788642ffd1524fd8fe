Mwingi West MP Charles Nguna yesterday said he will table a Bill prescribing punitive punishment for hit-and-run drivers. Speaking during a funeral at at Kairungu, he said many Kenyans have been killed in road accidents since the year began, but few motorists are prosecuted as they flee the accident scenes. "[They] don't even inform the police about the accidents and many victims end up being dumped at City Mortuary after their bodies are abandoned on the roads," Nguna said. "Who suffers most? The family of the deceased. Are there punitive measures the government might have put in place in order to bring sanity on our roads?" In January President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered the National Transport and Safety Authority off the roads, following rampant accidents in December. " I have lost a cousin through this disturbing hit-and-run situation. A very young soul is gone yet no one knows who killed the 33-year-old who has left a young family behind. We have to take stern actions against reckless drivers to end this [arrogance]," he added.
