Governors want the Senate to dismiss the state’s petition to reduce cash allocations to the counties by Sh18 billion. The county chiefs said the petition presented in Parliament by Treasury CS Henry Rotich is unconstitutional. “The Division of Revenue Act, Section 5, provides that the national government will bear the revenue shortfall and in case of revenue over performance, it shall be accrued to the national government,” Council of Governors chairman Josphat Nanok said yesterday. He spoke to journalists at the CoG headquarters in Nairobi. “We appeal to the Senate to ensure this proposal by the National Treasury is negated,” Nanok said.

He said Treasury’s proposal has serious implications for service delivery and that it will require amendment of article 219 of the Constitution. The Article demands counties share of revenue raised by the national government to be transferred to the 47 devolved units without undue delay and without deduction. “It will also require the amendment of Division of Revenue Act 2017,” Nanok said.
