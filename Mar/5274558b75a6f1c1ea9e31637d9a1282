President Uhuru Kenyatta and Nasa principal Raila Odinga’s reconciliation has nothing to do with the 2022 presidential succession, the Kericho Senator has said. Aron Cheruiyot and his Kitui counterpart Enoch Wambua said the deal is between two people about to hang their political boots. The leaders spoke in Kitui on Sunday after they attended a harambee in aid of Kauwi AIC Church. They said the deal was between individuals who had a common retirement agenda. Cheruiyot said in Kitui it is pointless to speculate what impact the deal will have on the 2022 presidential race. Deputy President William Ruto is slated to take over after Uhuru in 2022. Cheruiyot said, “What is important is to appreciate that it was an important political event that has given this country a new lease of life.” He said Uhuru and Raila are keen on leaving a good legacy as they move towards their political careers. In 2022, Cheruiyot added, there will be a new crop of leaders who will take over and develop the gains made. “The pact between Uhuru and Raila should be welcomed by all because Kenyans fought and hated each other for long. There is no need wasting energy trying to interrogate why Uhuru and Raila decided to bury the hatchet,” he said. Wambua added, “We have seen in media outlets the thawed relationship between Raila and Uhuru. As Wiper, ANC and Ford Kenya we are not party to it though.” Wambua of Wiper asked Nasa co-principals not to be swayed but further seek the group’s agenda of championing reforms that would help the mwananchi. He said boardroom gentlemen agreements by individuals and firm handshakes must be rejected. He said Kenyan leadership should focus on pushing for peace and how to improve the welfare of the masses.
