A Kisumu businessman on Monday accused Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo of threatening his life. Erick Rabwogi claimed that he was attacked by youths who had accompanied the MP to a bar at the weekend. "The youths beat me up as they took me to where the MP was. The MP then threatened to shoot me," he told journalists on Monday. "During this process, the MP was threatening me and saying there is nowhere I can take him. I managed to escape". Rabwogi has reported the matter with the police under OB 42/24/03/18. The trader said he sustained minor injuries on the ribs among other parts of his body. He was treated and discharged. Rabwogi wants police to investigate the MP and ensure for youths who attacked him are arrested and charged. He said the lawmaker might be after him because he testified in the petition filed by former MP Jakoyo Midiwo. The case was dismissed last month at the Siaya High court for lack of evidence. "The MP told me that he will deal with me and not even Midiwo can do anything about it," Rabwogi, an activist, said. Odhiambo denied the claims. "He is lying," he told the Star in a text message.
