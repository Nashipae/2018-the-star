The havoc caused by the rains this week highlights the fact that with every new suburb that emerges from the construction boom in the capital city, the earth of Nairobi is being concreted up. It is amazing that there should be so much chaos with the rainfall of barely three days that was unusually accurately forecast by the Meteorological department. Careless disposal of plastic waste, reckless and lawless building on riparian land, and bogus building plans have increased the vulnerability of Nairobi to flash floods. The resultant deaths, damage to property and connected repairs are losses that can be avoided by meticulous human planning. Even the Nairobi River cannot flow because of plastics pollution and illegal building on its riparian areas. As well as ending the pollution and the lawless encroachment on riparian land, there should be a massive investment in expanding the drainage system. Storm drains should be built as an essential component of all those new suburbs popping up all over the city. Yet the problem of flooding is not limited to the city. The death and destruction reported all over the country are a stark reminder that we don't learn from our disasters. Whereas we need new roads and other infrastructure, we must prioritise the security of life and property and put an end to this cycle of calamities caused by system failure.
