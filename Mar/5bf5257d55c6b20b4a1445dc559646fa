It was big news when word got out that Nigerian artiste Mr 2 Kay was attacked and robbed in his hotel room. He was left with bruises all over his body. The Naija star, who is on a media tour in Nairobi, said, "I don't like talking about it because it is sad and scary. It was a big drama that happened to me in 2017. 2017 ended and I am focusing on my 2018 album, elevating and doing more collabos. It's good and I am fine." Mr 2 Kay also shared his journey into music. "I started making it on my own. When I was young, I used to hawk on the streets for my mum, who was a petty trader in the street. That is what was giving me joy. At that time, other kids were in school, which made me a little bit depressed, but music was my backbone. From there, I started doing it for fun, and people stared loving my voice; they loved how I sound when I sing. He continued, "After secondary school, I thought now I had to take music seriously. I started putting my money together and because I am a church boy, I pray a lot and God is so kind. I prayed for my music and also I wanted to be in Grafton record, and God answered my prayer and I was signed to be one of them."
