Two children died while six people were injured as floods destroyed houses and roads in Makindu on Saturday night. The children aged four and five died in Kamboo and Syumile villages. The one in Kamboo had been home alone, Makindu Assistant County Commissioner Aooko Anyumba said on Sunday. "We have confirmed that two girls drowned last night and that one of them had been left unattended by the mother in their house," he told reporters. He attributed the deaths to carelessness by parents. The injured were taken to Makindu sub-county hospital. The floods left at least 20 families homeless as their houses were damaged. Close to 100 residents from the area are camping at Musingini shopping centre with the items they managed to salvage. "They need urgent attention. Young children have been exposed to bad whether," Anyumba said. Makindu MCA Alfred Kituku told the Star at the hospital that ward and county officials were making arrangements to help the affected. "We are assessing the situation to see how to help them return to their homes," he said. The floods have also disconnected Ngaikini, Nduluni and Kwa Usingu villages from the urban centers as Kwa-ndengya bridge was swept away.
