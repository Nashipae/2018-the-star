Nana Gecaga, President Uhuru Kenyatta's niece, celebrated her birthday over the weekend in a flashy invite-only party in Malindi. Those who graced the lavish party included her brother Jomo Gecaga, Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, socialite Lola Hannigan, family and friends. Nana Gecaga, who is the managing director of KICC, was gifted Giuseppe Zanotti shoes. The Cruel Crystal Sandal make is worth Sh215,056, meaning if you earn Sh30,000 a month, this will translate to seven months' salary. Nana took to social media to flaunt the pair of shoes, writing: "You only turn 40 once, and my goodness, look at these beautiful @giuseppezanotti (Cruel Crystal Sandals) I got as a birthday gift. Every girl's dream... They complete my birthday outfit for tonight... Thank you sooooo much." In another post, Nana thanked her family and friends for making her birthday a success. "I just want to say thank you to everyone for a lovely time and Iâ€™m truly blessed special thank you to Kristeen Kuria for making me a Queen for one night the face beat and hair thank you to @billionaireresort and @lioninthesun for hosting us and making it magical," read Nana's message.
