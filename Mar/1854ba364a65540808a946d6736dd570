A man narrowly escaped lynching on Saturday after Gatuanyaga residents cornered after discovering he was a police imposter. John Nyaachi was was rescued by area community policing chairman Stephen Kiarie. Residents had cornered him after he was found extorting money from a Boda boda rider at Ngurai shopping center under the guise of being a police officer. They said the suspect had terrorised many residents with handcuffs which he used to threaten his victims. Nyaachi also extorted bribes from traders he found using plastic bags. He threatened to arrest them, claiming he was an official of the National Environment Management Authority. Boda boda operator Lukas Wamwea, who ferried Nyaachi from Gatuanyaga to Ngurai, said the man threatened to arrest him for talking on phone while riding. â€œHe [Nyaachi] said it was disrespectful to talk over the phone while ferrying a police officer," Wamwea said. According to Wamwea, Nyaachi removed handcuffs and threatened to arrest him after reaching his destination. "I raised alarm, thereby attracting the public," Wamwea said. Richard Sawanda also claimed the man had extorted Sh2,000 from him after he was found using plastic bags. The suspect claimed he was attached to Munyu police post. Angry residents descended on him with kicks and blows as others looked for tyres. The suspect was frogmarched to the Gatuanyaga AP post and later taken to Ngoliba police station where he was held. "We will get to the bottom of this matter," Thika East police boss Julius Kyumbe said.
