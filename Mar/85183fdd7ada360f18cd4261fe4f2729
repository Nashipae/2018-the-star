Five hundred students were left stranded after Kisii University closed its Kabarnet campus citing low enrolment. The university follows Egerton and Mt Kenya, which closed their campuses in Kabarnet town last year. Days earlier, 11 staff were laid off. “This is to inform you that during the 111th University management board meeting on February 21, 2018, the university board approved the closure of the above campuses by May 1, 2018,” reads a letter sent out on Wednesday. The Kitale and Migori campuses have also been closed for failing to meet Commission of University Education requirments. Students at the Kabarnet campus protested, accusing college director Chang’masa Sogomo of keeping mum on the matter. “He has not told us anything,” student Mathew Borois said.
