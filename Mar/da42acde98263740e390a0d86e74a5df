At least two people have died in Kajiado following heavy rains that wreaked the most havoc in days on Thursday morning. County Commissioner David Kipkemei reported on Thursday that at least one pupil in Kiserian died this morning after being swept away while crossing a stream. Kipkemei also reported that a man's boday was found in Enkirgirri River at midday. “This is the saddest news we have ever woken up to. It is a sad reality so I am taking this opportunity to advise parents to keep their children at home until the rains subside,” he said in Isinya. The Commissioner spoke at the edge of Isinya River whose banks burst, damaging the only bridge connecting Athi River and Tanzania at the Namanga border town. The bodies were taken to City Mortuary.
