Governors want senators to treat them with
respect whenever they invite them to their sittings on various issues touching
on the devolved units. Council of Governors chairman Josphat Nanok on
Sunday said senators should display mutual understanding, respect
and cooperation. There has been acrimony between governors and
senators in the past. The county chiefs have been refusing to honour summonses by senators. Read: Senators make law to arrest Governors snubbing summonses Last week, the Senate Public Accounts and Investments
