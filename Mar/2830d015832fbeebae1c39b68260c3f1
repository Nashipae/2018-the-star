A few years ago, Vivian’s presence was not really felt. Despite having released instant hits like “My Dream,” “Woman in Love” and “Same Girl” as well as having featured on Bobby Mapesa’s “Over and Over”, there wasn’t much to write home about. Thanks to the hard times of trying to make it in the music scene, Vivian has swiftly left that past behind. She has experienced tremendous musical maturation in its entirety. She’s transformed her image from being an artiste simply trying her luck to prosper to one who’s actually destined for greatness. She now understands that she needs to do whatever it takes for music enthusiasts to appreciate her music. Ever since she released “Teren Teren”, her musical career has experienced an upward trajectory. Her pop style has been embraced by radio and TV shows, earning her significant airtime. In 2016, she was fortunate enough to tap Jose Chameleone’s brilliance on “Charm,” a move welcomed by her fanbase. Ever since she has been releasing hit after hit, featuring Though her catalogue isn’t as extensive, she caught up with her peers. She has worked hard to position herself among other top names. And regardless of whether you find her music, and most importantly her sound, electrifying or tedious, we have to agree that whatever she’s doing seems to be working just fine. The “Attention” hitmaker is starting to feel more audacious with her attempts. She sounds more comfortable belting out lusty pop tunes, like her latest release “Chum Chum”. With every drop, she sounds better than she did in her previous release, and so does her personality. Her minimalist tracklist reveals a narrative or stylistic through-line that basically revolves around romance. However, even though art should be considered meaningful even in its slightest form, the most effective way to evaluate her music is if she offered her fans a full-length compilation. That we will eagerly await.
