The Wakwali Kwanza criminal gang from Mombasa has invaded Ng’ombeni, Kwale, attacking residents and robbing them. Msambweni deputy commissioner Samuel Towet yesterday said during a baraza that the government will punish them. He said the gang, which consists of young people from the age of 15, has been terrorising locals, especially at night weddings. “We’re going to crack down on the gang,” Towet said. Ng’ombeni residents say several victims have been seriously wounded. “These atrocities do not happen only at night, but sometimes during the day,” Tatu Tinga from Moshini village in Ng’ombeni said. He said the gang walks in groups of 10-15, wielding knives and pangas. Towet urged residents to cooperate with police to help weed out the robbers.
