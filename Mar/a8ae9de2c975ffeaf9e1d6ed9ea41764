Kenya could join the world’s leading
silk producing countries if the high potential for sericulture in the country is fully exploited. Head
of national sericulture centre based in Thika Kasina Muo on Friday said joint research by Kenya and Japan entomologists reveals many
ecological zones are suitable for silk
farming. He was addressing residents of Ikolomani subcounty. A group in the area has been rearing silk worms since 2016. Japan’s department of agriculture and Kalro are carrying out the
research aimed at promoting the sector. Kakamega and Kibos
Kalro stations have been identified to carry out further research on viability
of sericulture using biological and molecular genetic technology. Muo said that China, the
world’s leading silk producer was keen to leasing large tracts of land in Kenya
for silk production for both local and international market needs. “My centre has no
problem with that as long as there are clear laws governing production and
marketing of Silk in the country to benefit farmers,” he said. He asked residents to
embrace sericulture which has better returns than Gold that has been discovered
in the area. “Gold diminishes as it
is mined but silk keeps increasing depending on the silk worms one rears,” he
said. Muo also said the county would benefit from rearing a variety of butterflies, wasps and spiders and other wild insects are rich sources of silk
fibre. Muo said that a part
from being used to produce some of the world’s most expensive linen, silk is
also used for production of bulletproof jackets. The leaves of Mulberry
tree on which the silk worms feed can also be used to treat high blood
pressure, prostate cancer, feed animals and its fruits are used in making jam,
he added. Muo said that Japan and
Kenya first signed an agreement for production of silk in 1972 but the project
stalled. This, time around, he
said, the two countries were serious about making sericulture a paying venture
like tea and Coffee.
