Two North Rift governors have opposed plans by the National Treasury to reduce funds allocated to the counties this year following a decline in revenue collection by Sh70 billion. “We are telling CS Rotich not to dare touch funds set aside for the counties. We have already planned and committed the funds and we will not allow any reduction,” Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago said. He spoke at Chepkanga in Eldoret on Saturday. Mandago said debts incurred by the counties will increase if the revenue allocation is reduced. The national government plans to slash county funding by between Sh15 billion and Sh17 billion. The counties owe suppliers and contractors more than Sh40 billion. The National Treasury last week said the government is facing a serious cash cruch and cannot meet all its financial obligations. Mandago and Sang said the counties need more cash and not budget cuts. Mangado urged Kenyans to pay taxes. “If you avoid paying taxes then the government will not give the services needed by the public or complete many of the ongoing projects,” he said.
