Nairobi county Majority leader Abdi Guyo has protested reports he has been funding criminal and terrorist activities in the city. He has also denied having sexual affairs with nominated women MCAs. The Spring Valley Matopeni ward representative said he has been maligned and his character assassinated by reports in mainstream and social media. “I abhor al Shabaab and its activities. I am not their sympathiser and I don’t know who runs the terrorist group,” he said. Guyo said cartels who are holding the county at ransom are behind the false reports. He said the cartels want to silence him because of his hard stance position against them. He said the his woes started two weeks ago immediately after the MCAs discussed EALA MP Simon Mbugua’s role at City Hall. He claimed that he has bean receiving calls from private numbers, threatening him over what transpired in the chamber. The MCAs questioned Mbugua’s role at City Hall, saying that the former Kamukunji MP was directing, intimidating and threatening leaders and workers at the county headquarters. I have never been involved in any criminal activity. I am a leader in this house, in my ward and in the whole of Nairobi. What is happening is pure intimidation and character assassination,” the visibly angry MCA protested.
