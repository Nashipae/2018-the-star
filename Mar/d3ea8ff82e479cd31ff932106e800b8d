Only 10 counties invested in development projects between July and September last year, pointing to stagnant business during the election period when more than Sh20 billion allocated for growth activities was untouched. The latest audit by the Controller of Budget has revealed that counties are consistently spending more on salaries and less on development. The recommended level for county salary expenditure is 35 per cent of total expenditure; the current spending averages 78.3 per cent on salaries. Read: Why county audit funds are withheld Most counties blamed their lack of spending on delays by the national Treasury in releasing funds. However, funds were allocated to development by Turkana, which spend the most of development, followed by Murang'a, Kiambu, Laikipia, Kilifi, Machakos, Mombasa, Narok, Nairobi and Kitui. Even as taxpayers complain of poor roads and lack of other key infrastructure across the country, 37 counties failed to spend any money on development, despite an uproar over low absorption by counties. None requested money to fund any development projects, according to the report by Controller Agnes Odhiambo The report also revealed that counties spent 78.3 per cent of the Sh34.27 billion spent by devolved units between July and September on salaries — even as they perform poorly in revenue collection. Another Sh6.52 billion (18.4 per cent) was spent on operations and maintenance. Odhiambo has recommended counties lower their wage bills to ease the burden on taxpayers and increase availability of funds for development, social welfare and other key issues. High expenditure on salaries and allowances, under-performance in local revenue collection and delay by the Treasury to disburse the equitable share of revenue raised nationally were identified as problems hampering effective budget implementation. Even as a large chunk of funds was allocated to salaries and other recurrent expenditures, only eight counties collected more than Sh100 million between July and September. The devolved units only met 8.6 per cent of their targeted collection, indicating that counties are still overwhelmingly reliant on the national government. Nairobi was the best performer, collecting Sh1.4 billion, followed by Narok with Sh692 million and Mombasa with Sh307 million. Others that collected more than Sh100 million include Nakuru (Sh271 million), Nyeri (Sh137 million), Kiambu (Sh244 million), Kisumu (Sh123 million), Laikipia (Sh106 million) and Machakos (Sh103 million). The worst performers were Tana River (Sh3 million), Lamu (Sh5 million), Tharaka Nithi (Sh6 million), Mandera (Sh8 million) and Garissa (Sh9 million). Marsabit, Tana River and Wajir did not report their expenditures for the review period, the report says. According to the latest report by the Controller, all 47 county governments had total available revenue of Sh55.3 billion for the four-month period. This represented a Sh20.4 billion equitable share, Sh4.82 local revenue, Sh4.9 billion Fuel Levy fund and an opening balance of Sh25.17 billion While the Controller of Budget approved Sh37.8 billion, counties only spent 35.4 billion, representing under spending of Sh2.4 billion of the amount approved for withdrawal by the CoB. Of the total money issued to the counties, Sh5.17 was for the county assemblies, while Sh32.09 was for the county executives. Notably, of the total expenditure by counties during the first quarter of the 2017-18 financial year, only Sh1.1 billion (3.3 per cent) was incurred for development projects. The money spent on development represented an absorption rate of 0.9 per cent of the annual budget, the lowest since the advent of devolution. “The low absorption of development funds denies Kenyans the benefit to be derived from development projects such as access to quality services in health, agriculture, Roads, and the education sectors,” says the report. Odhiambo says counties should prioritise implementation of development projects to improve the living standards of its citizens. During the same quarter in 2016, counties had an absorption rate of 8.3 per cent; Sh13.96 billion was spent on development projects for the three-month period. “The low expenditure on development activities was due to delay in disbursement of funds by the national Treasury, which was occasioned by delay in approval of the County Allocation of Revenue Bill, 2017,” Odhiambo reported. Laikipia county spent Sh131.7 million, Kilifi Sh131.4 million, Narok Sh74 million, Machakos Sh35.4 million, Mombasa Sh29 million, Nairobi Sh24.5 million and Kitui Sh23.6 million. It emerged that while some counties had well-balanced budgets, others were had unrealistic estimates, or deficits. The Controller of Budget, on the strength of the deficits, approved release of Sh37.82 billion from the County Revenue Funds to County Operation Accounts to fund the budgets during the period under review. The authorised withdrawal was a decline by 50.1 per cent from Sh75.69 billion released in the same period in 2016-17. Nairobi, Kiambu and Narok recorded the highest expenditures at Sh4.56 billion, Sh1.7 billion and Sh1.33 billion, respectively. On the other hand, lowest-expenditure counties included Vihiga at Sh241 million, Lamu Sh272 million and Isiolo Sh463 million. Nairobi county spent the most on personnel emoluments at Sh3.39 billion, followed by Kiambu and Kisii counties at Sh1.27 billion and Sh29.6 billion, respectively. Analysis of personnel emoluments as a percentage of total expenditure by county shows that Nakuru, Kisii and Garissa recorded the highest percentage at 95.6 per cent, 95.1 per cent and 94.9 per cent, respectively. The Controller of Budget said that counties continue to struggle in raising local revenue. “Counties failed to budget for all the conditional grants as contained in the County Revenue Allocation Bill, 2017,” Odhiambo said. During the period, counties collected local revenue amounting to Sh4.82 billion through local sources, representing eight per cent of the annual target. This was a decline of 32 per cent, compared to 7.09 billion generated in the same period in 2016, which was 12.3 per cent of the annual target. Samburu, Baringo and Isiolo recorded the highest revenue as proportion of the annual revenue target at Sh21.7 million, Sh20.5 million and 18.3 million, respectively.
