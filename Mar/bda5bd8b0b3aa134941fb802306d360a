Likoni voters burst into song and dance after the Mombasa High court upheld Mishi Mboko's election. The petition challenging her win was filed by former MP Masoud Mwahima who argued the August 2017 election as not free and credible. Judge Erick Ogola validated the election saying the petitioner failed to prove his case. He said though the court noted some minor irregularities, the same could not affect the outcome of the vote. Ogola said that during the scrutiny and recount of 10 polling stations revealed Mishi's votes decreased by seven while Mwahima's increased by a vote. The judge said the margin of votes between the petitioner and the MP was huge adding that the seven votes could not change the outcome. The judge further dismissed the ground that form 35A was filled with information meant for form 35B. Ogola said such mistakes were never intentional but were a mathematical error, hence a minor miscalculation. "These officers worked for more than 24 hours without sleep and it is possible for someone to make such mistakes due to fatigue," he said. The judge further said the petitioner had also failed to prove how power blackout during the counting of votes had affected him. He said Mwahima did not prove how the blackout disadvantaged him to a point his votes were stolen. Ogola further said the former legislator did not point out some of the polling stations where votes were counted without electricity.
