Twenty clerks will be hired to hasten the issuing of birth certificates by the Registrar of Persons in Murang’a county. It is not clear for how long they will be hired. The announcement was made by Murang’a Governor Mwangi wa Iria and county commissioner John Elungata on Thursday. Registrar Charles Wanyeje said his office has doing its best and issues more than 200 birth certificates per day. “I only have 10 staff members who have been working hard to serve the hundreds of parents trooping into our offices every day,” he said. Birth certificates are needed to register in the new digital education system that tracks students throughout their academic careers. Pupils will not be enrolled without them. The hiring follows numerous complaints by parents who have been camping at the office for days, seeking the documents. Parents say the process is painfully slow yet the certificates are needed in schools for children’s registration. They say they have unsuccessfully been making numerous trips to the Office of the Registrar of Persons in Murang’a town. The parents say they are always told to wait and wondered how much longer their children would stay out of school for lack of the certificates. “We know if you intervene we will get the certificates without further delay,” the parents told the governor on Thursday. They had intercepted him on his way to the office. Some say they had been told to collect the documents on Thursday, but were disappointed to find that they were yet to be produced. “I have received numerous complaints the Registrar’s Office has been frustrating the issuing of certificates and demanding bribes from parents,” Wa Iria said.
