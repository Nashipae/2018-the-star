The Kamulu bridge along Kangundo road has been washed away after swollen Athi River burst its banks. Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua on Thursday evening said those trying to use the road to Nairobi or Machakos should turn back. Many motorists had opted for the road after the busy Mombasa highway was closed after Mto Wa Mawe River cut off the bridge near Green Park estate.

"The water is still rising. Our emergency assessment is that the highway will be cut off until tomorrow. The road is now closed," Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua had earlier said in a Facebook post. Mutua said more than 50 people were rescued from the estate by the county emergency team. "Majority of them are the elderly, house helps and children from some of the flooded houses. Our teams will be on the ground tonight to respond to any situations that arise. Let me repeat, Mombasa Highway is CLOSED."  Click here for the latest political news
