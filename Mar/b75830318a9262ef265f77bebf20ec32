Bomet Governor Joyce Laboso has urged Kenyans not to misread the recent reconciliatory meeting between President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga as a political realignment. Praising the duo for agreeing to work together for the sake of the country, she said in Sotik on Saturday that the move was “healthy for the nation”. Laboso urged Kenyans to emulate the two. “Political differences that have existed for long among our people should now end. We’re happy and we now want to forge ahead in building our nation, uniting all Kenyans and working together,” she said.
