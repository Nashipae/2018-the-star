Police have accused Boni residents of supplying food and water to al Shabaab militants hiding in the forest. On Tuesday, Lamu county boss Muchangi Kioi said some of the people are using proceeds from illegal logging and charcoal burning to fund the terror group. But Kioi noted that police were conducting a massive crackdown on the loggers and charcoal burners. “The fact that people burn charcoal and cut timber to fund such acts is unimaginable. That’s why we have launched this crackdown. We have already arrested four suspects,” he said. Terror attacks in the area have left hordes of security officers and civilians dead.
