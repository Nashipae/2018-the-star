A class six pupil at Narumoro primary School Kajiado county has been washed away by floods. Melody Wanjiku was going to school accompanied by two others when she was swept away by water as she crossed a swollen stream. The other two girls were rescued by a boda-boda man who was nearby. Head of Media Communication and Publicity for Kajiado county MPs George Kaniaru said the three children were crossing on a wooden bridge when the tragedy occurred. "I was called in the morning after the accident, there wasn't much I could do. What I gathered is that the children were crossing the river on a wooden bridge which is not that strong," Kaniaru told the Star on Phone on Thursday. Kajiado North MP Joseph Mande urged parents to take their children to school during this rainy season. He further said that a dam pathway (Kisirian Dam) is under construction near the river to connect Kajiado North and Kajiado West.
