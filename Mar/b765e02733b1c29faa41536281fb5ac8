The national government has set up security camps in areas believed to be al Shabaab hotspots on the Lamu-Garsen Road. The move is meant to weed out al Shabaab militia. Raids have been occurring on the road since 2014. They resulted in the deaths of scores of security officers and civilians. Lamu county commander Muchangi Kioi said the camps have been erected at Milihoi, Nyongoro and Lango La Simba, all of which are notorious hotspots. Militants have ambushed and launched attacks on security vehicles and transport buses plying the route. Kioi said security officers have been deployed to reinforce patrols to prevent further attacks. He assured travellers of their safety, saying there is adequate security presence. “We have established police camps and set up security barricades in all the hotspots,” Kioi said.
