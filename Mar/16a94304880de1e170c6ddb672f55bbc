Residents are reported to be fleeing the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta enclave in Syria as the situation there was described as "beyond critical". Syria's military appears to be increasing pressure on several fronts to try to retake the enclave just to the east of the capital, Damascus. Amid intense fighting government forces have taken 10% of the area, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says. The UN says an aid convoy has not been able to obtain permission to enter. It had planned to go to the Eastern Ghouta on Sunday carrying humanitarian supplies for aid agencies to distribute. Some 393,000 people are trapped in the besieged enclave. Neither a daily five-hour truce ordered by the Russians - Syria's main backers - nor a nationwide ceasefire demanded by the UN Security Council have led to any humanitarian relief for the enclave. Opposition sources and journalists on the ground speak of hundreds of people fleeing the bombardment of Beit Sawa on the eastern edge of the densely populated centre of the Eastern Ghouta - a sizeable region which also comprises towns and agricultural land. A resident speaking to the BBC described the situation in the Eastern Ghouta as "beyond critical", adding that government forces were only two miles (3km) from Beit Sawa.
