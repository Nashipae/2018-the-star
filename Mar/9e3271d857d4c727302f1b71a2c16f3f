The government has dismissed claims Miguna Miguna was denied entry into the country upon arrival from Canada on Monday. The Interior ministry said that Miguna declined to present the passport he travelled in upon arrival at JKIA as required by law. Mwenda Njoka, the ministry's spokesperson, said: "IATA regulations requires travellers to show the documents they travelled in at the point of entry." There was a stand-off at JKIA after the self-declared NRMKe general declined to be issued with a tourist visa to gain entry. He maintained that the government has to adhere to the orders issued to the effect that he be allowed entry as a Kenyan citizen. Miguna said the tourist visa application, as sought by immigrations, is a trick which he wouldn't fall to. He said applying for the visa would take away his rights. "There is no way I will agree to what they are asking because what it
does is that it waives rights that will never be restored. I know the
mischief." See: [VIDEO] I won't apply for tourist visa, adamant Miguna says after JKIA blockade Also read: Miguna Miguna denied entry after refusing to apply for Kenyan visa Click here for the latest political news
