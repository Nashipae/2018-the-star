Inmates at Nyahururu GK prison have expressed concern over their health following a water crisis in the facility. An inmate who spoke to the Star on Saturday said they are living in deplorable conditions and some have started diarrhoearing. He said both water and electricity were disconnected a week ago. “We have no water to bath and drink. The toilets are overflowing as there is no water to wash away the waste. We urgently need help as people are sick,” he said He said about 30 inmates in the facility have stomach problems, adding lack of power also aggravates their problems. The Star visited the facility on Saturday evening. Peter Kubende, the officer in charge denied that the inmates have health issues.

He said there is a borehole in the facility but without power, they cannot pump out water.
