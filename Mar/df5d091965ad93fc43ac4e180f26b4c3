Sixty-five school leavers from Tana River and Garissa yesterday benefited from a one-month skills training programme sponsored by a a local organisation. The CBO’s Graduate Internship Programme chairman Steve Sandagi said the aim of the programme is to equip them with skills and knowledge so they become self reliant. It instils hope in those who did not perform well in their KCPE and KCSE exams. The graduation took place at Life Frontier Primary School. He said youth are not aware that Garissa University and North Eastern National Polytechnic have opportunities for those who did not get good grades. Education executive Abass Kunyo said he will ensure all county programmes are fully implemented to uplift youth, women and people living with disabilities. Beneficiary Hassan Said requested that funds be set aside for youth to be able to access loans to start up businesses and be self-employed. A similar programme will run in July. A programme to monitor graduants in the next five years has been put in place to ensure they don’t waste themselves.
