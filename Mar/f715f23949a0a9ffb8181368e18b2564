Nakumatt’s administrator has proposed that the company’s suppliers convert 75 per cent of their dues from the retailer into equity and waive the balance. Peter Obondo Kahi, of advisory firm PKF, says in a proposal to be filed in the High Court that only 15 per cent of Nakumatt’s creditors will be paid if the supermarket chain is liquidated. He says the best way out for all stakeholders is to revive the retailer. The administrator has proposed, however, that the other creditors (banks, KRA and employees) do not waive any of their debt. Kahi has for the first time revealed one of Nakumatt’s best guarded secrets — the exact amount Nakumatt owes to its creditors, which is Sh35.8 billion.

He proposes that Tuskys be allowed to continue managing Nakumatt until the struggling retailer can stand on its own feet. Suppliers carry the bulk of risk with Nakumatt, as they are owed Sh18.5 billion. The retailer also owes lenders Sh12.8 billion. Other creditors include the KRA (Sh1.8 billion), staff (Sh1.3 billion) and another group whose claims have not been specified (Sh1.1 billion). The report and proposal were ordered by High Court judge Fred Ochieng who is presiding over a suit filed by 100 creditors seeking to liquidate Nakumatt for failure to pay them over Sh4.5 billion. Ochieng in January allowed the appointment of Kahi as administrator. Kahi in turn appointed Tuskys as Nakumatt’s manager. Kahi has suggested employees receive Sh680 million in the year ended February 28, 2019 and receive the balance over seven years.
