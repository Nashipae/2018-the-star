Former President Daniel arap Moi jetted back from Israel on Saturday evening after knee treatment and medical checks at a Tel Aviv hospital. Moi, his son Gideon - who is Baringo Senator and Kanu party chairman - and his physician Dr David Silverstein landed at the JKIA in Nairobi at about 8pm. They then proceeded to his Kabarnet Gardens residence, according to a statement from his communication office. The former President flew to Israel on Sunday and was admitted following "an unconformable knee." The 93-year-old was discharged on Thursday when Gideon noted he was doing well.
