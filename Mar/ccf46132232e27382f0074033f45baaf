EACC detectives on Friday raided the home of Pyrethrum Processing Company managing director in a bid to unearth evidence of corruption at the firm. After raiding Paul Lolwerikoi's home at 5am, the cops later stormed the company's Nakuru premises following an outcry by members of the public. "The sting was prompted by a public outcry over alleged corrupt deals ranging from tendering to contracting," EACC south rift manager Christine Natome said. "AfterÂ  obtaining a search warrant on Thursday, we raided the residence and offices of the company acting managing director, accountant and marketing manager," she said. However, no official from the pyrethrum company was arrested during the raid. "Very crucial documents related to the complaints raised were retrieved and the investigating officers will be relying on them before deciding on whether there are any charges to be preferred against any of the managers," Natome said. Nakuru, West Pokot, Nyandarua, Bomet, Uasin Gishu, Kericho, Kisii, Elgeyo Marakwet, Kiambu, Baringo, Narok, Nyeri, Nyamira, Laikipia, Meru and Nandi are some of the key pyrethrum producers. The run-down sector used to earn Kenya in excess of Sh10 billion in foreign exchange in the 1980s and 1990s before corruption and mismanagement took root. The Nakuru factory has been idle due to lack of raw materials. During its peak, the factory received flowers from 200,000 farmers. But the number drastically fell to 6,000. Currently, the factory waits for months to accumulate flowers for processing. Analysts say that 100 tonnes of processed flowers can earn the company Sh20 million in international markets. The current equipment can crash 25 tonnes of flowers a day but is largely under-utilised. Another machine, which cost taxpayers nearly Sh1 billion and can crash 50 tonnes of flowers a day, is also rotting at the Nakuru factory yard. The machine was acquired in 2006 but developed mechanical problems. Click here for the latest political news
