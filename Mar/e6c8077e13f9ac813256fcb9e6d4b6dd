Cherangany MP Joshua Kuttuny has asked NASA leader Raila Odinga not to forsake his co-principals after he decided to work with President Uhuru Kenyatta. Kutunny said he will help to mediate between Raila and Bungoma Moses Wetang’ula who was ejected from the position of minority leader in the Senate on Tuesday. James Orengo (Siaya) was elected as his replacement.

Kuttuny said there was no need to cause political hostility within NASA. “The four principals were in the cold together but I am disappointed after getting a small meal from Uhuru, Raila now does not want any of the NASA principals to move near him,” Kuttuny said. Kuttuny is the former adviser to the president. Also read: Orengo takes over Minority leadership, Wetangula ousted  Click here for the latest political news
