The Ombudsman services could soon be devolved to the 47 counties if senators endorse a proposal to devolve the office “urgently”. Nominated Senator Petronilla Were, sponsor of the motion to open ombudsman satellite offices in all counties, says its absence in has denied Kenyans their right to access justice. “...the absence of the Commission offices in the rest of the counties has made it difficult for members of the public to report allegations of maladministration, delay, administrative injustice, discourtesy, incompetence, misbehavior, inefficiency or ineptitude within the public service,” Were said. Senators are expected to debate the motion today during the afternoon session. Regina Mwatha (pictured) is the acting chairperson of the Commission on Administrative Justice following the resignation of Otiende Amollo, who was elected as the Rarieda MP. The office is tasked with investigating suspected unlawful actions that are likely to result in any impropriety or prejudicial such as complaints of abuse of power, unfair treatment or unethical behaviors within the public service both at the county and national level. The CAJ (Ombudsman) currently has offices in five counties. They are Nairobi as the headquarters, Mombasa, Kisumu, Isiolo and Uasin Gishu. The office was created through an amendment in Parliament in 2011 that restructured the Kenya National Human Rights and the Equality Commission.  Click here for the latest political news
