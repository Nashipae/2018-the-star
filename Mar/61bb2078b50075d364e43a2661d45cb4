Nairobi county government has been put on the spot by the Kenya Commercial Bank over a Sh3.7 billion loan. KCB CEO Joshua Oigara who appeared before the County Public Accounts Committee on Tuesday said city hall has not made any efforts to settle the debt nor have they responded to a number of requests the bank has made. The county government in April 2014 entered an agreement with KCB seeking help to offset a 2.4 billion it had acquired from Equity Bank. However, city hall has defaulted from any of the payments since February 2016. “The county has been in default since day one and the interest charged has been increasing,” Oigera said. The watchdog committee chaired by Mabatini ward rep Wilfred Odalo however sought to find out whether the loan facility was acquired through the right channel. Kilimani MCA Moses Ogeto further questioned whether the acquisition of the loan facility was approved by the city assembly as required by the law. Odalo ordered the bank to appear before the committee next week with all required documents ascertaining assembly approval for the loan facility and specific bank documents detailing the nature of the loan.
