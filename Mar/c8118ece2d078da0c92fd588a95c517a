Police have arrested four people found selling unpackaged cigarettes in Murangâ€™a town on Wednesday. They were arrested during a crackdown on counterfeit and illicit liquor by a multi-agency team. Four others were arrested for operating bars without licences and selling alcohol that was not properly labelled. The four-day crackdown was headed by Wangai Gachoka, a Nacada official. It is being carried out in 26 counties most affected by drug abuse and alcoholism. Wangai said the team will raid bars that operate outside the 5pm-11pm hours. He urged residents not to chew too much miraa, as it has a chemical that causes mental retardation.
