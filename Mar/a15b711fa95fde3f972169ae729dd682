The Auditor General has criticised Embu county government for failing
to use about Sh790million it had earmarked for development projects in the
2015/2016 financial year. A report by the Kenya National Audit Office, which has been
tabled in the county assembly for scrutiny, indicates the assembly had approved Sh2,290,151,875 for development. Sh3 million had been allocated to the office of the governor (Public Service and Administration) and Sh2, 287, 151,875 for the nine executive departments. The report seen by the Star shows Sh2,095,200 was used for the governor's office Sh1,498,591,482 for the nine
executive departments. It is before the county assembly’s Public
Accounts and Investment Committee for scrutiny and recommendations. The report states four departments with a budget of Sh601,586,202 were below 70 per cent
rate of budget absorption. These include the governor's office that had not consumed 67 per cent
of the expenditure approved by the assembly, and the Department of
Gender, Culture, Children and Social Service (45 per cent), Finance and Planning (13 per cent)
and Education (63 per cent). The Auditor General concludes the poor absorption
of funds by the county government resulted in the failure by the executive to utilise Sh789,465,193  for development projects. The Auditor General said this resulted in non-delivery of services to the people of Embu. The executive spent Sh3.2 million on investment and industrialisation, which was not budgeted for, the report says. It shows there was no supplementary budget presented for audit review to show whether the over expenditure was approved
by the county assembly or not. Neither is it possible to confirm where funds that were not budgeted for came from. The Auditor Genral says the executive’s
financial statements reflected pending debts of Sh1,042,904,103 as at
June 30, 2016. However, the county government did not maintain creditors’
records including ledgers, invoices, contracts and register. Therefore, the Auditor General  says, it was impossible to confirm the
validity, occurrence, accuracy and completeness of the pending bills. The report states that if the county executive had
settled all its debts, the statement of
receipts and payments would have reflected a deficit of Sh634,278,841 instead
of a surplus of Sh408, 625,262. The report stats the county’s capability to maintain quality services remains doubtful.
