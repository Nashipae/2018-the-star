Northeastern politicians have been urged to stop politicising the TSC’s transfer of non-local teachers who fear terror attacks and violence. Kenya Livestock Marketing Council chairman Dubat Amey on Friday said non-local teachers’ safety concerns are genuine and no one should force them to stay in the county. He urged politicians to engage teachers. “Some MPs are saying the teachers must stay and others have gone further to demonstrate against teachers who want to be transferred. Why should they threaten a teacher from Nyeri who wants to be transferred for fear of his life?” Amey said. “The teachers came to this region willingly to teach our children, but there is a problem. Some of them have been killed. They now fear for their lives.” Amey said the safety of teachers is just as important as children’s learning. “Non-local teachers cannot be taken hostage by leaders, parents and the community,” he said. “We need to come up with a solution. This is not politics of Jubilee and NASA. This is a different thing. We need to sit with teachers, comfort them and agree on the way forward.” Amey said Garissa, Wajir and Mandera governors should set aside Sh1 billion annually to train local teachers to fillthe shortage.
