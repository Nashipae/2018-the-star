A group of Coast leaders yesterday distanced themselves from DP William Ruto's endorsement for 2022 presidential race. Led by Kwale Woman MP Zuleikha Juma, they said those who backed Ruto at the weekend made personal decisions that must not be viewed as the party's position. Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya (Jubilee) on Monday at Biashara centre said they have decided to support the DP. But the group said ODM leader Raila Odinga will direct members on what to do. "We cannot forget the sacrifices Odinga made for us. If he says he will contest for presidency in 2022, we will support him. As for now, we can't say Ruto is our choice," Juma said at Swahili Beach Hotel. She said ODM is still intact and has not merged with Jubilee, despite Raila having signed a pact with President Uhuru Kenyatta. "We are telling our supporters to ignore misleading information that ODM leaders will support Ruto's candidacy," Juma said. She added that NASA wrangles are normal and do not mean the affiliates will split. "We are aware that other NASA principals want to meet the President, which is okay. That doesn't mean they want to join Jubilee," Juma said. Kwale governor Salim Mvurya on Monday at Biashara centre said that Jubilee have already decided their presidential candidate come 2022 which is Ruto saying he stands a better chance to lead as he has been the deputy president for two terms. "We know that in 2022 Ruto will be our president. We cannot debate on that as we have a stand as Jubilee. If there is any other person from the other side then we are waiting for them, " said Mvurya.
