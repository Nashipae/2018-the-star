Six senior military officers including Chief of Defence Forces Samson Mwathethe have been ordered to appear before a court martial next month. This is after Major Laban Nyambok, the medical verification officer at Kenya Armed Forces Medical Insurance Scheme, successfully obtained summons. The officer wants his bosses to appear before his trial as trustees of the medical scheme and shed light on how it works. Others summoned are Lieutenant General Gondi, Major General S.W. Nandwa, Lieutenant Colonel Keitany and all service commanders of Kenya Army, Kenya Navy and Kenya Air Force. Nyambok was placed on his defence by the court on February 28. It is then that that he asked the court to issue summons to his bosses. The court issued summonses but the court clerk said he was unable to effect service owing to seniority of the officers and bureaucracy. The court then directed the summonses be served through the legal department, but there was no success because of stringent chain of command. Nyambok is charged with four counts including receiving money from Anthony Mbithi, the proprietor of Tahidi Nursing Home in Mwingi to allegedly clear payment of fictitious hospital bills for a number of people, acts he knew to or ought to have known constitute offences. It is alleged that between June 6, 2014, and January 27, 2015, while performing the duties of medical verification officer, he approved payment of inpatient hospital bills of Sh206,130 without authoriation. The witnesses are expected to appear in court on April 12. Click here for the latest political news
