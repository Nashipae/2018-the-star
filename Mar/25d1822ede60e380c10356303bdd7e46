Imams have condemned the assault on journalists covering the return of National Resistance Movement ‘General’ Miguna Miguna at JKIA on Monday night. Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya Uasin Gishu chairman Sheikh Abubakar Bini on Tuesday termed the assault barbaric and out of order. The attack on journalists by plainclothes and uniformed police officers was captured on live television. Citizen TV reporter Stephen Letoo was rushed to Nairobi Hospital after he was beaten by a policeman and complained of abdominal pain. NTV cameraman Robert Gichira was beaten and his equipment destroyed by a GSU officer who beat him. Another officer manhandled KTN’s Sophia Wanuna but she stood her ground and he eventually let go of her. All this took place as the cameras were rolling. Speaking in Eldoret, Bini said, “As religious leaders, we want to condemn the act in the strongest terms possible. This is uncalled for and something needs to be done to end this mess. Why should journalists be harassed while in their line of duty of informing the public?” He called for disciplinary measures against the officers. “Police should treat journalists in a humane way as they are not criminals,” Bini said.
