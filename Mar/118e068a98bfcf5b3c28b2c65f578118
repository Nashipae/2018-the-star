A conman who has been soliciting money from MPs is closely related to Murang’a woman representative Sabina Chege, detectives have said. According to Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti, the suspect has a "special relationship" with Chege. The MP was one of several lawmakers who complained in the House last week that they were being blackmailed by a conman using her name to solicit cash from them. Chege said she knew the suspect but police were reluctant to move in and arrest him. On Thursday, the National Assembly Security committee went into private session after Kinoti said he could not divulge further information on the matter in the full glare of the media. On Tuesday, Kinoti promised the committee that he would, in 24 hours, arrest individuals who have been harassing MPs. Besides blackmail, the lawmakers had complained about receiving nude photos from an unknown woman who put their marriages at risk.

That’s what I’m promising," he told the the team led by Paul Koinange at Continental House in Nairobi. Click here for the latest political stories
