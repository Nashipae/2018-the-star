Nairobi DCI chief Ireri Kamwende has been moved to the the DCI headquarters in the latest changes by DCI chief George Kinoti. Kamwende has been replaced by Gideon Kibunja of Rift valley. Former Flying Squad chief Said Mohammed has been named the new Kilifi County DCI boss while former Special Crime Prevention Unit boss Noah Katumo has been moved to Nyanza as a Divisional Commander. AIG Henry Ondieki, who was recently moved from Eastern where he served as DCI chief, has been transferred to the police headquarters. Unlike in the past where the names of officers were released to the public, the DCI has contacted officers to inform them of their new posts. This followed uproar over a leaked transfer from the office of the Inspector General of Police in February. A senior police officer was interdicted over the leakage. About 350 police officers from the Flying Squad and the Special Crime Prevention Unit have been transferred. The newly appointed Kinoti says the Flying Squad is being reconstituted because of reports some police collude with criminals. The two units lost about 100 officers in the changes last month while another 250 officers were transferred.
