Two women claiming to be wives of a city thug killed by police were locked out of a meeting by mortuary staff following a standoff. One sought to be recognised as the wife of Ng’ang’a Muhia, 54, who, alongside three others, was shot dead by police last Wednesday in Parklands, Nairobi. Yesterday, the deceased was identified by family members. He was from Kwamaiko, Kiambu. His wife, children and father were present.

I will have died finding money for her,” the note read. Besides the officially recognised wife, another woman said she had a child with Ng’ang’a. It was not clear if she was the one Ng’ang’a referred to in the note. She appeared to be in her 20s. Ng’ang’a’s wife, in her late 40s, opposed attempts by the young woman to be recognised.

They were at pains to explain to the investigators the nature of the business he ran. Ng’ang’a fits the description of Kenya’s oldest thug, going by the recent statistics on the ages of criminals shot dead by police.The majority are young men aged 30 and below. Ng’ang’a was the driver of the car he and his accomplices were in when they were killed by the police at 3rd Parklands Avenue. Nairobi DCI chief Ireri Kamwende said the men were part of a criminal network preying on customers leaving banks after making huge withdrawals. He said the suspects had attempted to carjack a customer who was leaving a bank in Westlands. The criminals would trail traders from banking halls to the city streets, where they would kidnap, carjack or rob them, Kamwende said.  Click here for the latest political news
