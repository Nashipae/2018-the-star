Embu farmers have threatened to paralyse the implementation of recommendations of the miraa task force over alleged discrimination in the distribution of a Sh1.2 billion fund. The farmers yesterday said they will go to court and block the implementation committee. The Mbeere and Embu Miraa Farmers Union and Mbeere Muguka Sacco said they were left out of discussions on the future of the crop despite their contribution. The two unions have more than 70,000 farmers. Speaking in Embu town, the union said they were never represented in the task force that made the recommendations. SH1.2 BILLION GRANT The task force was appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2016 to look into the problems bedeviling the sector and propose solutions. They accused the team of failure to consult farmers in Embu. “Embu miraa farmers were not represented in the committee. We wonder whether we are miraa farmers in Kenya or elsewhere,” chairman Jerevasius Nyomyekothe said. He was flanked by union’s secretary Silus Ngeranwa and Pius Njiru (treasurer). He was also with Mbeere Muguka Sacco chairman Josphat Njue. They have not benefited from the sh1.2 billion Uhuru ordered the government to set aside for the improvement of miraa farmers welfare. WANT REPRESENTATION The farmers claimed they were being discriminated, citing projects elsewhere within the miraa growing belt. The farmers want the court to ensure they are represented in the implementation committee to ensure they benefit. “There is a problem in the 12-member committee because our representative is not included,” Nyomyekothe said. Half of the members are government officials, including the Embu executive for agriculture Anne Mukami. Lack of water for irrigation, drop in miraa prices and insecurity are some of the challenges they face. Njiru said the farmers have a right to benefit from government interventions. “We will do whatever it takes for us to get those benefits,” Njiru said.
