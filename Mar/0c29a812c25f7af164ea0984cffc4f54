Governor Okoth Obado on Wednesday launched a Sh18 million renal unit at the Migori County Referral and Teaching Hospital. He said equipment was bought through the national governmentâ€™s Managed Equipment Services. Obado said the county will offer kidney dialysis for patients with chronic kidney disease. He said patients will pay Sh9,500 per dialysis session. The first patient was treated on Wednesday. Obado also said there are enough resources to complete a paediatric ward, an oxygen plant, a satellite blood bank and an amenity ward.
