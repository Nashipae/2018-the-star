President Uhuru Kenyatta has asked Kenyans to show love and compassion this Easter. In a message to the public ahead of Good Friday, Uhuru added that Kenyans should encourage each other during this period. "This holiday offers us the promises of victory over adversity, temptation and challenges if we remain faithful to our Lord's injunction to love one another as we love ourselves," he wrote on Twitter on Thursday. "[This holiday also] renews our commitment to making our families, communities and nation united, peaceful and strong. God bless you." Opposition leader Raila Odinga said: "Happy Easter to all Kenyans from all walks of life. From my family to yours, I wish you the Lord's blessings." Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko asked asked the people to promote peace. "As we mark this Easter, let us remember all those in need and promote peace around the country by avoiding divisive politics of tribalism," he said via Facebook. Easter holidays are widely regarded as celebrations of the resurrection of Christ. Good Friday, also known as Holy Friday, marks the start of the season and is followed by Easter Monday. The dates change every year as Easter Sunday must always fall on the next full moon after the Spring Equinox. Good Friday is commemorated because the date marks the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and his death at Calvary. The Holy Week began with the blessing of palm fronds in churches across Kenya as faithful celebrated Palm Sunday on March 25. This day marked the moment Jesus entered Jerusalem in triumph, riding on the back of a young donkey, while crowds who would later call for him to be killed paid him homage.
