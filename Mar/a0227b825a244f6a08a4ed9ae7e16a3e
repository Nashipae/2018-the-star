Residents of Athi River in Machakos county on Saturday protested demanding game meat of a stray buffalo shot by KWS officers at the East African Portland Cement Company premises. They condemned the killing then demanded a share of the kill. The residents accused the KWS of masterminding the killing. “We are shocked by the way KWS officers are killing animals looking for pasture here,” resident Joshua Sankale said. He said the officers should have used a dose to make the buffalo unconscious or a trap. “We demand a share of the kill be given to starving wanainchi,” resident Irene Mwikali said. The buffalo is said to have turned violent, endangering residents’ lives, prompting KWS officers to kill it.
