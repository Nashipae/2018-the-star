Kenya is among 37
countries in dire need of food aid, according to a UN report. The report by FAO released yesterday states that  conflicts and adverse
climatic shocks are taking their toll, particularly on East African
and Near East countries. A large number of people in these regions continue to be in need of humanitarian assistance. In February, the
Kenya Red Cross appealed for Sh1 billion for food aid to fight hunger
in drought-stricken areas. The National
Drought Management Authority last week said about 3.4 million people
are severely food insecure, mainly in eastern, southeastern
and coastal regions. The most affected counties include Garissa,
Kajiado, Isiolo, Mandera and Tana River. The Crop Prospects and Food situation report states
that last year, cereal production in East Africa dropped by 7.2 per cent
drop. “Recently-concluded
harvests of the short rains season cereal crops are forecast to be
below average in Kenya, Tanzania and Somalia,” the report warned. Seasonal rainfall in Kenya is 80 per cent below average. The country received little rainfall during the 2016 short rains season and below-average long rains in 2017. This led to poor harvests and pastoralists losing their livestock to drought. The report calls for close
monitoring of rangeland conditions in eastern parts of the country. Kenya
is categorised among countries with severe localised food insecurity, where
consecutive unfavourable rainy seasons are hampering crop and
livestock production. Other
countries in need of external food assistance are 
Afghanistan,
Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad,
Congo, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of
the Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Haiti, Iraq, Lesotho, Liberia,
Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Myanmar,
Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan,
Swaziland, Syria, Uganda, Yemen and Zimbabwe.
