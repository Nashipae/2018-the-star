ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi yesterday accused Raila Odinga’s ODM party of not honouring the pre-election pact. The ANC leader said the removal of Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula as the Senate Minority leader was reprehensible and a tragic mischief. “We stand with Wetang'ula and call on ODM not to use other means to take back Kenya to a one-party state,” Mudavadi said. He spoke during a Parliamentary Group Meeting at the ANC headquarters in Nairobi. The agenda of the meeting was to chart the way forward, following President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila’s unity. “The latest manifestation was a move to embarrass Moses Wetang’ula by some people who have decided to dethrone him,” Mudavadi said. "The dialogue must not be between two people and self-interests but centered on the interests of Kenyans." The ANC leader cautioned ODM to stick to the opposition reform agenda. "The government in our country has degenerated into the syndicated looting of public resources, non-accountability, arrogance, impunity and institutionalisation of ethnic hegemony in the management of public resources,” Mudavadi said. He said their goal is to review the government structure and the push for electoral justice so Kenyans can enjoy good leadership. Mudavadi said the opposition should only take part in the dialogue if it’s well structured and focused to address corruption, tribalism, bad governance, create jobs and unite Kenyans. “We are ready to remain in opposition alone to support the spirit of multipartism and stand by the interests of Kenyans,” he said. Mudavadi said the pre-election MoU demanded parties in NASA to equally share position in Parliament. “The opposition must accept to operate outside government, especially when holding the dialogue on reforms,” he said.
