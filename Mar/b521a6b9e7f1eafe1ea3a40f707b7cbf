Accessories are the exclamation point of a woman — so said designer Michael Kors. Wearing a well-fitting, high quality material dress is good, but what will make you stand out is if you pair it with a nice slim or chunky belt or add a statement neck piece to it. Accessories can turn basic clothes into fashion statements. Bernadette Kagwa knows this all too well, and she has made it her business to make women stand out in the right way with neck pieces. The multi-talented designer dabbles in wig creation, jewellery design and many things creative. Here are some of her neck pieces, which are sure to turn a normal outfit into an extraordinary one.  The designs are categorised as: 1. Natural stone 2. Antique 3. Beaded 4. Bridal 5.
