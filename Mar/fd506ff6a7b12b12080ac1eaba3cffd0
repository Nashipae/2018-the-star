Lawyer Miguna Miguna has reported being "dragged, assaulted and drugged" before being forced to leave the JKIA in Nairobi for Dubai on Wednesday night. In messages he sent early on Thursday morning, he said: "I woke up in Dubai and the despots are here insisting that I must travel on to London." He continued: "I’m sick. I need medical treatment. A Mr Njihia is threatening me. I need urgent help here. I want to take a flight only to Nairobi. Nowhere else! Disseminate it elsewhere. "I'm sick. My ribs and body are hurting all over. This is a travesty of justice." Interior Minister Fred Matiang'i and IG Joseph Boinnet could get jailed for holding him.

He was first deported to Canada on February 8 for stamping documents during Nasa leader Raila Odinga's self-inauguration as the People's President after the disputed August 8 and October 26, 2017 elections. In a shocking turn of events on March 9, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila decided to work together for the sake of peace, national healing and unity. This left the National Super Alliance in limbo. Miguna returned to Kenya on Monday but he was held at the airport after refusing to apply for a Visa. He said he was detained in a filthy toilet and that he was denied access to his lawyers, food and water. He was deported to Dubai despite a court order requiring that he be released and produced in court on Thursday.
