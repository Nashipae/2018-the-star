Impala Saracens coach Frank Ndong has set his sights on toppling champions KCB in the Kenya Cup semis at the Lion’s Den next week. Speaking after masterminding a crucial 34-18 win over Ngong Road derby rivals Quins to book their spot in the last four, Ndong commended his charges for the victory, their second over Quins this season. “A very tough game. We gave away some soft tries in the first half but I am glad our defence was good in the second half and they were not able to score. Our execution in attack was good despite the wet and muddy conditions” added Ndong Ndong said there is room for improvement ahead of the showdown against the bankers. “There are areas we have to improve. We know KCB are strong in setpieces, scrums and lineouts and have some excellent runners in the backs so they will be a big threat,” noted Ndong. Ndong will take solace from the fact that his charges drew 9-9 with the bankers in the final pool game a fortnight ago. “It will give us confidence and we will relish the challenge,” he added. Impala try scorers were Samuel Motari and Anthony Nyandigisi — scoring a double each — with Paul Mutsami and Mark Kwemoi scoring one each as Kwemoi added a further penalty and conversion. Quins replied through Patrice Agunda, Tony Mutai and Dennis Muhanji with Lyle Asiligwa adding a conversion and penalty . 2016 champions Kabras edged Strathmore Leos 43-13 to set up a semifinal clash against Homeboyz. Try scorers for Charles Cadovillis’ charges were Phillip Wokorach, Elphas Emgong, Pius Ogena, Felix Ayange, Andrew Chogo, Asuman Mugerwa and Hosea Ngesa. Wokorach added three conversions with Kevin Keegan contributing one. Dennis Juma scored the Leos lone try with Gideon Makumi adding one conversion and two penalties.
