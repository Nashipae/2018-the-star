Former Mbere South MP Mutava Musyimi yesterday raised concern over the ballooning debt, calling on MPs to be watchful. Speaking at the post-election seminar for MPs,  the former Budget and Appropriation Committee chairman said if over borrowing by the national government is not checked, the situation will get out of hand. “We should not borrow money to pay another debt. MPs should watch the debt, the numbers are not good at all,we need to be worried.” Musyimi told MPs to play a key role in ensuring there is no wastage, saying the borrowed money should be injected into infrastructure that will boost the growth of the economy.
