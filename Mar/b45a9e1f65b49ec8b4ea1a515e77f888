President Uhuru Kenyatta will not give the State of the Nation address as has been the norm in March every year since he was first elected. He left the country at 6.30am this morning for a four-day state visit to Mozambique. Since his election in 2013 Uhuru has used the address in Parliament to spell out the government agenda. Some of the issues previously addressed included fighting corruption, development projects and national unity. “We have not planned for one but anytime we plan we must notify Kenyans,” State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu told the Star.

Foreign Affairs and International Trade CS Monica Juma said, "The discussions in Mozambique will revolve around value addition in a number of areas, top among them being the blue economy – all aimed at benefitting the people of the two countries." Juma is part of the delegation. "Some of the discussions that are going to take place will be on how we can connect trade, how we can add value on our ocean, particularly on the blue economy,” she said. Trade between Kenya and Mozambique has grown over the years, with Kenya's total exports to Mozambique increasing from $6.61 million (Sh660 million) in 2007 to $11.8 million (Sh1.17 billion) in 2017. Despite the two countries signing a Joint Permanent Commission for Co-operation Agreement in 1991, trade volumes have remained below par. Uhuru's visit is expected to stimulate new impetus for increased trade. “We have a long history with Mozambique. As you may know, even during the Mozambican civil war, Kenya played a key role in terms of helping to negotiate between the Mozambique Liberation Front and the ResistÃªncia Nacional MoÃ§ambicana,” Juma said. Kenya’s major exports to Mozambique include prefabricated buildings, plastic items, animal and vegetable fats, tableware, kitchenware, fruit and vegetable juices. Imports from Mozambique include sugar, molasses and honey, aluminium, coal and non-ferrous base metal. There is potential for Kenya to export edible oils, tea, pharmaceuticals, beauty care products, packaging products, dairy products, textiles, apparel, leather products, construction materials as well as capacity to export services in general and professional services in particular.
