The ministry said Moi is in Tel-Aviv, Israel, for a routine medical checkup that has been very successful. "He is recuperating well and is in very good health. He will be sightseeing today and he takes this opportunity to wish all his fellow Kenyans well," it noted. Moi's spokesman Lee Njiru said he was to receive treatment on his knee, “which has been troubling him for some time”. The 93-year-old was admitted to a hospital in Tel Aviv and will turn 94 on September 2. On January 27 last year, Moi underwent a minor surgery on his knee at the Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi. The problem began on July 30, 2006, after his Range Rover collided with a pick-up truck at the Rukuma Viewpoint in Limuru.
