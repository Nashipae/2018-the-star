Miguna Miguna has moved to court seeking to be released unconditionally from JKIA. The self-declared NRMKe general has also applied to be granted unrestricted right to re-enter and remain in the country. He wants this to be on the basis of his Kenyan passport, ID or a temporary entry permit. Through his lawyers Nelson Havi and John Khaminwa, Miguna wants the court to stop the state from deporting him. In the petition filed at the Milimani law court on Tuesday, Havi says that Miguna is currently being detained incommunicado in a toilet at JKIA's Terminal 2. The lawyer says he is apprehensive that he will be abused, tortured and illegally removed from country in order to frustrate the orders of the court. "The government has refused to comply with court orders directing them to issue Miguna with travel documents to enable him re-enter and remain in the country," the petition reads. The Opposition politician was detained at the airport after he refused to board a Dubai-bound plane on Monday night. He arrived in the country at around 2.30pm from Canada but was denied entry for lack of a Kenyan passport. The government attempted to put him on the plane after a commotion ensued at the airport.
