Sarova Hotels, Resort & Game Lodges on Friday last week signed a contract with the McCarthy Family to manage boutique lodge, Spirit of the Masai Mara located in Masai Mara Game Reserve. The lodge has 10 spacious, air-conditioned luxury suites built on solid stone structures, which uniquely blend traditional materials with a contemporary design. Speaking while signing the agreement, Sarova Hotels managing director, Jimi Kariuki said that the company’s foray into the luxury boutique segment was in line with their strategy of offering a diverse guest experience. “Sarova Hotels is not a chain of hotels, but a collection of unique experiences spread across the country. Time has come for Sarova Hotels to expand the brand into the luxury and exclusive market. Sarova Stanley has for long stood out as a luxury 5-star property within the city and winning numerous continental and global awards. It is this strength and experience that we want to replicate in a luxury boutique lodge,” he said. Justin McCarthy, Spirit of the Masai Mara director said Sarova Hotels was the best partner in helping them showcase the property to international and domestic tourists due to their vast knowledge and expertise in the tourism industry both regionally and globally. “Sarova Hotels has a strong brand value as a home-grown hospitality group with nine properties across the country, and have managed to reach out to the global markets comprehensively based on the company’s 40-plus years’ experience. If you combine this with both our high level service provision to our guests we can only grow Spirit of the Masai Mara further,'' McCarthy said. Kariuki added that the inclusion of Spirit of the Masai Mara brings to two the number of Sarova Hotels in the game reserve, giving tourists more options when visiting the Mara.
