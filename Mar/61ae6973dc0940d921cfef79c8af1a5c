The Judiciary has launched a five-year programme to enhance access to justice for the poor and vulnerable. The Sh4 billion Programme for Legal Empowerment and Aid Delivery in Kenya will be funded by the European Union. It will be implemented by the Judiciary, United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. The project aims to create awareness on legal aid. It will help the Judiciary to strengthen court administration and case management through an effective case flow management system.

While the project will be rolled out countrywide, seven counties will be given special attention. They are Wajir, Mandera, Lamu, Tana River, Marsabit, Isiolo and Garrissa. Speaking during the launch at Crowne Plaza in Nairobi on Friday, Chief Justice David Maraga said the impact of the project will be felt by generations to come. He said it took four years of negotiations for the programme to be launched. Maraga said the Judiciary will continue to ask Parliament for more funds. “This is because government investment in the rule of law is not only in its recognition of an inherently good social value, but also an acknowledgement of the direct link between the rule of law, economic development and political stability,” Maraga said. EU Deputy Ambassador Bruno Pozzi said human rights, democracy and rule of law are inseparably connected.  Click here for the latest political news
