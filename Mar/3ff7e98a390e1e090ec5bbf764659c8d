Kirinyaga county has demanded perfection from contractors awarded tenders for the construction of 217 km roads in rural areas. They must adhere to standards, Deputy Governor Peter Ndambiri said during an inspection of Kimbimbi-Kanjiji-PI road in Mwea on Friday. "No one will be be paid for a job poorly done," he said, adding they must honour terms as the work is non a on-time fix. Residents of Kanjiji who spoke to the Star said the road has been in a pathetic state since the dry season due to dust and the rainy season due to mud. They complained that boda boda riders cannot transport them and thanked the county to helping. Ndambiri called on the resident engineer to supervise all road work and ensure standards are met. He noted the construction is in line with Mountain Cities Project sessional paper that seeks to make Kirinyaga a key investment county. The DG saidthe county lobbied, through Governor Anne Waiguru, for 300 kilometers of tarmac roads to be built in the county. The national government has agreed to tarmac the roads at Sh20 billion. Ndambiri asked leaders to work together for the sake of development as the season for active politics ended. "It is time for leaders to deliver on their pledges," he said. Waiguru and her rival Narck Kenya leader Martha Karua are still embroiled in an election petition at the Kerugoya High Court. Click here for the latest political news
