Not only do loggers have no respect for forests, but they also disrespected Founding Father Jomo Kenyatta when they felled a tree he planted almost 50 years ago. Lari Kirenga MCA Joseph Karichu on Saturday condemned timber traders and loggers for cutting down a tree planted by Kenyatta on September 10, 1969, at Nyambare trading centre. “Those who harvested the Uplands Forest portion at Nyambare made  a mistake because they cut down a tree planted by the founding father of the nation,” Karichu said.  Youth leader Robert Nyaga said harvesters also removed a  plaque where the tree once stood. “An important part of the history of this nation was erased,” he said. Karichu said loggers are endangering rivers that dry up.  He said Lari forest is the source of the rivers Kamiti and Ruiru and Ruiru dam. Without reforestation, their future is at risk, he said. Karichu distributed 12,000 seedlings and 3,000 avocado seedlings to residents. He urged people to plant trees at their homesteads.
