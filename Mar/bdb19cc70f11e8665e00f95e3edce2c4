In a video shared by Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria, Miguna earlier said he could not walk into the plane to London as he fell sick. He added that he was brutalised in Kenya but that he thought things would be different in Dubai. "This is an international airline and airport ... I know the rules ... I am following the rules ... I am sick... I am allowed to say if I am sick ... you cannot force me to walk if I cannot walk ..." he says in the video as his voice breaks.
