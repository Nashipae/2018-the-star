Some Nakuru MCAs yesterday rejected claims that there is a row between the assembly and executive over the Revenue Allocation Bill. Kabazi MCA Peter Mbae told the media leaders are working as a team to deliver services. Two weeks ago, efforts by MCAs to push for a Sh2 billion kitty failed after Governor Lee Kinyanjui declined to sign the bill. The governor returned the Revenue Allocation Bill 2018 to the assembly, explaining why he could not sign it. He said the county is financially strained due to a high wage bill and inherited Sh3 billion pending bills. Kinyanjui said the county’s annual wage bill about Sh6 billion while revenue collection has stagnated at Sh1.8 billion in the last two financial years. He said the bill would result in a deficit of Sh1.2 billion, thus, denying  the executive funds needed for   flagship projects. MCAs unanimously passed the bill in January. The bill was to be tabled in the house again yesterday for approval today before it is sent back to the governor. It provides for MCAs to get at least 25 per cent of the county’s annual development funds for projects in their wards. If the bill becomes law, each of the 55 wards in the 11 subcounties will allocated Sh20 million- Sh40 million in the next financial year. Mbae said MCAs have made the changes. The bill seeks to improve revenue collection. “We passed the bill and sent it to the governor, but he made some changes and recommendations and brought it back,” he said.
