Politicians want teachers in terror-prone areas transferred. Former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga wants the 2,760 non-local teachers working in Northeastern transferred until the al Shabaab threat is addressed. On Saturday, some of the teachers killed in Wajir were buried in Rungu village, Kabondo Kasipul. They are Seth Oluoch and his wife Caroline. The terrorists raided Qarsa Primary School on February 16, killing three teachers and injuring one. Magwanga wants the government to deploy more security personnel in Northeastern. He said the government pays more attention to minor issues while citizens are killed by al Shabaab. “I wish Interior CS Fred Matiang’i would be as swift in dealing with al Shabaab the way he is with Opposition supporters like lawyer Miguna Miguna and businessman Jimmy Wanjigi,” Magwanga said.
