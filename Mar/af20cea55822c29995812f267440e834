Top pests scientists from Kenya Agriculture and Livestock Organisation have been dispatched to Brazil to learn how to deal with Fall Armyworm. The worms are a leading pest in Kenya. They are responsible for huge losses incurred by farmers. Agriculture CAS Andrew Tuimur yesterday said the government has released Sh300 million to Kalro for research and purchase of pesticide. Maize farmers suffered huge losses last season as a result of the pest. Tuimur said Brazil has successfully dealt with the worm using technology. “Kalro needs similar capacity. It should provide the right chemical or biotechnology that will wipe out the menace in Kenya,” Tuimur said at Kabiyet town in Mosop.
