Budalang’i residents have been urged to adopt commercial farming to improve their lives. Former constituency manager Godfrey Obayi has said Budalang’i has not had floods for five years and residents should use the ongoing rains to grow crops and make the region food-secure. He spoke on Saturday in Bunyala North ward, where he distributed maize seeds and farm inputs to residents. Obayi said their land is fertile and arable, and can produce enough food for Busia and neighbouring counties. The politician praised former MP Ababu Namwamba now Foreign Affairs CAS, for supporting farmers.
