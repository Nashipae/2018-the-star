Out of the five people who were swept away by Enziu River in Mwingi Central, two survived by swimming across on Thursday. The fate of the other three is still unknown. The five were transporting charcoal to Nairobi in a lorry from Yatwa, Nuu division. Witness Kithome Musya said as the lorry was crossing it got stuck. As the five tried to push the vehicle out, the river flooded, carrying them away. “They jumped on top of the lorry, which did not help much as it overturned,” Musya said. Local divers said the water was too deep to look for the bodies or survivors. The heavy rains started on Wednesday night and continued until midday on Thursday.
