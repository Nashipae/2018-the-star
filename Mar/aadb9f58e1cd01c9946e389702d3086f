Several female celebrities have
decided to turn a new leaf and give their lives to Christ, and the
latest artiste to get saved is Amani, which is something she counts as
joy. In an interview with Word Is, she said: “There
was nothing particular that happened to me to be born again, but it's
just that I got tired. I would feel like I would be somewhere, sit down
at home without travelling like I used to do before being in a music
concert or even performing, then I asked myself what could be the
problem. "It's when I realised there was something I needed to change in
my life. I started searching why am I not feeling the same anymore, and
its when I realised that my heart was not there anymore." When
asked what drove her to take the righteous path, she said, "Well, it was
basically a personal decision to follow Christ. Two
years ago, I felt I am actually done with the whole industry and
basically my own life, and I felt yeah, I need to turn over a new leaf." She
went on, "I
decided to be quiet about it, for one because, once you get saved, the
transition is not overnight. You have to go through your old
transformation and get new habits and form new ones. I
also wanted to get to a point where I would be comfortable about
talking about it and a point where I felt like I had gotten to a new
lifestyle, though each day God is working on you with different stuff. So
when I felt I was comfortable talking about it, is when I did."
