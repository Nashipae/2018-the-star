Governor Kiraitu Muriungi is willing to improve partnership between Meru county and the Republic of Korea to promote agriculture. Kiraitu said his international networks help him get parnerships that will develop the county. He spoke on Thursday at stopovers when he and South Korean Ambassador Young Dae Kwon toured agriculture projects. The county boss said the partnership awareness mission aims to uplift the youth through equipping polytechnics. Youth skills help curb poverty and unemployment, Kiraitu said. Kwon visited farmer James Gitonga in Kiria, Imenti Central, before heading to the Nkubu open-air market. At Kaguru Agricultural Training Centre, Kwon told farmers to be diligent to boost their business.
