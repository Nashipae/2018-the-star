Ekeza Sacco, which shot to the limelight last year after claims of fraud, has assured members that their money is safe. In a statement on Tuesday, chairman David Kariuki said issues raised by the Commissioner for Co-operative Development had nothing to do with the money. He asked members to remain calm as they have "nothing to worry about". "Your money is safe and secure as this is a solvable administration issue and not that of financial misappropriation," Kariuki said. Ekeza's 26 offices across the country were shut down last Friday, Commissioner for Co-operative Development Mary Mungai saying it had failed to meet its objectives. As a result, about 8,000 members reported having invested Sh3 billion flocked its offices in several towns on Monday demanding the truth about their money. Kariuki assured that the society will not renounce its duty to safeguard members' funds. "We shall not abdicate our duty to customers. The Sacco is working closely with the [Trade ministry through the CCD] to ensure issues raised by the commission are exhaustively addressed," he said. The chairman maintained that Ekeza observed statutory requirements and by-laws and can, therefore, work with the commission to achieve its objectives.
