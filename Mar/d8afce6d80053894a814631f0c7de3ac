Kenya Forest Service chairman Peter Kinyua has called for a total ban on harvesting of Sandalwood. Kinyua said the overextraction of the tree will make the species extinct. The tree is highly valued for its essential oil used in the cosmetic industry. “There is need to have the extraction banned,”Kinyua said at the weekend during a working visit to Kitichi near Wamba in Samburu county. Suspects found engaging in illegal forest activities were nabbed. KFS and its partners have intensified patrols to combat illegal harvesting of indigenous trees in the forest. The trees are targeted by illegal loggers because of their high demand. The patrols follows a directive by Environment CS Keriako Tobiko. Sandalwood is listed under endangered species by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.
