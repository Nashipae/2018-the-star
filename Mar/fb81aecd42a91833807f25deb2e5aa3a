Job seekers should be wary of fake advertisements ahead of the 2019 population and housing census. Zachary Chege, director general of the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, announced on Tuesday that job vacancies being circulated on social media are not genuine. "All KNBS job advertisements are done through the daily newspapers, uploaded on the authority's website and a link sent to the official social media sites," he noted. "Our jobs are coordinated from the Human Resource Management and Development office in Nairobi." Chege further noted the recruitment processes is free and fair so it does not involve the exchange of money or favours of any kind. "The people behind the advert are fraudsters and conmen posing as employees of the bureau for selfish gains," he said. He asked the public to verify any details on reported vacancies at the bureau. The government has begun preparations for the Sh18.5 billion census which will be held in August.
