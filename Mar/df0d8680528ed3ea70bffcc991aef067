Acquiring a gun in Mt Elgon is as easy as buying popcorn from a confectionary shop. Investigations by the Star reveal that the region is dotted by agents who sell guns to residents for as low as Sh40,000. One can also hire a gun for an assignment, at an average of Sh10,000 a night. Bullets, on the other hand, fetch between Sh80 and Sh150. “There is no deficiency of bullets in this region. If you want 10,000 bullets, I can bring them to you within two hours,” a bullet merchant told the Star team. It is understood that the weapons reach Mt Elgon through the porous borders at Lwakhakha, Chepkube in Bungoma and Suam on the Trans Nzoia side. A spot within the Mt Elgon forest is also used to store guns sneaked into the country. West Pokot is also said to be a key source of guns and bullets, as well as those crossing over from Uganda. Experts say there were no guns in Mt Elgon until the 1980s when Uganda was undergoing political instability. That time, the Sebeis and Bagisu from Eastern Uganda would enter Kenya and steal cattle from the Sabaots. This forced Mt Elgon residents to arm themselves against the aggression from Uganda. It is during the instability in Uganda that Ndorobos, then the occupants of Mt Elgon forest, easily acquired guns from the Sebeis and the Bagisus. On the other hand, the Soys, occupying the lower parts of Mt Elgon, used the permeable Chepkube border point to buy guns from Uganda. Even with the security agencies’ operations and disarmament programme, residents say it is almost impossible to wipe out the guns in Mt Elgon. To them, the Sabaot cannot live without the weapons because of what life has taught them. Security agencies say it is difficult to disarm the Sabaots due to the fact that they hide most of their weapons in caves. “What we get in their houses during operations are just spears, arrows and bows,” a police officer based in Mt Elgon said.
