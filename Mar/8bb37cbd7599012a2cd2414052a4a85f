Prison authorities have been directed to present a man in a Sh633 million forgery case to the immigration department for identification and verification of his documents. Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi made the order after the court was told that the true identity of Madat Saburali is yet to be established. Saburali is facing the forgery charges alongside Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter and Arthur Sakwa. The three face multiple counts, including conspiracy to defraud the Central Bank of Kenya of Sh633 million in Treasury Bills. They have denied the charges. Yesterday, the prosecution said Saburali used a forged ID card and particulars to enter the country. Andayi ordered the officers to accompany the accused to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airportâ€™s immigration office. Keter has since been released on a Sh2 million cash bail. Saburali is yet to raise the amount. The were arrested on February 16 as they waited to meet CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge over the Treasury Bills. The CBK alleged the trio made a false claim for Treasury Bills numbers 1138 and 1148 bought in 1990. The hearing of the case will begin on June 4.
