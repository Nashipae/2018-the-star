Kitui county commissioner Samuel Kimiti on Sunday asked Kitui East MP Nimrod Mbai to avoid blame game and give information on police laxity for follow up. His area has been invaded by armed Somali herders. Kimiti admitted the situation was volatile since some of the herders were armed and said it required a security and diplomatic approach to be addressed. Mbai said security officers had been compromised and were reluctant to drive out the herders, thus leading loss of many lives. He called on Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to transfer them. Kimiti has ordered for frequent patrols.
