More
than 41,000 land title deeds have not been collected from the office of Land
Registry in Homa Bay County in the last two years. Homa
Bay County land registrar Violet Lamu, the registry received 82,000 title deeds
in 2016. Lamu
said Homa Bay residents only collected 42,000 land titles. The
registrar said absence of title deed has raised cases of land and boundary
disputes. She
claimed most people have taken advantage of lack of title deeds to encroach
private lands. “Disputes
have erupted in many areas over absence of title deeds. Most people take
advantage of absence of document of ownership of land to enslave poor people,” Lamu
said. Speaking
to journalists on Thursday in Homa Bay town , Lamu said high number of
uncollected land documents belong to the residents of  Suba North,
Suba South, Homa Bay Town, Rangwe and Ndhiwa sub-counties. “I
urge residents who applied for their title deeds to come and collect them at
our offices,” Lamu said. The
registrar lamented on the laxity of the residents from Suba North Sub County
which has the highest number of uncollected titles. She
called on opinion leaders to encourage residents to collect the land documents. “The
documents are very important. Elected leaders need to encourage residents to
collect the documents immediately,” she said.
