Gor Mahia have raised concerns over the change of date of their Caf Champions League return match against Esperance over what they termed as deliberate move to jeopardize their preparations. The match was initially scheduled for this Saturday but was pushed back to Sunday without consulting the Kenyan champions. With Gor already struggling financially, the change of date means Gor have to draft a new plan for their travel to Tunis for the return match. The club’s chief executive officer Lordvick Aduda termed the move as frustrating and expressed his dissatisfaction with the changes. “We got a communiqué from Football Kenya Federation (FKF) over the postponement of the match. We were never consulted or reached directly by either Caf or Esperance and this is a deliberate move to frustrate us. If Caf knew playing on Saturday was impossible, they would have communicated to us and Caf in time to allow us adequate preparations. Now we have to plan again for a Sunday’s clash which has already disorganised the progress we had made so far in preparations.” Gor face an uphill task of getting an away win or a high scoring draw which will guarantee them a place in the group stages. History favours the home side who have never lost to a Kenya team at home and their 0-0 draw in the first leg left them with a lighter job of getting a home win. Gor return to Stade Olympique de Rades, the same venue they suffered a blistering 5-0 defeat four years ago and will be seeking their first win over the Tunisian side. A repeat of the 1987 Mandela Cup 1-1 result reaped in Tunis will give K’ogalo the green light to the group stages which comes with a Sh50 million from Caf. Should Gor succumb to Tunisia, their continental journey, they have the option of playing in the Caf Confederations Cup. In 2014, the return match was deferred for 24 hours due to heavy rains which had rendered the Rades Stadium unplayable.
