Mandera county is facing an education crisis due to the exodus of non-local teachers fleeing terrorist attacks. Schools in the Northeastern region as a whole perform very poorly academically. Th flight sof teachers makes the situation worse. Speaking to the Star on phone yesterday, TSC county deputy director Ahmed Osman said 23 primary school teachers and 40 secondary school teachers have left since February. More have applied for transfers. “Many teachers have left and we have few local teachers,” he said. The worst-affected areas include Lafey, Mandera South and parts of Mandera East subcounty. The county has suffered several terrorist attacks by al Shabaab, who target non-locals, especially teachers. Three years ago teachers went on strike after 28 bus passengers traveling from Mandera to Nairobi were shot dead. In response, the government strengthened security and the TSC transferred tutors who refused to return. To fill the gap, form four leavers were hired to keep students in school. However, after least 100 teachers, transferred, no one will replace them. On February 16, two non-local teachers were killed alongside the wife of one of them in Qarsa Primary School in Wajir. Osman expressed alarm at the rate non-local teachers were leaving more secure areas such as Banisa, Rhamu and Takaba. Teachers in insecure areas were receiving counselling before being transferred.
