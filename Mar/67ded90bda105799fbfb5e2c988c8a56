Foreign and local investors in Malindi are pushing for the expansion of the Malindi International airport to pave way for directs flight from Europe but the government seems to be taking their time. Vice president Plan hotel Paolo Rosso said tourists are forced to spend many hours once they land at JKIA since all domestic flights operate in the morning making it difficult for foreign tourists to get connecting flights.  Tourism CS Najib Balala however, said that investors should upgrade their investments to attract investors and never wait for the government to implement projects as it does them at its pace.
