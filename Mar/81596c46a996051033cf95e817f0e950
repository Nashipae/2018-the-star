The Mombasa Water Supply and Sanitation Company on Friday denied reports that Jomvu residents have not received water for more than three months. Water kiosk operators have threatened to stop working because of the shortage. The firm’s business unit manager for West Mainland, Lydia Osewe, told the Star that water, though scarce, water has been reaching residents weekly. “Supply is less than demand and that is why we have a rationing programme. Jomvu residents get water on Mondays and Fridays,” Osewe said. Many residents interviewed told the Star said they receive water on their scheduled days. Water Kiosk Operators Association chair Gabriel Amok said they want an overhaul of personnel in charge of water services in the county. “They have failed. Even after initiating various projects, the water crisis has not ended,” Amok said. However, Osewe and county executive in charge of Water Fatma Awale said they are working to ensure all Mombasa residents get sufficient water.
