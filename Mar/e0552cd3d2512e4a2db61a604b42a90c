Adopting healthy lifestyles saves lives and money by preventing heart diseases, Karen Hospital has reminded Kenyans following its heart run on Saturday. Dr Dan Gikonyo, who is Heart to Heart Foundation trustee, noted the cost of heart operations ranges from Sh350,000 to Sh1.3million. "It is still expensive for many families ... the best remedy is to adopt healthy lifestyles," he said at Uhuru Gardens where thousands gathered to participate in the race. The doctor advised against smoking, noting it remains one of the main causes of many heart diseases. He asked the public to drop this and other risky habits, exercise and eat healthy foods. At least 10,000 participants registered for the 25th edition of the run. Last year, over Sh10 million was raised and 12 people helped. Overall, more than 450 people have benefited from open heart surgeries, Gikonyo reported.
