Auditor General Edward Ouko has questioned confidential
expenditure in the Presidency amounting to Sh1.2 billion for the last financial year. This is a tidy sum from the public purse. Among others, the auditor complains about “confidential
expenditure incurred on motor vehicles” in tens of millions of shillings. This is abnormal and raises very serious probity questions in the usage of public resources at the pinnacle of the Executive. It is not the first time. While a case can be made for the Presidency to operate a
discretionary fund to be spent on exigencies of the office in the public interest, information on such expenditure must be accessible to the
public. There is no provision under the Constitution for the Office of the President, or State House, to run a secret and unaccounted-for
fund. Secretive expenditure is excusable for the Military and the
National Intelligence Service – and only in extraordinary circumstances such as
flashpoints in the war on terror. Nothing that goes on at State House or the ODP should fall
under the “cannot be made public” blanket. That's a cover for slush funds for partisan political purposes unauthorised by law. In view of the recent High Court ruling on auditing of defence expenditure, this too must be de-classifed and addressed as part of reforms to ensure transparency in the public finance sector management.
