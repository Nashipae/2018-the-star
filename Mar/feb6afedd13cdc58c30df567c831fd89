Trans Nzoia officials have admitted that the report ranking the county as the second-most corrupt is accurate. Deputy Governor Stanley Tarus on Wednesday said the county will make a raft of changes in order to stem graft. The corruption report released by EACC chair Eliud Wabukala revealed that Murang'a topped the list followed by Trans Nzoia.

We promise to make several changes that will see corrupt officers prosecuted." "We have put in place measures to curb this vice especially on roads health and procurement sectors," the deputy governor said. Speaker Joshua Werunga absolved the current assembly of corruption claims saying the report concerned the previous government which he was not a party to. Werunga said MCAs are ready to work together with the Executive in dealing with corrupt officers. MCAs Eric Wafula and Jeremiah Wakhulia appealed to the EACC to also intervene in the county's Lands department. They raised a concern of massive corruption in the lands sector as cartels that have infiltrated the department. "We are appealing to the EACC to also carry out an analysis of grabbed land in Trans Nzoia so that we can together fight this vice," Wafula said.
