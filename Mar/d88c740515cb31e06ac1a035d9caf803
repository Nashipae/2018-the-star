About 1,435 squatters in Ontulili, Meru county, want to be settled on land they say they were given by founding President Jomo Kenyatta in 1977.
They allege the 2,400 acres was taken by then Lands minister Jackson Angaine. They spoke on Friday when the Parliamentary Committee on Land heard their grievances.
The committee was led by chairperson Rachael Nyamai.
But Mugambi Angaine, the son of the late minister, dismissed the allegations as “mere politics”. He challenged the squatters to produce the allotment letter of the land they say the former President gave them.
“Their case was dismissed in court because they lacked documents to support their claim,” Mugambi told the Star on the phone.
He said they have no documents to show they own the land.
