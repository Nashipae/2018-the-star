Star newspaper journalist Joseph Jamenya on Monday embarked on the final stretch of his 400km run to raise funds for a cardiac centre in his native Vihiga County. He plans to raise Sh60 million and create awareness of the rising number of cases of heart conditions in the country. He has already covered 200km of the run that is expected to end on April 15 in Nairobi. “I’m about to be flagged off by Nakuru Deputy Governor. Am doing a run to raise money to set up a cardiac centre at Vihiga referral hospital. This will be county number 3 after Vihiga and Kericho. I have already done over 200km...Am on my way to Nairobi,” Jamenya said.

Two months later, his mother was diagnosed with a heart condition. The run was launched on March 5 at the Vihiga County Referral Hospital in Mbale. It is named #JJ heart run with the theme 'Your heart your life'. According to the World Health Organization, Kenya is among the low-and-middle-income countries where nearly three-quarters of all deaths from noncommunicable diseases occur. The global deaths - 28 million - from cancers, diabetes and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases are related to poverty and lack of detection and treatment. Jamenya hopes that his initiative will help reduce the deaths in Kenya by sensitizing Kenyans to go for early checkup.
