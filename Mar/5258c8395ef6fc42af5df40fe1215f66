Nazma Abbas, a 22-year-old woman, was crowned the new Miss Tourism Kenya, Lamu county, on Sunday. Hundreds of locals and tourists turned up at the hotel to witness the contest. Nazma becomes the first Muslim woman from the Bajuni community to participate in and win the title since the pageant was introduced in Lamu a few years ago. The event was aimed at promoting the tourism sector that has seen hotels and businesses close doors due to insecurity. County Tourism executive Dismas Mwasambu said the event was focused on cultivating cohesion among various communities. Nazma pledged to use her position to promote the tourism sector.
