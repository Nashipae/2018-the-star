The Sh800 million mall in Kiambu town will adhere to a recently passed motion requiring that 70 per cent of jobs be reserved for the dominant community in the county. Kiambu Mall chairman Peter Burugu yesterday said they will employ residents, with priority on youths and women. “I believe in empowering our young people. We are asking them to apply for jobs in the mall. We will employ according to merit and skills,” Burugu said during the launch. MCAs unanimously passed the law, which compels companies to reserve the majority of job opportunities for the dominant community. The motion was sponsored by Miajority leader Anthony Ikonya. He said investors had sidelined locals by outsourcing labour. “It is why unemployment rates are high. The law we passed was not to arm-twist the investors, but to ensure our people get jobs,” Ikonya said. Burugu said he believed in devolution because it gives the private sector a chance to develop the counties and create jobs. The mall is expected to change Kiambu Town’s outlook and open up more business opportunities. “Kiambu Town has no malls, yet it has a big population. Most residents prefer to shop in Nairobi, where they can easily access everything under one roof,” Burugu said. There is a lot of development coming up in Kiambu, especially in real estate. “We want to provide a shopping convenience for residents in the estates,” Burugu said. The Kiambu Mall will also house Optica, Java, Nairobi Hospital, Ashleys, Vivo Energy and the Commercial Bank of Africa, among others.
