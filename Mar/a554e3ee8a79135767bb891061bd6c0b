Mathematics teachers have been urged to be creative to make the subject interesting to students. Allidina Visram High School principal Juma Mshimu said teachers are partly to blame for the poor performance in Mathematics. He said the only way to help students develop interest in the subject is to make it more fun and appealing to learners. “Teachers definitely have some responsibility to take,” Mshimu said on Saturday. He spoke during the 2018 Annual Brookside Mathlete Series at the school.  About 2,000 students attended this year’s event. Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology don Dickson Owiti said Mathematis is the heartbeat of economic development. “No country can develop without emphasis on science, technology, engineering and Mathematics,” Owiti said. Strathmore University admissions services manager Fenuel Kalulu said 90 per cent of all course clusters have Maths as a core subject. “You find someone has an A plain but scored a B- in Math disqualified for some courses,” Kalulu said. Brookside Dairy chief operating officer Faiz Taib on Friday said their partnership with Strathmore University in promoting Mathematics has been successful. The stakeholders said although students are increasingly getting better in the subject ever since the Brookside Mathlete Competition was established in 2003, more still needs to be done. “We are seeing significant improvement in the mean score of Maths in different schools,” Taib said. Taib said the company spends Sh13.8 million on scholarships every year, with two students sponsored for degree, 34 for diplomas and 32 in secondary schools. On Friday, Strathmore University presented a Sh1.2 million scholarship cheque to Khulud Mahmood, the top girl in the 2017 Mathlete from Memon Academy High School.
