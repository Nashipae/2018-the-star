132 suspects were on Sunday arrested with fake KDF admission letters at the Moi Barracks Recruits Training College (RTC) in Eldoret. Brigadier Martin Ong'oi who is Chief of Personnel at KDF said the suspects had presented the fake letters on arrival at the college. "The letters cannot be authoritatively confirmed to have been issued by the KDF and we have handed the owners of the letters to the civil police to carry out investigations," Ong'oi said.

"When we started the recruitment on March 12 it was made clear that the recruitment is free and no corruption would be allowed," he said. He said hundreds of people had been conned of millions of shillings paid to conmen who gave out the fake recruitment letters. Brigadier Ong'oi said many more letters were still in circulation and the public should be aware of the fake documents which are not from KDF. He said they had talked to those who produced the letters and they confirmed to have paid out money to some individuals. He said last year the fake letters were about 65 and it appeared the conmen involved were increasing. "We are going on with the admission and only genuine calling letters will be accepted," he said. The suspects were handed over to the police and taken to the Eldoret police station Last week Police in Eldoret arrested two men who were found masquerading as KDF officers involved in military recruitment.
