NASA co-principals Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi, and Moses Wetang'ula have asserted they were not aware of the Friday meeting between the President and Opposition leader. In a statement which followed Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga's meeting at Harambee House, they said the four principals will proceed for a retreat on Monday to discuss the development. They said: "While we have always advocated for dialogue as co-principals of the NASA coalition, we were not privy to the discussions at Harambee House." The NASA leaders said they only learned of the talks between the two top politicians through the media. The coalition comprises of four parties namely Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), Wiper Democratic Movement-Kenya (WDM-K), Amani National Congress (ANC), and Ford Kenya. Uhuru and Raila issued a joint statement after their meeting whose planning was kept confidential until the last minute. They came out laughing and seemingly happy with the outcome of their discussions. The two referred to each other as 'brother' and told Kenyans of their resolve to quash their differences and heal Kenya.
