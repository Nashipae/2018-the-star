Three Mt Elgon chiefs have been fired as the state steps up eviction of residents from government land and forest reserves. Benson Chemorion (Masaek), Thomas Satia (Emia) and David Ndiwa (Kubura) were sent packing on Tuesday. They are accused of colluding with criminals behind the killings in the region and sabotaging government efforts to restore normalcy. Assistant county commissioner Wesley Koech said the three had been sent on compulsory leave and replaced immediately, pending investigations. "We have launched investigations into some grave allegations touching on their conduct raised by residents," he said. Residents have accused government officials of colluding with criminals and leasing government land irregularly . This came up during the visit by Interior CS Fred Matiang'i two weeks ago, when he declared a dusk-to-dawn 90-day curfew. A human rights report early this month said most former provincial administrators colluded in the allocation of land in the Chepyuk settlement scheme . Matiang'i ordered residents out of all government land.
