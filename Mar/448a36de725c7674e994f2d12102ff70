Eleven Meru musicians want their freedom of expression protected, saying their songs are unfairly misconstrued as hate speech. They have appealed for the release of Man Kinyua, who was arrested at
Igoji, Imenti South, last Wednesday and whose whereabouts are unknown. The artistes, who spoke in Nteere Park, Meru town, last Thursday, criticised the arrest of the legendary Kimeru Benga artist. Man Kinyua was arrested from an NHIF roadshow truck and reportedly taken to Buruburu police station. The musicians said they had been in communication with Man Kinyua up until Thursday, when he stopped picking calls. MC Laing'o and Nut Mwalimu said they suspect Man Kinyua's arrest was instigated by a politician who did not like a song called Mama Kiwinya, in which the artist calls out the politician over social issues. "We
don't support hate speech and all indecent songs that are against the
law should be banned. But why was he arrested? Where is he? Why was he
taken all the way to Nairobi, whereas we have police and courts in Meru?
We demand to know the circumstances of his arrest," MC Lango said. "We
appeal for his release." The musicians said artistic
talents should be nurtured instead of their zeal and creativity getting
murdered. They said everyone has a constitutional right to express
themselves. "They can do it through speech, cartoons, songs, poems or other musical lyrics," they said.
