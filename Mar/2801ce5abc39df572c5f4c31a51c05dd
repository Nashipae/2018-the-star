In
a statement, Tobiko directed the Kenya Forest Service chairman
and the Chief Conservator of Forests to also replace officers
deployed at Oloolua, Thogoto and assign suitable teams. He said the officers have a responsibility to ensure the forests are protected, not destroyed. “Due
to the massive destruction of forest resources, a new team has to come
in place. These are officers who were in charge of the forests and
there responsibility was to ensure it is protected. But look at what
has happened. It is either they are complicit or incompetent,” he said. Read: State sets up taskforce on illegal logging Read: 90-day ban on logging not PR stunt, says DP Ruto The
CS also directed the immediate suspension of the Plantation
Establishment and Livelihood Implementation Scheme within the
same forest stations – Kibiku, Oloolua, Thogoto and Ngong Road – pending
an independent status assessment. Deforestation,
degradation and encroachment of water towers and other catchment
areas, coupled with uncontrolled human activities, including wanton
logging, have threatened and undermined the country’s capability to
ensure food security. The destruction has also resulted in water
crises. Last month, Deputy President William Ruto imposed a 90-day ban on timber harvesting in all public and community forests. Ruto directed the Environment ministry and all other relevant authorities to jointly take prompt and decisive actions to enforce the order. "This is to allow reassessment and rationalisation of the entire forest sector in Kenya," he said.  Click here for the latest political news
