Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has hinted at a merger plan with Baringo Senator Gideon Moi in his push for the Presidency in 2022. Mutua, the Maendeleo Chap Chap leader, said they have had conclusive talks with Gideon, Kanu national leader. “We agreed that ‘mbele iko sawa’ (the front is okay),” Mutua said. If their pact holds, the two will face Deputy President William Ruto who is eyeing the coveted top seat. Mutua addressed residents at the homecoming party of Baringo Central MP Joshua Kandie at Kapsogo on Saturday. He read out a message from Senator Moi, assuring the people that his ailing father, former president Daniel Toroitich Arap Moi, who was flown to Israel last week, is responding well to treatment. Mutua said Gideon apologised for his absence, saying he had accompanied mzee to Israel. Mutua’s merger statement with Senator Moi has raised questions as Gideon himself has declared he is interested in the presidency in 2022. However, Jubilee leaders at the event urged Mutua to drop his bid and support Ruto. “Ruto should be supported by all Kenyans. I am sure he will win,” said Ainabkoi MP William Chepkut. Mutua said it is time Kenyans were treated to something other than hereditary politics. He was backed by MP Kandie, his Tiaty counterpart William Kamket and Baringo Woman Representative Gladwell Cheruiyot.
