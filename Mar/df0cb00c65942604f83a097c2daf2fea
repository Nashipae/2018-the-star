Wajir politicians are preparing for by-elections following the overturning of Governor Mohamed Abdi's victory and that of Wajir West MP Ahmed Kolosh Mohamed. In Northeastern, clan dynamics and elders influence play a big role in elections. Kolosh, who is from the same area as former governor Ahmed Abdullahi,is trying to consolidate his support and the two aim to canvass for votes of the largest custer clan in Wajir, the Mataan Kolosh of ODM is facing stiff competition from Jubilee Party. â€œWe will form a strong axis to ensure Kolosh does not reclaim the seat," Abdijabar Mohamed, Wajir West Jubilee coordinator, said. Last week, Justice Francis Tuiyot invalidated Kolosh's election citing manipulation of results in two polling stations Qara and Korich in favour of Kolosh. Governor Mohamed lost his seat after the election court declared his victory as null and void. He however swiftly moved to the Court of Appeal which issued stay orders until the case is determined.
