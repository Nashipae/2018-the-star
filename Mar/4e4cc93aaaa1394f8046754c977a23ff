The Nyeri county government, in collaboration with the national government, has distributed more than 18 tonnes of certified potato seed worth Sh54 million to farmers. The seeds are meant to be planted this rainy season. Flagging off of the seed outside his offices in Nyeri town yesterday, Governor Mutahi Kahiga said the potatoes will be given to famers’ groups in Kieni constituency. The county government will buy 25 more tonnes. The county needs about 50 tonnes of potato seed. “We are targeting a maximum harvest of about 60 to 80 bags per acre,” Kahiga said. The county government will set up a potato storage facility in Kiambogo and Kiawara, both in Kieni, to help farmers store their crop until prices improve. Kahiga urged residents to harvest rainwater for irrigation.
