Former Laikipia North MP Mathew Lempurkel will spend his Thursday night in police custody following his arrest for incitement to violence. The court freed the former lawmaker on Sh250,000 bond or Sh100,000 cash after denying incitement to violence charges. However, the court registry had closed by 6.30pm when he was released. He was arraigned before senior resident magistrate Evanson Ngigi where he pleaded not guilty to incitement to violence. The former ODM legislator is accused of inciting members of the Pokot and Samburu communities by asking them to "unite and revenge on the disappearance of people in the hands of police". According to the prosecution, the ex-MP committed the offence on March 6 at Mowarak area and Posta in Laikipia North constituency.

However, Ngigi dismissed the application pointing out that the prosecution had not given convincing reasons why the accused should not be released on bond. Lempurkel had also filed an application to stop him from taking a plea to the charges arguing that he had been held in police cells for more than 24 hours since his arrest. He was moved to Rumuruti, Ngâ€™arua, Marmanet, Subukia, and Nanyuki police stations after his arrest. His lawyer William Bonwonga had asked the court to first order for investigations as to why he had been moved to all these stations before he could be arraigned in Nanyuki. He also questioned why the politician was brought to court at 5pm, terming the move by police as political persecution. However, the court allowed the prosecution to prefer the charges against the former MP and advised him to proceed to the High Court to challenge the ruling. The case will be heard on May 30.
