There are 1,300 Kenyans serving jail terms in other countries and more than 2,000 foreigners in ours, Foreign Affairs CS Monica Juma has said. Out of the number, 47 are in Uganda, 79 in Tanzania and 15 in Ethiopia. "There is nothing unusual about Kenyans being in foreign jails particularly if processed following due process,' Juma said when she addressed media on Thursday.

"Our Kenyan embassies are providing consular services to all the 1300 inmates," she said. Juma said Kenya has engaged in intense negotiations with Saudi Arabia in terms of safety of our citizens. "We have signed labour agreement that protects our citizens," she said. In regards to human trafficking, the CS said it is true EAC has been vulnerable to transit in human trafficking. It is estimated 500 million people are trafficked by criminal networks across the World.

"The border one will also help the never-ending wrangles between Kenyan and Ugandan traders," Juma said.
