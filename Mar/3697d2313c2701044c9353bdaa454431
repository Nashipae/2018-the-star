An Indian investor is counting losses of more than Sh1.5 million after fire destroyed his 10 acre tree plantation in Kakuyuni, Malindi county. The fire is suspected to have broken out from a neighboring farm after a labourer burnt cashew nut trees on Sunday afternoon,. Devshi Naran (pictured), the owner of the plantation, said the fire spread very fast and burnt almost all the trees planted since 1995. Naran took journalists round the farm on Wednesday and sadly narrated how he had invested heavily in the plantation. “I was about to sell the farm to a private developer with all the trees at Sh10 million, but now it will be difficult,’’ he said.
