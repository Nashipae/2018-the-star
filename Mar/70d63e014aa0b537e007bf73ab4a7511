A number of counties have informed their workers of delayed salaries for the month of February following cash troubles. Staff in Kericho, Taita Taveta, Kilifi, and Busia counties were on varied dates since last Wednesday, told that their salaries will be paid late. In a notice, Busia Health chief officer told members of the department that the delays have been occasioned by cash flow problems at the National Treasury across all counties. Asoka Itur said: "The same will be paid as soon as possible...thank you for your patience and understanding." For the case of Kilifi, workers were informed that delays in remittance of equitable share of funds will see them paid at a later date. Finance chief officer Benjamin Chilumo told chief officers of the various departments that they are working to ensure staffs are paid by early next week. "Kindly advise your staff to be patient as we follow up with the National Treasury...the county regrets the delay, the first since the inception of this county government," the notice reads. Taita Taveta acting county secretary Mghanga Mwanyasi told the county employees that the salaries will be processed and released immediately the funds are wired to the devolved unit's accounts. "In this regard, I request you to bear with us and we highly regret any inconveniences caused," Mwanyasi in the March 1 letter to county executive committee members (CECs). Joel Kibet, Kericho county secretary, citing the same reasons, told the county staff that the county has no cash for their salaries. The cases follow in the wake of National Treasury CS Henry Rotich's admission that the government is broke, hence unable to meet its financial obligations. Due to the cash crunch, government institutions have been asked to cut down wastage
and improve efficiency in the use of money allocated to them. More on this: We have run out of cash, Rotich admits Also see: Treasuryâ€™s collection falls Sh52.6 billion below mark Click here for the latest political news
