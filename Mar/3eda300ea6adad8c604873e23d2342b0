The National Assembly yesterday unanimously approved the appointment of Kennedy Ogeto as Solicitor General. Majority leader Aden Duale described Ogeto as a competent lawyer. “I interacted with Ogeto at the International Criminal Court, where he was representing our leaders," he said. "Ogeto is a very refined, decent and seasoned lawyer. I urge this House to support this nominee.” Uhuru removed his key ally and long-time aide Njee Muturi from the powerful State Law Office, where he was the accounting officer. He appointed him Deputy Chief of Staff and replaced him with Ogeto. During his vetting last week, Ogeto said he will push for law amendments, through Parliament, to have top government agency bosses charged for failure to provide information to the Attorney General on legal matters.
