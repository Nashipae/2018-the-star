Some previous MPs at the Coast celebrated the death of former kingpin Karisa Maitha, former Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung’aro has alleged. Mung’aro, who is now the Lands Chief Administrative Secretary, said this shows Coast leaders are their own enemies and this has affected the development of the region. He spoke at the burial of Karisa’s third wife, Alice, at his Mzambarauni home in Kilifi county on Saturday. Mung'aru said the same Coast leaders, including cabinet secretaries at the time, who agreed to chart an independent political way forward for the region during the 2013 Dabaso declaration are the same ones who fought him tooth and nail the next day. “That is the same reason just one and a half months before the late (Karisa Maitha) went to Germany and died, those who predicted his death were Coast MPs. Or don’t you remember?” Mung’aro said. “The enemies of Coast people are Coast people themselves,” he said, noting that the area leaders never cease the opportunity given to them to unite. He said when he was fighting for a position in government after he failed to oust Amason Kingi as the Kilifi governor in the August 2017 general elections, ODM MPs from the region went to President Uhuru to try and talk him out of appointing him to the government. “You are in ODM, I am in Jubilee, why do you go to Jubilee to tell them I should not get any position?” Munga’ro said. The Lands CAS said the region will only develop when leaders stop witch-hunting and work together. He said he will work to ensure the region develops as much as possible. “The Jubilee government has set aside some money for the development of infrastructure in the Coast,” Mung’aro said. To depict the unappreciative nature of the Coast people, he recalled an area in Kadzinuni in his own constituency where he gave out over 1,800 title deeds three days to elections but still got only 50 votes there.
