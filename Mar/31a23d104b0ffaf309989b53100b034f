Hotel bookings at the Coast are on the rise as Easter draws closer. Pride Inn Paradise Hotel, a Sh3 billion facility north of Mombasa, is currently operating at 67 per cent bed occupancy. Managing director Hasnain Noorani yesterday said, “We expect by next week to have surpassed 85 per cent bookings.” Pride Inn, which acquired Flamingo Beach Resort late last year, seeks to expand to 10 hotels. TERRORISM “We pumped in a lot of money into this hotel (Pride Inn Paradise) in 2013, at the time when investors were running away due to increased cases of terrorism. We are happy now the region has regained its lost glory and tourists are now flocking back to the region,” Noorani said. The hotel will host this year’s Skål World Congress which will bring together 1,000 tourism stakeholders from across the globe. Tour firms have registered good business as Kenyans book holidays.
