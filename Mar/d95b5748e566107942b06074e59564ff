Lugari MP Ayub Savula yesterday scoffed at the offer by Jubilee leaders in Western to rally behind DP William Ruto as his running mate in 2022. He said the community is focused on
the presidency and will field ANC leader Musalia
Mudavadi for president. “Luhyas are second in
population to Kikuyus. Kikuyus have been in power for over 30 years, and as the
second most populous community, we want to unite and take over power for at least 10 years," Savula said. He said attempts
by JP leaders in Western to push the "top-up mentality" for the community will
fail this time. Luhyas are estimated to
have 3 million registered voters, with 1.9 million in Western and another 1.1 million in the diaspora.
The community has, however, failed to present a united face during elections.
