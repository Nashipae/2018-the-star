Street vendors will soon breathe a sigh of relief if a proposed Bill protecting and recognising their trade is adopted as law. The Hawkers and Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street vending) Bill by MMC Africa Law was presented to the Senate yesterday. If adopted, it will ensure the formation of structures at county and national government levels to decriminalise hawking. This will be through dispute resolution mechanisms. MMC Africa Law team leader Edward Muriu said the proposed Bill will establish the Hawkers and Street Vendors Authority. The authorityâ€™s job will be to facilitate registration, regulation and monitoring of the trade by hawkers and street vendors in Kenya, oversee the functioning of County Vending Committees in the counties of Kenya, establish a national bureau and maintain a national registry of hawkers and street vendors. It will also oversee the establishment of county tribunals to hear appeals by hawkers and street vendors aggrieved by the decision of the county governments. The draft bill comes as residents complain about hawkers crowding the CBD. Once in operation, hawkers will enjoy rights to adequate facilities and compensation should their property be damaged. Muriu said the law will regulate the sector.
