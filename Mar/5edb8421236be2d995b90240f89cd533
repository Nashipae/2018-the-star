Another crackdown on illicit brews has been launched.The Multi-Agency Task Force on Illicit, Second Generation Brews, Drugs and Substance Abuse is cracking down. Nacada regional manager James Macharia yesterday said in Nyeri that they will restore order in the beer industry. He said they will cover about 25 counties, especially those in Central and Upper Eastern. “The products that will not meet the expected standards will be removed from the shelves,” he said. In July 2015, President Uhuru Kenya launched a war on “the business of death”, mainly in Central Kenya. “We targetted manufacturers and closed unlicensed outlets. Currently, we have only 42 manufacturers operating. We want to know if those that were closed have reopened again,” Macharia said.
