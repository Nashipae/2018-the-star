Murang'a woman representative Sabina Chege has denied knowing the conman who has been defrauding MPs. Chege on Friday said it is a shame that media outlets picked the wrong story and publicised it, soiling her name. She said media outlets that ran the story should have sought more clarification from the Department of Criminal Investigations. "If my name was mentioned, they should have sought to prove and contact the DCI for clarification," the MP said.

"This man is a known criminal and that is what I have been saying... then the media picked the story and said I know him," she added. The legislator said she fears for her life as the said criminal has not been arrested even after his identity was made known to security agents. Chege, who is the chair of the committee on health, said she is waiting for the DCI to follow up the matter and bring the criminal to book. "Those who said that I know him, only God can judge you," she said. The DCI on Thursday told the parliamentary security committee that the conman, who solicits money from MPs, has a close relationship with Chege. But Kinoti denied reports that he said Chege had a close relationship with the conman. Read: Man conning MPs is known to legislators - DCI Click here for the latest political stories
