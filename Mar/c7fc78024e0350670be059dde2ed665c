Five terror suspects who police say planned to attack the Milimani law court last month to rescue suspected radical Marsabit cleric Guyo Gorsa will remain in custody for 30 days. Senior principal magistrate Martha Mutuku yesterday allowed the Anti–Terrorism Police Unit to hold Abdimajit Adan, Mohammed Nane, John Maina, Antony Kitila, alias Rasta, and Lydia Nyawira pending investigations. Intelligence reports indicate the suspects had planned to launch an attack at the chief magistrate’s court on February 16, when Gorsa was scheduled to take plea. Two suspects were arrested at dawn in Merti, Isiolo county, while transporting a cache of weapons in a car embedded with improvised explosives. A suspect was shot during the arrest while two escaped. Police found five AK47 rifles and 36 loaded magazines, 36 unprimed hand grenades, 18 IEDs, three military knives, a black flag and other paraphernalia associated with al Shabaab. Prosecutor Dancun Ondimu told court of a well-choreographed plan meant to free Gurso, who is facing terror-related charges. When the Sheikh was arrested on January 13, youths who attended his madrassa burnt a police vehicle and vandalised a church and other business premises in Isiolo town. “Investigations so far show the suspects have been in constant communication with a number of well-known terrorists in Somalia”. “To safeguard integrity of the investigative process, the visit to various areas was not shared widely due to security reasons.” The lawyer said the suspect possesses the capacity and financial muscle that if freed, there is a likelihood of interfering with investigations. The court also heard that a tenancy agreement was recovered in a house within Rongai, where a search has since been conducted and more items, including two log books, recovered.
