Billions of shillings have been lost to unscrupulous traders masquerading as farmers, Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri has said. Speaking during a press briefing in Nairobi on Friday, Kiunjuri said the traders are benefiting from maize and fertiliser subsidies. Most are from Uganda and Tanzania, he said. “Our neighbouring countries are using the same seed varieties, thus making it difficult for us to differentiate our maize form theirs,” Kiunjuri said. “If we do not register our farmers, the country will lose billions of shillings in subsidies to farmers from elsewhere.” He said out of the 40 trucks delivering maize at the Nakuru National Cereals and Produce Board depot, only two had maize from genuine farmers. “The rest were from unscrupulous traders buying maize from Uganda at Sh2,100 and selling it to the NCPB at Sh3,200,” Kiunjuri said.

I have directed the cereals board to review transport rates for short distances to make the service competitive to transporters in order to ensure we facilitate deliveries.” Cartels have taken advantage of gaps in the vetting of farmers to access subsidised fertiliser and benefit from the maize buying programme. Kiunjuri said the government has started training staff in six counties for online registration of farmers before the next harvest. “We want farmers to form cooperatives so we can deliver fertiliser directly to them. We are appealing to them to cooperate in the registration process because it will enable us put proper systems in place to ensure prompt delivery of fertiliser and efficient receipt of maize,” the CS said. According to the NCPB, 900,000 bags of planting fertiliser have been distributed to farmers. The remaining 300,000 bags will be ready for collection by end of next week at a cost of Sh1,500 per bag.
