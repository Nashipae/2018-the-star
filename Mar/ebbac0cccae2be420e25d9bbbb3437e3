Kiambu county residents are being encouraged to walk more and use bicycles to reduce congestion and pollution in towns. The aim is to create more liveable towns and cities. The county has partnered with UN Habitat to educate residents about the importance of alternative means of transport. The programme ‘Placemaking’ was launched in Ruiru town on Thursday. Speaking during the launch, Roads executive John Mugwe said, “We advocate a healthier, safer, more inclusive and vibrant towns through safe, walkable and pedestrian-oriented streets in all towns. He said the county is educating residents that public spaces should be enjoyed by everyone. The programme is to be rolled out in other towns if it succeeds in Ruiru. Policymakers and urban planners will discuss how public spaces can be created, sustained and properly utilised. “We believe quality public spaces are an excellent way to improve the standards of urban life for all residents. We are committed to creating such spaces to reduce conflicts between motorists and other road users,” Mugwe said. WORKS IN NETHERLANDS It is hoped the programme will also reduce overall congestion in towns. UN Habitat head of Urban Mobility Unit Stefanie Holzwarth said the programme is designed to improve ease of movement within urban centres. “It’s a programme of its own kind. We are sure it will ease mobility just as it has in towns in towns in the Netherlands. Vehicles, motorcycles, bicycles and pedestrians will freely use the roads,” Holzwarth said.
