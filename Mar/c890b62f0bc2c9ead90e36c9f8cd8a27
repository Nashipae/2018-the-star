Tharaka Nithi dairy farmers and milk vendors have threatened a demonstration to the area's Kenya Dairy Board offices over harassment. They want employees of the board transferred as they have allegedly been demanding bribes in Kiracha, Kibugua, Njuri and Ikuu from milk sellers who use plastic jerricans. They further complained that their milk is confiscated for sale in Chuka town hotels and their plastic Jerricans given to friendly vendors and residents. "We have tried seeking peace in vain. They frustrate all our efforts," said John Njeru, a dairy farmer in Kiracha. The business people also claimed the board staff move around in a pick-ups and pretend to seize and pour milk that they claim is confiscated. They are notorious and inhumane, an unidentified vendor said, adding: "They can take 100 litres but pour only 10. Where do they take the rest of the milk?" The vendors said they had identified hotels in Chuka town that buy the confiscated milk at lower prices and that they will present the list to police for action to be taken. The business people also said they will turn to other means of livelihood if the board's top management does not transfer culpable workers. "We know the workers by their names and faces. We will tell the office to transfer them so we can work in peace," said Mercy Makena. They protesters however noted that they are willing to use recommended transport and storage tools but will need time to buy aluminium jerricans. But when contacted, board boss Eunice Nyaga said the allegations were fabricated. "That is propaganda ... it's untrue," she said on phone, adding that the workers pour milk that is mishandled, unfit for sale or dilute due to the addition of water. Nyaga added that the board will start taking dairy farmers and milk vendors found to have committed offences to court. "Let them complan. We will not only be destroying their jerricans and pouring their milk but also taking them to court." Click here for the latest political news
