The High Court has given Fred Matiangi, Joseph Boinnet an Gordon Kihalangwa one hour to appear for sentencing on contempt charges. The Interior Cabinet Secretary, Inspector General of Police and Immigration Principal Secretary did not go to court on Thursday morning as had been ordered. Justice George Odunga told their lawyers: "See if you can get hold of your clients. They should be here at quarter to midday [so we can] see if we can proceed with this issue." Odunga had asked State lawyers if they needed more time. "Can I give you one hour to see if your clients can comply with yesterday's orders? Can you bring your client in the next one hour?" But lawyer Charles Mutinda said he had been unable to get a hold of the three since Wednesday and that more time would not simplify the "hard task". "The most relevant client we can get is Kihalangwa. I may not be able to take on the others. I will not be able to reach them. I have not been able to reach them since yesterday," he said. Odunga interrupted saying: "The court gave orders yesterday and knew those it wanted here. The court will determine whether they are relevant or not." Opposition leader Raila Odinga went to the Milimani court in a show of support for deported lawyer and NRM leader Miguna Miguna Raila had been pictured with businessman Jimi Wanjigi and law professor Makau Mutua but he left shortly before proceedings into the sentencing.
