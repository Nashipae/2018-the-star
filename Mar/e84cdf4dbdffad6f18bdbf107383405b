A Zimbabwean court has ordered the government and head of police to pay more than $30,000 (Sh3 million) in reparations to farmers who were evicted to make way for Grace Mugabe's farm and game park. According to Deutsche Welle, the court ruled in favour who those were forcefully evicted from their lands to give way for the "Gracelands" project - as it was called by Zimbabweans. "The subsistence farmers' houses were demolished to make way for Grace Mugabe's development plans for the area," DW said. "She took over Mazowe dam and seized land for her personal farm and game park." Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights which represented the farmers said that the ruling could set a precedent. The victims' lawyer said they hope all judgements will be delivered by the end of March. "We expect the cited authorities to pay the damages as indicated by the court," the agency quotes Kumbirai Mafunda from the rights group. The group says its motivation in taking up the Grace Mugabe case "was to challenge impunity." "So that other actors are deterred from attempting such injustices," they say. Most of the affected farmers, DW reported, are living under tough conditions. Others said the ruling gives them hope to rebuild their homes. Click here for the latest political news
