The Fino attack in Mandera county where four AP police officers and police reservists were killed by al Shabaab militants could have been a revenge mission, regional county commissioner Mohamud Saleh has said. During the Friday 2am incident, about 50 heavily armed militants attacked the two camps on the border town of Fino, Lafey subcounty, before retreating to Somalia, five kilometres away. Those killed include four APs and a national police reservist. The confrontation lasted three hours.

Saleh said 40 al Shabaab militants and two of their senior commanders were killed on Tuesday during a KDF and Amisom operation in Fafadun, Gedo region, Somalia. Troops ran over the militants’ camp. “We suspect these ragtag militants were on a revenge mission following the heavy casualties they suffered in the hands of our troops,” Saleh said. “We have accounted for all our officers at the two camps of AP and regular police. We are pursuing the militants, some of whom sustained injuries following the heavy exchange of gun fire.” Saleh said the militants do not deserve free publicity because “that is what they yearn”.
