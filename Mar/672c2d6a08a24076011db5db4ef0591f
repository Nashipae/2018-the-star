Cholera has killed five people in Balambala subcounty. Health executive Ahmednathir Omar said on Friday that two people died in the Cholera Treatment Unit last week and another three succumbed in Saka between Wednesday and Thursday. Impassable roads has made it hard for workers to reach residents to determine the scale of the outbreak. “As we speak, we are stuck in the mud, with county assembly Health Committee members and officials on their our way to take equipment to assess and contain the spread of cholera,” he told the Star on the phone. The group included Health committee chairman Irshad Hilowle (Ijara), Hassan Ismail (Baraki) and Adan Abaile (Balambala). Twenty-four cases have been listed at the treatment unit since February 19. Three patients are still admitted while the rest have been discharged with a pack of soap, jerrycans, a bucket and water treatment chemicals. HYGIENE Omar said the county government has managed to contain the outbreak since it broke out in January by quarantining victims. Medical supplies and staff have been sent to Saka. The team has engaged imams and chiefs to teach residents about hygiene. “We are on the ground and monitoring the situation and continue to give updates on how it evolves. We are optimistic we will contain it as we did in other areas,” Omar said. There was a wave of cholera outbreaks in Garissa county last year and also in nine other counties.
