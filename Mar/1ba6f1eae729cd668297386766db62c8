Flying Squad officers impounded bhang worth Sh13 million in Nakuru town on ThursdayÂ morning. CID officer Joseph Koini said they acted on a tip-off from members of public, on a vehicle ferrying the bhang from Nairobi. They mounted a road block on Nakuru-Nairobi highway and flagged the driver down when he got there. "He didn't stop so the officers followed," Koini said, disclosing the Toyota NZE's registration as KBT 977R. The driver was pursued into Shabbab estate where the car broke down. He and a passenger escaped. The officers towed the car to the station where it was searched and 6,558 rolls of bhang [with that street value] found." Koini said they were following a crucial lead and assured the arrests of the criminals. Click here for the latest political news
