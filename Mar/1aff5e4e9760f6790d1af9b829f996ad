ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi would be the best candidate to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022,  political scientist Amukowa Anangwe has said. He said Mudavadi’s perceived weaknesses may be a blessing in disguise in his bid to be the next President. The NASA leader has the capacity to stabilise the country and end the current political and economic mess, he said. “His gentle mien, proverbial circumspection, respect for the rule of law and credible track record may be an antidote.”
