Miguna Miguna was on Wednesday night deported to Dubai despite a court order requiring that he be released and produced in court on Thursday. According to Rarieda MP Otiende Amolo, one of the lawyers representing Miguna, the latter was put on an Emirates EK 722 Dubai-bound flight at around 11pm. "So they have assaulted Lawyers, defied the court and deported Dr Miguna...I feel helpless and angry as an advocate! Useless as an MP and angry as a Kenyan!!!," Otiende tweeted. "Miguna Miguna is missing. The toilet Door at the JKIA Terminal 2 was broken and we have no idea where he is," lawyer Cliff Ombeta told the Star. Lawyers James Orengo, Nelson Havi, Ombeta, and Julie Soweto
were roughed up by GSU police officers when they attempted
to serve court orders at JKIA. They were blocked from serving the Immigration department with the order requiring them to release the self-declared NRMKe general.

The opposition lawyer refused to board a plane to Dubai where the Immigration department wanted to deport him as an undocumented person on Monday. Efforts by NASA leader Raila Odinga, Jimi Wanjigi, James Orengo, Nelson Havi and Cliff Ombeta to free him on that day bore no fruits. Justice George Odunga has convicted Interior CS Fred Matiang’i, Immigration PS
Gordon Kihalangwa, and IG Joseph Boinnet for contempt of court. This followed their defiance to produce Miguna in court for the
hearing of the matter where the lawyer wants the state compelled to
grant him entry. "Having considered the issues raised before me, the matter before me
is no longer a dispute between the parties but a matter of the court,"
Odunga said. Read: Matiang’i, Boinnet face jail after failing to produce Miguna Click here for the latest political news
