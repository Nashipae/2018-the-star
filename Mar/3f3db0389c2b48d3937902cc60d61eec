About 4,800 former employees have threatened to take legal action or petition the Senate over City Hall’s failure to remit pension deductions to the Local Authorities Pension Trust. This comes two weeks after Laptrust executive Hosea Kiili threatened to stop paying pensions due to a Sh13 billion debt owed by the county that has accumulated since 2013. Retirees including former Urban Renewal executive Tom Odongo, former chief valuer Gitonga Akotha, Margaret Jobita and Jenipher Nyagah on Thursday asked the County Assembly Public Accounts Committee to intervene. They appealed to the committee led by Wilfred Odalo to compel the county to start remitting the money. They will suffer if the scheme stops paying them, they said. LIVING IN MISERY “The situation is very bad. Some retirees may be dying as we speak, yet they worked for this county diligenty for more than 30 years. We are pleading with the county not to let our retirement be our death sentence. Some people can’t afford bus fare to this place,” Jobita said. Many retirees are already suffering, and any attempt to stop the pensions will only worsen their misery. About Sh6.6 billion of the total debt is principal outstanding while the remainder is interest and penalties. About 60 per cent of the Sh50 million Laptrust pays out every month goes to City Hall retirees. “The former administration paid us for a few months and then stopped. This administration has paid us for only two months in the six months it has been in office,” Kiili told the committee two weeks ago. At least 9,600 of the more than 13,000 employees of the county government are members of the scheme. The county is expected to remit Sh132 million per month to the scheme.
