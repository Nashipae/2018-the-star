Ugandan star Hanson Baliruno was in Kenya on a media tour to promote his new single Akatambala, features legendary Tanzanian star Saida Karoli. Speaking to Word Is, Hanson talked about meeting the Tanzanian artiste and what it was like working with her. "Initially the title of the song was not Akatambala. I wrote the song and sent it to her. When she came to Uganda we did it, but with another title. We remixed it because she noticed that I loved the title Akatambala. She wrote her part and I did my part. Akatambala means handkerchief. It is a traditional song. In other traditions, when a girl is being prepared for marriage, she is given different gifts, but [in] Saida's culture, they give her a 'katambaa'. So in the song she is telling the girl, here is a 'katambaa', use it, and always be with it on your person." The singer said working with Saida was so amazing because "she is a down-to-earth person. She is a person who loves performing and [is] very easy to operate with. She liked me as a person and had always wanted to see somewhere in music. I tried contacting her many times, but did not manage. When I heard that she was coming to Uganda that is when I met her." On his Kenyan collaborations Hanson said, "I am also working on how I can do some collabos with Kenyans like Sauti Sol, Nameless and even Victoria Kimani."
