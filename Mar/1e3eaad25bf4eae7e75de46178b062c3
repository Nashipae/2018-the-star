The high court has quashed the decision by KNEC to cancel the results of Chebuyusi High School. Justice George Odunga said the cancellation of the results was not done in accordance with the law. When the results were released last year, Chebuyusi was ranked 16 nationally and position one in Kakamega count.

The court has, however, given the examination body 14 days to investigate allegations of cheating and determine on whether they will cancel or uphold the results. Results of all the 190 students were cancelled among the 1,025 others countrywide over alleged cheating. Knec cited collusion in the Chemistry and Biology papers. The parents went to court to suspend the decision by Knec and the Ministry of Education. Through the period of 2017 KCSE examinations and the month during which the exams were marked, neither the school nor the students or parents were informed of any report on irregularity.
