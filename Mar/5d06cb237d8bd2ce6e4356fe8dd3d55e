An acute shortage of condoms has forced poor women to wash and reuse female condemns. This can hamper the war against HIV-Aids. Some residents of Kiandutu in Thika said they are washing condoms for reuse, owing to scarcity and financial constraints. Some said they can’t aford to buy new ones. “I have no money to buy a female condom. The cash I have can only buy unga and vegetables. I have no option, but to wash my condom several times and reuse it,” resident Martha Wangari said. She said she is not alone, as many women are doing the same because free condoms are not available. The female condoms are more expensive than men’s condoms. Speaking after distributing more than 10,000 condoms at Kiandutu slum, HIV-Aids crusader Stanley Ngara, popularly known as the King of Condoms, said the shortage is greatest in slums. He said the country might lose the gains made in disease prevention if the shortage persisted. Ngara said many people in slums engaged in risky behaviout and have multiple sexual partners They need regular distribution of condoms to prevent HIV infections. “In slums, young girls start having intercourse at very tender age because of financial constraints. Women are also forced into sexual relationships to get money for food and rent,” he said.
