The cast and crew of Watu Wote had high hopes of clinching an Oscar when they attended the 90th Oscar Awards in Los Angeles. Krysteen Savane, who is part of the cast, told Word Is: "We of course were nervous and excited at the same time. We had planned a very long Odi dance had we won, but we are extremely happy that we made it that far. It's a first for Kenya and we will still be in the race again. It's very possible." Kyrsteen said the biggest lesson is that "everything is possible. If you put your mind to it, you can get there. Staying focused. I think it's a wake-up call to the film industry in the country that it is actually really possible to make a film and get to the top level". "We need a lot of support from all the government bodies that represent film from beginning till the end. This opens loads of doors, and even investors would comfortably join the bandwagon. Film is serious business. It needs to be treated with the respect and seriousness it deserves," Krysteen added. 'Watu Wote' tells a short story about Northern Kenya and the war on terror. Though they did not win, Krysteen cherishes the experience she had going to the prestigious event. She looked glamorous during the ceremony. "I was dressed by Neomi Nganga. She is my hugest support system. She made me look so glamorous, I didn't even believe it was me. My earrings were from Own Your Culture, who are Kenyan, too."
