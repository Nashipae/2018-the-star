Kenyans will be enjoy some sunshine from tomorrow, the weatherman has said. The news come as a relief to Kenyans after at least 15 people were reported to have died, following heavy rains. The downpour has also left many families displaced and property destroyed. Kenya Meteorological Services director Peter Ambenje yesterday said there will be a decline in rainfall in many parts of the country starting tomorrow (Wednesday).

Ambenje, however, said Mandera county will receive heavy rains on Friday. The Mai Mahiu-Suswa road was cut-off last week after a volcanic fault dipped, according to the Kenya National Highway Authority. This led to heavy traffic jam that lasted for about four hours, but the authority was able to restore the flow of traffic to and from Narok. In a statement, Kenha said a team of contractors and engineers were permanently assigned to the site to monitor any developments that may occur as a result of the isostatic adjustment of the volcanic area, attributed to the fault line. “We have embarked on an immediate emergency exercise to restore the section using rock-fill. Motorists are requested to bear with the situation, which is expected to necessitate traffic interruption which may last up to four hours as the authority undertakes the exercise,” Kenha corporate communications officer Charles Njogu said. The Kenya Red Cross had issued safety tips for Kenyans to follow in case of floods. Also Read:Expect depressed rains starting late March, says weatherman
