The government will spend Sh10.2 billion in the next three years on TB, HIV-Aids and malaria programmes, Health CS Sicily Kariuki said yesterday. The money will complement funding from the Geneva-based Global Fund. “This is part of our sustainability strategy towards combating the diseases,” she said. The CS spoke during a meeting with MPs from France, Friends of the Global Fund Europe, who are in the country to assess programmes financed by the Fund. The Global Fund requires beneficiary countries to also allocate domestic resources in a co-financing agreement. Kariuki said in the last 15 years, 25 grants have been signed between the Global Fund and Kenya. “The support from the Global Fund and other partners over the last decade has enabled us to bring on board and maintain more than one million adults and children living on ARVs, distributed 15 million long-lasting insecticide treated nets and provided TB medicines to more than 900,000 patients,” Kariuki said. Last December, the Fund approved a Sh38 billion grant to Kenya to fight HIV, TB and malaria in four years. This was the largest allocation to any African country among the applications that were accepted last year. Of Kenya’s funding, the government will control Sh27.2 billion ($263 million), while the Kenya Red Cross Society will get Sh7.3 billion ($70 million). Amref will get Sh4.3 billion ($45 million). Some Sh32 billion of the total amount will go towards control of HIV and TB. The remainder will be used for malaria programmes. Treasury CS Henry Rotich said the support from the Global Fund has made services for HIV, TB and malaria provided to all Kenyans at no cost in all public health facilities.
