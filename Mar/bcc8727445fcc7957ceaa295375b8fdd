Mombasa county government has been criticised for failing to reign in cartels controlling the water sector. Water kiosk operators on Tuesday said a cartel has been colluding with Mombasa Water Supply and Sanitation Company and county officers to sell fresh water at exorbitant prices. He spoke hours after Water executive Fatma Awale told Mombasa residents to brace for tough dry times. Speaking to journalists in her office, she said the Mombasa water crisis would only be solved at the earliest in 2020. That’s when the county hopes to have installed desalination plants to take advantage of the sea water.
