The multi-agency team clamping down unlicensed alcoholic drinks has seized methanol and assorted counterfeited alcoholic drinks at a factory in Kasarani. The officials on Tuesday found forged KRA excise duty stamps and several alcoholic brands belonging to various manufacturers at the Julijo Investments Ltd's premises. The team was led by deputy county commissioner James Kamau. Kamau said the company resumed operations without getting government licenses to manufacture brews. The company had been closed earlier for non-compliance and had not obtained government licenses before reopening. "We went on a routine check of the company that had been ordered closed and found 200 litres of ethanol, assorted illegal products and counterfeit KRA exercise duty stamps." "We also found assorted products of illegal products belonging to different, manufacturing companies," Kamau said. Boniface Mbithi of Kebs quality control said: "We found very many substandard products at the premises. The manufacturer doesn't have an efficient system for testing quality of raw materials and the products from the same". The team is drawn from Kebs, Nacada, department of public health, anti-counterfeit agency, KRA, police and the office of the president. Three people were arrested during the swoop. Kamau said the suspects will be charged. The officials said police will secure the premises until the court visits to see the items listed as exhibits in the case against the owners and the three found inside the facility. Kamau warned any companies that could also be involved in this kind of vice, the multi-agency is very firm and that they will be apprehended for illegal activities.
