Activist Okiya Omtatah has been released unconditionally by a Nairobi court following his arrest on Thursday. In a ruling on Friday, Milimani Senior Principal Magistrate Martha Mutuku lifted the warrant that had been issued against him. This followed a request by his lawyer James Orengo (Siaya Senator) who said Omtatah did not skip court intentionally as he was at the High Court forÂ another matter. Orengo said it was unreasonable for Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi to issue the warrant yet the activist was within the court building. The prosecution did not object the application but asked the court to advise Omtatah to take the proceedings seriously. The case will be mentioned on March 22 for further directions to be given.
