Rick Ross, the “Biggest Boss”, has officially confirmed he is coming to Nairobi on April 28, through a video drop released this afternoon, quashing doubts of his performance in the country. The rapper called on all bosses to show up at the event. He said, “What’s up, Nairobi. This is the first time coming to Nairobi so this is a special event. The boss Rick Ross will be bossing up at the NRG Wave. It is time you get your tickets. It is going to be a party. It is going to be an event. It is going to be a festival.” Excitement over the Rick Ross #NRGWAVE concert is building up and with such an affordable fee, fans have no reason to miss partying with the boss. The American rapper is set to perform at Carnivore grounds, where fans will pay an entrance fee of only Sh3,000 per person, Sh10,000 for a group ticket of four people and Sh9,000 for VIP. These are some amazing, never-seen-before rates in the market that Kenyans are now warming up to and, for a long time, asked organisers to introduce. Gates open at 6pm and the event will go all the way until early morning, as revellers get to experience nothing but the best from Rick Ross, one of the best rappers America has to offer. He is best known for his hit songs “The Boss”, “Hustlin” “Push it”, and “Speeding”. In 2009, Ross founded the record label Maybach Music Group, on which he released his studio albums Deeper Than Rap ( 2009 ), Teflon Don ( 2010 ), God Forgives, I Don’t ( 2012 ), Mastermind, Hood Billionaire ( 2014 ), Black Market ( 2015 ), and Rather You Than Me ( 2017 ).
