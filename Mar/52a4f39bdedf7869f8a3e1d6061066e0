Three star hotel PrideInn Hotels has expressed dissatisfaction with the court of appeal decision requiring it to pay a disputed debt within 30 days or face liquidation. "We are very much shocked with the reasoning of one of the court of appeal judges claiming that any company can be liquidated at any time over a debt and hence exposing livelihoods of hundreds of employees and other stakeholders who depend on the business," said Hasnain Noorani, group MD in a statement. He said the minority decision by Justice Karanja who disagreed with her colleagues, stated clearly that liquidation should be a last result when a company is unable to pay its debt which has been the position in law. He added that the hotel has not been granted an opportunity to provide evidence disputing the debt in question and hence the liquidation process is seen as means of forcing payment of disputed debts. "We had issued a bank guarantee of Sh90 Million which is proof that money is available to pay should we not find any other solution to further appeal on the same. This clearly demonstrates our solid financial position and therefore our capacity to meet our obligations." Our next action that involves consultation with our legal team will be conducted within the next 30 days which is within the grace period granted by the Court of Appeal to clear the debt in dispute. We are strongly working towards our vision which is “To be the leading hospitality chain within East and Central Africa” by providing a “A global feel with Kenyan Soul”. Our immediate short term growth plan of establishing a further 10 hotels over the next 3 years is in process and we shall soon be announcing the same. We assure our staff and stakeholders that we remain financially sound and these developments will not affect our operations and mega plans lined up in the short and long term.
