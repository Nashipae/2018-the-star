Northern Kenya is caught in an ironic vicious cycle. The region bore the brunt of the recent drought. Locals lost livestock because of lack of water and pasture. But just when they thought they were coming to the end of the ordeal with the beginning of the rainy season, they are left reeling from the devastation caused by downpours. Loss of livestock continues — this time from flooding. They also suffer destruction of property. Floods, plant pests, animal disease outbreaks and droughts have become the new normal. Agriculture CAS Andrew Tuimur yesterday told the Star on the phone that young and emaciated livestock have been worst hit. “Some of them have either been washed away by the floods being experienced in parts of Northern Kenya. The heavy rains have delayed planting in parts of the North Rift,” he said. The weatherman last week said there would be heavy rains in Central, Western, Northeastern and Southastern regions. “The showers will be relatively heavier in Marsabit, Mandera and parts of Garissa and Wajir counties on diverse days,” a seven-day weather forecast stated. Tuimur said North Rift farmers should have planted from March 15. A new report by the Food and Agriculture Organization shows that farmers are losing billions of dollars each year from disasters such as drought and floods. The report released yesterday says between 2005-15, natural disasters cost the agricultural sector in developing countries a staggering Sh9.7 trillion in damaged or lost crops and livestock. Nation Drought Management Authority CEO James Oduor yesterday said the water situation in Isiolo, Kajiado, Garissa, Mandera and Tana River has improved. “Pasture will take at least a month to regenerate. Livestock have migrated in search of pasture due to the recent drought. Crops have yet to be planted. Intervention is still required,” he said in an interview.
