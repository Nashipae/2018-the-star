The Buildings Inspectorate has condemned more than 400
structures in Nairobi as unsafe for human occupation (see P2). Half of 2,260
buildings in Nairobi are in urgent need of inspection and drastic
action. Indeed, less than 900 buildings in the capital city are considered safe
for habitation. That is why we commend the county government and the National Construction
Authority (NCA) for the ongoing demolition of substandard
buildings in Zimmerman, Roysambu Constituency. The Chief Executive of NCA has informed the Star that close to 100 people
have been killed and more than 290 injured by debris from collapsing buildings nationwide in 2017-18. That's alarming enough to trigger radical action. We are also informed that a whopping 217 buildings need immediate action to prevent calamity. How did Nairobi come to this pretty pass and why should we wait for tragedy to strike? Unfortunately, intervention by relevant agencies is being hampered by unscrupulous
developers and landlords who have taken refuge in the courts over the years, using
every trick to delay demolition and other
corrective measures. These crooks have turned the construction and real estate sector into a sanctuary of corruption as tenants continue to pay for deathtraps - flats and apartments that have no facilities,Â  functioning drainage or reliable water supply. It is upon the Judiciary to immediately clear up this mess to save lives or it shall take responsibility for this impunity.
