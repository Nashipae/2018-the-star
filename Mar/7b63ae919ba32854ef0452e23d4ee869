In a statement on Thursday, IPOA head of communication Dennis Oketch said the authority has taken up the matter to establish the authenticity of the claims. Mary Wanjiru alleges that she was physically assaulted and locked up for three days by a police officer when she rejected his sexual overtures.

On investigation conclusion, the Authority will make recommendations and forward the investigation file to the ODPP for his attention,” Oketch said. Wanjiru had gone to the station on Saturday night to report an incident between her and her boyfriend. She told the court on Tuesday that the officer allegedly asked her whether she could have sex with him before being assisted. And when she rejected, she was allegedly beaten up and locked up in the cells for more than 24 hours. The court noted that she has visible injuries on her left thigh, buttocks, and a black eye. She also had a swollen leg. The Independent Oversight Policing Authority is mandated to investigate and recommend charges against police officers found culpable of abusing their position.
