The Court of Appeal on Thursday overturned the ruling which required two members of the Lesbian and Gay community to undergo an anal test. The test, which the office of the Director of Public Prosecution requested, was to ascertain whether the accused persons engaged in sexual activities. Judge Alnashir Visram set aside the High court decision saying it was unconstitutional and a violation of human rights. "The evidence cannot be allowed. I, therefore, allow the appeal and set aside the High court decision," Visram said in his judgement. In February 2016, Caleb Omar Idris and George Maina Njeri were charged at the Kwale magistrates court with engaging in homosexuality. In order to get evidence that the duo was involved in gay sex, the police sought to have them undergo the said anal test. However, they moved to the Mombasa High court to contest the production of the results as evidence. Judge Anyara Emukhule (Rtd) dismissed the application and allowed the test to proceed. His grounds were that the procedure and examination used to obtain evidence from the suspects was lawful and within the confines of the Constitution. Anyara further said the accused persons did not oppose the test adding that their lawyer had knowledge of the same. However, the duo registered their displeasure at the Court of Appeal where they challenged the legality of the anal examinations. They claimed that they were forcibly subjected to an anal examination by police and doctors at Msambweni District hospital four years ago. The judge said the the manner on which the evidence had been collected from them evidence amounted to rape.
