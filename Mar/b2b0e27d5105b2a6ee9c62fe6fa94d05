Three bloggers linked to the Kericho county government on Saturday were blindfolded, bundled into a vehicle and dumped in the bush. They were beaten up over unknown reasons. The three bloggers are popularly known as Team Infinix include Emanuel Kiptoo, Kiprotich Chepkwony and Maiyet Korir. The three were lured into a car parked at Saptet Guesthouse shortly before midnight on Saturday. They were having drinks with friends when six people asked them to meet outside. They founded themselves in hospital beds full of bandages. They declined to speak to the Star. One who managed to escape came back and helped them get to the hospital. The bloggers suspect a politician who may have been unhappy with social media articles they recently posted.
