Some candidates eyeing the vacant SRC commissioner positions were at pains to explain the commission’s key roles and their plans to help the government lower the ballooning wage bill. Fourteen candidates were vetted yesterday by the Senate Finance and Budget Committee chaired by Senator Mohamed Mohamud (Mandera). Some puzzled the panel after failing to express themselves well. This is despite most possessing higher academic qualifications, including master’s degrees. The term of the first commissioners ended in December. The academic qualification of Metha Kaburu from Tharaka Nithi, who has served in the public service as an accountant for 34 years, raised questions after the committee established he did not have a bachelor’s degree, despite possessing master’s and doctorate degrees. Candidate Cornelius Wanyonyi from Bungoma, who served at Harambee House and has BA in Political Science and MA in International Studies, had a hard time explaining the role of the SRC and its secretariat. He said, however, that he would end the standoff between the SRC and the counties on job evaluation and pay. Click here for the latest political news
