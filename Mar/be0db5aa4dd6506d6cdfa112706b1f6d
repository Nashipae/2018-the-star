Non-local teachers in Mandera have castigated their colleagues who fled the Northeastern region over insecurity and discrimination. Some 123 teachers fled after al Shabaab killed two of their colleagues in Qarsa Primary School in Wajir county on February 16. The private and public school tutors told the press yesterday that claims made by the teachers who left the region were unfounded. Ibnu Hajjir Integrated Academy principal Patrick Mwiti denied allegations that locals were discriminating non-locals in buses and in buying goods from shops at a hiked price compared to the natives. “I have been teaching in this school since 2011 and live barely 200m from the Somalia border, but have never had any mistreatment from the locals,” he said. “The fleeing teachers currently in Nairobi are only seeking transfers to areas near their homes and nothing more.” Mwiti said the school has 16 tutors, 12 non-local, whom he said are contented with the area and will serve the community with dedication. Joy Start Academy proprietor Debra Adala asked the over 700 non-local tutors in the region to solve their problems amicably without tarnishing the image of the local community. Her school has 20 teachers, only one a local. “Every region the world over has its own unique challenges which need to be addresses diligently without tarnishing anyone’s name,” she said. In Moi Girls, Border Point Secondary School and Komor Primary School, non-local teachers also make the majority of the tutors.
