A 32-year-old woman with triplets from Nguirubi village, Kiambu county, is appealing for help to buy powdered milk for her children. Monicah Wamaitha said she received a lot of gifts from friends after birth, but she now finds it difficult to sustain the babies’ needs. On Saturday, she said her children cry through the night because of hunger. “When babies don’t suckle to their satisfaction, they cry. I suspect mine lack milk. I don’t have enough money so I am unable to eat well and this makes me not produce enough milk,” Wamaitha said. The former housegirl now says she plans to introduce her boys to food at two months because breastfeeding for six months will be difficult. “I’m planning to feed them with food such as porridge, fruits, mashed bananas, potatoes and any other soft food. Many years ago, people used to be introduced to food when they were two months old,” Wamaitha said.
