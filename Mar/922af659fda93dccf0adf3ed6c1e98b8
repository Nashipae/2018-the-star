JSC has protested a decision by the National Assembly to subject Justice Mohamed Warsame to vetting before admitting him as a member of the body commission. In a letter to clerk Michael Sialai dated March 21, the Judicial Service Commission said the approval of Warsame by Parliament is unlawful, unconstitutional and undermines the independence of the Judiciary. The letter signed by JCS Secretary Anne Amadi said the Judicial Service Act, 2011, exempts judicial nominees to the commission from vetting because they represent a body whose members are lawyers. "The requirement for parliament approval is only in respect of persons appointed under article 171 (2)(h) of the Constitution and these are one woman and one man representing the public not being lawyers appointed by the president with the approval of the national assembly," Amadi said. Parliament ran a public notice in local dailies on Wednesday and Thursday inviting members of the public to submit memoranda on the suitability of the appointment of Justice Warsame as a member of the JCS. This was after the Court of Appeal re-elected the judge as their representative to the JSC with a majority vote. The Constitution requires that the JSC must consist of one judge of the Court of Appeal. According to the Judicial Service Act 2011, the President is supposed to confirm the appointment of a JSC nominee within three days of receiving the name without it going through parliament. "I have therefore been directed to inform you that Hon. Justice Mohamed Abdullahi Warsame will not subject himself to the process of approval by the National Assembly," Amadi said.
