The Tana River county government is facing an acute cash crunch following delay by the Treasury to release more than Sh2.3 billion. The county is unable to pay salaries and Sh1.5 billion to contractors and suppliers. Once funds are released, the county will remain with only Sh800 million after paying off the debt. Governor Dhadho Godhana says lack of cash has made it difficult for the county to serve residents and deliver election pledges. Speaking during the launch of the first dialogue conference in Hola on Tuesday, Godhana urged the NationalTreasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich to release the funds to enable county governments to function smoothly. Even though the national government failed to meet it revenue collection targets, its failures should not be shouldered by the county governments, he said. Godhana said it’s ironic that when the government collects more taxes than projected, it does not share with counties. Workers’ salaries have delayed and suppliers have not been paid for months. Godhana’s administration inherited the Sh1.5 billion debt. Godhana said the county lags behind because of poverty. The county is drafting an urbanisation plan to boost development.
