Education CS Amina Mohamed will name Moi Univerity's new Vice Chancellor next week, ending year's row over the position. Acting VC Laban Ayiro's tenure will end on Monday. Sources at the ministry told the Star that professor Isaac Kosgey will be appointed. Kosgey topped in interviews conducted last year amid claims that some panelists deliberately down-graded Ayiro to deny him the position. Ayiro came second but claims of bribery caused former Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i to put the appointment on hold. “Kosgey’s name will be gazetted this week so that he takes over as VC," said a senior official at the ministry. Amina,who was in Iten town on Friday, did not comment on the matter. Last week, the Universities Academic Staff Union asked the CS to make an appointment since most operations at the institution have been hampered. Jack Abok, who is Uasu chairman at the university, said Ayiro and other top managers had remained in acting capacities for long resulting in effectiveness. “It’s important that the university gets a new VC so that it can run its programmes with senior officials properly in office," he said. In September 2016, the row over the VC position at the university took a political angle when Governors Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu) and Alex Tolgos (Elgeyo Marakwet) led MPs in storming the university and demanding Kosgey's appointment. Mandago and the others noted he excelled in the interviews by the university council so it was improper for Matiang'i to appoint Ayiro as acting VC. Matiang'i nullified results of the first interviews and ordered a repeat which was done in October last year. Kosgey emerged the best again. The professor has been serving as Deputy Vice Chancellor at Laikipia University. Both Kosgey and Ayiro declined to comment on the matter when contacted on Saturday.
