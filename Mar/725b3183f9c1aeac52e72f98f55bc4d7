The last male northern white rhino on the planet, Sudan, is showing signs of deteriorating health. The rhino arrived at Ol Pejeta in 2009. “At the advanced age of 45...his future is not looking bright,” the conservancy said in a statement yesterday. Sudan developed an age-related infection on his back right leg at the end of 2017. A team of vets from around the world took care of him, and he responded well to treatment, healing quickly. Sudan resumed normal movement and foraging habits in January to mid-February. However, a secondary and much deeper infection was discovered beneath the initial one. This has been treated, but the infection is taking longer to recover. He is under 24-hour care by a team of vets. “Everything possible is being done to help him regain his health. We are very concerned about him - he’s extremely old for a rhino and we do not want him to suffer unnecessarily,” the conservancy said. “We will keep you updated on all developments. Please keep him in your thoughts.” Last December 5 a team of experts met to discuss the next steps in a groundbreaking procedure to save the northern white rhino from extinction. They included veterinarians, conservationists and wildlife managers from the Czech Republic, Kenya, UK and South Africa. Only three members of the subspecies are left on the planet, one male and two females, all of which are ageing and all of which are at Ol Pejeta. The animals were moved to Africa from DvÅ¯r KrÃ¡lovÃ© Zoo in the Czech Republic in 2009 in an attempt to get them to breed naturally under African conditions. Although the females showed positive signs of cycling, no confirmed pregnancies occurred. Achieving success in artificial reproduction techniques using surrogate southern white rhinos is now the only way to save some of the northern white genes in living animals. This has never been before attempted in rhinos.
