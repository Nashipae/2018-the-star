Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko and his Mombasa counterpart Hassan Joho are said to have played a critical role in uniting President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga. Nairobi ODM chairman and Makadara MP George Aladwa yesterday confirmed meetings between the two governors prior to the famous handshake between the President and Raila. He said he met Sonko on March 8, a day before Uhuru and Raila met. "I had a meeting with Sonko in his office and he told me the President and himself were ready to work with NASA officials," Aladwa said. Aladwa also said he urged Sonko to hold talks with all the 17 MPs in Nairobi. There are reports that Sonko first met Joho, who is Raila's deputy party leader and asked him to tone down his combative style of politics against the Jubilee administration. Sonko and Joho clashed in January 2015, when Uhuru was in Mombasa to issue title deeds to the squatters on the Waitiki land in Likoni. Towards the August 7 last year, Joho's attacks against Jubilee government intensified. But immediately he was reelected Mombasa governor, Joho toned down his attacks. Sonko is seen as close to Uhuru. Joho could not confirm about the meetings with Sonko as he is out of the country on official visit.
