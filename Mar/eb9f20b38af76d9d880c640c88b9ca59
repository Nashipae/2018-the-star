Fresh from finishing second at the Vancouver Sevens over the weekend, Shujaa have been handed a tricky draw for the Hong Kong Sevens next month where they face Australia, Canada and Spain in Pool ‘B’. Kenya, who bagged 19 points from their exploits in the Canadian city will open their campaign against Canada, whom they are expected to meet at the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast two weeks later. The two sides have met once this season, at the Dubai Sevens in December, with Innocent Simiyu’s charges running out 29-15 winners. Shujaa will then face Spain in their second preliminary match. The two sides met in Vancouver with Kenya hammering the hapless Spaniards 43-0 and hold a favourable record against the Europeans, winning their last seven encounters. Kenya’s final pool game will be against Australia, whom they have met thrice, with the Aussies winning all (19-12 in Dubai, 33-12 in Hamilton, and 26-21 in Las Vegas). Kenya lie eighth on the standings with 64 points and remain on course to meet their target of 100 points with four tournaments remaining. The squad was expected back in to the country last night and will rest for a week before resuming training in preparation for the Hong Kong event.
