Paul Clement is the Tanzanian gospel artiste behind the mega hit song, Amenifanyia Amani. He has clearly changed the gospel music game from the normal dancehall gospel that has been trending to introducing his own style, which has successfully captured a huge following. The artiste's other hit songs include Jina La Yesu and Namba Moja. He was in Kenya and had an interview with Kiss FM's Chito Ndlovu, where he talked about his music journey. Talking about his mega hit, Amenifanyia Amani, Paul Clement said: "Kwanza huo wimbo ulitokana na nikicheza keyboard, nilikua na bro hapa amekaa hapo nikawa naimba huku ananisikiza. Sikujua huo wimbo utakua mkubwa. Siku moja nikaenda kwa event yangu then hapo ndio niliintroduce huo wimbo kwa watu na kila mtu akawa amezama. Lakini sikua nimeureccord. Watu wakaanza kuimba huo wimbo kanisani na ivo ndivo uliweza kuenea." He continued, "Benpol mentored me in the music industry. Yeye ndiye amenifundisha kuimba. Kila mahali naenda lazima nimkumbuke. I was a street kid for 8 years, My father had always wanted me to pursue another career and not music. Nia yake ilikua niwe laywer kama yeye. Issue za familia ndio zilichangia niwe street child. Nmashukuru Mungu kwa sababu malengo yangu yalitimia na bado yanaendelea kutimia. Nilikiwa street niliandika nikiwa kwa situation ngumu wimbo unaitwa 'Juu ya mataifa yote' huo wakati nilikua bado naenda kanisani."
