A mother has sued Nairobi Hospital and one of its doctors for negligence following a botched caesarean section. Naomi Mwangi claims the doctor perforated her colon. She has also accused the hospital of detaining her after she failed to clear more than Sh2 million bill. In documents filed at the High Court yesterday, Mwangi says she attended antenatal clinic at the hospital.

In the package, normal deliveries cost Sh98,000, while caesarian section was Sh220,000. On February 12, she contacted AAR Insurance, and the firm confirmed that they would take care of the hospital bill up to a limit of Sh245,000. Mwangi decided to deliver at the hospital after an obstetric ultrasound conducted by the hospital indicated her pregnancy was normal. A procedure was carried out, but she claims she developed complications. “A CT scan done on February  15  indicated the patient had a gaseous abdomen band, while another CT scan  on  February 16  indicated she  had  severe pneumoperitoneum, indicating a perforated hollow viscus,” a court document reads.
