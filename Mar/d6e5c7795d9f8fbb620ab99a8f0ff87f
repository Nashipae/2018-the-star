The toll of cancer in Kenya is horrendous and all indicators are that it will get worse. The majority of cancer cases in Kenya goes undiagnosed or is discovered too late. There is a huge need for increased cancer sensitisation and millions of Kenyans have to be urged to go for screening so that the disease is caught early. Diagnosis, treatment and care of patients are mammoth tasks, given the lack of equipment, personnel, expertise and medication. There are those who are calling out for cancer to be declared a national emergency and to be tackled as such. This is much easier said than done. Cancer is a healthcare calamity all over the world. Cancer is one of the world’s foremost non-communicable diseases. According to some experts, alongside cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases, cancer accounts for more than 50 per cent of global mortality annually. Healthy Kenyans must learn to avoid taking the path to death by cancer by avoiding tobacco use, alcohol abuse and exposure to environmental carcinogens. Kenya needs to have cancer statistics, and the Census next year would be a good opportunity to begin building a reliable database. It is time to map cancer’s incidence, morbidity, mortality and survival statistics in Kenya. Our knowledge of the true extent of the plague of cancer needs to stop being merely anecdotal.
