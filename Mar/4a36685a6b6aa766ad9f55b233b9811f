Kenyan musicians got to learn all about film scoring thanks to the new partnership between Discop and Ongea! Africa. The programme, Discore, is specifically targeted at the music industry across Africa, with a focus on music production and supervision for content, licensing, synchronisation and all the related implications. The first full programme is set for Abidjan in May 29 to 31. It will provide a unique opportunity to learn from the pros and build relationships with international music supervisors; as well as with film, television, digital content producers. But before then, in Nairobi, creatives had a chance to learn about film scoring at the International TV & Film Market event at KICC. The dicussion was moderated by Mike Strano and on the panel was producer Tim Timbui, film director Likarion Wainainai and Executive producer Appie Matere.
