Retired President Daniel Moi will leave for Israel on Sunday for medical check-up. Moi's son Baringo county Senator Gideon Moi said on Saturday “the old man is not feeling well.” “He will go for medical checkup, so he needs your prayers as he leaves the country” Senator Moi said. He said plans for the early Sunday trip were complete and confirmed that some family members will accompany the retired president. While in Israel, Gideon said the 93-year old former Head of State will visit historical sites in Jerusalem. The senator spoke while addressing a thanksgiving-cum price giving day at Sacho High School in Baringo Central Sub-county. Moi, who will turn 94 on September 2, ruled Kenya for 24 years between 1978 and 2002. He took over from Kenya's founding father Mzee Jomo Kenyatta following his death on August 22, 1978. Senator Moi lauded NASA leader Raila Odinga for the bold move he took to hold talks with President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday. “We hope the talks of the two leaders will go along way to bring about peace and prosperity to the people of Kenya,” Moi said. He said it is important that leaders come together to bring about peace, inclusivity and economic prosperity to Kenyan people. “And that will not be possible without engaging one another, we hope this will bring a new beginning to our country,” Moi said.
