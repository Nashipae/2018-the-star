The city assembly has set aside Sh350 million for upgrading four stadiums to boost sports and and nurture youth talent. The stadiums are City stadium, Kihumbuini in Parklands, Joseph Kang’ethe in Kibera and Ziwani in Kariokor. “City Stadium was the first stadium in Kenya to have artificial turf. It will be quite shameful If it is neglected. It is worn out and we have decided to restore it and give it a better look,” Budget Committee chairman Robert Mbatia told the Star yesterday. The Kariobangi MCAsaid the pitch, the tartan track and toilets will be renovated. “The pitch will be fully artificial to ensure an environment conducive to training. The current state of the stadiums is hazardous,” he said. Terraces will also be expanded to accommodate more spectators. The assembly expects the work to be 50 per cent done by May. Majority leader Abdi Guyo praised the Budget committee for considering the stadiums. He said on Tuesday the stadiums will provide adequate training grounds for sportspersons and residents. “It is very shameful at times we are forced to go to the outskirts of Nairobi because of the poor status of our stadiums,” Guyo said. Last November, MCAs travelled to Machakos for the fifth edition of the Annual Inter-Counties Sports Competitions, which were held in Kenyatta Stadium.
