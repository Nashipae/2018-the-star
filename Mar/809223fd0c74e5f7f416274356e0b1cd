The National Youth Service recruitment failed in Machakos after very few people turned up, chief inspector Amina Dube has said. Dube, who was in charge of the listing in the county, said they did not meet the targeted number of recruits due to a low turnout. She said the situation was worse in Athi River sub-county on Friday where they had to seek assistance from the locals in
mobilising youths. "NYS targets 45 recruits from
each sub-county; 30 men and 15 women. We did not get the numbers due to
the very disappointing turnout." Dube spoke to journalists during the recruitment at KMC Grounds in Athi River on Friday. Only six youths turned up at the sub-county recruitment centre. She said they were dismayed that youths had
boycotted the exercise in the county despite the publicity around it. "We only managed to get the targeted 45 recruits in
Kangundo, Machakos town and Kathiani sub-counties," the official added. Dube said they did not understand why many youths shunned the recruitment at the county this year. She said they will do a report to the
National Youth Service director on the exercise for a way forward. Click here for the latest political news
