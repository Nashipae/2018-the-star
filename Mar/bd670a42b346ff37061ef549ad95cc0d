The government should support children living with Cerebral Palsy, Doors of Hope NGO project director Jacqueline Shibalira has said. Shibalira said the national and Machakos county governments should be at the forefront in advocating for children’s rights. She said the number of children living with Cerebral Palsy in Machakos is overwhelming and there is a need for speedy intervention. Shibalira addressed the press at her office in Athi River, Machakos county, yesterday. “It is necessary to support these children, especially now that the world is marking the International Cerebral Palsy awareness month,” Shibalira said. The NGO’s centre for children living with Cerebral Palsy is committed to ensuring that the children’s lives improve and they attain their best abilities. Children at the centre get three therapy sessions each week.
