The government is holding on to more than Sh400 million earmarked for bridging the digital divide, a report has revealed. The report from the Web Foundation, the Alliance for Affordable Internet and UN Women, released at the 62nd UN Commission on the Status of Women, says Kenya has one of the largest unspent sums, with Sh420 million unused in Universal Service and Access Funds. The country did not disburse cash in 2015 and 2016.The report blames this on low internet adoption in Nairobiâ€™s slums, where only 20 per cent of women and 57 per cent of men are connected. USAF is a funding method used to incentivise the expansion of internet services in remote and underserved areas. The fund became law in 2013. It is expected to help with network deployment and service provision in rural, outlying and economically unattractive areas, where telecommunications service providers may not invest for lack of economic viability. With an estimated Sh40.8 billion collected to expand internet access throughout Africa sitting dormant in public coffers, the report found Kenya and many other African countries fail to take action to connect women and other populations.
