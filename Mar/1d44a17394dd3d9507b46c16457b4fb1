Kisumu residents lit bonfires on Wednesday to protest the detention of lawyer Miguna Miguna at the JKIA since Monday. They also waved placards with phrases including 'No Miguna, No peace!' and marched on the highway demanding justice for the defiant General of the National Resistance Movement. The protesters started gathering at about 10am. They noted Miguna played a key role in Nasa leader Raila Odinga's January 30 self-inauguration as the People's President. "The government should not leave him frustrated as we are witnessing," one said. Another shouted: “We are very bitter with what we have been witnessing since Miguna jetted into the country. We will not accept this. Let him be released The demonstrators also pushed huge rocks onto the road leading to a traffic snarl up. Others were seen in T-shirts branded 'Resist', a slogan initially marketed by Raila to promote defiance against the Jubilee government. Police stepped in. Miguna has carried on with the resistance despite the Nasa chief's unity, peace and national reconciliation handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta.

The Nasa leader is expected to visit the lake region with the President following their unity deal. Some of the demonstrators said this cannot be right given what has transpired.
