The Ministry of Transport, Infrastructure, Housing and Urban development has halted the construction of the proposed Mitubiri sanitary landfill pending more consultations. In an advert published by the Ministry, Cabinet Secretary James Macharia said the project has generated a lot of adverse publicity due to inadequate consultations. The project elicited high emotions from locals who have complained that there was insufficient public conducted by the Nairobi Metropolitan Services Improvement Project. “Consequently, I have directed that the development of this project stops with immediate effect until widespread public consultations and participation have been undertaken and a consensus agreed among key stakeholders,” the advert read. Locals complained that the Sh1.2 billion landfill, that will sit on a 50 acre piece of land in Maragua, may contaminate their drinking water. They further expressed concerns why the project that is meant to serve Nairobi, Kiambu, Kajiado, Machakos and Murang’a counties was not taken to a less agricultural county. However, during a public participation forum conducted at Gikono area mid last month, locals said they will support the project if the National Environment Management Authority gives it a go-ahead. Senator Irungu Kang’ata petitioned senate to consider halting the project until claims that it may cause serious health issues due to the presence of poisonous elements such as lead and mercury are thoroughly investigated. He asked senate to ensure appropriate safety audit is undertaken for the sanitary landfill to guide on the implementation and effects of the project thereafter.
