Chad's president Idriss Deby would be
allowed to stay on until 2033 and be granted greater powers
under constitutional changes recommended by a national
conference that the opposition said aimed to create a
"monarchy". The two-week forum of about 800 politicians, business
leaders and traditional chiefs, boycotted by the opposition,
issued its report late on Tuesday, recommending eliminating the
post of prime minister and creating a fully presidential system. It proposed re-instating presidential term limits that were
scrapped by a 2005 referendum, but the reforms would still let
President Deby, who came to power in a rebellion in 1990,
stay on well into old age. It recommended six-year rather than five-year presidential
terms, limited to a maximum of two terms, effective from the
next presidential election in 2021. That would mean Deby could
stay in power until 2033, when he will be 81. Deby pledged before the 2016 election to reinstate term
limits, bucking a regional trend that has seen the presidents of
Rwanda and Congo Republic remove term limits to stay in office. The conference's proposals are expected to be taken up by
parliament this year. Chad, an ally of Western nations in the fight against
Islamist militants in West and Central Africa, has faced strikes
and protests in recent months over economic woes caused by low
prices for its chief export, oil. Click here for the latest political news
