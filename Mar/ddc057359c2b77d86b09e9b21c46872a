Kenya Squash & Racquets Association have moved to court seeking to lift an order requiring them to carry out repeat selection of representatives at the Commonwealth Games. The association in their suit papers, say they picked two of their best players to represent the nation at the games in Australia. “The applicant (association) did countrywide trials in 2017 and picked the two best players. These two meet the conditions and qualifications set by Commonwealth Games Federation.” However, player Khaaliqa Nimji challenged the decision of the association before the sports tribunal which ruled in his favour, ordering for fresh selection. Aggrieved by the decision by Sports Tribunal the association has taken the legal battle to High Court, saying implementing the ruling of the tribunal will bring the association to their knees in terms of finance and popularity. “The decision and subsequent proceedings are a setback to and will cripple down the applicant in terms of their popularity to their members who are preparing to attend the Commonwealth Games,” court was told. Most importantly, the association argued, the selection has already happened and deadline expired which makes the repeat selection something that has been overtaken. “The respondent (Sports Tribunal) has issued a ruling with grave far-reaching consequences in excess of its mandate or and jurisdiction. The same is absolutely overtaken,” the suit papers read in part. The association further termed the decision of Sports Tribunal as one which contravened the doctrine of nation values. The deadline for selection was March 7 but the sports tribunal directed for repeat of selection following complaints. The Commonwealth Games are set to commence on April 4.
