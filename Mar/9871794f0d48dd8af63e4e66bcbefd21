The country has enough maize to last for four months, the Agriculture CS has said. CS Mwangi Kiunjuri yesterday said the country has 37 million bags of maize, although there is still a deficit of 10-15 million bags. Currently, the country’s consumption per year has increased from 43 million bags to about 51 million bags, hence the 15 million bags deficit. This, the CS said, will be met by importations from Uganda, Tanzania and other countries in the region, including Ethiopia. He spoke during a media briefing on the current drought situation. His counterpart Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa said Sh3.8 billion is required for drought response between now and April. A total of Sh2.5 billion is needed for food and cash transfers. “The livestock sector will get Sh619 million for offtake, feed, disease surveillance and control. The agriculture sector will receive Sh84.9 million to help in preparation for the long rains planting season,” Wamalwa said. The water sector will receive Sh305.9 million, he said. Health and nutrition will get Sh100.4 million, peace and security Sh64.7 million and education will receive Sh113.6 million. So far, 3.4 million people are in need of food and five counties – Isiolo, Kajiado, Tana River, Garissa, Mandera – are the most affected. Other counties like Marsabit, Taita Taveta, Kitui, Samburu East, Kilifi, Wajir, Turkana, Lamu, Baringo and Tharaka Nithi are categorised in the alert drought status. Embu, Kwale, Laikipia, Meru North, Nyeri, Samburu, West Pokot and Makueni are in the normal status. However, National Drought Management Authority CEO James Oduor said the number of those affected by drought is likely to decline to about 2.5 million due to interventions from the government and other agencies.
