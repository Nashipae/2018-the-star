Two popular celebrities are raising their newborn, while still going about their lives. Actor Nick Mutuma and Bridget Shigadi's stars reconnected after their romantic liaison ended. They now have a daughter, Dua, together. Weighing 3.1 kilogrammes, Dua seems to be the apple of Nick's eye. “Charles Mutuma is the newest and proudest grandfather in the world,” Nick updated his fans, while breaking the news of her arrival. Adding, "We welcomed Dua with sass and class." Mutuma relocated to Los Angeles when he got a scholarship to study acting at UCLA, while Bridget relocated to Florida to be near her family. The two are working hard to raise their precious bundle of joy, even though they are states apart.
