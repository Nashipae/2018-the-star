The Kenya National Union of Nurses want their regulator - the Nursing Council of Kenya - not investigate one of their own who was blamed for a brain surgery mix-up at Kenyatta National Hospital. The nurses have threatened to move to court if Mary Wahome is subjected to another investigation. “We will defend the nurse because she is not to blame. This is a systemic failure. It’s an issue of administrative failure. Everyone must be blamed,” secretary general Seth Panyako said yesterday. A report released by the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board last Friday exonerated doctors who operated on the wrong patient. Appearing before the parliamentary Health Committee on Wednesday, Wahome confessed she put the tag of John Nderitu on Samuel Wachira before wheeling him into the theatre because he did not have a name tag. Wahome said she only identified Wachira as the patient after she called out the name of the John Nderitu and he responded. “I did not receive the patient with a label; I am the one who wrote it on a strapping,” Wahome said. Panyako said, “Patient tagging is not the responsibility of the nurse and if it is, it is only a small fraction. A nurse cannot identity a patient for surgery.” According to the WHO theatre pre-operation checklist, people mandated to identify a patient for surgery are the surgeon or his or her deputy, who must also put a mark with an indelible ink pen of where the surgery should take place. Neurosurgeon registrar Hudson Ng’anga, who operated on the patient, said the hospital does not follow the recommended tool by the World Health Organisation before an operation is conducted. The two patients involved in the mix-up were discharged and are recuperating. Wachira, who was the right patient, was not operated on after doctors found he was responding well to treatment.
