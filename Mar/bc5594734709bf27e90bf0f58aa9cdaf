The woman who mysteriously disappeared from a Kisumu court after being convicted of murder presented herself before the same court yesterday. Martha Nyagol was found guilty of murdering her husband Jared Otieno on the night of May 26-27, 2014, in Kanyakwar village, Kisumu East. She strangled him with a belt. On Wednesday, Nyagol was present in court when the ruling was made by High Court Judge Justice David Majanja. After the judgment, Majanja cancelled her bond and ordered that she be held in custody, pending her sentencing on April 11. Nyagol spoke briefly with a prison officer and walked away unnoticed. Then the judge realised she was no longer in the courtroom. “Where has the woman I just convicted gone to?” Majanja asked. He sent a court clerk to look for Nyagol, but she was nowhere in the court premises. Majanja adjourned the session, citing a security breach. Yesterday, Nyagol’s lawyer Steve Odumbe defended her. She was apologetic, as she thought she had to leave and come back on April 11 for the sentencing, Odumbe said. “My client has never absconded hearing. What happened was not intentional. She is regretting what transpired,” he said. Nyagol’s sister Lilian Ajuang’ told the Star outside the court that every time they attend a hearing, they are always given a date to come back, so they thought Wednesday was no different. Ajuang’ said her sister only came to realise what had happened when the lawyer called to ask why she left the court when she was supposed to remain. “My sister’s phone was off. When she charged and switched it on at around 5pm, she got the massage. That’s why we came back today,” she said. Nyagol had pleaded not guilty to the murder charge and said she was ordered by three masked and armed thugs to strangle her husband. But witnesses said she had marital problems with her husband, hence, the murder. Judge Majanja said she was part of the plot to eliminate Otieno.
