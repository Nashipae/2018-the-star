Sudan, the world's last standing male northern white rhino, is dead at the age of 45 years. "It is with great sadness that Ol Pejeta Conservancy and the DvÅ¯r KrÃ¡lovÃ© Zoo announce that Sudan, the world’s last male northern white rhino, 45, died at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya on March 19, 2018," the conservancy said. Sudan was being treated for age-related complications that led to degenerative changes in muscles and bones combined with extensive skin wounds.

"The veterinary team from the DvÅ¯r KrÃ¡lovÃ© Zoo, Ol Pejeta and Kenya Wildlife Service made the decision to euthanise him," Ol Pejeta said. The conservancy said Sudan will be remembered for his unusually memorable life.  "In the 1970s, he escaped extinction of his kind in the wild when he was moved to DvÅ¯r KrÃ¡lovÃ© Zoo." "Throughout his existence, he significantly contributed to the survival of his species as he sired two females," the conservator said. Additionally, his genetic material was collected on Monday and provides a hope for future attempts at a reproduction of northern white rhinos through advanced cellular technologies. The conservancy said Sudan during his final years came back to Africa and stole the heart of many with his dignity and strength. "We on Ol Pejeta are all saddened by Sudan’s death. He was a great ambassador for his species and will be remembered for the work he did to raise awareness globally of the plight facing not only rhinos but also the many thousands of other species facing extinction."
