Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has chided the Judiciary for giving soft and lenient sentences to corrupt convicts. On Tuesday, Sonko noted individuals accused of swindling millions of shillings are sentenced to a few years in prison thus encouraging the vice. “We have tried our level best to curb graft ... courts should give punitive rulings to these individuals. During the time of my predecessor [Evans Kidero], huge amounts of money were lost in hands of these characters,” he said. He addressed a delegation from Cotu, led by Secretary General Francis Atwoil, at City Hall.

"My government will ensure it remits the National Hospital Insurance Fund and Lap Fund deductions for its staff to relevant bodies," he said. Atwoli applauded Sonko’s progress in making Nairobi great but urged to put more effort into solving county workers' problems. "I have faith in you," he told the Governor, adding he has proven to be a performer "unlike his predecessor". Atwoli cited huge garbage pile-ups, especially along Mombasa Road, a menace that continues to haunt Sonko. He asked the county boss tackle the land grabbing matter head-on and ensure those found guilty face the full wrath of the law. “Land grabbing syndicates in Nairobi are real. There is a victim in Mariakani, South B ... I want you to take up the case and assist those families," he said.
