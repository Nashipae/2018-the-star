The body of a man was yesterday found dumped in Shell area at the outskirts of Bungoma town. It had deep panga wounds to the head.
 Bungoma South police boss David Kirui said the man could have been killed elsewhere and the body dumped at the scene.
He said police have not identified the body, but investigations have started. Kirui said they did not find any documents, wallet or a phone when they found the body.
He urged residents to give information that may lead to the arrest of the killers. “Residents should help police bring to book goons that have been terrorising them. This will go a long way in curbing the escalating crime in Bungoma town,” Kirui said.
Resident Grace Wekesa said police should increase night patrols in estates to fight crime.
She said many people are robbed, especially when it’s raining.
The body of the man was taken by police to the Bungoma Referral Hospital morgue.
