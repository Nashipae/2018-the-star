A judge has pulled out of a Sh800 million property suit after one of the parties accused her of bias in cancelling the title deed and issuing eviction orders against the buyer. The property is located in Nyamakima in Nairobi Environment and Land Court Justice Antonina Kossy Bor recused herself from the case pitting Elias Waithanji against Joseph Maina and the Land Registrar following an application made by the propertyâ€™s initial owner, Javan Drakumar , who sold it to Waithanji for Sh12 million in the 2000s. Through lawyer Philip Ongondi, Shah accused the judge of bias by issuing eviction orders in April . The orders were enforced in November last year, without hearing from the defence. Maina, through his lawyer, Arnold Otundo, moved to court, claiming he bought the land from the initial owner, Joginder Sigh, in 1987.
