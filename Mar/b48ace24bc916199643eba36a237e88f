Following in the footsteps of Lupita Nyog'o, who caught international attention with a local production, the duo of Mankind are about to drop their own movie, Meet Me Outside. The singing group of Eugene Lowell (Mane) and Alexander O'Brian (The Cloak) have proven they can also make movies. The short film follows the life of an orphan and a small trader in Zanzibar, a photographer in Nairobi and a regular London dweller. The Cloak said the film has a "very unique story line". "It brings out the perspectives of very different people living in different countries across the world. Mane and I are suckers for narrating stories, and making this movie was such a treat for us." The pair won a Sh1 million British Council grant from a shortlist of 250 applicants.
