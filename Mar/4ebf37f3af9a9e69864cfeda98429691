Mungai said the sector employs hundreds of youths but it had been neglected for years. The sentiments were echoed by the association treasurer James Kiiru who said that transport had been nearly crippled during the rainy season. “Currently there are some parts in Naivasha town and the rural areas which are completely impassable whenever it rains,” he said.
