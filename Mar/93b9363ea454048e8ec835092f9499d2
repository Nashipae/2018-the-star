IS Jubilee behind the Bill to create a ceremonial President and a powerful Prime Minister? Well, top Jubilee operatives in a casual chat at a top parking lot could not stop laughing at how the party's top brass denied the allegations. One of them was overhead saying, “Everyone in the country knows Jubilee MPs have been gagged by the Executive to push for a specific agenda. At times Kenyans have a reason not to take seriously the people we use to push for our propaganda," one of them said. ========= A section of politicians from the Rift Valley allied to DP William Ruto received the news of the nullification of Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter’s election with shock. The MPs, who openly expressed their resentment in Parliament, said the ruling could be the last straw that broke the camel’s back, in the DP’s efforts to ring-fence his Rift Valley backyard. “Unfortunate for us and the DP,” said one of the MPs. Some of them argued how Keter - a Jubilee rebel -would give Ruto sleepless nights and even puncture his efforts to rally the region behind him ahead of the 2022 elections. “This could be a trap, and a bad one,” another MP retorted. ========= ADMINISTRATION Police officers in Boni Forest are not sure if they will get their hardship allowances after a high ranking officer allegedly rebuked them: “Pelekeni penye mnataka.” The officers spend sleepless nights in the cold on a 24-hour mission to take on terrorist gangs in the expansive forest but have never been paid any allowances since the operation started. Their GSU counterparts in the same mission apparently earn Sh31,500 per month. The APs told Corridors the funds are estimated to have accumulated to more than Sh250,000 per head and could have been pocketed by some officials in Nairobi. The affected officers are trying to get in touch with the officers attached to the Presidency to protest to the country’s top leadership. ======== COULD a senior official of the ODM party be stoking an internal storm at Orange House with his claims of financial misappropriation by a section of officials? Yesterday party treasurer Timothy Bosire – the custodian of the party’s finances - dismissed as imaginary claims that there could be misuse of funds. The former Kitutu Masaba MP said the party’s internal organs have not been brought to the attention of any loss of money at Orange House. He challenged those making the claims to do so formally, as the records are clear. “We are audited, there is nothing like loss of funds, nothing of that sort,” said Bosire. ===== Click here for the latest political news
