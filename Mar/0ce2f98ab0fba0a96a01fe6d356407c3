One necessary quality that models should possess is rarity in appearance. For albinos and those with vitiligo, their unique aspects have in the past come with a painful experiences that expose them to body shaming, discrimination, violence, death and alienation. But a new era of civilisation is coming up and more people are beginning to embrace and champion for diversity and equal opportunities for everyone. This brings to mind Michael Omari, who uses his skin condition to make a mark in the creative scene. In the presence of many, itâ€™s his self-loving attitude towards his appearance that enables him to stands out and have presence. He understands that he possesses the kind of aesthetic appeal that will actually fascinate an audience. Even in the slightest of opportunities, his Instagram feed beams with a proper taste of non-conformity and individualism. His poses, fashion sense and the conceptualisation of each picture communicates credence. He tries to model in a natural, graceful twist, enabling the photographer to capture something disparate. Visibility for those with albinism is getting better thanks to the bold move by individuals like Omari. To a great extent, being different is a blessing. He embraces his nature, and as a budding model, he could be headed for greater platforms, like London-based model Leo Jonah. His career is gradually picking up, and the lad is quite a common figure in the alternative social scene. Kenyan designer Zeddie Loky included him in his 2017 NarokNYC collection launch in Nairobi. Omari proves that traditional standards for modelling are antiquated. There might not be much to tell about his career yet, but from whatever he has already showcased, we can already predict that he is headed for greatness.
