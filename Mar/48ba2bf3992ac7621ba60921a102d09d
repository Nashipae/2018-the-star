Mbeere ACK Bishop Moses Mashamba yesterday said MCAs and residents making comments on Governor Martin Wambora’s election nullification will cause conflicts. Mashamba said extreme politicking by the ward representatives supporting or opposing Wambora or his rival former Senator Lenny Kivuti hurts cohesion. The bishop said campaigns by the MCAs at public gatherings, on social media and in church services goes against the spirit of peace and development. He said the verbal public combats by supporters of both politicians threatens unity among the residents. Mashamba urged Embu residents and politicians to stop the war and instead focus on nation building. The cleric said residents should allow the courts to deal with the matter between Wambora and Kivuti. Mashamba inaugurated the new Kiametho ACK parish and vicar in-charge Abishag Ireri in Mbeere South subcounty on Sunday. The cleric said Wambora has a right to appeal against the nullification. He further said Kivuti also had a right to file the petition after losing the election, but residents should not fight in the meantime. “They should wait in unity for the outcome without hating each other.” The cleric urged politicians to keep off the election mood to spur development in the county. Mashamba asked the residents to support Wambora if he succeeds in his appeal and if fresh elections are to be conducted, all residents should come out to vote. Mashamba asked residents to emulate the gesture of reconciliation forged by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition chief Raila Odinga and practice inclusivity and sharing of resources. There has been intense lobbying from both Wambora and Kivuti supporters following the poll nullification.
