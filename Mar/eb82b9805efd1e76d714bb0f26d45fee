Anti-narcotics detectives have arrested three Tanzania nationals and seized heroin worth over Sh90 million at Lunga Lunga border in Kwale County. The businessmen were found in a bus by officers who had been trailing them. The drugs weighing 30 kgs had been packed in three suitcases. Anti-narcotics unit head Khamis Massa said the suspects were taken to Port police station. The three are among wanted drug dealers in the region. The covert operation that led to their capture was conducted by a mult-agency team of the DCI, NIS and anti-narcotics sleuths. "We are interrogating the suspects, whom we believe are drug traffickers, to establish where the drugs were destined for," Massa said on Friday. Tanzania is among countries used as transit points for hard drugs. Last year, officers seized drugs worth Sh10 million and arrested 12 suspects, among them Tanzanians, in Mombasa. The government has deported several drug barons including Italians in the war on drugs.
