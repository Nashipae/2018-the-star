A python that has been troubling Magodzoni villagers, Kwale county, for two weeks was on Wednesday evening captured and taken to the Mwamanga snake park. Residents flocked the area to see the nine-foot python removed from a hole. Resident Rajab Azwaj said he was grazing his cattle when he saw the python. It seemed to be digesting after feeding. “Angry residents wanted to kill the snake, but one remembered there is a snake hunter who specialises in capturing snakes,” Azwaj said. There have been several cases of snake attacks on people, livestock and poultry. Snake hunter Mwachambuli Salim said he was told about the python on Sunday. It was easy to capture from the hole. Salim advised residents to keep their animals in a safe place, far from the forest. “The python comes to homesteads because it is attracted by the smell of goats and chickens, but if you keep them in a safe place, it will go to the forest to find food,” he said. Salim captures snakes for a living. One catch attracts Sh5,000 pay. Some of the creatures are at the Mwamanga Park in Ukunda, an attraction site visited by foreign and local tourists. The snake hunter said, “Snakes are a source of income to us as we feed our families on this business. We will train other youths to run this business and grow the park.” In December last year, the Environment CS said the ministry may not be able to pay snakebite victims Sh1.5 billion compensation. She said loopholes in the Wildlife Act have made it difficult to compensate victims of wildlife attacks and amendments are long overdue. “The issue of injury by wildlife is in the law but we want to remove snakebites because many people get bitten by snakes, even on their own houses.”
