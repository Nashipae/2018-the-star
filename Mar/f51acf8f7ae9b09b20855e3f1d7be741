The Teachers’ Service Commission has asked the High Court to dismiss an application by Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion, who has contested his sacking. The TSC told the Employment and Labour Relations Court the decision to sack the nominated MP was within the law, principles of natural justice and public interest. “He was subjected to a fair administrative process and was accorded full benefit of the rules of natural justice, before he was shown the door,” Josephine Maundu, the director in charge of human resource management, said in court documents.

The commission said Sossion was obligated to resign or retire in compliance with the Teachers’ Code of Conduct and Ethics, 2015, upon being nominated to Parliament by ODM. “By holding two conflicting public offices, he was engaged in two positions of gainful employment from the same government contrary to Section 26 of the Leadership and Integrity Act,” Maundu said. She said Sossion, by assuming a state office while serving as a public officer in the teaching service, engaged in gross breach of statutory and regulatory provisions.

His says the power to sack a teacher is regulated in law and a decision is informed by the rules of justice and fairness. “I was entitled to a one-month notice in writing,” he says. But the TSC denies his claims, saying he was given time to respond but failed.  Click here for the latest political news
