The Mai Mahiu-Suswa Road has been reopened for traffic to and from Narok. KeNHA assistant director of communication Charles Njogu said the authority has managed to back-fill the section of the road. "A contractor and a team of engineers have permanently been
assigned to the site to monitor any developments that may occur as a result of
the isostatic adjustment of the volcanic area, which is attributed to the fault
line that has developed," Njogu said. He said the authority will issue more updates on a need basis. The section of the road has twice been rendered impassable due to heavy rains. The road was first rendered impassable on Tuesday last week after it developed a volcanic fault line. Motorists using the road were stuck on the road for several hours unable to proceed to their destinations. On Monday, the same section which was repaired with rock fill sunk again disrupting traffic.
