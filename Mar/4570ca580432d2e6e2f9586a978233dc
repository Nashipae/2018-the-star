The boda boda operators' strike in Lamu Old Town yesterday entered its second day. The 100 operators are protesting harassment by county askaris. The town was listed as a world
heritage site by Unesco in 2001. This means all
elements of Westernisation are to be avoided to preserve the culture and
heritage of the ancient Swahili town. The only mode of transport allowed is donkeys due
to the narrow streets. The
operators have accused the county askaris of arbitrary arrests and
demanding licences, which the majority of them don’t have. They
said the askaris demand bribes, even for the smallest mistake. They said the business doesn’t bring in much and at the end of the day they are left high and dry and giving out bribes. For residents who are used to boda bodas, the strike is a nightmare. But for cart pushers and donkey owners it is a blessing as they are making a kill. Lamu Boda Boda Operators Association chairman Mohamed
Badi yesterday said more than 10 motorcycles whose owners refused to bribe the askaris have been seized. This
is the fourth month since the boda boda business kicked off in Lamu town.
