The baby mama of a legendary Kenyan footballer is the main reason the marriage of a popular celebrity couple almost crumbled to dust. The baby mama and the hubby of the songstress have been having a torrid affair. It was such a long affair to a point where it was on-and-off-on-again-off-again before they actually called it off. All this under the nose of the wife. When she found out, sources close to the couple claim she went and sought spiritual intervention because her hubby needed Jesus. They both went for marriage counselling and thing are now on the mend. However, pundits claim the man could still be keeping in touch with the luscious babe who bore a child for a flamboyant footballer.
