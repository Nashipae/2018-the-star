Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi has asked residents to register with NHIF, saying he will not help pay hospital bills. Speaking during the induction of hospital management boards in Makutano on Friday, Kiraitu said he will never attend a funds drive to raise money for hospital bills. The National Hospital Insurance Fund covers all illnesses. The governor asked residents to take advantage of the national government’s universal coverage by enlisting with NHIF to reduce financial burdens of families with patients in hospitals. Kiraitu said it is senseless for the government to invest in health, only for people to refuse to benefit. “I will not attend any harambee for someone who needs funds to pay medical bills. Don’t invite me because I won’t attend,” Kiraitu said. He said the elderly, aged 70 and above, are covered for free by NHIF. The boards that were undergoing the induction include that of Meru Level Five Hospital and 14 Level four hospitals across the county. NO TREATMENT Kiraitu urged NHIF service providers to work together with the management of health facilities to enlist more members. He said the county will mobilise resources for a door-to-door sensitisation campaign. “No patient will receive treatment from all level 4 and 5 hospitals in Meru county unless they are registered with NHIF,” Kiraitu said. The governor said there are plans to elevate the Meru Level 5 Hospital to level 6 and make it a teaching and referral hospital. That elevation will ensure the hospital offers all services required by patients in the region, he said. The county will pay half of the Sh500 NHIF monthly contribution for youths. ”The main challenge in the health sector is financing. A third of the county’s budget goes to the sector, but will little benefit to patients. It is like having funds for education, but most of it ends up being salaries for the teachers while there are less books for the students,” Kiraitu said. Click here for the latest political news
