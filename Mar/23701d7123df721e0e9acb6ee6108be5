Migori leaders and sugarcane farmers have pledged to block an attempt allow a private investor to buy the South Nyanza Sugar company. They even said hey would physically block border entry roads so an investor cannot enter. A meeting at the firm with the Privatisation Committee on Monday at turned into a blame game. Leaders said despite giving their stand against privatisation, their views were not factored in to a decision. They accused the commission of working at the behest of sugar barons to privatise the sector. Migori Governor Okoth Obado and MPs Mark Nyamita (Uriri), Tom Odege (Nyatike), Walter Owino (Awendo) and Marwa Kitayama (Kuria East) vowed to the borders. “We have said Sony Sugar will never be privatised. We don’t want to be provoked. Migori county took the commission to court to force public participation. We have given our views,” Obado said. Sony Sugar has survived despite two private millers — Sukari Industries (Migori) and Trans Mara Sugar (Narok) — poaching their cane. Nyamita said the government should write off loans in the sugar industry, just as it did in the coffee, tea and miraa sectors. The leaders told the commission to move swiftly and reflect their resolution that Migori is against privatisation of Sony. Secretary general of Kenya Federation of Sugarcane Farmers Ezra Olodi said privatisation will not compensate farmers who donated land to theestate to set up mills. Farmer Ben Okello from Uriri said cane farmers can manage the company and pay future bills if debts are waived. Commission chairman Henry Obwocha said they aim to collect veiws of all stakeholders. He denied claims of working as a front for sugar barons.
