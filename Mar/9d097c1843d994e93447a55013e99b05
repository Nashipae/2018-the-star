Retrogressive cultural and religious practices, corrupt medical practitioners and inept judicial officers are fueling violence against women, Action Aid has said. The group said weak witness protection laws had led to the collapse of crucial cases as witnesses shied away from providing evidence. On Wednesday, the group led countrywide protests to demand action against gender violence. It called for the strict implementation of the Sexual Offences Act, Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act and the Protection against Domestic Violence Act. “Some medical practitioners demanded payment before filling P3 forms,” Makrina Mwamburi, Taita Taveta’s Sauti Ya Wanawake chairperson said. She spoke at a forum organised by Action Aid at a hotel in Mombasa. Garissa county civil society youth leader Fatuma Ahmed said delayed court cases have discouraged many victims from seeking justice. Sexual violence was the biggest aggression women faced followed by battering. Mwamburi said religious and cultural practices have allowed predators to thrive. “For example, some cultures that promote FGM seek justification in religion,” Mwamburi said. She said Kadhi’s Courts have failed to handle divorce cases arising from domestic violence because of contradictions in the law. “Law enforcement is weak and dodgy,” she said. Action Aid wants Kadhi’s barred from deciding divorce cases, citing bias. CURRICULUM Shika Adabu Sauti ya Wanawake official Amina Juma called for the inclusion of chapters on the dangers of FGM in the curriculum. Juma also asked the Health ministry to establish exhibit management units at county level. “Counties should also pioritise community education on gender-based violence offences,” Juma said. The forum asked Chief Justice David Maraga to provide a specific time frame for hearing and determination of all sexual crimes and GBV cases. “They should also avail medical practitioners who fill P3 forms during court proceedings,” Juma said.
