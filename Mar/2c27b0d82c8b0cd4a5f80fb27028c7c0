Nairobi ODM and Jubilee youth leaders have asked President Uhuru Kenyatta
and NASA leader Raila Odinga to involve them in the unity negotiations. The youths, who welcomed last Friday's decision by the two leaders to unite Kenya, said they want in since they were the most affected during the polls. "This unity bid was long overdue. We have been waiting for it because of the effect of the political intolerance that we have seen in
the past," Jonah Onyango, ODM Nairobi youth chairman, said. Onyango and his
Jubilee counterpart William Ng'ang'a addressed a press conference in
Nairobi yesterday. They urged
Raila and Uhuru to include youths in the discussions so that their interests can be factored. "Youths have been
injured, maimed and killed in the name of politics. We are jobless
and politicians have taken advantage of this to involve in
demonstrations and the like," Ng'ang'a said. "For long-term
peace in Nairobi and other parts of the country, youths must be
involved," he added. Read: Raila took calculated risk to avert bloodshed - Salim Lone Raila and Uhuru
surprised the nation last Friday when they addressed a joint
conference at the President's Harambee House office. The duo promised to
bring to an end their political and personal differences and unite
the country. Politicians from
both sides of the political divide have also lauded the move, saying
it will foster togetherness and unity among Kenyans. Others have criticised the development. Onyango further urged the
individuals who appealed the High Court's decision to uphold Governor
Mike Sonko's victory to withdraw the case. He argued that this will help
foster unity among the youths in the city. "This case will
only widen the bridge between Jubilee and Nasa supporters in Nairobi.
Let them give Sonko time to work and deliver on his promised for the
youth." Also read: Raila might scuttle Uhuru succession plan, Kithure Kindiki cautions Jubilee Click here for the latest political news
