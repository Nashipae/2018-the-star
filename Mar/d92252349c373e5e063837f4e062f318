Ol Pejeta Conservancy wants the world to ensure that other rhino species and all wildlife thrive. The conservancy made the call on Sunday following the death of Sudan, the last male northern white rhino. Sudan was no ordinary rhino as he was was some kind of a 'celeb' who stole the hearts of many who came to Kenya. He was the last male northern white rhino and last hope for the breed in the world.

"Let's hope the demise of Sudan will not be in vain," the tweet read. "The case of the northern whites should serve as a cautionary tale for humanity." The actions of mankind could lead to the extinction of half of African birds and mammals by the end of 2100, a UN-backed study says. The report conducted by 550 experts from around the world said reduced biodiversity could affect people's quality of life. It also found 42 per cent of land-based animal and plant species in Europe and Central Asia have declined in the last decade.
