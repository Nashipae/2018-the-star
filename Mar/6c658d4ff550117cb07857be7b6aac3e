The Election Observers Group yesterday demanded an audit of the 2017 polls saying they were neither free, fair, nor credible. In a new report called ‘One Country, two elections, many voices’ launched at a Nairobi hotel, the team cited insecurity as having had a negative impact on the vote outcome. ELOG also cited numerous cases of intimidation of voters, fear, coercion, and the indefinite postponement of voting in 25 constituencies. The agency holds that the IEBC’s decision to call off the polls - mostly in Nyanza - denied millions of Kenyans their right to participate in the election. “Political problems require political solutions. We recommend a broad-based and inclusive process for a national dialogue,” ELOG coordinator Mule Musau said. He said there was also the absence of party agents other than jubilee and observers that provided an environment which was not conducive to the conduct credible elections. “IEBC should ensure that its decisions are independent, transparent, accountable, legal and guided by the best interests of the country,” Musau said. They want the audit findings to help identify and prosecute perpetrators of violence and election malpractices. The observers also want the audit findings to help establish new laws and enhance logistics preparations to ensure free, fair and credible polls in the future. “All stakeholders – including civil society groups – must remain steadfast, vigil and demand accountability from duty holders despite threats,” Alfred Rotich, ELOG Advisory and Peace panel boss, said.
