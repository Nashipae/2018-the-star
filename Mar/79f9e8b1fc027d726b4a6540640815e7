The Nembure Coffee Society has sacked the management committee following a drop in production from two million kilogrammes to 100,000. The team was sacked on Thursday during a special general meeting overseen by Cooperative Development officers. County cooperative commissioner David Muriuki (pictured) directed the farmers to hold an election on March 22 to replace the officials. He said his office will not condone officials who mismanage societies and it will facilitate their removal. Muriuki accused the officials of selling their own coffee to Nembureâ€™s rival after running down the society. Muriuki said the society was once one of the most vibrant in Embu county and members produced enough coffee and workers were paid on time.
