The Portuguese have started tracing their roots in Malindi, 520 years after Vasco Da Gama built a pillar and a chapel on his way to India. The five-century old historical structure may collapse due to strong ocean waves. Portuguese Ambassador Luisa Fragoso, together with Mozambique consul general Frederico Da Silva, toured the site. They were received by National Museums director general Mzalendo Kibunja and High Commissioner to Tanzania Dan Kazungu. In its current state, Kibunja says the pillar requires Sh60 million to rehabilitate and avoid a collapse. The NMK chief said Fragoso was on a fact-finding mission to see the pillar and chapel where Da Gama buried two of his sailors in 1498 and the Portuguese ship wreck in Ngomeni.
