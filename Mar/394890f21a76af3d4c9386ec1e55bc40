Nasa principals Musalia Mudavadi and Kalonzo Musyoka are confident that Moses Wetang'ula's is the best Senate Minority leader. The ANC and Wiper bosses declared this on Friday after Nasa chief Raila Odinga's ODM party moved to replace Wetang'ula with his Siaya counterpart James Orengo. In a letter signed by ANC Secretary General Barack Muluka, the politicians noted their resolve to throw their weight behind Wetang'ula, who is Bungoma Senator and Ford Kenya boss. Muluka said the decision was made during their meeting in Karen, Nairobi, today. The statement stated: "The three principals have reaffirmed their total confidence in Wetang'ula as the official leader of the Minority in the Senate. Their support for Wetang'ula in this regard is unwavering." ODM Senators wrote to Speaker Kenneth Lusaka on Wetang'ula removal. Lusaka told them on Thursday that he had received a letter on the resolve from Minority Whip Mutula Kilonzo. The Speaker, however, told the Opposition coalition to ensure it follows proper procedures in electing Orengo before the appointment becomes official.

"If anyone wants a divorce it will be noisy, messy and unhelpful, and it will have causalities. I'm not going anywhere. I was not invited to Nasa - I'm a founder."
