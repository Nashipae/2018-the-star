The Employment and Labour Relations Court yesterday stopped implementation of a circular by head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua to Cabinet Secretaries and Permanent Secretaries lifting the retirement age. This followed activist Okiya Omtatah’s suit challenging the government’s move to scrap age and term limits for State corporation CEOs. Kinyua had directed that CEOs of public bodies will not be subjected to both the mandatory retirement age of 60 years and that they can also serve for more than six years extra. Former President Mwai Kibaki lifted the Public Service retirement age from 55 years to 60. The private sector retains some people aged 60 and above based on their productivity and net contribution to the organisation while the Public Service retires the employees based mostly on generational transition, in light of the young people coming through, and on the strength of perceived declining productivity. Yet there are people in both government and the private sector aged 60 and above who have the energy, vision, experience and institutional memory to be of considerable value for a number of years yet. Even in the private sector, CEOs aged under 40 are still exceptions to the rule. Most are aged over 40. While Kinyua's action is before court for determination, we think that a national conversation on the age limit for public servants and its necessity is important.
