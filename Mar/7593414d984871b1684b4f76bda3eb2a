Several elected Embu politicians turned a ward representative’s thanksgiving ceremony into a campaign rally for Governor Martin Wambora whose election was nullified. Embu Senator Njeru Ndwiga, Runyenjes MP Erick Muchangi and MCAs on Sunday said they support Wambora. The others are county speaker Josiah Thiriku and Deputy Governor David Kariuki. They had attended the thanksgiving ceremony of Gaturi North MCA Paul Muchangi at Gichugu ACK Church on Sunday. Justice William Musyoka nullified Wambora’s victory on February 22 after former Senator Lenny Kivuti filed a petition.  Justice Musyoka said the petitioner proved his case beyond doubt that there were massive irregularities that affected the results of the August 8 election. The judge said the scrutiny report of 356 polling stations showed there were many irregularities that led him to nullify the election. Ndwiga said Embu lags behind in development because its leaders do not support those who win elections. He said they spend most of the time fighting and in the process they hurt development. Ndwiga urged the county leaders who lost in General Election to join hands with those who won to serve residents. Thiriku said it is unfortunate that Kivuti wants to return voters to the ballot. “He will come back to us and we shall decide the way we did on August 8,” he said. Thiriku told Kivuti to wait for 2022. Last month, Kivuti asked Wambora not to appeal the nullification of his victory and instead brace himself for a fresh election. “He should be man enough and agree to face the people,” Kivuti said after the court delivered its judgment.
