Likoni MP Mishi Mboko and her Malindi counterpart Aisha Jumwa overcame widespread prejudice that women can’t be elected. Mboko on Thursday said there was lobbying to persuade her and Jumwa to step down before August 8. Mboko and Jumwa were Mombasa and Kilifi woman MPs in the 11th Parliament. Both decided to run for constituency MPs.  Mboko said she was promised a nomination slot to the Senate and Jumwa to the National Assembly if they dropped their bids. She said Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and Kilifi’s Amason Kingi expressed fears they’d lose. “We were warned about cultural beliefs among Digos and Giriamas that women cannot be elected. We were asked to let ODM to pick men,” she said. “We told them point blank we don’t want to be awarded posts. We want to go out and fight for them. Some laughed at us.”
