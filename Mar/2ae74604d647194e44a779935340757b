Over 20 cars have confirmed participation at the first 2018 4x4 Champaign Challenge circuit slated for this weekend in Kipeto, Kajiado County. According to the organisers, the circuit is expected to be a muddy affair and promises to pump up adrenaline of both drivers and spectators. The organisers expect course to be tasking for both the drivers and the off-road machines following the rains that have pounded the area for the last three weeks now. Last year’s season winners ‘The Experts’ will be out to retain the title but will have to contend with tough competition from 10 other drivers including 2018 runners up ‘Team Wazimu’. Rhino Charge driver John Kanyali of ‘Team Ole Nkrunet’ will feature in the top Experts category that will feature 10 drivers. The ‘Intermediate’ class has attracted 15 drivers who will also race over six stages while 15 ‘beginner’ drivers have five phases in the challenge to cover. Clerk of the course, George Njoroge, advised drivers to arm themselves with mud-grip tyres as the terrain will be very demanding. Siblings Manish Kirai and Dipak Kirai of ‘Team Wazimu’ are excited ahead of the challenge. “The car is in great shape and compared to our competitors, the weather favours us because they all use petrol engines which do not work well with water,” said Manish. Team Wazimu will be driving a Toyota Prado-box diesel engine in the Expert category. Experienced driver Bob Kaugi said: “This year is going to be tough. Drivers should attend all the entire series because the season is very unpredictable.” “Familiarising one self with the course would do drivers much good as opposed to driving in and embarking onto the course,” added Kaugi.
