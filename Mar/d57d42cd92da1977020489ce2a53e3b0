The Emoji Movie, an animated film starring James Corden and Patrick Stewart, has swept the board at Hollywood's Razzie awards, which highlight the year's worst films. It was given four Golden Raspberry titles, including worst picture, director and screenplay. In a statement, Razzies organisers branded the film a "talking poop opus". Tom Cruise was named worst actor for his performance in the reboot of The Mummy. The film was poorly reviewed by critics, who described it as "empty headed" and "one-note". "Cruise should have played the Mummy - that way his face would be swathed in bandages and his fans wouldn't have to see him sweat so hard," Peter Travers wrote in Rolling Stone. The worst supporting actor award was given to Mel Gibson for the comedy Daddy's Home 2. He follows in the footsteps of US President Donald Trump, who won the title in 1990 for his cameo in Ghosts Can't Do It. Tyler Perry won the worst actress award, dressed as an elderly woman in Boo 2: A Medea Halloween. He was nominated for the same award last year.
