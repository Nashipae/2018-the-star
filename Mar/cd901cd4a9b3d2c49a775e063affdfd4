Residents of Mandera yesterday complained about delayed compensation after losing their loved ones to wildlife attacks. Guticha MCA Mohamed Yussuf told the Star on the phone many families are suffering because the Kenya Wildlife Service is taking too long to process payment. He said the most affected are families that have lost their breadwinners. Women and children are living in misery, the MCA said. “Some families lost their loved ones to snakebites, lion and hyena attacks over five years ago. They are yet to be compensated, despite their claims being approved,” Guticha said. He said monkeys and baboons take over farms along the river when farmers plant their crops. Guticha said many families are languishing in poverty because their source of income has been destroyed. Guticha said victims of human-wildlife conflict are unable to seek specialised treatment because they lack money. Compensation should be done swiftly for the injured people to get appropriate treatment, he said. The MCA said the KWS should find ways of controlling animals to minimise human-wildlife conflict, including fencing Malkamari Game Reserve. Mandera county KWS warden Adan Alio said Sh521 million will be paid as compensation. “Since 2014 to date, we have received 659 cases. Once funds are released, we will dispatch the money,” he said. Records seen by the Star show 34 deaths occurred because of wildlife attacks. Each will get Sh5 million as per the 2014 Wildlife Act. Alio said there are eight cases of crop damage by hippos and elephants. “We have only compensated two deaths at Sh10 million, we are waiting for money to settle the remaining cases,” he said. Many deaths in Mandera are due to snakebites in dry areas of Elwak, Lafey and Takaba.
