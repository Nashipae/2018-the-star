The county government has demolished illegal structures along Kangundo Road to allow construction of the Kangundo Road market. The Sh800 million project, in Embakasi West, will accommodate over 4,000 traders and will help decongest county markets increasing access to quality, affordable and sustainable food for a healthy Nation. Governor Mike Sonko who was accompanied by executive members Veska Kangogo (Devolution), and Mohamed Dagane (roads and transport) on Thursday said, “The market will provide an opportunity for women and youth to engage in trade for decent livelihoods.” The project will take 12 months to complete. The county will also utilise part of Sh28.2 billion set aside for the fire department to put up two fire stations in Waithaka and Kangundo road in a bid to decentralise fire services. The project has however faced challenges in commencing construction work due to encroachment on the land by private developers. The station will have fully equipped fire engines, ambulances, boreholes and other facilities that will enable the county to respond to disasters in a timely manner. The residents of Mowlem ward and the surrounding wards are set to be the greatest beneficiaries.
