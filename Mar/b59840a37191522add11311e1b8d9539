Six Egyptians accused of being terrorists and charged with being in the country illegally were acquitted on Wednesday after their documents were found to be valid. CID officers arrested Ahmed Ramadan, Abdelsasal Khalifa, Mohamed Mohamed, Mohamed Shamir, Mohamed Elysayed and Mohamed Ali in Bomet a week ago. They were,however, handed over to Kisumu-based anti-terrorism police for interrogation. When they appeared before the court for the mention of their case, the prosecution applied to withdraw the case saying investigations established they had proper documents. Bomet Principal Magistrate Pamela Achieng therefore granted the prosecution's application to set the six free. Lawyer Geoffrey Kipng'etich, who represented the suspects, thanked the court for dismissing the case but criticised police for arresting and detaining his clients without allowing them legal representation. “We ask security officers to be careful when conducting investigations into such matters. My clients were branded terrorists and dragged around cells ... so humiliating,” Kipng'etich told the press. Mohamed said they had been in the country for more than six months for business. “We were shocked when police raided our house and arrested us yet we had done nothing wrong. But we are happy that we are free," he said. Click here for the latest political news
