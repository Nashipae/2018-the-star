The University of Nairobi student who died at Kenyatta National Hospital after a potentially life-saving brain surgery was performed on the wrong patient will be buried on Saturday in Kitale. The body of Angelo Miano, 25, is at the Cherangani Hospital mortuary. The second year Bachelor of commerce student was knocked down by a boda boda in Kericho and rushed to KNH with a blood clot in the brain.

Miano’s father, James Muthee, believes his son would be alive had he undergone the surgery. “I received a call informing me my son had been knocked down by a rider and they were looking for an ambulance to take him to hospital,” he said. Commerce students’ leader Washington Junior said Miano’s colleagues will demonstrate in Nairobi today morning. Health CS Sicily Kariuki suspended KNH CEO Lily Koros and clinical services director Dr Bernard Githae over the mishap until investigations are completed. But yesterday, politicians from Kericho, Koros’s birthplace, protested, saying they would impeach Kariuki if she does not reinstate the CEO.

They said Koros should not be treated like a “scapegoat” when medical officers blunder. “We all know KNH is one of the implementing agents of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four. We are told Koros is one of the hardest nuts to crack who has made it difficult for cartels to operate at the facility. All these scandals we are seeing are aimed at spearheading her ouster,” Cheruyoit said. Click here for the latest political news
