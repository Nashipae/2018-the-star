Britam Life Assurance Company last weekend scooped the top award at the Association of Kenya Insurers Agents of the Year awards held in Nairobi. The company has now won the award for the third year in a row, which according to the association confirms its status as a leader in life insurance category in spite of strong competition from some of its competitors. Speaking during the event, AKI chairman, Patrick Tumbo said that 293 insurance sales agents met the rigorous prerequisite criteria to qualify as top performers in the industry. 67 per cent of the qualifying agents were women. "The awards continue to attract industry performers from leading firms across the country. We are happy that women are owning the insurance space,'' said Tumbo Among top winners from Britam Insurance was Anastasia Muthoni who was recognised as the agent who brought in the most business. Samson Muthee from Kenindia Assurance was presented with the Persistency Award, which recognises agents with a good record of business retention over the last three years. Jubilee Insurance clinched the most improved company, having 93 of its agents qualify for the awards up from 22 the previous year.
