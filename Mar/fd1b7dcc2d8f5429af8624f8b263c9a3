Boda boda operators have refused to vacate the Central Business District, despite constant arrests, officials have said. City askaris are currently on a crackdown to arrest boda boda riders operating within the city centre. Notorious operators have ignored the crackdown. Speaking to the Star yesterday, county director of operations at the inspectorate department Peter Mbaya said the crackdown will continue until all riders are pushed out of the CBD. “Our work is to arrest. The operators go back to the streets after paying fines,” Mbaya said. About 200 operators are arrested daily. More than 800 were arrested on the first day of the crackdown two weeks ago. “The reduced number of arrests means most operators have started following the law,” Mbaya said. City Hall has collected Sh5.6 million in fines from owners of impounded motorbikes since the crackdown began. A few operators who spoke to the Star yesterday said they cannot vacate the CBD because they have nowhere else to work from. They said they will remain at their workstations, despite the risks of arrest. “I have been operating in the CBD for almost two years now. I have a family to take care of so I can’t stop my work,” Joe Gitagama said.
