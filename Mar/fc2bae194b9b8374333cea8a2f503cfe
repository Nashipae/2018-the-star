Lecturers at Moi University yesterday said they will not go back to class until an amicable solution is found to end the strike. The lecturersâ€™ strike is now in its third week. The dons say their legal team is working on an appeal to stay the High Court ruling that ordered them to go back to work yesterday. Chapter secretary Jack Willis Abok said no lecturer will go to class. They said the court did not consider many issues before issuing the ruling, adding that the status quo remains until their appeal is heard by the Appeal court. They said some residents and government officials are urging them to return to work for the sake of the students. The lecturers questioned why they were not considering the plight of the lectures. They are pushing for the implementation of the 2017-21 Common Bargaining Agreement. Read:Labour court orders lecturers to return to work on Monday
