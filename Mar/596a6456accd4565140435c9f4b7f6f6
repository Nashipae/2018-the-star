Several legislators from the Mt Kenya region are frequently visiting the North Rift to assure Deputy President William Ruto of the Kikuyu community’s support in 2022. Mathira MP Rigathi Gathagua and Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri said Ruto has earned support to succeed President Kenyatta because he is a hard working hands on politician. Gachagua, speaking during a fundraiser in Eldoret on Saturday, said, “We will not back Ruto because he supports President Kenyatta but because he has proved to have a vision and good plans for the country.” Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has also been a frequent visitor to the region. He says the Kikuyus have already made an irreversible decision and no one will violate the decision he termed a sure bet, a cheque made out to the DP. Others who visited the region included Central Kenya business community figures. Influential business woman Mary Mungai and Eng Anthony Mwaura said the Kikuyu community does not behave “like political watermelons” and the decision to back Ruto is rock solid. She said that because Nasa has joined hands with Jubilee, Ruto will have the easiest way to State House. “We have about five million votes in the Central region and come 2022, Ruto can bank on six million votes as a start. No one from the community will vote elsewhere,” she said. Mungai and Mwaura cautioned the Kalenjin community not to be divided in their support for the DP ahead of the 2022 elections. “For us, we have already made that decision to back Ruto and maybe it will be you, the Kalenjins, who will let him down by being divided. Please support him and don’t look back,” she said.
