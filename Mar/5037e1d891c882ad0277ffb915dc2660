An Education ministry official has warned individuals threatening to grab Tambach Teachers’ Training College land that they will be arrested and charged. Some residents claim the 80-acre parcel is their ancestral property. But Chacha Mwita, the director of field coordination and co-curricular activities, yesterday said the land will not be repossessed. The college was established in the 1940s and former President Daniel arap Moi was among the first tutors. He headed the institution between 1948 and 1955. “We shall take the necessary steps to ensure the college stands without any external influence,” Mwita said. He told security agencies and ministry officials in Elgeyo Marakwet, where the TTC is located, to stop encroachment on the college. “Anybody who has reasons to claim ownership of Tambach Teachers’ Training College should write to the Education ministry Principal Secretary,” Mwita said. Some county leaders also want the institution upgraded to a university and have proposed that it be named Kerio Valley University. Some board members opposed the idea.
