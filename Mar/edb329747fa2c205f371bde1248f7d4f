Reduced funding to the counties would not affect President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda, the national Planning department has said. Last week, governors and senators said cutting allocations would hurt service delivery. The Planning unit said it will outline the Medium Term Plan to be in line with the agenda to be rolled out to all other departments, including counties. PS Julius Muia yesterday said the MTP will outline policies, programmes and projects targeting broad economic growth, including that aimed at achieving sustainable development goals. He said the plan will also emphasize structural transformation of the economy to increase the share of manufacturing and industrial sectors. “The third MTP will carry forward and complete programmes and projects initiated during the second MTP,” Muia said.
