National Super League leaders Bidco United will be seeking to extend their lead when they face second-placed Western Stima today at Moi Stadium Kisumu. In the absence of the Kenyan Premier League, which was shelved to pave way for the Fifa international week, football enthusiasts will be entertained by the second tier action, which will feature nine matches on the cards. Bidco, who have 14 points to their name, are ahead of their host on goal difference and will be chasing maximum points at a venue which has proved hard for visitors. Bidco head coach Leonard Saleh is determined to register victory in Kisumu against all odds. “We are ready for the match and I am happy with the kind of determination and psyche being displayed by my players ahead of the match. “The match will be tough considering Stima will be enjoying the home support. Our goal is to get the three points against Stima. There are no injuries in my line up and I am looking forward to a great encounter.” A win for Bidco will fortify their lead with 17 points while a win for the Richard Makumbi coached Stima will see them topple their opponents. Meanwhile, struggling pair of Administration Police and Nakuru All Stars will lock horns at Camp Toyoyo. Nakuru are yet to record a win this season and the return of Ezekiel Akwana as the head coach is set to rekindle their quest to remain in the league. Akwana left the Nakuru based club before the season begun but after a change of guard he was reinstated to save the club from sinking to Division one. AP are placed 18th with four points. At the same venue KCB will have to do without the services of their tactician John Kamau and midfielders duo of Kimechwa Brian and Chrispinus Onyango who are who are way with the national team when they face GFE 105.Modern Coast Rangers host Talanta at Mbaraki Stadium.
