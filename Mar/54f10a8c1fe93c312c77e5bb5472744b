A popular comedian is debt-ridden. The funny man, who gives off an air of success, is on a very short leash with his debtors. One of them sent auctioneers his way a fortnight ago to get hold of his BMW car. The comedian pleaded with them, and based on the grapevine, he parted with some cash to get them off his back for a while.Â It puzzles many, who know the comedian because on social media, he is always out and about at events emceeing, or at corporate gigs grinding. Pundits have whispered that the comedian could be spending his money on Nairobi slay queens, expensive booze and frivolous wants. It is not clear, though, if he will still have his shiny new BMW at the end of this month if he doesn't pay up.
