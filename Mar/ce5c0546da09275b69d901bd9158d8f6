The Agriculture ministry is seeking a Sh2.5 billion supplementary budget to pay maize farmers. PS Richard Lesiyampe yesterday said they had not anticipated to buy so much maize from farmers. “This is the first time in 10 years that the government has been able to buy such a huge amount of maize from farmers totaling 3.3 million bags,” he told the Star on the phone. “In the past, we have only managed to buy about 1.5 million bags.” Lesiyampe said they have so far paid Sh7.5 billion but still owe Sh2.5 billion. Farmers in the North Rift last week said they may not plant on time due to the delayed payments for the maize delivered to the National Cereals and Produce Board. The NCPB is buying maize from farmers for Sh3,200.
