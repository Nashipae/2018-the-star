Logging continued unabated in Embobut Forest, Marakwet East, on Sunday despite a 90-day ban issued by Deputy President William Ruto on February 23. Cedar trees were cut cut down less than 1km from Kenya Forest Service offices in Tangul, sparking outrage. Residents claimed KFS wardens were involved in the logging. “KFS wardens who were conducting an operation recently cut down cedar trees. They started loading the logs on lorries yesterday morning. Residents found them,” resident Elias Kimaiyo said. He called for urgent intervention to stop the illegal loggers from continuing the destruction.
