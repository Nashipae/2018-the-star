A 26-year-old butcher is admitted to a Nairobi hospital after he was shot in a scuffle yesterday morning between police and meat traders at the Kiamaiko goat market. Also admitted to hospital is a police officer from Huruma Police Station who was pelted with stones by the butchers in Eastlands. Ibrahim Aden’s head was grazed by a bullet as police battled a mob of youths that had that attacked a police officer. The youths were angered after police attempted to arrest a suspect said to have robbed a man of Sh10,000 and a mobile phone. A fight broke out at about 6am. Yesterday, hundreds of youths mainly from Soko ya Mbuzi where Aden worked as a butcher stormed the Huruma Police Station.They demanded to see the commander. Some youths who were armed with kitchen knives threw stones at officers investigating the shooting of their colleague. Kiamaiko is a busy goat market with slaughter houses and butcheries. The area is chaotic. It used to be notorious and dangerous. Even police didn’t want to visit some areas. There are also some rogue youths pretending to be meat dealers and brokers. In the past police reports cited radicalisation in the area. However, there’s another side to the story. Some of the area is improving and the slum economy is growing. Kiamaiko meat market is one of the three places that provide a steady supply of goat meat to city dwellers, besides Njiru and Dagoretti slaughter houses. MIXED PICTURE Unlike the majority of Kenyan slums where unemployment, insecurity and crime are rife, Kiamaiko has seen more jobs and small businesses flourish as a result of the goat market. Residents say the goat market has changed the expansive slum — once notorious for guns and thugs — and even attracted investment. Since the slaughterhouses expanded, there have been job opportunities and businesses have started.
