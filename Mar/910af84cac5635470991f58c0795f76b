Kipchumba Murkomen is sorry for politician Moses Wetang'ula as he is a "casualty" of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition chief Raila Odinga’s unity pact. The Elgeyo Marakwet Senator said this on Friday, adding the attempt to remove him as Senate Minority leader is due to political realignments. “I sympthatise with Wetang'ula because he is the casualty of that handshake between the President and Raila,” the Senate Majority leader said in Iten. ODM Senators moved to replace Wetang'ula with Siaya Senator James Orengo but the former said he will not go down without a fight. Wetang'ula is Bungoma Senator, Ford Kenya leader and one of the four National Super Alliance leaders. He, Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Musalia Mudavadi (Amani National Congress) asked to meet Uhuru for their own discussions on the deal with the Opposition. They also met in Karen, Nairobi, on Friday to discuss the divorce from Nasa. At that meeting, Kalonzo and Mudavadi threw their weight behind Wetang'ula.

KOT speculate Murkomen noted the pact has united Kenya and put economic growth on the right path. He urged the President to meet Raila's co-principals “You are our
President ... I appeal to you to also open your doors to Kalonzo,
Wetung'ula and Mudavadi. It is good for everyone to get the President’s
handshake,” he said. "Persistent bickering has wasted our country. Even our foreign
currency investment has been wasted.” Murkomen hit
out at critics who say the deal will puncture Deputy
President William Ruto's 2022 presidential bid. It increases Ruto’s
chances of succeeding Uhuru, he said, adding opponents are speaking out of ignorance since they are not privy to discussions
between Uhuru and Raila. “Kenya now
has one President at Harambee house,” he noted. Click here for the latest political news
