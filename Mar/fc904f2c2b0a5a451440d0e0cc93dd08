The Airports Council International has recognised JKIA for its excellence in customer service. It was named the best-improved airport in Africa in the 2017 ACI Airport Service Quality Awards. In January, Interior CS Fred Matiang’i made a surprise visit to the airport and found many work stations unmanned. He ordered mandatory training of all JKIA staff to improve service delivery. The CS also directed vetting of taxi drivers. JKIA has been undergoing reorganisation and modernisation as it seeks to claim its position as a regional hub. In January, the JKIA Service Charter was signed promising to provide consistent, professional and high quality service. In 2015, President Uhuru Kenyatta launched Terminal 2, which cost Sh1.7 billion, to handle 2.5 million passengers annually. The terminal was projected to increase JKIA’s capacity to 7.5 million passengers a year. “Today’s recognition shows that the measures we have put in place to improve services are beginning to bear fruit. The benefits of all agencies working as a team are clear to see. We still have a lot to do, but I believe we are on the right track,” Kenya Airports Authority CEO Jonny Andersen said. The ACI ASQ Survey as a benchmarking programme captures passengers’ experience at all airport passenger contact points.
