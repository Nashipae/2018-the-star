Babu Owino has claimed that President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto had a hand in the court verdict nullifying his elections as the Embakasi East MP. "The whole nation knows that this is a war between the president and the deputy president versus Babu. It is sad that the government is controlling the Judiciary," he said. "No one can destroy me. If either Uhuru or Ruto decides to vie against me in Embakasi East I will beat them seriously." Speaking after the Court ruling, Babu said he will appeal the decision noting that he will still emerge the winner of the constituency. "The judge ordered a scrutiny but we will appeal the decision. Any weapon set against me shall not prosper," Babu said. Babu alleged that his dismissal was due to him opposing the government. "... the government was not legitimately elected by the people of Kenya," he added. Justice Joseph Sergon said the elections were not free and fair and ordered Babu to pay Sh5million as costs The judge also said there were errors and irregularities during the election process.
