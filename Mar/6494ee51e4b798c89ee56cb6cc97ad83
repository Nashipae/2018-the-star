Some 800 IDPs in Eldume camp, Baringo South subcounty, are appealing for help, saying life has become unbearable with the start of the long rains. The IDPs fled their homes following a bandit attack on Mukutani Full Gospel Church on March 11 last year. Eleven people were killed, many others injured, 1,500 livestock stolen, shops looted and at least 100 houses torched. The rains started pounding the area four days ago. Jarida Barkitore yesterday said her three-year-old child has been diagnosed with pneumonia. “The old tents donated last year by the Kenya Red Cross Society are torn and leaking ... where are we to sleep with our young children?” she said. Barkitore appealed to friends and well-wishers to give them tents and warm clothes. Appeal for food aid Betty Lesarangan said they are dying of hunger. “The last food donated by government and the Red Cross was in May last year,” she said. At least 400 schoolchildren have dropped out of school after they fled with their families. Those who have opted to continue with their studies go to the nearby Ol-Samburmbur Primary School, which is now heavily congested. On Sunday, Marigat-based human rights activist Amos ole Mpaka urged the government to fast-track provision of relief food. He also urged Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i to move fast and resettle bandit attack victims in Baringo. “It is unfair that Kenyan citizens, including innocent children, are still leading dehumanising lives years after Independence,” Mpaka said. On Wednesday, Baringo county commissioner Henry Wafula said the government will donate relief food. “I have already written to the department of Special Programme notifying it of the dire hunger situation,” he said. Wafula urged people living on low-lying areas to move to higher ground as the heavy rains are likely to cause flooding. He also urged the county government to use funds set aside for disaster to buy food for hungry residents and banditry victims.
