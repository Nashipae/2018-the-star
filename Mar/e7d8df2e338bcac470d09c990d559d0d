A top ODM official has denied claims
of misappropriation of funds by the party’s executive. Timothy Bosire (Treasurer)
termed as erroneous, reports that the party cannot account for some millions
paid as donations and member contributions. The Star reported on
Thursday that some top officials accused of plundering resources have
panicked after lawyer Edwin Sifuna took office as ODM secretary general.

"For the record, ODM is an
institution that receives funds from the Kenyan public directly, and through the
Political Parties Fund." "We are, therefore, obligated to account for all receipts and
payment and the same to be audited," Bosire said in a statement. He said, no issues of
misappropriation, misrepresentation of material facts or systemic defects have been raised by the auditor
general in his reports. "Our
members will be pleased to know that the last such audit was concluded only
three weeks ago, and feedback was nothing but commendation of our stewardship
of resources,"  the former MP said. He
blamed ODM rivals for the allegations saying the claims are meant to divert the
party’s attention from the struggle for electoral justice and against the entrenchment
of autocratic rule. "We
see a simplistic tactic of diverting us and Kenyan public from pursuit of the
same. We assure the Kenyan people that we shall not take our eyes off this
ball," he said. Click here for the latest political news
