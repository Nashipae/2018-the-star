Last week, social media was suddenly abuzz, a dead lion had been sighted in the park. A few caring people immediately responded and drove to the place where the incident was reported. Sadly on identification, it was revealed that a well-known young lion named Sirua had indeed been killed by another dominant lion. Although no one actually saw the fight to the death, the prime suspect is Sirikoi, a lion who dominates the Athi basin area. There is also a lesser possibility that the duo of Cheru and Sam (other prime males) who dominate the central zone of the park could have killed him. However, irrespective of exactly how he died, the tragic fact remains, that the “blond prince” of the Nairobi National Park is no more. It is believed that Sirua was sired through the bloodline of Mohawk the Magnificent, who also died tragically two years ago. He was about five and a half years old and starting to enter into his prime years. No doubt other prime lions do not like it when young lions start to threaten their territory. It is a documented fact that only one in eight African male lions achieve full maturity. It is believed that Sirua did, however, sire some cubs in his short life. Siru was becoming a magnificent lion in almost every way, powerfully built, with a blond mane. He spent most of his days with his maneless brother known as Masaka. We fondly remember many sightings of them together into the area between junction No 10 and the rim of the Athi basin, with one of his favourite places being the waterhole with the mounds near No 10 junction. Rest in peace, Sirua. Goodbye, blond prince  The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00.
