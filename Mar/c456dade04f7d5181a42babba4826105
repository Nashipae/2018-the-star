Renowned Ghanaian actor and preacher Majid Michel will come to Kenya in May, when he will unleash his other life to his fans in Kenya. The award-winning actor of many Nollywood movies will tour Nakuru county for five days from May 12. “In the eyes of many Nollywood movie fans, he is just an actor,” says his host, Ghanaian apostle Michael Ayitey. However, Majid is a born-again Christian. He turned over a new leaf in May 2016 after giving his life to Jesus. In early 2016, the handsome actor was spotted ministering to a congregation at the Zoe Chapel International, Tabor, in Accra, Ghana, before word went round about his salvation. “He is coming to Nakuru for the first time, and I believe he is going to be a blessing to the land and his fans. Nakuru is about to be blessed by the ministry of the great man of God. We will be having a number of programmes, including training,” says Ayitey. He says his newfound love for preaching is a genuine one inspired by his understanding of the Bible. For some time now, Majid has been spotted in churches in and outside Ghana, ministering. In 2016, Majid, in an Instagram post, criticised pastors who seek wealth and fame instead of winning souls and leading their congregations to Christ. He said some pastors these days do not focus on the dictates that come with their job, but rather meddle in immoral acts and compete against each other for fame and wealth. Apostle Michael is a writer and powerful revivalist, with God's grace being his favourite topic. The apostle, who is a theologian and a philosopher, says he does counselling for youths. He is also a marriage counsellor, which entails pre- and post-marital issues. He is set to launch his new book, 'My Destiny', during Majid's tour in Nakuru. “My main audience is church workers, associate pastors, assistant pastors and employees in general,” the apostle says. "In this book, I teach how to fulfil your destiny by running another man’s vision.”
