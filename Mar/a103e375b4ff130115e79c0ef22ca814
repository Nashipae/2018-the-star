City traders and politicians in
Nairobi have lauded the new found political friendship between President Uhuru
Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga saying it will greatly stabalise the country
creating conducive environment for business. Business owners, led by Jubilee politician
Francis Mwangi, say they have suffered huge losses during past political clashes pitting the opposition and the government. “We all recall what Nairobi went
through during Nasa demonstrations. Some
businesses were looted and vandalized but a good peaceful environment we
have been asking for is now here with us,” Mwangi said. He said the handshake between
Uhuru and Raila will now open more opportunities between western and Central Kenya “We are now ready to go round the
entire country explaining this new found peace to the people and how beneficial
it is. Time for politicking is over,” he added.
