Busia ACK bishops have backed President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga’s unity talks. Speaking during the burial of Katakwa Diocese founder Timothy Akwara on Saturday, area bishop John Okude and his Nambale counterpart Robert Magina said they fully support Uhuru and Raila’s calls for reconciliation. Magina praised the move, saying it will change Kenya’s political equation for the better. The bishops called for the inclusion of religious leaders in the negotiations. “Kenya is not only for the two political leaders. It belongs to all of us,” Magina said. He asked for county leaders to also reconcile after the hotly contested election. “We had polarised elections. Let people sit down and talk for the sake of peace,” he said. Okude asked NASA co-principals Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang’ula to support the Uhuru and Raila reconciliation talks, regardless of whether they were involved. “Raila is their team leader.” Okude said. Akwara, 94, was buried in Aboloi in Teso North subcounty.
