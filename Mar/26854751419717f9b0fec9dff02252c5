Lawyer Miguna Miguna, who is still at Dubai International Airport, has set the record straight on Hassan Joho saying they have never communicated. In a statement on Saturday, the General of the National Resistance Movement said the Mombasa Governor has never called or written to him. "I have never received a request either from him, or anyone else, [stating] that he would like to meet or speak with me," he said. "I would have had no reason to decline such a request. I have no ill will towards Joho or anyone else." Miguna said his only "persecutors are the tyrants in Jubilee". He added he has never had the Governor's phone number. "The claims being advanced, that I declined to meet Joho in Dubai, are being done for PR, propaganda or malicious reasons. Kenyans should treat them with the contempt they deserve." It was reported on Thursday that Joho would visit Miguna in a show of solidarity. Spokesman Richard Chacha said: "Names of those who will accompany the Governor and the exact time will be known shortly."
