Governor Sospeter Ojaamong on Monday visited the Busia County Referral Hospital to console the victims of kidney ailments and to witness the operation of the dialysis services. Addressing the press after the tour of the facility, the Governor said he was happy that patients who used to access dialysis services in Kisumu or Eldoret can now access them at the countyâ€™s Referral Hospital. "The only challenge that my government needs to overcome is on the funding for the Renal Unit. We will have to increase the budgetary allocation to cater for more health personnel to man the unit and run the equipment," the governor said. Dialysis services are now available twice a week and the county wants to increase this to at least five or six times, thus the need for more funding, he said. Ojaamong urged patients with kidney problems to seek treatment at the facility and to take National Hospital Insurance Fund covers to settle medical bills. A dialysis patient, Jackson Adeyo, thanked the county and national governments for the facility, saying he used to spend over Sh1,400 in transport costs to access the services in Eldoret. "I have been seeking dialysis services for two years now. I am appealing to the two levels of government to meet transplant costs for dialysis patients. There are people who are willing to donate their kidneys but lack transplant costs," he said. Busia County Referral Hospital medical superintendent Dr David Mukabi said the start of dialysis services at the health institution was a milestone achievement and will get better when the inherent challenges are addressed.
