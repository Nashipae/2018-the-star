The current heavy rains will begin to wane on Tuesday, with temperatures expected to rise again to highs of 30°C in Nairobi next week. The rains will be heaviest this weekend across the country, accompanied by low temperatures. Head of meteorological department Peter Ambenje said the afternoon rains will be accompanied by thunderstorms. “Residents in urban areas are advised to be on the lookout for flashfloods. In dry river beds, moving water may suddenly appear,” Ambenje said. The projections are contained in a seven-day forecast that ends Wednesday next week. It shows the Lake Victoria Basin, highlands west of the Rift Valley, Central and south Rift Valley will be the coldest places next week. Temperatures will sink to 11°C at night, rising to a maximum 27°C during the day. This region comprises the counties of Siaya, Kisumu, Homa Bay, Migori, Kisii, Nyamira, Trans Nzoia, Baringo, Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo Marakwet, Nandi, Nakuru, Narok, Kericho, Bomet, Kakamega, Vihiga, Bungoma and Busia. The rains have helped replenish small rivers and reduced dust, which increased spread of respiratory diseases. It is also expected to replenish grass across the country. However, the weatherman cautioned farmers against rushing to plant food crops. He said these rains will reduce on Tuesday and most parts of the country will be dry on Wednesday. He said these are not the long rains, which are still predicted to start end of March in most places. Ambenje advised farmers to consult their local extension workers to know when to plant. “Continue listening to the local media as updates will be provided if conditions change significantly. Further advisories will be issued as we follow up on the progress of this weather event.” The seven-day forecast comes after the ministry released a three-month forecast predicting depressed rainfall.
