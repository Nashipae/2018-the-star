The call for dialogue was between NASA leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta, not a coalition meeting, Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda (pictured) has said. He said the meeting between the two leaders was critical to unite the country. Ochanda on Saturday said the duo are on a different level of politics and no one from both sides of the political divide should be offended by their show of unity on Friday. “Everyone, including the Church, have been calling on Raila and Uhuru to dialogue. That is what they did on Friday,” Ochanda said. The MP dismissed the notion the meeting came as a surprise to many. Ochanda said other NASA principals should not worry as they will be briefed on what was discussed. The Bondo MP praised Raila, saying this will end the current political stalemate in the country. “It’s time to put behind our political differences and move the country forward,” Ochanda said. Ochanda also dismissed any form of rift in NASA, saying people are only waiting to see the benefits of the meeting. He was accompanied by former Alego Usonga MP Sammy Weya. Weya said to unify the country, the two leaders must be on good terms till 2022, with or without dialogue, for the interest of the country. He, however, urged Raila not to forget to champion for election reforms. Weya asked the other NASA principals to also arrange for a meeting with the President if they feel left out.
