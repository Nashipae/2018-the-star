Many Bungoma private schools have not painted school buses yellow as required by the ministry of Education. The deadline is today. Education CS Fred Matiang’i gave the directive in January. Bungoma county Education director Jacob Onyiego said buses that haven’t be painted will be impounded from Friday. “The directive was given to all private and public schools. I am happy with those that have complied,” he said. Nzoia Girls principal Isabela Aliva said the colour would differentiate school buses. A spot check by the Star on Friday showed many public school buses have already been painted yellow.
