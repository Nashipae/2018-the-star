Leaders and a civil society group are now following up on a case where 48 year-old Andrew Kamau's genitals were chopped off by his wife in Lari constituency, Kiambu county. Sauti ya Wanaume na Watoto chairman James Njenga and nominated MCA Mercy Nungari yesterday vowed to follow up on the case after Kamau refused to testify saying he will not get any justice. "No no, we cannot allow her scot-free. She must be punished by law so that she can be a lesson to others who might be planning to do that their men" an agitated Njenga said. Njenga said a lot men suffer silently adding that their lawyers will investigate Kamau's health including injuries to the head and genitals before taking appropriate action.
