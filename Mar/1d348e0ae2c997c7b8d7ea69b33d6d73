Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga (pictured) will wait longer before he can establish his full Cabinet. This follows a conservatory court order that bars his office from resubmitting the names of some nominees. Rasanga had resubmitted the names of Adrian Ouma (Water), Dorothy Owino (Education), George Rubiik (Governance and Administration) and Dismas Wakla (Physical Planning) for consideration. The nominees had been rejected by the vetting team. Siaya speaker George Okode on Wednesday said the issue will await The courtâ€™s direction.
