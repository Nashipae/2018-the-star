While driving on the tar road towards the main gate in the late afternoon, I saw a tiny antelope eating next to the road. It was a tiny Suni, only found in the forested section, and can be seen if driving very slowly, when they feed on green shoots and leaves. They are very shy and sensitive, and it is rare to get close to them. The suni suddenly ran across the road and went into a thick clump of bushes. I was just about to drive onward, when suddenly the suni emerged from the bushes. I could scarcely believe my eyes. A tiny, minute little newborn lamb was trying to stand and suckle on its mother. Wow! What a super suni sighting, a mega tick on my all time sightings in the park. The lamb could not have been more than an hour or two old, and the mother was trying to force it to walk, as she slowly moved away every time the lamb tried to stand and walk on its wobbly newborn legs. There is always something very precious and special about witnessing the start of a new life. Suni are often mistaken for dik dik. The tiny antelope seen in the forest area are almost always Suni (Neotragus moschatu), also know as “Paa’ in Kiswahili. Even smaller than dik dik, they are the smallest antelope in the park. They vary in colour from fawn grey to chestnut brown on the back with white underneath. Dik dik can be seen on the Western boundary just outside the Masai gate in the Silole sanctuary and near the Cheetah gate. Next time you drive through the forest, be on the lookout for the special suni antelope.  The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00.
