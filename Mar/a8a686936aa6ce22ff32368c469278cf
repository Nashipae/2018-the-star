A Homa Bay MCA will miss sittings for three months and pay a Sh70,000 fine for breaking the Assembly mace. Joan Ogada of Kojwach ward was found guilty of violating Assembly rules and will be required to issue a public apology to her colleagues. The mace, which is the Assembly's symbol of authority, was broken during a scuffle over committee positions on January 29. This was after some
MCAs accused the Speaker of prejudice against some members during the special sitting. On Tuesday, MCAs unanimously adopted the Powers and Privileges committee report recommending the punishment. The committee is chaired by Speaker Elizabeth Ayoo who was injured in the fight.

calling the sitting to remove several committee chairpersons and their
deputies. The Speaker had introduced a motion
to remove the committee heads which was opposed by some MCAs who
started shouting. It was then that Ogada grabbed the mace. "Madam Speaker, we cannot allow you to conduct proceedings contrary to
Standing Orders. This motion cannot proceed," Ogada shouted as she walked away with the mace. She was wrestled down by the members who supported the motion but in the process the mace was broken. Click here for the latest political news
