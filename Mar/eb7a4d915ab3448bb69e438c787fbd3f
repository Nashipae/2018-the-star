Baringo county government partnered with the German government to train youths on technical skills to improve emergency response. Governor Stanley Kiptis said the collaboration will extend to improving health facilities, water resources and boosting education. “After the training, we will start an exchange programme in which experienced youths will go and work in Germany,” Kiptis said. In the deal, the Germans will equip technical colleges and polytechnics for quality training. The deal signed in Kabarnet town on Monday, came barely a month after Kiptis and Baringo Central MP Joshua Kandie made a week-long trip to the European country. Two weeks ago, the county failed to control a fire in Kabarnet. Kiptis said the county lacked skilled people to operate and maintain fire engines. The county will buy two more fire engines.
