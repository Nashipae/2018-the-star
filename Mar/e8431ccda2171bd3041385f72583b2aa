The Pharmacy and Poisons Board has issued a warning to Kenyans against using two anti-snake venoms certified to be fake. They include puff udder anti-venom, registered under Lot No: 000697, and one identified only as ‘anti-venom’, which has no manufacturing date or instructions for use. “Members of the public, health workers, health establishments including chemists and pharmacies are advised to be vigilant and not use these products,” deputy registrar Fred Siyoi said in a statement yesterday. Kenyans are urged to report to the board if any is sold to them.
