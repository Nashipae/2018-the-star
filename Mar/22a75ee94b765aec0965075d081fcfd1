Education players are disappointed by Nakuru’s dwindling performance in national exams. Governor Lee Kinyanjui said candidates who scored E in mathematics totalled 11,314 in 2017. Addressing the forum during the county education stakeholders’ consultative forum, the governor said 2,113 candidates had E mean grade. “Only 13 per cent of those who sat the KCSE last year managed grades that would secure them a place in the university,” Kinyanjui said. Subukia, Kuresoi North and Kuresoi South are among the worst performing subcounties.
