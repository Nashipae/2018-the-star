On the surface, it appears as if the meeting
between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga was
triggered by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s visit to Kenya. But insiders
say the meeting was a culmination of quiet behind-the-scenes moves over the
last two weeks. It is proper that the two leaders have met,
but it is regrettable that such a meeting had to take this long, and at the
behest of foreign powers, to happen. Yesterday’s handshakes on the steps of
Harambee House are reminiscent of the 2008 ritual, albeit with a smaller cast.
After months of conflict and loss of dear life, Raila and Uhuru have, just like
Mwai Kibaki then, agreed to unite the country. Like the armistice that
gave birth to the Grand Coalition government and the National Accord, the two
leaders have set up a working team on the unity agenda. Ten years since 2008,
the nation is still reeling from the unaddressed Agenda Four items of the
Accord. While it is noteworthy that that the two
leaders have recongised their personal responsibility in resolving the
historic, decades-long, ethnic animosity traced to their parents, they should
also take steps to mitigate the immense loss of life and property by victims of
their brinkmanship and make a public admission of the same.
