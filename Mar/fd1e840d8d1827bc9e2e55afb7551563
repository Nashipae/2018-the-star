The government has not overlooked the spate of killings in Mt Elgon but is very much concerned, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa has said. He said security is every Kenyan's right and thanked residents for voting for Jubilee in last year's election. "There is so much in store for Bungoma from Jubilee because you people voted wisely and are deeply in the government," Eugene said. He was speaking on Wednesday at Mabanga Farmers' Training College in Kabuchai constituency during the awarding of Wilson Khaemba as a principal chief. The function was attended by all chiefs from the countyâ€™s nine constituencies. Khaemba has served from 1981 as a police officer and a chief. Eugene said the government will not interfere with the provincial administration's work but will empower it. "As I go back I'm going to ask [Interior CS Fred] Matiang'i to find a way of giving chiefs, especially those in Mt Elgon, motorcycles so they may assist in combing out criminals," he said. He said principal chiefs like Khaemba should be given cars for easy service delivery. He urged chiefs to practise integrity to climb up the ladder. "The state is aware that the chiefs are the ones who stay with wananchi and get real information on how things are on the ground and there is need for them to work comfortably," he said.
