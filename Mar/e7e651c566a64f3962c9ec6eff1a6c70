STARRING: Clare-Hope Ashitey, Beau Knapp, Michael Mosley, David Lyons, Regina King BASED ON: The Major by Yuri Bykov GENRE: Crime drama RELEASE DATE: February 23  Pete Jablonski is a white cop with a young family, but his life drastically changes when he accidentally runs over a black teenager. Out of fear for losing his life, Pete calls up some of his cop buddies, who help him cover up the evidence of his crime. They leave Brenton (the kid in the accident) out in the cold to be found by people in the morning. The case ends up on the desk of a black lawyer by the name KJ Harper. Before the case, KJ was struggling with many things in her life. She uses the case to her fight for justice in a broken system. Meanwhile, the aftermath of the accident causes wide racial tensions in New Jersey. Brenton’s parents and the black community insist on finding out who the actual killer is. Pete is ridden with guilt and wants to confess his crime. But the cover-up had been done by several police officers, which would mean they would be indicted, too, for being part of the crime. Thereby exposing the corrupt system that was meant to protect and serve the people. The story and the ensuing conversation is not a new one, but it is relevant and current. It’s a story we see on television almost on a daily basis, and the outcome is almost always the same, too. So watching the show feels like a déjà vu moment with no suspense, because we know how it will end. But the acting from the main cast is exceptionally strong and does all it can to draw us in. With the real highlight of the show being Regina King’s portrayal of a grieving mother seeking justice.  Star Rating: 3/5
