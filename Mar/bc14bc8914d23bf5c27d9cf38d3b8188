Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has said he will go for nothing short of the presidency in 2022. This is in the wake of reports that Deputy President William Ruto wants to rope him into his circle. There are also reports, though dismissed by Ruto, of talks for Kenya's second in command to back Joho. Through his spokesperson Richard Chacha, Joho said they are neither privy to Ruto's plan nor have they been talked to. "We have not been approached. Our focus is on the presidency," he said. But Joho failed to rule out future negotiations saying: "We will also reach out to others". The ODM deputy party leader said they are listing people who will help him become the president. Last week, Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir said Ruto was aware of Coast MPs' plan to convince him back Joho. He said this would be in the spirit of working together and unity bid by President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition chief Raila Odinga. The two 2017 poll antagonists resolved to drop their differences and unite the country. Joho has welcomed the Uhuru-Raila handshake and observers said they will not rule out his partnership with Ruto or Uhuru. Majority Leader Aden Duale was on Monday quoted saying Joho and other governors are in contact with Ruto. "We
have already made inroads in Western, Coast and Kisii region, but it is
now time to cement the new-found relationship," Duale said. The lawmaker said Josphat Nanok is the
one mobilising NASA governors to join hands with the DP. Others targeted are Amason
Kingi (Kilifi) and Charity Ngilu (Kitui). Also read: DP Ruto intensifies 2022 campaign in drives disguised as official duties Click here for the latest political news
