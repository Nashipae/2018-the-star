The Court of Appeal has quashed a death sentence imposed on a man convicted in 2011. Ibrahim Watua was said to have violently robbed a woman and killed two people in Bungoma. “In the absence of sufficient evaluation by the High Court, it cannot be said that the evidence was credible,” the three-judge Bench ruled. Justices Erastus Githinji, Hannah Okwengu and Jamila Mohammed said Watua’s appeal was allowed. They added that the convictions for robbery with violence and attempted robbery were quashed and the sentences set aside. Watua was convicted and sentenced for two offences of robbery with violence allegedly committed on the night of July 4, 2009. Watua, while in the company of others, allegedly robbed Catherine Nekoye of Sh10,000 at Sella Bar, Miluki shopping centre, armed with an AK47 rifle.
