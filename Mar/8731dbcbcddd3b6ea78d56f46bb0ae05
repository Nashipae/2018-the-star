More than 100 PSVs were impounded in a crackdown in Kitengela, Kajiado county, yesterday. Administration Police and county government inspectorate officers conducted the joint operation led by Trade executive Jackline Koin. An equal number of drivers were arrested. Those arrested were handed over to Traffic police, who will then charge them with offences ranging from dropping and picking up passengers in undesignated points to obstruction. “We will use our bylaws to charge those picking up passengers from undesignated areas, which attracts a Sh5,000 fine,” Koin said. Most of those arrested were tuk tuk, matatu and bus drivers. The crackdown started at 5am. The officers accused indisciplined PSV drivers of causing unending traffic jams in the town. “We will investigate allegations that some saccos are members of the outlawed Mungiki sect. We have information they have infiltrated the transport sector and are illegally demanding money from vehicle owners,” Koin said. She said a high-level security meeting held in Kajiado last week identified Kitengela as a haven for Mungiki members.
