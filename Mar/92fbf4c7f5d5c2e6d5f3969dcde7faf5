The solar power generator disconnected by ERC at Remba Island was operating without a permit and tariff approval, the regulator has said. The Energy Regulatory Commission said Dream Green Power (K) Ltd sought their guidance on the installation but commenced operations without following the set-out procedure. The energy regulator, in a statement on Monday, held that it acted within the law to dismantle the power vendor's facility. The March 15 raid by the commission officials at the island attracted criticism from members of the public. Kenyans on social media castigated ERC for the move saying they could have directed the power supplier on the right process than plunge the island residents in darkness. The regulator further said Dream Green was levying connection and power supply charges on the consumers without the commission's approval. "Further to this, the National Environmental Tribunal had on January 18, 2018, issued a stop order for setting up and construction of the mini-grid at Remba Island." During the raid, the person who was found in charge of the solar power plan was arrested. He was arraigned at the Mbita law court. The man was charged with the offence of operating an illegal electricity generation and distribution business without a permit, contrary to the Energy Act 2006, Section 27 (2). ERC says the mini-grid had the potential to expose the public and consumers to dangers of electrocution and fires as its compliance with the applicable technical standards and codes is yet to be ascertained. "The commission wishes to affirm its support and backing of innovation in the energy industry. However, all operations within the industry abide by the law," the agency said. It further warned that the safety of the consumer cannot be guaranteed where the power supply has not complied with the necessary technical requirement.  Click here for latest political news
