National Bank of Kenya CEO Wilfred Musau, who is facing allegations of sexual assault, has accused the defendant of blackmail. In court documents, the NBK boss accuses Asanta Luku of resorting to a smear campaign against him after a botched promotion bid. Denying the sexual assault and harassment claims, Musau and NBK questioned why Luku resorted to social media before exploring internal mechanisms. The bank executive says the manager either refused or failed to appear before a committee set up by the board to probe the matter and instead chose to rush to court. “I am aware of the allegations against me made in this suit were first disseminated and/or published, in form and substance, in various social media platforms including blog pages and twitter accounts of those bloggers,” Musau said in a sworn affidavit to the Employment and Labour Relations Court. The bank said the case was filed in bad faith with a vendetta objective as the employee first reported it to the bank in January, yet the alleged assault happened in October last year.
