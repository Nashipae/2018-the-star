The Auditor General has been ordered to investigate the NLC over Sh2.8 billion Standard Gauge Railway compensation. The Public Accounts Committee chaired by Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi wants Edward Ouko to verify whether the payments in 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17 were made in accordance with the Constitution. Wandayi yesterday said the committee was concerned by failure by the Muhammad Swazuri-led commission to respond appropriately to queries raised by the Auditor General and failing to provide supporting documents. Ouko should verify whether the commission established the lawful ownership of all parcels before recommending compensation. “The Auditor General should check whether there exists any lawful excuse or justification for failure to respond to audit queries on this matter for an inordinately long time. The special audit report should be tabled before the committee within 60 days,” he said. The watchdog seeks to to establish whether the compensation was fair, equitable, comparable and without favouritism. “The Auditor General may rely on the Constitution, statutes, parliamentary reports, information from the NLC or information from other personal entities to enable him to finalise this special audit expeditiously,” Wandayi said. Last week, the NLC was taken to task over failure to submit valuation reports for SGR land compensation. Swazuri and director of valuation and taxation Salome Munubi told MPs Ouko had yet to verify how the compensation was made a year ago.
