An activist is in court challenging new stringent traffic rules and wants suspension of an order disabling eCitizen password of driving schools countrywide. Okiya Omtatah says the decision made on December 29 2017 to disable the eCitizen passwords of driving schools and of officers of the Driving Test Unit of the National Police Service, has effectively shut down operations of most driving schools around the country. Also sought is an order to suspend, with immediate effect, the public notices announcing a scheduled vetting by an interagency taskforce of all driving schools and Public Service Vehicle Operators within Kenya. The impugned public notices clearly state that failure to comply within the 14 days of the notification will result in the automatic cancellation of the affected partiesâ€™ licences. The rules being challenged are yet to be gazetted as law. He has sued the Cabinet Secretary transport and National Transport and Safety Authority. Among other things the new rules requires that each and every driving school should own not less than 1.7 acres of land upon which it must develop facilities and infrastructure of a model highway. The driving school should own classrooms measuring 8m by 6m, and equipped with ICT teaching aids such as computers and projectors. It also requires each and every driving school to have a management structure constituting school manager, a secretary, instructors, and a director of studies who are at least diploma holders. And now Omtatah in his application says the new rules amount to harassment. He says there was no effective public participation in the development of the law. Omtatah argues that if the court doesn't intervene immediately affected driving schools be bankrupt and eventually collapse.
