Gospel artiste Mash Mwana has achieved so much in life through his music.Â Through his redemption, he found favour with God. This is how he ended up becoming a gospel artiste and an interior designer at the same time. The
interesting part is, he has never gone to an interior design school, but
acquired the skill through a close friend. "Kuwa
mtu wa interior design is the same as music. In music, kuna vile beat
unapanga. Kuna utamu flani unajua kuweka. Na pia kuna flavour flani
unajua kueka. Nyumba pia inataka hivo. It's the same thing," Mwana said. He's
been designing houses for two years now, and it's one of his side
hustles as a gospel artiste. Last year, he got an opportunity to design former Kitui West MP the late Francis Nyenze's house in Kitui, before the MP passed away. Nyenze was
one of his best clients, as the late MP was friendly and kind towards
him. This opportunity was massive. He got a chance to meet someone great
and design one of the best homes. "RIP, Francis Nyenze," he said. The Groove award winner was born in the ghetto at a place called Sinai, into a family of pastors. At a tender age, he dropped out of school and joined a gang and became a thief to sustain his drug addiction, almost dying in the process. However, through the grace of God, he got an opportunity at a Tanzanian Bible school, and this is how his life changed. "I reached a place in life nikaanza kuskia ni kama nakufa. Mabeshte wangu wakaanza kumadwa. Alafu kwa spirit yangu nikaanza kufeel pia mimi na madwa, and I could feel the spirit of death haunting me. I went to church nikasmama kwa corner and told God heri unifanye chizi kuliko nikufe. At least I'll live for long," Mash said.
