Drug users in Lamu have accused the county government of refusing to help them kick the habit. There are no rehabilitation programmes, yet many addicts are willing to start a new life free of drugs, they say. In interviews with the Star in Lamu town yesterday, the drug users accused some county officials of playing “mind games” with their misery. They sign them up for rehab, but later disappear, leaving them hooked on drugs. Drug user Aisha (not her real name) said they are concerned that people were taking advantage of their plight for personal gain. They want an audience with Lamu Governor Fahim Twaha so they can explain the problems and find a way forward. “I have been on drugs for more than 10 years. I started using after my parents divorced and I was left alone. I really want to stop if someone helps me. County officials tell us to give our names, then they disappear. We are residents of Lamu, we need help,” Aisha said. Drug user Mohammed (not his real name) urged the county to set up rehab centres. “We have been hearing of plans to set up a rehab in Hindi for years, but nothing happens. Addicts in Malindi and Kwale are lucky — they have methadone treatment centres to help them quit. We need the same, we are tired of fake promises,” he said. Lamu Deputy Governor Abdulhakim Aboiud denied the county has turned a blind eye to the plight of drug users. He said tht through The UN Office on Drugs and Crime, the county is establishing a special unit at the Lamu King Fahad Hospital for addicts. He said it is 50 per cent complete and staff has been trained. After the first failed war on drugs at the Coast, some youth fled ‘treatment centres’ that they said were useless and worse than life on the streets.
