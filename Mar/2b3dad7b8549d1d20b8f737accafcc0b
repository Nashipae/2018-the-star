Gabu of Punit has been doing a lot of solo projects which gave us the idea that P-unit has broken up. In an interview with Mpasho, he said last year they had taken a break since Frasha was more inclined to politics then, and he was working on his new project which is his recording label, Kompark Recordz. We asked him to clarify the rumors that he is the type of guy who refuses to pay bills in clubs, considering in his song featuring Jalango, Kristoff and others, they say: "Bill ikicome mimi silipi baby ninajifanyanga niko sleepy." He said its a rumour because he pays for what he drinks and not other people's drinks, if he has not invited you to come through. "Music is music, when I go out with you, I know I will pay and buy for you, but when you come where I am and start ordering things because Gabu is there, Gabu is not your father, I pay for what I drink. Even if my friends come with girls, they will sort them out, I am not a charity." For him, it's crazy how rumours spread so fast because he is a celebrity. He also talked about another rumour, where he was accused of beating a waitress at XS millionaires. Gabu laughed and said he respects women and appreciates them, so he can never assault them. "I was in the right place at the wrong time, guys were fighting and because I am the one who is known, ikakuwa ni Gabu. I appreciate and respect women."
