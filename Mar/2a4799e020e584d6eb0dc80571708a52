Environmentalists have raised concern of Lake Naivasha water level dropping to alarming levels despite the ongoing heavy rains in various parts of the country. Fishermen too are affected following a drastic reduction in the population of Tilapia fish. Lake Naivasha Water Users Association (LanaWrua) chairman Enock Kiminta said two key rivers flowing in the lake had dried up following human activities upstream. He cited rivers Karate and Gilgil that have completely dried up while the only surviving river Malewa has its levels on all time low. Kiminta said the lake levels stood at 1,887.4M above sea level against the normal 1,892M and expressed fears that matters could get worse if the ongoing rains stop. "The three days of heavy rains are over and we do not see more showers coming. This could spell doom for the lake that is already facing several environmental challenges," he said. Kiminta told journalists after a tour of the lake on Wednesday that conservation efforts should be prioritised in water catchment areas. He cautioned residents living along rivers against massive water abstraction. "We welcome the ban on logging...we should all make sure that we plant trees as Naivasha is largely dependent on the existence of this lake," he said. His sentiments were echoed by Charles Owino - a fisherman, who said the shallow ends of the lake are muddy hence difficult to navigate. Owino said though it has rained for the past one week, the levels are down hence making it impossible for them to access key areas for fishing. "We now have to use boats with engines to access the high waters for where we lay nets other than what we used to do several months ago using normal boats." Click here for the latest political news
