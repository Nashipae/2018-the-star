Two Iranians (pictured) acquitted of terrorism charges have filed contempt of court proceedings against Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet at the Supreme Court. Ahmad Abolfathi Mohammed and Sayed Mansour Mousavi, through lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi, say they are being held in the country illegally following a court ruling on February 23 last year. Ahmednasir says despite an acquittal order, the two Iranians remain in police custody at the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit in Nairobi Area, Upper Hill. He said this is in complete disregard of an order issued by this Court. The failure on the part of the state to comply with this courtâ€™s order constitutes not only an abuse of public office, but also offends the dignity and authority of court, he said. In the application filed under a certificate of urgency, the two Iranians want the court to cite Boinnet for contempt of the court order and be committed to civil jail for a no longer than six months. The Iranians were initially jailed for 15 years after being convicted of concealing 15kg of RDX explosives that they allegedly planned to use to bomb the Israeli Embassy in Nairobi six years ago. The Supreme Court judges, led by Chief Justice David Maraga, had ordered the two be held in custody pending an application by the Director of Public Prosecutions seeking to quash their release. Ahmad and Sayed also said they are being held in deplorable conditions in the police cells.
