Governor Mike Sonko’s administration yesterday was ordered to pay Sh18 million to 18 employees as compensation for unfair treatment. Judge Mathew Nduma of the Employment and Labour Relations Court awarded each complainant Sh1 million after they proved the county used unfair labour practices against them. This must be enforced within 30 days. In 2015, Barbara Wanjiku, Mwanaisha Kitang’u, Geordiadis Gitonga, Catherine Mukiri, Alvin Cheptoo, Lilian Akoth and 12 others moved to court. They said they were employees of the county on permanent and pensionable terms. Some of their three-year contracts were to end on May 25, 2014, and others on December 17, 2014. They said that on January 24, 2014, the national government, through the Health ministry, directed the county to absorb them on permanent and pensionable terms once their contracts expired. They said City Hall ignored the letters and refused to absorb them as directed. “We felt cheated and commenced industrial action, including strikes and go-slows, aimed at getting the county to absorb us as directed,” they said in court documents. The industrial action resulted in a return-to-work formula and written commitments by the county that it would honour its part of the bargain. The court declared the complainants became employees on permanent and pensionable terms once contracts ended — one group on May 25, 2014, and another on December 17, 2014. City Hall will have to issue employment letters, pay each complainant allowances in arrears from the date of expiry of their contract at Sh27,000 per month and pay the costs of the suit. “Considering the facts of this case and the law, the court awards each claimant Sh1 million for the violation of human rights and subjection to unfair labour practices set out in this case and proved by the claimants on a balance of probabilities,” Nduma ruled. The employees had sought an order that the county issue them with employment letters as was directed. During the hearings of the suit, the county purported to issue the employees with letters of employment dated February 15, 2016, with a commencement date of July 1, 2015. “The first, second, third, fourth, seventh, eighth, ninth, 11th, 12th, 15th and 17th claimants’ contracts expired on May 25, 2014,” the court was told. “They were supposed to be employed on permanent, pensionable bases from May 26, 2014 and not July 1, 2015 that was unilaterally fixed by the respondent. “Likewise, sixth claimant’s contract expired on December 16, 2014, and his employment in permanent and pensionable terms was to commence on December 17, 2014.” The court also said employment letters issued to the employees on February 15, 2016, show they were employed as community health assistants III, but should have been hired in job group H — community health assistant II.
