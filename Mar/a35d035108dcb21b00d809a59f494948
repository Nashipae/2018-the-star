The Kenya Tea Development Authority has been asked to formulate policies that ensure farmers get more benefits than middlemen. Cherangany MP Joshua Kuttuny said tea farmers are subjected to numerous taxes that eat into their earnings. Speaking in his constituency on Saturday, Kuttuny said KTDA to also start paying farmers from profits derived from power generation and insurance cover. “Farmers are part of the kitties. I wonder why they are only paid the low amounts from tea supply,” Kuttuny said. He was addressing Trans Nzoia County Sacco Society during an AGM at Kapsara. The lawmaker said farmers in Rift Valley and Western regions were paid as low as Sh60 per kilogramme yet middlemen were selling the same kilogramme at Sh300 in Mombasa. He promised to introducing a bill in the National Assembly to fix the disparity and ensure farmers are well paid
