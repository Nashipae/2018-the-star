With the swearing-in yesterday of Chief
Administrative Officers and Principal Secretaries, we can safely say that
President Uhuru Kenyatta’s second administration Cabinet is now fully
constituted. Notwithstanding the fact that there are legal challenges pending
over the appointment of CASs, the buck now stops with those who have taken the
elaborate oaths to serve the public. Words such as transparency, accountability,
honesty, integrity, and sacrifice rang out of the hallowed boardroom at State
House as the top civil servants took the solemn oath of public service. The President for the umpteenth time since he
took the oath on November 28 warned sternly, “No one will be spared for engaging
in corruption and abuse of office.”  There will be no calls from above, he
stated. Not from him or his deputy. He wants to lead the nation to take a great
leap forward and all should support him. The task of nation building is not for
the government or President alone but every citizen. We hope this will inspire
citizens to release their energies for the next five years and beyond. His task will be made much easier if he
allows the institutions of governance and those tasked with the watchdog role
to function independently. That includes the Judiciary, Parliament and the
Press. From here we can only promise one thing: We
will be watching.
