Mandera county security operators have narrowed down on six individuals believed to be behind the killing of five officers in Fino, Lafey ubcounty, on Friday last week. Fifty heavily armed militants attacked two camps on the border town before retreating to Somalia, five kilometres away. Northeastern regional commissioner Mohamud Saleh on Thursday said the Fino attack could have been a revenge mission. Those killed include four APs and a national police reservist. The confrontation lasted three hours. One AP officer, national police reservist and a local sustained minor injuries. A Safaricom mast was destroyed when the militants threw a hand grenade at it to interrupt communication. Saleh said the community helped narrow down on the six suspects.  AMNESTY “These al Shabaab operatives causing mayhem are local youths who work with their counterparts from neighbouring Somalia,” said Saleh. “We have their names and are working closely with the local administration, their relatives and the Somali government to make sure they are apprehended. They crossed over immediately after the attack.” The additional six suspects brings to 41 the total number of Kenyan-born al Shabaab militants in Mandera on the government watch list. Saleh two weeks ago while in Mandera gave an ultimatum to 35 locals whom he said were working with al Shabaab. The number who sought anonymity is unknown. Meanwhile, Fino MCA Saad Ahmed urged the government to deploy special forces on all borders, adding they are better equipped to fight terror.  'LETTING US DOWN' “I also urge the government to quickly reconstruct both the Fino AP and police station camps where all the structures were completely destroyed by the insurgents,” he said “The KDF must also come out of its comfort zone at the camp. They came all the way to serve Kenyans. Let them do it with the zeal it deserves. We’ve always been proud of them, but it is time we confessed that they are letting us down.”
