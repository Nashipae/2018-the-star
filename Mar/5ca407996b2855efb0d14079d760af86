The club is directly opposite to the Bungoma police station and the houses of the police bosses. The thugs made away with cash, alcohol and a few electronics after making their way to the main club. The death sparked protests in the town with angry residents blaming the police for laxity. “If somebody can be brutally killed a few meters from the police headquarters and the official residence of all the police bosses and county commissioners, this really puts to question our security as citizens,” Caleb Barasa a resident said. Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati blamed police for sleeping on their jobs saying the killing in the county were now alarming. “The rate at which our people are being killed has become a matter of grave concern, the security apparatus should up their game or leave the county,” he said. He said he had on many occasions raised concern with the security team but had done nothing to stop the ruthless killings. Mt.Elgon MP who also joined the protests called on Bungoma county commissioner to ensure that the killings are stopped. The killing of the guard comes barely a day after another bodaboda operator was killed only a few meters from this incidence.  Click here for the latest political news
