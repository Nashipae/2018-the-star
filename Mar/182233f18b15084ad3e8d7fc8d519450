The Mandera county government plans to use Sh50 million to refurbish the region’s slaughterhouse and bring it to modern standards. Governor Ali Roba said on Saturday the upgrade will start in July. He toured the facility. It will have a new waste management system to ensure proper sanitation, which is key to protecting the health of workers and residents. “We’ve set aside Sh50 million that will be used to rebuild the slaughterhouse. It will have new blocks, a cemented floor and an elaborate waste disposal system,” Roba said. “Our people’s health is of paramount importance and when the butchers’ association raised concerns over deteriorating health conditions at the facility, we had no option but to move with speed.” The facility slaughters four camels, four cows and 60 goats daily. The National Environment Management Authority has set out conditions to be met to ensure the slaughterhouse does not endanger residents’ lives. Nema county director Josiah Nyandoro said on Saturday his department will carry out an environmental impact assessment of its septic tank. He said all the employees must wear protective gear.
