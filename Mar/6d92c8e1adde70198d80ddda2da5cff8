The Nairobi Assembly has adjourned until March 13 to allow public participation on the county integrated development plan. The MCAs are expected to lead residents from the 85 wards in ensuring that views sought by the Executive were captured in the CIDP On Thursday, Majority leader Abdi Guyo emphasised the importance of the exercise and urged all elected members to take it seriously because its part of the budget-making process. "We all must be present because all our ward projects can only go through if they arewell captured in the CIDP." The CIDP was concluded last year but Kilimani MCA Moses Ogeto says it was not given the right impetus by the Assembly. "We did not take the exercise seriously last year and ended up with projects we never asked for," he said. ""We now have an opportunity to ensure that the much-needed projects are given priority in budget allocation." Initiatives the MCAs want prioritised include completion of stalled road projects, building of modern kiosks in all wards and improvement of health facilities.
