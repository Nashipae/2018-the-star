Nation Media Group has condemned police for attacking journalists covering the drama around lawyer Miguna Miguna at the JKIA. Among those assaulted were NTV cameraman Robert Gichira and Citizen reporter Steve Letoo. Gichira sustained deep wounds
in his left arm while his camera and other equipment were damaged. Letoo was treated at a hospital and discharged. Journalists Sophia Wanuna and Bonny Kirere were also at the scene. Many of them noted their displeasure via social media networks and declared they would not bow to intimidation for doing their jobs.

"The brutalising of Kenyans by the government, which is becoming an almost daily occurrence, is not a confirmation of [its] democratic credentials. On the contrary, it is a breach of rights," he said. Kiboro said the media house will address Interior CS Interior Fred Matiang'i and IG Joseph Boinnet on Gichira's ordeal. He maintained that security agencies must respect the rights of other institutions to execute their mandate as provided for in the law. The chairman further asked courts, the public, media organisations and the international community to intervene and take appropriate action against the government's attempts to abrogate the rights of Kenyans. But Dennis Itumbi, who is State House senior digital communications director, is of the view that police did well as "journalism is not an absolute right". He said "ugly scenes" cannot be showed at international airports anywhere in the world.
