Environment CS Keriako Tobiko has directed the Kenya Forest Service chairman to replace all officers currently deployed at Kibiku, Ololua, Thogoto, and Ngong Road forest stations. This followed mainstream and social media reports of massive destruction of forest resources in the said areas. "The officers should be replaced immediately and suitable teams assigned," Tobiko said in a statement on Sunday. He also directed the immediate suspension of the Plantation Establishment and Livelihood Implementation Scheme within the same forest stations. He said this pending an independent status assessment. Tobiko further directed KFS to commence forest rehabilitation programmes including replanting of indigenous trees and ensuring total protection of the forest block. "My office will also receive daily progress reports on this exercise from today," he said. Last week, Deputy President William Ruto commissioned a 10-member multi-sectoral taskforce that will review forest management across the country. "The ongoing focus on my 2022 presidential bid can be turned into a crusade of attaining 10 per cent forest cover by 2022. It will greatly help reclaim our forest cover," he said. He unveiled a task force to unearth problems ailing the forest sector. Ruto said matters to do with water catchment areas should not be politicised.
