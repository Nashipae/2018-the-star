Kiss FM breakfast show presenter Adelle Onyango says being nominated among the 100 women on OkayAfrica will amplify her social activism. Speaking to Word Is, she highlighted what she hopes to achieve with this level of international recognition. "Just as with the BBC100 women’s recognition, I want to have conversations on giving youth opportunities, cyberbullying and rape, globally. OkayAfrica happens annually, where they list down people to recognise the efforts of women who are inspiring change in their fields. Last year, the likes of Yvonne Orji from the hit TV show Insecure was on the list! It’s a huge accolade!" Adelle said. She also talked about her journey. "Well, a year ago I told my team that one goal was to be recognised as one of the top media personalities in Africa, and we did! So it’s putting my mind to something and ending up achieving it! But it’s a lot of work! The constant work to see your dream projects take off. Sometimes sleep becomes a luxury, which is unhealthy, but what do you do? Nothing worth having or worth achieving comes easy! There are always challenges that aren’t there to make you give up but just sharpen your craft." Adelle encourages anyone with a dream but is faced with challenges left right and centre, barring them from going after their dream, not to give up.
