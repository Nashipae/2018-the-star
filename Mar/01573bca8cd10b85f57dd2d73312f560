A seasonal river in Turkana county burst its banks on Friday leaving motorists stranded for hours. Heavy rains raised the levels of water at Kalemorok river, rendering routes to Lodwar, Lokichogio and South Sudan impassable. Commuters stood at its banks contemplating their next moves and waiting for the water to subside. Residents Joseph Ekai and John Esekon asked the government to construct a bridge at the river so learning and other activities are not paralysed. Rashid Ekai, a lorry driver, called for road repairs and the construction of a modern bridge over it. "Drivers opt to use Uganda-Busia road to South Sudan because of the poor state of the Lodwar-Lokichogio-South Sudan route," he noted. It took about 12 hours for the water levels to decline. A drift at Kainuk, along the Kitale-Lokichar-Lodwar-Nadapal corridor was also overtopped by floods. The Kenya National Highways Authority therefore asked motorists to wait for the water levels to decline. "Apply absolute caution on all drift areas along this corridor," the authority warned in a statement. "Do not attempt to cross any sections of the road that are overtopped by floods." KeNHA said Kainuk bridge was intact and in use by light vehicles and pedestrians. The bridge has collapsed several times in the past due to heavy rains.
