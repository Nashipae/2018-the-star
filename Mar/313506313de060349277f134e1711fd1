Farmers in the Rift Valley have faulted the government's plan to allow importation of more than six million bags of maize from Uganda. They say the National Cereals and Produce Board is still receiving maize produced locally. The farmers on Saturday said about three million bags of maize are yet to be delivered to the NCPB depots. Uasin Gishu Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno urged the state to ensure all maize from local farmers is bought and they are paid before imports are considered. He wants the government to release more than Sh4 billion owed to the farmers by the NCPB. The government has already allowed millers to import the maize from Uganda to help reduce the prices of maize flour. Senior Minister in the Ugandan government Michael Walikhe, who was in Eldoret last week, said the two governments have agreed on the plan to have the maize brought into Kenya. He said Uganda has a surplus of maize, unlike Kenya. Maize in Uganda is going for about Sh1,800 per bag. “We have agreed to have the surplus brought to Kenya so it can help reduce the high cost of maize flour,” Walikhe said.
