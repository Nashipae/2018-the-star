The Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital will increase its ICU beds from 25 to 30. Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago said level five hospitals will be upgraded to reduce congestion at MTRH, which will only handle serious referral cases. He said Trans Nzoia, Nandi and Elgeyo Marakwet counties are improving their facilities to reduce referrals to MTRH in Eldoret. He spoke on Thursday when he hosted a delegation from USAID and and the US-funded Ampath HIV and Aids project that is based at the hospital. USAID health director Randolph Augustin led the delegation that included Ampath chief of party Sylvester Kimaiyo. Mandago and Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno discussed how to tackle the spread of HIV. Statistics indicate men are afraid to be tested and the highest number of infections are found in people between 15 and 25 years. Mandago said educating residents will help stop HIV spread. “I talk to over 1,500 people on weekends. If we have statistics and information, we can easily reach many,” he said. “If we repeat information over and over during meetings, it can sink in and we will make big steps.” Mandago urged elders to educate boys undergoing circumcision about HIV. Chemno said residents should be told during church services and social gatherings about the importance of testing. It can be treated and people can live normal lives, he said. “Pastors can talk to men and the message is driven home,” Mandago he said.
