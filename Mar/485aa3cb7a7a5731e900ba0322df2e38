The Moi Stadium in Kasarani should be open for business next month, Sports Cabinet secretary Rashid Echesa has said. While on a tour of the facility, Echesa said: “I have talked to the contractors who are working on the stadia as well as sports Kenya who have assured me that all will be done in a month’s time. We have to start hosting games here as soon as possible.” The closure of Nyayo and Kasarani stadiums for renovations has affected various sports events like the Kenyan Premier League, which has been forced to find alternative venues for the season. The CS also had a stern warning to individuals who had encroached the expansive Kasarani land that stern action will be taken against them. “We are going to liase with the police to evict the encroachers and any ministry official found to have colluded with them will face the full force of the law without fear or favour,” a visibly upset Echesa warned. Earlier, Echesa launched a five day workshop on the governance of the Sports Academies. The countrywide programme is intended to seek and nurture talent in all the 47 counties across 25 disciplines. “Our main aim is to devolve sports to the grassroots. He noted he grassroots and have a sufficient feeder for our sports teams and federations form all ages. This is something achievable as we eradicate the cartels in between the team selections,” he said.
