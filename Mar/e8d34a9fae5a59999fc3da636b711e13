All the counties have been directed to file records of pending bills at the Office of the Controller of Budget and Auditor General within the next two month. The bills amount to about Sh40 billion. The CoB has written to all the county governments and county assemblies asking them to verify the pending bills for payment. Uasin Gishu county assembly speaker David Kiplagat told MCAs during debate on Tuesday the bills are a burden to county governments. Meanwhile, Nandi MCAs have initiated a fresh process to audit and verify county debts amounting to Sh1.3 billion. The MCAs last week rejected a report presented by Governor Stephen Sang on debts incurred by the county government. The county assembly said the report prepared by a task force appointed by Sang is defective and has loopholes. Speaker Joshua Kiptoo said the fresh audit will be carried out by experts. “The report does not have the input from parties like the contractors who are demanding to be paid millions of shillings by the county government,” Kiptoo said. The audit on former Governor Cleophas Lagat administration's expenditures shows attempts by contractors to fleece the county of more than Sh670 million in fictitious claims. The contractors are demanding payment for 656 projects undertaken between 2013-17. “Most of the claims are fictitious and the county cannot pay for such using public money,” Sang said. When Sang took over the county had Sh759 million in its accounts, which was not enough to pay the debt. The construction of the governor’s office and Kipchoge Keino Stadium are some of the pending projects. A Sh103 million two-storey building was recommended, but an additional floor was later approved at a cost of Sh21 million.
