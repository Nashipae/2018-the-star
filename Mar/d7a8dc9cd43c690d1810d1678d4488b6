Inspector General of Police
Joseph Boinnet, Director of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations George
Kinoti and Immigration Principal Secretary Gordon Kihalangwa were yesterday fined Sh200,000 each by
High Court judge George Odunga for contempt of court. By so explicitly and brazenly ignoring court orders in the
sordid Miguna Miguna saga, the Government of Kenya has got itself into an
infinitely worse situation than if it had simply complied.
No law allows the State to ignore court orders. The money is to be paid from their own
pockets. That's a slap on the wrist compared to the magnitude of their offence. The top security officials of the nation, whose job is to enforce the law, have shown nothing but utter contempt for the same law. This impact of the streak of disobedience will be both immediate and long term. Consider for a moment if members of the public emulated the Jubilee administration's attitude and the anarchic end. It is simply untenable. Miguna is a chaotic and loud personality who has determined to make capital out of his situation rather than opt for an amicable settlement. But government officials are worse off for breaching their oaths of office to protect the
Constitution. The state cannot be in competition with presumed offenders in breaching the law. It is in the business of winning the public's confidence.
