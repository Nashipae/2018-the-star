Teachers in Kisumu have demanded the immediate implementation of improved house allowances as approved three years ago.
Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers Kisumu executive secretary Zablon Awange yesterday said the delay has demotivated teachers. He accused the Teachers Service Commission of not addressing the issue despite the reminders. The TSC did not map and code schools in the city expected to ensure teachers benefit from the inclusive city allowance implemented on July 1, 2015. Awange said teachers in Kisumu East subcounty, Kisumu Central and West are not getting the allowance.
The TSC chief executive, Nancy Macharia, on September 16, 2016, said consultation on the matter with the Salaries and Remuneration Commission are ongoing.
