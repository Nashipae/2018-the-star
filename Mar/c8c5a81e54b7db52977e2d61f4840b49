Sweet potato farmers in Migori county have started forming cooperatives to weed out middlemen exploiting them. Farmers drawn from Kuria West and Kuria East subcounties said for a long time they have lost money to middlemen who buy their products cheaply and sell them for huge profits. Currently, an extended 90 kg sack goes between Sh1,000-Sh1,500 in Migori. At Wakulima Market in Nairobi, a similar sack retails for Sh3,000-Sh3,500. Farmer Chacha Maroa from Kehancha said the sacco will also help in value addition for products like crisps, flour and biscuits.
