Coast leaders are resolving to seek divine intervention to form a unifying political vehicle for the region. Efforts to form a Coast party have been thwarted on several occasions due to bitter rivalry between leaders. “We have tried this unity thing for ages but it doesn’t seem to work. Maybe it is time we seek a different route,” said political activist Naomi Cidi. Speaking on Saturday during the burial of Alice Maitha, who was the wife of the late tourism minister Karisa Maitha Cidi said leaders should seek God's hand through departed coast leaders. "Alice should go tell Karisa and other Coast leaders there we have failed to unite. I send her to seek my mother and sister in heaven and all other Coast leaders so they can beg God to unite us,” she said. Kaloleni MP Paul Katana, who was also in attendance, said for Coast to have its own political vehicle all leaders must unite first. “The unity is more important. If Raila Odinga shook hands with President Uhuru Kenyatta, we at the Coast need to shake hands. I would like to see  Gideon Mung’aro (former Kilifi North MP) shake hands with Governors Amason Kingi and Hassan Joho,” he said. Kilifi South MP Ken Chonga said the Dabaso declaration must be revived.The declaration, which was killed just days after it was made due to political rivalry, refers to a political statement made on January 4, 2014 at Dabaso in Kilifi North constituency. However, nominated Senator Christine Zawadi said that the unity talks should be led by female leaders because male leaders have failed. The coast region is an opposition bedrock however, after the now famous handshake between Uhuru and Raila on March 9, the region has expressed willingness to work with the Jubilee government.
