The National Construction Authority has ordered the demolition of Nandi Governor's office, saying it was unsafe and dangerous. The three storey building is still under construction. The contractor was suspended by the county early last year. On Monday, NCA officials said the building is unstable and must be demolished. It has developed huge cracks on its unstable wall. Engineers said the pillars were substandard and water from the roof freely flowed to the basement. The foundation cannot support the three floors of the building. County executive for Infrastructure Hillary Koech said the invited NCA engineers to ascertain the status of the building after it developed cracks. The county had spent Sh124 million on the structure. Another Sh10 million has been allocated for its completion. The previous administration contracted Korso Enterprises Limited in a controversial tender to construction the building in 2014. The construction was expected to cost less than Ksh. 100M, and was to be complete within 25 months from the initial plan. However, Five years down the line, the building is yet to be completed despite the fact that the county had settled all the payments to the company. Governor Stephen Sang had planned to vote in ksh. 20m in the 2018/2019 financial year for completion. The building was meant to house all county devolved departmental offices. However, in random inspections, it was established that the building was weak as it had developed dangerous signs and was likely to collapse. “This prompted the us to summon NCA who are experts in the field to give us a clear direction on the way forward and it’s sad we have to bring it down,” Koech said. Finance executive Alfred Lagat said resident engineers will be held responsible for the loss. Officers from the Authority also carried out inspections on the Kipchoge Keino stadium under construction and were satisfied with the quality of work.
