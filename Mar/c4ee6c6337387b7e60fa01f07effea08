Trainees joining primary teacher training colleges from next year will be required to study subjects that prepare them to handle children with special needs. The government prepares to rollout a new framework in the colleges to replace the current P1 certificate with diploma qualifications. Basic Education PS Belio Kipsang (pictured) yesterday said the new framework is ready and would be rolled out by next year. This will be a shift from the current system in which teachers focus on children with no hearing, physical and visual impairment. Teachers will have to be conversant with special needs education to fix the shortage of teachers in the special-needs schools.
