Police in Kilifi have launched for a man hunt for a woman who allegedly dumped a day old baby in a church pit latrine. This is after the neonate was on Friday retrieved in a church pit latrine in Zowerani village, Kilifi County. The neonate was discovered on Friday afternoon by a resident who had gone to relieve himself. It is believed he was dumped in the morning. Zowerani sub location assistant chief Tecla Chai who led the rescue mission said she was notified of the incident by the church pastor and deployed members of the public in trying to retrieve the baby boy. “I was called around 1pm by Pastor Peter Mwangala. He said a man had gone to the latrine and heard the baby crying. We managed to create a hole and retrieved the baby,” said Chai. The baby was later taken to the Kilifi county hospital high dependence unit (HDU) where medical officers said he is in stable condition after the two hour rescue operation.

This is indeed a miracle because most likely he was dumped in the latrine in the morning. His body was covered in faeces and the umbilical cord was still intact which means the baby has been delivered today,” said Chai Kilifi police boss Alexander Makau police have launched investigation into the matter. He appealed to members of the public to assist the police in giving out information on who the mother could be. Chai said already Nyumba kumi ambassadors are helping in tracing the mother. “This is someone from the same area so we are going to get her. This is sad and we must get this culprit,” she said.
