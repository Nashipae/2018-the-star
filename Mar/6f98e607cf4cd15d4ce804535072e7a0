The IEBC has said it is ready for by-elections in areas where the court has nullified results of last year’s polls. IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukat said out of the 446 petitions filed in courts, about 325 had been determined. “The petitions represented about five percent of the entire elective positions we had and we think that is a good margin indicative of the good work the IEBC did on most areas,” Chebukati said. He was speaking in Eldoret during the post-election evaluation tour in North Rift. Chebukati said the commission is also planning for boundary reviews for all wards. This he said, will cost about Sh8 billion in the next four years.

The commission has so far toured Turkana and will be in West Pokot after Uasin Gishu. On the boundaries review for wards, Chebukati said the process would have to wait for the national population census to be done later this year. “We have wards which are huge in size and some which may need to be merged. The populations have also increased and we are planning to look into all that”, he said. The commission will not change the number of constituencies. He said the IEBC would go out to first collect views from Kenyans when the time comes for the exercise to commence.  Click here for the latest political news
