ARE Raila Odinga’s ODM MPs unhappy with the surprise unity deal between
their leader and President Uhuru
Kenyatta? Well, sources whisper to Corridors that the secrecy with which
the deal was treated has confounded some of his allies. Only Suna East MP Junet Mohamed (pictured) was in the know. Unlike
Jubilee MPs who took to social media to congratulate the leaders on the new
deal, none of the ODM legislators – even those who are always vocal on social
media – congratulated the leaders, as many struggled to understand the deal. ***** JUBILEE leaders were yesterday
busy meeting some of their colleagues pushing for the impeachment of Health CS Sicily Kariuki. The leaders were asking
those who have signed up for the motion to withdraw their support and pledge to
have their grievances addressed in other ways. The question is how many of the
154 MPs will heed the calls? ***** A powerful Cabinet Secretary
who used all tactics to ensure the downfall of a former MP from Nyanza is said
to have threatened the life of the ex-legislator. The CS met six people on his
way to a working tour and reportedly asked them why they dealt with him. It is
not clear what the CS meant, but the former MP, who was informed by one of his
friends among the group, is worried that his life could be in danger. It is not
clear why the CS is determined to deal with the MP by hook or crook. Only time
will tell. ***** OUR politicians it seems have
never learnt from the old adage that there are no permanent enemies in
politics. As news filtered in that Uhuru
and Raila were meeting at Harambee
House, a governor from a Jubilee stronghold known for his loathing of Raila was
saddened. He quickly summoned officials to his office to confirm the news.
 Our informer says the governor was disappointed as there will be no one
to blast every weekend if Raila and Uhuru work together. ***** WHAT prompted an outspoken Opposition
MP to withdraw from tabling crucial documents revealing how some financial
institutions rose from dust to riches through favoritism by previous regimes?
This was the question some MPs in Parliament were pondering after the lawmaker
made a hasty U-turn on the pretext that a senior officer in possession of the
documents was out of the country. The MP's excuse, however, did not convince
all lawmakers as some immediately claimed that his hand must have been greased
to make him abandon his mission that could have put the institutions in bad
light.  Well, that’s what is called  rent-seeking. *****
