Elgeyo Marakwet county government failed to implement 63 budgeted for projects worth Sh78 million, the Auditor General’s report shows. The report unearthed how taxpayers lost money to ‘projects’ that were never implemented in 2016. It cited construction of the Sh52 million governor’s residence near Kamariny Stadium in Iten. The county lost Sh13.8 million on the stalled project. “Physical verification revealed that the site was deserted and the project had stalled due to a pending case filed by locals who were not involved in public participation,” Auditor General Edward Ouko says.
