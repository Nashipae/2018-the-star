Limuru MP has urged MPs to shoot down the Bill proposing amendment of the constitution to create the post of a PM. MP Peter Mwathi yesterday said the Bill by Tiaty MP Kassait Kamket might lead to a referendum, which needs a lot of money to conduct. “This is not the right time to discuss a Bill. It will waste
a lot of time,” he said. The Kamket Bill proposes the creation of the position of a Prime
Minister who will have executive powers. The PM will also be the leader of the
government business in Parliament. Kamket also proposed that President be ceremonial and
would serve a one seven years term. Mwathi supported Deputy
President William Ruto for dismissing the Bill, saying it was wrong for elected
leaders to use political space to manipulate debate on leadership and power
sharing. “The DP advised leaders very clearly on Sunday in Uasin Gishu to concentrate on services of their constituents,” the MP said. Mwathi, however, urged legislators to investigate Kamket,
alleging he might be working for the opposition. “He cannot have the energy to table such a Bill in
Parliament. The
truth must be known if he is working for the opposition or for whom?” the MP said. Mwathi said the Kamket’s Bill was taking back the country to
a parliamentary system, which people rejected when the Constitution was promulgated. “The MP should first study the politics of this country. They
are so open. People are willing to advise him,” he said.
