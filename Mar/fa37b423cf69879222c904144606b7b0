Gospel singer Bahati is in the limelight again.Â This time for a very personal and private family matter that leaked. Sources have whispered to Word is the singer went out and got a DNA test to verify the paternity of his and Diana Marua's daughter. "The DNA results were dropped at the flats where he stays and left in the custody of the person who was at the gate, because there were explicit instructions not to drop it at his house," the source said. The news of the DNA letter got a lot of tongues wagging, as neighbours talked about Bahati's reaction to the letter. No one knows for sure what the results are. When Bahati got back home on Thursday night last week, he was given the letter. "That is when all hell broke loose," a neighbour told Word is. "People kept asking what was in the letter because what ensued was an argument between Diana and Bahati. Even a pastor and his former manager were called to mediate." Bahati was asked to think through things before he made any rush decision. The news of the DNA letter is the talk of the hood, with whispers about the contents of letter making for juicy fodder in the marketplace. Neighbours who heard the drama going down were heard exchanging stories, saying the Ten over ten star was not happy at all. "Alisema akirudi atapiga watu marisasi. Alikua amekasirika sana." When called for comment, Bahati rubbished reports of there being a DNA letter, adding that, "Mambo ya kuingilia familia yangu siwezi ongelea."
