Low income and few urban centres are the main reason of Lamu's poor annual revenue collection annually, Governor Fahim Twaha has said. Speaking in Lamu on Friday, he said very few residents are able to pay taxes and the county lack industries. Twaha said in the last three years, insecurity has dealt the county a major blow to the economy because of travel
advisories which severely dented the tourism sector. “We only collected Sh70 million revenue
last year. Properties in urban centres are yet to be rated for taxation. We have only to major urban centres, Mpeketoni and Lamu. You can’t get much revenue from rural areas. It's a challenge," Twaha said. “The
past state of insecurity has also not done the tourism sector any
good.Literally Lamu has been struggling in revenue collection because we lack
in many ways,”he added. The
governor however said his office was liaising with the county assembly in order
to establish strategies for better revenue collection. “We have other upcoming urban
centres in Mokowe which houses the county headquarters.The same in happening in
other divisions.Our objective is to ensure as many properties as possible in
these centers are rated so we can improve revenue collection,”said Twaha.
