Fourteen counties in the Lake Region Economic Bloc want to set up a development bank and need to raise Sh2.6 billion. The bloc’s interim secretariat head Abala Wanga yesterday said member counties are required to contribute Sh200 million this financial year. They include Kisumu, Siaya, Homa Bay, Migori, Kisii, Nyamira, Bomet, Kericho, Nandi, Trans Nzoia, Bungoma, Kakamega, Vihiga and Busia counties. The bank is to be wholly owned by residents. Wanga said counties should have fully contributed to the fund by the end of October. Kisumu has already contributed Sh100 million, he said. He and others spoke during a strategic partnership meeting between the bloc and the Lake Basin Development Authority at Grand Royal Swiss Hotel in Kisumu. “Members are required to open a special-purpose account with the Central Bank of Kenya and deposit the funds as was advised by the Controller of Budget,” he said. Wanga said county speakers and majority leaders would deliberate on status and financial contributions on March 22. On March 23, county secretaries and Finance executives are to adopt the October deadline for contributions. The bloc, chaired by Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o, plans to hold a summit at Kakamega Golf Club Hotel on March 26 to review its seven main objectives. Wanga said member counties are focused and commitment to projects underway, including the bank. The bloc seeks a joint strategy to fast-track development of collective investments in big project. Wanga said the counties plan to increase investment in specialist hospitals, a lake region ring road, tourism circuit, education centres of excellence and an agricultural commodities exchange centre. Development Authority MD Evans Atera urged counties to exploit investment opportunities. Click here for the latest political news
