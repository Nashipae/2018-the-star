Mwangi applied for his client to be released on lenient bond, saying she comes from a poor family in Nyamira. He told the court the Kemunto used to work as a house maid to support the rest of her family members, who are also poor. However, the magistrate granted the application and ordered her to be released on Sh500,000 bond or Sh300,000 cash bail pending the hearing of the case on April 3. The accused was also directed to be released on the similar bond and cash bail terms in respect of the second count of stealing a child at Kamukunji area, Nairobi county.

He added that preliminary investigations revealed a child stealing syndicate and that the probe will extend to Kisii and Bungoma counties.
