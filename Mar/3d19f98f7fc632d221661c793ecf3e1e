Relegated after just one season in the Kenya Cup, Resolution Kisii and Regional Logistics Mombasa are targeting a quick return to the top tier league. Mombasa finished bottom of the log without a win while Kisii was second last with two wins against Mwamba and Mombasa. Kisii finished the season with 12 points following a 53-6 win over Mombaba at Kisii University on Saturday. Kisii coach Nick Abok and chairman Walter Orangi want to return to the top flight immediately. “ Lack of experience cost us. We played well against top teams and we are grateful for the run we had in Kenya Cup, sadly we have been relegated,” said Orangi. “We want to keep all our players and if possible, strengthen the team. One of the positive aspects is that we have built a fan base which will be crucial when we play in the Championship next season.” Abok, however, blamed lack of a proper pre-season preparations to their dismal showing. “We got it wrong from the pre-season. We would have won matches against Blak Blad, Strathmore and Nondies but we lost due to lack of experience,” he said, adding that he is focused on extending his contract with the team if offered the chance. Kisii, he added, are keen on the national Sevens circuit which starts with the Prinsloo Sevens in Nakuru on July 21 and 22 but regretted their lack of a sponsor. Mombasa coach Chris Atingo also blamed lack of experience for the team’s woes. “We are going back to the drawing board, restructure the team and seek a quick return to the Kenya Cup. We were not physically and mentally ready for Kenya Cup,” noted Atingo. Atingo is also keen on keeping their best players and add a little reinforcements ahead of the KRU Championships kick off.
