Muhoroni MP Onyango K’Oyoo wants an overhaul of Muhoroni Sugar Company management. He asked the government to bring competent receiver managers who can help restore efficient production in the firm, which is on the verge on collapsing. K’Oyoo blamed poor production on non-payment of farmers, poor management, corruption and incompetence of top managers. He urged the county and national governments to expeditiously address the plight of the farmers. K’Oyoo told the Star on the phone yesterday the company should priorities farmers’ payment.
