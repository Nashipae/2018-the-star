President Uhuru Kenyatta
wants his name removed from a case seeking to quash the creation of – and appointments to – the position of Chief
Administrative Secretary. In an application challenging the case filed by activist Okiya Omtatah, the Attorney General argues that as a sitting President, Uhuru enjoys immunity from civil and criminal proceedings under the Constitution. Article 143 states that no civil or criminal proceedings shall be instituted in
any court against a sitting President or any other officer acting in the
capacity in the performance of his duties during his tenure. Omtatah has sued Uhuru, the Public Service Commission, the AG and the Speaker
of the National Assembly. He accuses Uhuru and
the PSC of breaching the Constitution by creating the CAS position without
public participation. Omtatah has faulted Uhuru for not considering the implications on the wage
bill when he created the position in violation of the Constitution. The activist argues that the President
and the PSC violated the Constitution, as they have no power to create positions in the civil service and fill them without using a competitive process. But the Attorney General’s office through Senior State Counsel Jennifer Gitiri says the president cannot be sued
and his name should be struck out from the proceedings. The applicaton is supported by the Speaker who further wants the
court to reject the entire case because the process of approving the nominees is underway and Parliament should be allowed to complete its work. Justice Chacha Mwita directed the parties to argue
the application on February 20. He also allowed a
lobby group—Youth Progress Training Institute  — to be enjoined in the suit as an
interested party.
