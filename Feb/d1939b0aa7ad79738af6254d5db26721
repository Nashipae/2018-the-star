Lupita Nyong'o is still riding a wave of positive press reviews after the critical acclaim her recent movie Black Panther received. The movie has not only been a fan favourite but has also shattered Box Office records with astounding numbers for a superhero movie with a black ensemble cast. And if you thought that was the only good news for the Kenyan Oscar winner, then think again. She will be starring and producing Trevor Noah’s feature film adaptation of his famous book, “Born a crime.” Announcing the news to millions of followers on her Instagram page, she said: “When I read Trevor Noah’s 'Born A Crime,' I could not put the book down. Excited to announce that I will be starring in and producing its feature film adaptation! #BornACrime." Trevor could not keep the excitement to himself either, as he revealed shortly after with additional news, revealing she will take the leading role of his mother in the book. Trevor wrote, “My mom is a powerful woman who could easily be one of the beautiful soldiers in Wakanda. So it's beyond a perfect fit that she would be portrayed on the big screen by the radiant and regal Lupita Nyong'o. I'm beyond excited.”
