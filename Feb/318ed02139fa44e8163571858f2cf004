Mully is the story of a great African hero, Dr Charles Mulli, an
orphan who lived a beggary life but through hard work and faith in God, became a millionaire.Â He dedicated the rest of his life to saving and caring for orphans, street
children, destitute, neglected and other needy children through the Mully Children's Family centre. His philanthropy caught the eyes of Hollywood director Scott Haze, who made it into a documentary movie that has since been nominated for the Oscars. On Wednesday last week, it premiered in Kenya at the University of Nairobi's Manu Chandaria Theatre for Performing Arts. In attendance were Dr Charles Mulli himself, accompanied by his wife Esther Mulli and children, comedian MCA Tricky and investigative journalist Dennis Okari.
