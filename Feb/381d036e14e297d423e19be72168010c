Kenyan Alpine skier Sabrina Simader was ranked 59th in her first run of the Women’s Giant Slalom in the Winter Olympics in South Korea. The 19-year-old, who made her debut in the games, clocked one minute, 23 seconds and and 27 microseconds. Only 67 out of 81 skiers finished their races. The second and final run will take place from 4am on Friday. At 5am on Saturday, the Kenyan will take part in the Women’s Super Giant, the second event in the games. Simader's journey to the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang started when she was just three years old. Her step-father Josef owned a ski lift and took her out on the slopes, acted as her trainer and taught her what she needed to know. Simader qualified for the games after competing in the World Championships last February, making her the second Kenyan after Philip Boit to represent the East African nation at the Winter Games.
