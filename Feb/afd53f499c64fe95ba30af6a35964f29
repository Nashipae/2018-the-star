Five people died and 10 were injured on Monday night in an accident involving seven vehicles in Kikopey on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. Witness Samuel Wambugu said the accident occurred when the driver of a trailer headed downhill lost control and rammed into the vehicles. He said the driver was speeding and crashed into a vehicle causing a pileup. Two other trailers were part of the pileup. The injured were taken to hospital with five in critical condition. Two passengers died on the spot while the other three succumbed to injuries while undergoing treatment at St Mary’s Mission Hospital. Matatu hit first The majority of those who died and sustained serious injuries were passengers on a North Rift Shuttle headed to Nairobi from Eldoret. “The Nissan matatu was the first to be hit and two passengers died on the spot while passengers in other personal cars were seriously injured,” Wambugu said. Transport was paralysed for hours and officers moved in to tow away the wreckages. Gilgil subcounty commissioner Ndambuki Mutheki said the injured are in stable condition. Few accidents He urged drivers to be cautious, follow rules and avoid overtaking and speeding. “There have been few accidents in the last couple of months until the Monday night accident,” Mutheki said.
