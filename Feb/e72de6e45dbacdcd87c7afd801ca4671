Survivors of a Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead are marching in the state capital to press lawmakers to take more action on gun control. Dozens of students packed into a room at the statehouse to meet legislators. It is the first organised protest of the youth-led anti-gun movement that has swept the US since the attack. Thousands of Florida students walked out of their classrooms in solidarity with survivors on Wednesday morning, according to local media. "We're here to ask for change and we're confident change will happen," said Noah Kaufman, 16, "We know the issues, and we know who is with us and who isn't." Many students told US media they stayed awake overnight to research legislation and write speeches. The students arrived on Tuesday as the state legislature rejected a ban on assault rifles like the one used in the attack. They grilled the state senate president Joe Negron on Wednesday over assault rifle regulations.  The Republican did not say he would support any new gun control measures, adding it was, "an issue we're going to look at as we work to develop legislation". Under pressure to act, President Donald Trump on Tuesday backed a move to ban devices that can enable rifles to shoot hundreds of rounds a minute. This bump-stock accessory was used by a gunman in Las Vegas to kill 58 concert-goers last year. The president will host students and teachers at the White House on Wednesday for a "listening session" on gun control. The National Rifle Association (NRA) announced it would participate in a town hall that will be broadcast on CNN on Wednesday evening, according to the network. It was born out of the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland one week ago, the second-deadliest school shooting in US history. For the first time, articulate student survivors of the attack have broken into the much debated topic of gun violence and gun controls, says the BBC's Barbara Plett in Tallahassee.
