Newly nominated Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri has pledged to ensure the price of maize flour is affordable to the majority of Kenyans. He said this would be achieved through increased crop production, irrigation and supporting farmers to diversify on crops. He made the announcement after Laikipia Senator John Kinyua asked him to ensure that maize flour prices come down to at least Sh80 per two-kilogramme packet. Kiunjuri spoke at Kalalu Catholic Church on Sunday. It was the first time the former Devolution CS made a public appearance in his home county since he was re-nominated to the Cabinet.
