Parliamentary committees will next week begin vetting nominees for PS and ambassador. Yesterday National Assembly speaker Justin Muturi formally fowarded the names to the various committees. He directed them to  conduct the vetting within seven days as stipulated in Section 8 of the Public Appointments (Parliamentary Approval) Act. "It is therefore imperative that each of the committees immediately seizes itself of the matter to enable speedy conclusion within the set timelines," Muturi said.
