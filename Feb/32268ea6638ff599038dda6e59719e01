Thika Town MP Patrick Wainaina has said Sh5 million will be set aside from the NG-CDF to roll-out a water harvesting programme in all public schools. He said most schoolgoing children are forced to walk for long distances in search of water and this has been hurting learning. Wainaina spoke on Sunday at St John ACK Happy Valley Church. He said major rivers in the area, including Komo River, are on the verge of drying up due to the hot weather. Athi River, Wainaina said, has been polluted with raw sewerage and effluent from industries. “The weather is unpredictable. Rivers are drying up, limiting provision of clean water by THIWASCO. We have to come up with lasting solutions, especially in our schools,” Wainaina said. The water that goes to waste during the rains will be harvested and stored in tanks.
