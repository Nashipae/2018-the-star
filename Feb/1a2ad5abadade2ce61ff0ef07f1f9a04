Parliament has thrown out a petition seeking the removal of Chief Justice David Maraga and his counterparts from the Judicial Service Commission. In his communication yesterday, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi said the petition filed by Adrian Kamotho could not be addressed by the House, and termed it “pedestrian and misplaced” Kamotho wanted Parliament to remove the seven-member JSC team chaired by Maraga for gross violation of the Constitution, gross misconduct and incompetence. “The House should be pleased to send the petition to the President, for the appointment of a tribunal to investigate the matter expeditiously, report on the facts and make a binding recommendation to the President,” Kamotho argued. But Muturi said the petition was “couched in corporate terms” and Clerk Michael Sialai ought to have verified its admissibility and advised Kamotho accordingly. Majority leader Aden Duale told the House the petitioner was not fronted by Jubilee to “revisit the Judiciary”. “This is a petition that can fit well at Bunge la Mwananchi and we have no interest as Jubilee in the removal of the CJ or the commissioners. It should not be misconstrued as revisiting the Judiciary,” he said. “Once we intend to revisit, we will do it after conducting serious research. A lot of busybodies are filing petitions. They must burn the midnight oil before filing petitions in this 12th Parliament.” Minority whip Junet Mohammed asked the House to formulate legislation on oversight of the Judiciary.
