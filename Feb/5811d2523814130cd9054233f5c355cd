A rights group wants the government to amend sections of the law that violate the rights of persons diagnosed with tuberculosis. Presenting a report yesterday, Kelin said sections of the Employment, Prisons and Public Health Acts are unconstitutional as they do not protect patients. They also act as a barrier to accessing health services, said the Kenya Legal and Ethical Issues Network. Kelin’s report is the first assessment of the legal environment when TB cases are presented in court. “We do not have a law that specifically deals with TB like HIV,” Kelin’s programme associate Timothy Wafula said. The 43-page report also cited the Employment Act, which hinders persons diagnosed with TB to access treatment. They have to be off-duty most of the time because of the side-effects of the drug. All these other laws create loopholes, and the Public Health Act is one that is problematic because it had been previously used to jail TB patients who failed to adhere to treatment. The Prison Act, on the other hand, does not provide for isolation services, putting the health of TB patients and other inmates, at risk. Data from the Health ministry shows that there are about 600 patients diagnosed with multi-drug resistance TB. These patients need to be on treatment for 24 months. In a landmark ruling in 2016, then High Court judge Njoki Ndungu declared that confining TB patients in prison is illegal. She ordered the Health ministry to publish new policy guidelines in 90 days on how patients with infectious diseases should be handled. One year later, an isolation policy is being drafted by the National Tuberculosis, Leprosy and Lung Disease programme. It will help with the construction of isolation rooms in county hospitals.
