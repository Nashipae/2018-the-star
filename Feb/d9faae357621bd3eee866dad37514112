Mt Elgon MP Fred Kapondi has denied claims that the gang behind a spate of killings in the area could be a resurgent SLDF militia. He said it is a criminal gang hiding in the neigbouring Uganda. Speaking during a burial at Kinyoro village in Trans Nzoia, he said a gang of six with illegal guns is terrorising residents and fleeing to Uganda â€œThere is no reemergence of the dreaded SLDF fighters. These are lawless youths who have illegal guns and target businessmen and farmers. On Sunday night a Mt Elgon man was beheaded; the killers took the head. Three others were shot dead. Ten cows were killed. The Sabaot Land Defence Force miltia terrorised in the area between 2002 and 2005. It was dismantled by a joint military and police operation Okoa Maisha. There has been a spate of kilings in Mt Elgon in the past few months. Residents fear the militia that killed more than 1,200 people and displaced a further 10,000 was regrouping. Kapondi urged residents to help the police in indentfiying the criminals.
