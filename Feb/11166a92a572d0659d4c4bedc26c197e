Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has criticised plans by the Siaya county assembly to build a Sh700 million complex. He said the money should be spent on meaningful ventures such as helping the needy instead of building luxurious facilities. Odhiambo said needy citizens, for instance, need to be enrolled in NHIF. “The county assembly building is one of the best in Siaya, why again construct a complex when they are currently in a good premises,” he said. Odhiambo was speaking at his office in Wagai on Sunday, when he gave out bursary cheques. But clerk Felix Oluero dismissed the MP, saying he only wanted to paint the assembly in bad light. “The idea of the complex was brought about by the need to provide sufficient facilities for honourable members of the county assembly and nothing else,” he said. Oluero urged the MP to visit the assembly to get his facts straight instead of going to the public with hearsay. He said the project is a long-term project with about Sh700 million that is staggered over 10 years and they can only spend Sh100 million in one financial year.
