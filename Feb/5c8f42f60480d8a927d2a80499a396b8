Starring: Starring: Catherine Zeta-Jones, Raúl Méndez, Juan Pablo Espinosa DIRECTED BY: Guillermo Navarro RELEASE DATE: 20th January 2018  You see in a world of Netflix and HBO, horrific life events are recreated in a contemporary cinematic setting. That’s why we are addicted to these shows. But when a compelling life story is told on Lifetime — a channel known for its sappy Christmas movies — there is an immediate disconnect. This is the case with the Cocaine Godmother. The story begins with a young girl (of about 10 years) being sent to prostitute herself to a man, who doesn’t pay her for the encounter. Her mother, who sent her there, kicks her out of the house. The young Griselda marches back into the man’s house, robs him and shoots him with his own gun. Years later, Griselda is married with three kids. When her husband confronts her for being in the drug business, Griselda kills him. Slowly Griselda moves up the narcos ladder by coming up with creative ways to smuggle drugs into America from Colombia. Soon, Griselda becomes a major distributor for the drug lords. The movie recaps Griselda’s ascent to power, her three marriages, her relationships with her children and mostly her relationship with her lesbian lover Caroline. The story of Griselda Blanco is a gripping tale of horrors and murders, but the film fails in its attempt to bring us to the horrific reality that once terrorised Miami. Unfortunately, I cannot help but compare the film to Netflix show Narcos. Mostly because Griselda and Pablo Escobar were associates who ruled the drug empire together at one time. Although Wagner Moura is Brazilian born, he lived and studied in Colombia to perfect his Spanish for the role of Pablo Escobar in Narcos. But the Welsh-born Zeta-Jones’ cringeworthy Spanish accent with no Spanish lines was a complete mess. The film would have done better as a third season of Netflix’s Narcos, with an entirely Spanish cast.  Star Rating: 3/5
