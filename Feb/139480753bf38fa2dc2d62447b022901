Government institutions have been instructed by the Public Service Commission to request, in writing, extra funds from the Treasury (pictured) to pay interns. The new Public Service Commission regulations require organisations to offer internship to graduates for a period not exceeding a year. The internship aims to help the graduates gain work experience. It targets 100,000 students who graduate from universities and technical institutes annually. Under the new terms of the regulations, interns shall be deemed to be public officers during the duration of the internship.They will not be guaranteed employment in the public service. PSC chief counsel Jacqueline Manani yesterday said H managers are expected to tell the Treasury the number of internship positions they had offered.
