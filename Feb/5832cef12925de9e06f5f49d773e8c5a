The Boni minority community in Lamu County wants the national and county governments to establish legislation that will tax outsiders who benefit from the Boni Forest. The Bonis occupy Basuba, Milimani, Mangai, Mararani, Kiangwe, Pandanguo and Bar’goni in Lamu East. The community says neighbouring communities and counties flock to the forest to graze their livestock without limitation. They say it is unfair that other people benefit from the forest as much as they do. Speaking in Bargoni yesterday, the Bonis said taxation of outsiders who use the forest will improve the community’s welfare. Boni Council of Elders’ chairman Ali Gubo said the community has not progressed for lack of a reliable land ownership system. Gubo said, despite the fact that the forest has been identified under the community’s name of Boni, the government has never issued them with a title deed. “We want to own the forest. As a community, we have worked hard to preserve and conserve it. We want visitors taxed and the funds directed to the community,” Gubo said. Elder Doza Diza praised the national government for allowing the community to access and use the forest. For years they have been locked out because of the Linda Boni operation meant to flush out al Shabaab militia. The Boni, a forest community, depend on the forest for survival. They are majorly hunters, gatherers and honey harvesters. Last week, the Deputy Inspector General of Police in the Linda Boni operation, Douglas Kirocho, said residents can venture into the forest at will. Many are still apprehensive that they might get arrested if found in the forest. Elder Diza said, “Inasmuch as we are happy to be allowed back into the forest, we are still worried.We are still scared that we might meet security forces who will treat us like al Shabaab suspects.They need to assure us that we won’t be victimised at all.” Click here for the latest political news
