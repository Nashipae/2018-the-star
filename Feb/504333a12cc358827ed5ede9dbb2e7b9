International hotel chain Hilton has opened a new branch under its ‘Double Tree by Hilton’ brand on Ngong Road, Nairobi. It is the first in Kenya. There are another five DoubleTree by Hilton properties across Africa. The brand is part of a  five-year $50 million ( Sh5.04 billion) investment plan for the Hilton’s sub-Saharan African portfolio. The group plans to convert 100 hotels in African into Hilton branded properties, providing benefits including access to digital check-in for guests. “With the number of travellers visiting Kenya growing year-on-year, we are delighted to be opening the first DoubleTree by Hilton property in Nairobi in such a prime location with easy access to corporate offices and tourist attractions,” DoubleTree by Hilton general manager Nitin Gupta said. Double Tree has taken over the space where the Amber Hotel sat. The hotel will still be owned by its previous owners, though operating under the Hilton franchise, after the upgrading of its facilities to international standards. There are many office complexes near the hotel, including Jadala Place, which is directly opposite, Daykio Plaza, a few metres away and Marsabit Plaza. Guests have access to WiFi, a 40-inch HDTV, mini-refrigerator, coffeemaker, work space and a bathroom.
