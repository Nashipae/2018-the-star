The government will today start the distribution of food to starving families in 14 counties. Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa yesterday said they will be in Tana River today to distribute maize and rice. The government has three million bags of maize in the Strategic Grain Reserve with an additional 90,000 bags of rice. The rice was donated to Kenya by the Chinese government two weeks ago. “We have enough food for our people. We will tour all the affected counties and distribute food and water,” Wamalwa said. Tana River, Kilifi, Taita Taveta and Lamu are among the worst affected counties. Others are Kajiado, Mandera, Isiolo, Turkana and Garissa. “From Tana River, we will go to Kilifi followed by Taita Taveta and Lamu,” Wamalwa said. The CS was speaking during the induction of members of the Senate Commitee on Devolution at the Whitesands Hotel in Mombasa. Wamalwa told the senators he will call for a meeting of all ministries involved in fighting drought and hunger to agree on how best to tackle the challenge. Among those involved is the Water ministry. Wamalwa said he will revive the water distribution programme to drought-affected areas which he launched last year. CONSTRUCT BOREHOLES “We have enough trucks for water distribution. We are going to ensure our people get the much-needed help,” Wamalwa said. Asked for a long-term solution, Wamalwa said the government has started constructing boreholes to ensure there is enough water. “Kenya has a potential of becoming food secure, but we grapple with hunger and drought every year. We need a long-term solution to this perennial menace,” Machakos Senator Boniface Kabaka said. ”Construction of dams will be the solution to the drought. We are already constructing the Thiba and Bunyale dams, which will double rice production in Mwea and Bunyale,” Wamalwa said.
