The National Youth Service needs very competent staff with integrity if the fight against corruption at the agency is to succeed, Public Service Cabinet Secretary nominee Margaret Kobia has said. "The NYS budget is huge and we need to have very competent people with integrity to run it so as to end corruption," she said during her vetting by the Committee on Appointments on Thursday. Kobia said  NYS has many top officials serving in an acting capacity, a situation she said opens doors for misappropriation of funds. "Top 10 officials at the management are in an acting capacity. I will make sure to set up a discipline force team who are the right people who can run the NYS," she said. She admitted that there is "high level" of corruption in the public service that needs to be dealt with fast. "Cancer of corruption is quite unfortunate. I would spend more time in NYS looking at their plans and future since they start some programs but don't sustain them," she said. Kobia said she would put down correction measures and have a target and strengthen the institution. "High level of corruption is attributed when services are delayed. We will champion and be on the fore front on the fight against corruption," she said.
