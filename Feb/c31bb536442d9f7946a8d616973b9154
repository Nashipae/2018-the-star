The Communications Authority of Kenya will open a new outlet in Kisumu in its bid to decentralise its services. The authority's assistant director of communications and external affairs Rachel Alwala said the office will be operational by April. The office which will be based at the Lake Basin Mall is still being portioned and tarnished.
