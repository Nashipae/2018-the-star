This country is in tensile conflict state and drifting dangerously towards instability. The events of the last one week, encompassing the controversial oath by NASA leader Raila Odinga and subsequent state repression, are opening up a new phase of struggle that is all too predictable. The government appears to be hellbent on neutralising the Opposition, gagging the media and paralysing the Judiciary. Yesterday, it withdrew the passports of a number of vocal opposition leaders. But it is a tweet from the ruling Jubilee Party that let the cat out of the bag. “It is undeniable that certain judges with long known bias are working extra hard to aid individuals hellbent to destabilize the country. #WakoraNetwork”, the party said. This against the backdrop of the flagrant State disobedience of court orders is ominous. It recalls President Uhuru Kenyatta’s unguarded fury at the Supreme Court after it nullified the August 8 election and his threat to “revisit” what he described as a judicial “coup” by “wakora” (crooks). With the Legislature already under its heel, the Executive’s determination to subvert judicial authority and attempts to curtail freedom of the media are clear evidence that our democracy is under threat. This drift towards dictatorship must be resisted. Quote of the Day: “Government is a trust, and the officers of the government are trustees; and both the trust and the trustees are created for the benefit of the people.” — Henry Clay, American legislator and orator, declared in Senate “I’d rather be right than be president,” on February 7, 1839.
