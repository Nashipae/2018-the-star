Telkom Kenya is betting on retail shops to net 500,000 new subscribers by the end of the first quarter. This is part of the company’s second phase drive to increase its subscriber base. The network currently has 3.48 million subscribers. Telkom has spent Sh5 billion improving the quality of its network and upgrading to the 4G platform. “In 2017, we completed the first phase of our national backbone and metropolitan transmission network. Our 4G network is currently available in 32 towns and urban centres across the country. We have also doubled its capacity and coverage on the 3G Network, improving our customer experience,” chief marketing officer Levi Nyakundi said yesterday in Nairobi. A Communications Authority report in December showed Safaricom and Airtel had lost at least 450,000 customers to Telkom in three months. According to the first quarter sector statistics report of 2017-18, Safaricom’s market share dropped from 72.6 per cent to 71.9 per cent while that of Airtel dropped from 15.3 per cent to 14.9 per cent as at September 2017. On the other hand, Telkom Kenya’s market share went up to 8.4 per cent from 7.2 per cent. “We want to continue being the preferred choice for any Kenyan looking for an alternative network,” Nyakundi said. Telkom is waiting for the CBK to issue a licence to start mobile money services.
