Last year, AY did the one thing many men are afraid of: proposing. He proposed to his Rwandese girlfriend of seven years while in South Africa. AY, real name Ambwene Yessayah, has always kept his private life just that, and he's not the kind to be involved in baseless controversies and scandals. Well, this weekend, he will finally be saying "I Do" to his woman at an invite-only wedding in Rwanda. Shaffie and AY have been friends for years, and he is privileged to be among those who have been invited to attend the wedding. "I have know AY all my radio career, that’s over 10 years. We have travelled together, we have done business together, and so on. He's helped me grow my brand in TZ and vice versa," Shaffie said. Other celebrities who will be gracing the event are former entertainment journalist John Muchiri, fashion designer Fundi Frank, Tanzania's finest MwanaFA, Diamond Platnumz' manager Sallam and radio host B12. This year alone, Shaffie has attended a number of weddings. So when are we attending your wedding, Shaffie?
