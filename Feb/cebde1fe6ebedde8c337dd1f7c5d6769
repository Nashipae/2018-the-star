A case in which Meru Senator Mithika Linturi (pictured) has sued the University of Nairobi for revoking his law degree will be heard on March 6. The case was mentioned yesterday before Justice George Odunga. He directed them to appear before him next week on Tuesday. In the petition, Linturi moved to court seeking to overturn the decision by UoN to deregister him as a law student. He allegedly presented fake papers to get admission. The senator further asked the court to quash the decision dated November 30, 2017 by the university to deregister and discontinue his studies. Linturi said his tribulations started during campaigns. His political opponents Mugambi Imanyara and former Meru Governor Peter Munya allegedly swore they would do anything to ensure his name was not in the ballot during the August 8 General Election. “The EACC conclusively investigated the allegations that Linturi’s self-declaration forms for the election filed with the IEBC were falsified,” the court papers read. Linturi says he was admitted at the University of Nairobi on January 3, 2014. On November 30, just 21 days to his confirmed graduation, he saw on the news that the university had deregistered him for allegedly having a fake degree from Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University in India. Linturi says the UoN failed to inform him in writing that it was investigating his degree with the aim of deregistering him.
