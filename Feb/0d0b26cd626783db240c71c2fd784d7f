Two Nairobi residents yesterday moved to court to challenge the resignation of former Nairobi Deputy Governor Polycarp Igathe (pictured). Simon Kokoyo and Javan Owala want the High Court to declare Igathe’s resignation null and void. In the petition, the two also want the court to declare that the Executive Committee of Nairobi County is not properly constituted, because there is no deputy governor. They have listed Jubilee Party, Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko and the Attorney General as respondents. They say the governor and his running mate came into office through an elective process and therefore the county boss cannot appoint a deputy in case a vacancy arises. “The continuous undermining of the constitutional role of the Deputy Governor sets a dangerous precedent to the rule of law, constitutionalism and is an affront to the spirit of devolution,” the petition reads. They further argue there are no provision in the Constitution or law for a vacancy in the office of the Deputy Governor and therefore the resignation of Igathe has no effect in law. They say that during the August 8 General Election, Sonko and Igathe publicly entered into a social contract with Nairobi residents. In the contract, they argue, Igathe was to be the technocrat and charged with management of the county administration and services, owing to his academic credentials, competence and career in corporate management. Sonko was to be in charge of political affairs. In January, Igathe resigned as Deputy Governor, saying he had failed to earn Sonko’s trust.
