Kenya Pipeline captain Triza Atuka believes the team have a chance to reclaim the Africa Club Championship title they last won over a decade ago when the continental showpiece go down in Cairo, Egypt, between March 5 and 18. Pipeline finished fifth during the 2017 edition held in Tunisia, surrendering the bronze medal position they occupied at the conclusion of the championship an year earlier. The national team middle blocker could not explain why they have failed to click at the continental front despite dominating the local scene, winning back-to-back titles at the Kenya Volleyball Federation national league. “We have a good side and that’s why we have won the local trophy a couple of times now. We have always started the continental event on a high before but we somehow fail to hold it together going forward,” said Atuka, who won the best attacker accolades during KVF national league last season. “I hope this time around we get our acts together. We have been to the club championships for a while now and I believe it’s that time we go ahead and stamp our authority. We are aware it’s not going to be easy but it can be done.” The local champions played a friendly match against Kenya Commercial Bank on Friday to gauge their preparedness ahead of the 13-day event and Atuka noted they still have some grounds to cover. “Our back-court and services are okey but our attacks and blocks are still wanting and I believe with at least two weeks of training at our disposal we shall be able to seal all the loopholes and be at a better place before we depart for the host nation on March 4,” she said. So far 18 players are in residential training camp at the Safaricom Indoor Arena and the technical bench is expected to name the final list of 14 in a fortnight . Pipeline will represent the country in Egypt alongside local nemesis, Kenya Prisons, who bagged Bronze last year.
