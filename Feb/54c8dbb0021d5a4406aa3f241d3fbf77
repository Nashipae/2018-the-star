Aluta Continua (The struggle continues)! These were the words of controversial lawyer Miguna Miguna after the High Court declared on Thursday that the order for his deportation was null and void. "We, the NRMKe, Kenyan patriots and freedom fighters, believe in and are fully committed to the rule of law. Thanks and congratulations, Counsel. I'm grateful for the work," Miguna wrote on Twitter. The lawyer and politician, who declared himself the general of the National Resistance Movement, added that the Opposition's Nasa coalition will use the Constitution as the "spear and the shield" in the fight against despots. The deportation directed by Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i was nullified by Judge Luka Kimaru. He further directed Immigration director Gordon Kihalagwa to surrender Miguna's passports to court within seven days. The government forced the National Resistance Movement 'general' to Canada after he participated in Nasa leader Raila Odinga's swearing-in at Nairobi's Uhuru Park on January 30. The lawyer said he would be back and noted that his Kenyan citizenship cannot be revoked as he was born in the country.
