STARRING: Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong’o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker DIRECTED BY: Black Panther by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby RELEASE DATE:  February 16  Of course, this week we look at the movie that has taken the world by storm! A movie that has sparked interest and reignited the passion of African/Black empowerment. The film is none other than Marvel’s Black Panther. We had a brief interaction with Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War, where King T’Chaka of the Wakanda is killed in a terror attack. T’Challa, son of T’Chaka, is in line to be the next King of Wakanda. But according to custom, anyone can challenge his claim. M’Baku, the leader of Jabari tribe, challenges T’Challa. And although the custom is fighting to the death, T’Challa manages to convince M’Baku to yield. T’Challa is crowned and sets on his first mission to recover the vibranium stolen by a South African gangster by the name of Klaue. Klaue is saved by Killmonger, who is later revealed to be T’Challa’s cousin N’Jadaka. Killmonger challenges T’Challa for the throne and wins. After being given extract of the ‘heart-shaped herb’, that allows him to have the powers of the Black Panther, Killmonger orders all the flowers to be burnt. Nakia steals one flower and escapes to the Jabari clan with T’Challa’s mother and sister. The film has taken a life of its own. It’s captured the attention of many and has raised interesting debates about the imagination of Africa without colonialism, greed and corruption. Wakanda represents an idealism that many Africans have longed for. The sophistication of the production; the incorporation of various African cultures and languages; the authenticity of the actors (most of whom are Africans or African Americans); are some of the aspects of this film that make it a marvel — pun intended.  Star Rating: 5/5
