The national government has distributed equipment worth Sh900,000 to 64 persons living with disability in Siaya county. The state, through the National Fund for the Disabled of Kenya, distributed wheelchairs, sewing machine, ox ploughs, salon kits and welding machines to the people. According to the NFDK assistant programme manager, Isaac Aliya, the equipment is intended to uplift the livelihoods of people living with disability. He regretted that those who applied for the equipment were fewer compared to other regions that had more than 50 beneficiaries per subcounty. Area assistant county commissioner Rhoda Chepkorir called for sensitization of residents. She urged beneficiaries to use the equipment for the intended purpose and not sell it. Stern action will be taken against those found to be doing so. “Our people should not continue to languish in poverty when the government is geared to improve our lives. I want to encourage all persons with disability to apply for the programme,” Chepkorir said. She said that they are going to map out all persons living with disability in the region for easy identification of the beneficiaries of the programme.
