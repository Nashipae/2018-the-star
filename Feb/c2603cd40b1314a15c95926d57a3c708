Music lovers were not always sold on Noti Flow. But in 2016, when she came through YouTube with the rather explicit tune “Birthday Cake”, she left most web users, especially men, simpering in astonishment; no one wants to listen to music without some extra exciting moments. Then, being openly expressive about her sexuality was almost everything that her fans ever cared about. Now, two years on, we are still tuned in because you don’t need to like her to accept that she’s a reality star in the making. Her presence can border on pure controversy, but this does not stop her from pervading the hip hop scene. Like the rest of the genre’s contributors, she’s spending proper time at the studio, and her growth has been evidently noticeable, though it’s taken time for her skills to be taken seriously. Still in her early twenties, she’s suggested a new path for Kenyan female rappers. Her latest release, “100 Barz,” and her 2017 release, “Kamatia”, are perfect examples of attempts to lead her to win. Her gradual musical ascent hasn’t quite been influenced by any male cosigns, and we can now begin to say that she’s starting to master the sound. Noti Flow maintains her bad girl act, dropping eerie calm bars, sometimes with dirty punchy lines that you can’t miss. At times, her vehement delivery fails to complement the rhythmic intonation, and her storytelling is a little bit scattered. In keeping with her modest output, she believes that it’s all about being the centre of attention. Moving forward, all we can expect is that Noti Flow will either replicate or outdo whatever she’s doing right now. The determination of whether she’s on her way to making it lies solely on her, and judging by what she’s been doing lately, we have a feeling she’s on to something.
