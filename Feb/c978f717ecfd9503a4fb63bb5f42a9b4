Petroleum and Mining CS John Munyes yesterday pledged to turn Kenya into the leading mining destination in the world after a national survey of all minerals in the country is concluded. He said the mapping out of the minerals will enable the ministry to have a scientific atlas and a database showing all the minerals and their locations. “It will be a challenge for this ministry and Kenyans to now look for investors to explore these minerals,” Munyes (pictured) said at the ministry’s offices in Nairobi after taking over the ministry from former CS Dan Kazungu. He said President Uhuru Kenyatta, DP William Ruto and politicians support the sector, and “to mine is to help unlock the potentials undermined by bottlenecks and roadblocks”. The former Turkana senator said mining will be a game-changer in terms of jobs and wealth creation. More emphasis will be placed on artisans and small-scale miners, he said. Munyes said the dream of Kenya producing oil by 2022 will be achieved. “I’m very confident with the progress. I want to thank the investors and the government for the effort. We want to work within the framework — most urgent is to ensure this Petroleum Bill is quickly taken to Parliament, get it approved, then take it down to the public, engage the communities and sensitise them about it,” Munyes said. “I know there are challenges, but we have started a discussion with MPs from those areas. We are on track and I must say having oil by 2022 is a reality.”
