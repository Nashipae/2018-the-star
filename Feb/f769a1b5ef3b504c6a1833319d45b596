Former Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo on Monday vowed to fight another day after the court dismissed his election petition challenging Governor Cornel Rasanga’s win. “I don’t agree with the court ruling but I will respect the verdict. We tabled concrete evidence and it was upon the court to make a fair ruling,” Gumbo said. He said he is going to consult with his lawyers to see if they can appeal the ruling. He called on his supporters to move on with life as life has to move on with or without the case. Gumbo however did not disclose whether he will be on the ballot again in 2022. Governor Rasanga while addressing residents asked Gumbo asking him to join him to propel the county’s development agenda. He promised to serve all irrespective of whether they voted for him or not.
