The Nandi government has reinstated all casuals suspended three months ago and given them one-year contracts. Governor Stephen Sang said the task force instituted to establish the number of casuals found only 311 are genuine while 300 were ghost workers. “Many decided not to appear before members of the task force for obvious reasons - earning money they never worked for,” he said. Speaking on Friday when he issued contract letters to the staff, Sang said he is keen on ending graft. He said all those scheming to defraud the county will be arrested. He said the renewal of staff contracts will depend on their performance. Sang said all employees will sign performance contracts. “I have ensured all departments have been streamlined, right from procurement, finance and health were effectively functioning,” he said. Sang dismissed claims of an increase in the county wage bill. He said he has been able to reduce financial waste and rid the county of cartels. Sang said the agriculture sector will be revived. This will include the revival of Kaimosi Farmers’ Training College in Kiborgok. A bus has been bought and hostels and classrooms have been renovated.
