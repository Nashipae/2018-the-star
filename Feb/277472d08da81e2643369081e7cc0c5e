Five contestants will face off in the Kitui West MP by-election slated for March 26. IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said Edith Nyenze (Wiper), Elija Kilonzi (Chama cha Mapinduzi), Robert Lelli (Narc Kenya), Dennis Mulwa (Independent), and Frida Mutui (Kenya National Congress) are eligible for the poll. The by-election will be held following the death of MP Francis Nyenze. The Kitui West MP died from coronary cancer on December 6 last year while being treated at a Nairobi hospital. President Uhuru Kenyatta, DP William Ruto and Opposition chief Raila Odinga mourned him as a patriot, servant leader and a champion for unity. Kitui is a Wiper stronghold. Nyenze's wife won the party's nomination, positioning her at the precipice of taking over from her late husband. More on this: Nyenze's widow thrashes Maluki in Wiper's Kitui West nominations ...
