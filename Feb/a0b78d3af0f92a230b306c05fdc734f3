Western Stima started life in the Football Kenya Federation National Super League with a hard fought 2-0 win over visiting Modern Coast at Moi Stadium in Kisumu. After a dull first half which saw both teams fail to record a shot on target, Stima came out strongly in the second and were rewarded in the 50th minute when Johana Mwita beat Ryan Hamisi in the Rangers’ goal. Stima dominated proceedings and in the 70th minute second half substitute Maurice Ndukuli added the second goal after Hamisi punched the ball against his own defender. Stima which was relegated from the Kenya Premier League last season should thank their lanky goal keeper Stephen Otieno who stood out to make two quick saves in the dying minutes of the game. Stima coach Richard Makumbi expressed his displeasure with the performance of the team. “I’m not happy with performance especially upfront. We want to return to the Kenyan Premier League next season and we must be clinical and utilize our chances,” said Makumbi. His Rangers counterpart Abdul Nassir said he was happy with the performance of the team despite the loss. “We played well against a very experienced team. We made two mistakes and we were punished. I’m working on areas that I feel we didn’t do well ahead of the game against Kenya Commercial Bank,” said Nassir.
