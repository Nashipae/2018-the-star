The ruling on a petition challenging the election of Janet Ong'era as Kisii Woman Representative will be delivered today. Justice Anthony Ndung'u is expected to deliver the ruling at the Kisii High Court. Ong'era's election was challenged by Nahashon Akunga, who claims that the last year August 8 election was not free and fair. Akunga, through his lawyer Omwanza Ombati, told the court that the IEBC used fraudulent forms to declare Ongâ€™era the winner. Ong'era's lawyer Okong'o Omogeni told the court to dismiss the petition, saying Akunga failed to prove the allegations. Akunga told the court that his witnesses were intimidated to an extent that they failed to give evidence. Akunga also claimed that the voters' register used during the poll was not credible.
