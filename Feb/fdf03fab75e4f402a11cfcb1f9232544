The High Court has suspended the government's decision to revoke the passports of seven Nasa leaders. The leaders include David Ndii, University of Nairobi lecturer David Plop, Siaya Senator James Orengo and Dagoretti North MP Simba Arati. The seven moved to court to challenge the decision that came as the government took actions to suppress the National Resistance Movement.

The order will remain until the case is heard and determined. NASA activist Johnson Muthama was one of those who sued the government for suspending his passport, saying the action was arbitrary and in violation of his constitutional rights. He noted he is entitled to a passport under the Constitution and that any suspension is limited to the grounds under Section 31-1 of the Kenya Citizenship and Immigration Act 2011. The Act and Constitution allow revocation of a passport in line with Article 24, which limits some rights. In his remarks following the move by the government, Nasa chief Raila Odinga warned that the country was slowly but steadily becoming lawless.
