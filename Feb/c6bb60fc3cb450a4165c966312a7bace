Sugar plantation workers have asked politicians to stop interfering with the government's plans to privatise sugar companies, saying the process is overdue. The Kenya Union of Sugar Plantation Workers said the privatisation will save the factories from collapse. KUSPAW secretary general Francis Wangara said the industry was in bad shape and urgently needed any intervention that could keep it afloat. Politicians have called for more consultation before the state goes ahead to private the government-owned factories. Wangara said enough consultations had been done. He urged the state to go ahead and privatise the factories. “Consultation has been ongoing for a long time now. Politicians who were recently elected cannot claim that they were not consulted because they were not in office then," Wangara said in Kisumu yesterday. He said it was unfortunate that until now the matter has not been concluded considering that the He said the matter needed to be urgently concluded because the COMESA free market extension period for Kenya was almost ending. “There will be a serious impact on workers in the industry if the COMESA time frame finds us unprepared,” Wangara said. Kenya had been granted an extension of sugar import limits from the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, safeguarding local millers from intense competition due to cheaper products. Wangara lamented that the country had not done much to exploit the extension. He said privatisation will improve production and allow Kenya to favourably compete within COMESA. Wangara said new investors will properly maintain and modernise factories. "The government has only been making promises of providing funds with nothing being done. This had contributed to the dilapidation in most factories," Wangara said.
