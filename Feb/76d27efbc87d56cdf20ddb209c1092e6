Interior CS Fred Matiang’i yesterday told chiefs, assistants and elders in Wajir that rapists must be prosecuted and jailed not protected. There must be no traditional ‘maslah’ settlements, payments to families of rape victims, so they will not go to court. Anyone who promotes or condones the practice, protecting rapists, will be sacked and jailed, Matiang’i said. Local administrators are bribed by families to keep silent and let traditional ‘justice’ take its course. Matiang’i was referring to a case ijn which a 15-year-old Form One girl from Senior Ogle Girls Secondary School was gang raped by three men on her way home from school. The girl had been given permission by the school administration to go and seek treatment after falling sick. She met a man along the way in a vehicle who offered her lift. The man is alleged to have spiked the water he gave her to drink, so she fell unconscious. This gave him the chance to rape her before inviting two friends to join in. The girl suffered serious injuries an dhas been tansferred to Nairobi. One man has been arrested. STATE MEANS BUSINESS The crime has been widely publicised and ondemned, including by National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale. The tough-talking CS, while addressing elders on a security tour, said rogue chiefs and elders who protect rapists are themselves committing crimes. He said they have no place in society. “The government will not sit back and watch as such wicked and embarassing acts happen to our young girls. This is unacceptable,” Matiang’i said. He further warned local leaders against instigating clan clashes, saying the governmnt was on the lookout. “I say without any fear of contradiction we have had enough of this,” he said. The CS warned political leaders that it will not be “business as usual”.
