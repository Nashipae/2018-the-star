The important exercise of vetting nominees for Cabinet and ambassadorial postings commenced yesterday. To the disappointment of many Kenyans, NASA MPs stayed away, rendering the process a one-party charade. By so doing, the MPs have abdicated a crucial responsibility of representing their electorate in the constitutional duty of interrogating the integrity and competence of the Secretaries who will run the country for the next five years. It would be naive to expect Jubilee MPs to query the President’s nominees with the same rigour as the Opposition. The boycott exposes the hypocrisy of our MPs; the same MPs who have boycotted the vetting and budget sittings are quite happy attending induction sessions in luxurious hotels at the Coast where they pocket hefty per diems. Some, like Minority Leader John Mbadi, earn a responsibility allowance which includes their membership to such committees as the vetting one, that they don’t abjure. NASA leaders must make up their minds. They cannot continue enjoying their perks and not perform the corresponding duties. That’s tantamount to defrauding the public. It is unethical and immoral. Their emoluments must be gauged against performance of their job description and not how much they agitate outside Parliament, their electoral grievances notwithstanding.
