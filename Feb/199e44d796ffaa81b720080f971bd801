Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi yesterday refused to disqualify himself from hearing a robbery case linked to the murder of Kabete MP George Muchai. He dismissed an objection raised by four out of the seven suspects charged with violently robbing the deceased, his two bodyguards and a driver. They had argued that the magistrate was delaying the case and favouring the prosecution. The four are Raphael Gachii alias Kim Butcher, Kimani Anyonyi alias Musti, Stephen Lipapo alias Chokore and Eric Isabwa alias chairman. Three others — Jane Kamau alias Shiro, Margaret Wachuiri and Simon Gichamba — did not object to the magistrate. They want the case to proceed quickly. The four had complained that the magistrate had not directed Safaricom to supply them with data they need to cross-examine witnesses who said they had been arrested using Safaricom data.  Also facing murder charges Senior state counsel Solomon Naulikha, who leads the prosecution, opposed the application for Andayi to disqualify himself and the suspect’s demand for data. Safaricom’s lawyer Robert Gitau said the company had supplied only the part of information connected to the calls of the suspects. More than 20 witnesses have already testified. Muchai was killed on February 7, 2015. During the last hearing, a witness narrated how police recovered a phone belonging to Muchai from one of the suspects. Stephen Kuria identified Gichamba as the one found with Muchai’s phone on the Kangemi estate in Nairobi. The seven also face murder charges in the High Court in connection to the killing of the former MP. A vendor told the court he was handing a newspaper to Muchai, who had been his customer for seven years, when a white car came and blocked the MP’s vehicle. A man wearing a mask came out of the vehicle armed with a G3 rifle and started firing at Muchai’s vehicle. The suspects are remanded until the case is determined.
