Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula has called for “serious dialogue” between NASA and Jubilee to enable the country to “move forward peacefully”. He said on Saturday that Kenya is headed in the wrong direction and has not healed from political rifts and tensions that resulted from last year’s presidential election. Only meaningful dialogue will ensure the rising political temperatures cool down, he said. If President Uhuru Kenyatta does not understand the myriad problems and issues afflicting this country, then he does not fit in the head of state role, Wetang’ula said in Bukhokolo village, Sirisia constituency, during the burial of the father of Levi Makali, who was Ford Kenya’s Sirisia MP candidate.

Uhuru is acting like the proverbial ostrich that buries its head in the sand and assumes everything is okay,” he said. “We in NASA are wondering why he’s behaving like someone who wants this country to burn by taking a hardline when we’re calling for dialogue.” Levi lost to MP John Waluke of Jubilee Party, but petitioned Waluke’s win at a Kitale court. The ruling on the case will be made this month. Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati, Sirisia MP John Waluke and Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa were present. Wetang’ula also criticised the state for withdrawing NASA leaders’ security. “We want the whole world to know that I, Weta, the defender of the oppressed, have been stripped of my guards. I’m without security as I speak,” he said. Waluke and Barasa urged Kenyans to focus on their daily work, as “politics is over”. They urged Wetang’ula and ANC’s Musalia Mudavadi to join Jubilee and praised them for skipping the Raila Odinga oath in Uhuru Park, Nairobi, on January 30.
