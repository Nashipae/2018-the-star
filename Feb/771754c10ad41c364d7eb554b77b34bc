Five officers from the EACC yesterday morning raided the Wajir finance department offices. Accompanied by 15 armed police officers, they caught the staff completely unawares. The officials took over and started questioning a number of accountants and senior officials in the finance and internal audit office. They were still in by the time of going to the press. Speaking to the Star on the phone, Northeastern head Japhet Baithalu described the raid as a normal investigative routine. “We are doing some financial forensic investigations. We want to verify some documents in our possession and find out they are related to county transactions. We cannot however say who is culpable at this stage until we finish our investigations,” Baithalu said. According to a senior EACC official who was involved in the raid and who spoke to the star in confidence, they what to establish how some monies are being withdrawn from the county accounts, some spreading for the last two years. “Kindly let the official do their work. I cannot disclose to you their mission there. But I surely will get back to you if and went they get what they are looking for,” said Baithalu.
