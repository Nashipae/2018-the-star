Non-conformist, experimental, dynamic, precarious, thought-provoking. This is the first impression many have of Kenyan-based photographer Osborne Macharia. Osborne is a self-taught commercial photographer who perhaps credits his artistic freedom to his exploratory nature, which is evident in his project. Over the years, he has developed his impeccable style of Afrofuturism, delivering fascinating works that have left his fanbase in awe. Now, he is a prodigy; He is able to piece together different elements prioritising his passion to create. He has developed into the go-to collaborator for anything editorial and commercial. From his extensive portfolio, you can tell he is a hunter seeking out the perfect concepts and moments to frame his exceptional work. Osborne understands that he needs to set himself apart from the endless emergence of photographers, and the results are images that portray imperceptible situations. Osborne uses his imaginative eye to combine unrelated elements, scenarios and human interaction to create new, unthought narratives. Working with top models, eccentric subjects, makeup artists and his able stylist Kevo Abbra, he applies his techniques and editing skills to create artistic works never seen before. His works show dedication, encouraging viewers to open their eyes to new perspectives. Besides his personal projects, he has been commissioned by business brands globally to create images for their product promotion campaigns. His latest work, christened  “Ilgelunot,” is his own interpretation of the Black Panther movie that he had been commissioned to conceptualise by Disney/Marvel for the launch of the film in London. In one way or another, his works require viewers to be more attentive to the artistic detail.
