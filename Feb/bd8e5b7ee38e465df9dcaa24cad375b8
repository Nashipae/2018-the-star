His Rapcellency Prezzo has reunited with his ex-wife Daisy Kiplangat and seven-year-old daughter Zahrie. The My City My Town hitmaker says he doesn’t want to be a player any more. "I'm King Mswati, I date so many women, but right now, I'm in a very good place with my daughter and my baby mama, my ex-wife Daisy. So I don't wanna mess up anything for nothing or for anyone." He added: "We've patched things up." Born Jackson Makini, the rapper has been in controversy of late after joining reality show Nairobi D. Since then, he has been linked to multiple women, including Michelle Yola and Tanzanian video vixen Amber Lulu. He then exited the reality show, and there came reports that he had gone bankrupt. This was after Prezzo was allegedly unable to pay for a studio session in Tanzania. “That's not true. I can even give you my video director’s number. They can confirm that I went there and bought even more jewellery. I came back with more, not less, jewellery. I had my own stylist and I had everything intact. As a matter of fact, with three people, we flew there, we didn’t even drive." “All these allegations give people a rush
when they point fingers at me. They will say Prezzo does drugs, but then
I’ve never been to rehab even once in my lifetime. All these
allegations are formulated out of  jealousy. For me to travel with my
crew already goes to show we are financially fit. If I wasn’t, then I
wouldn’t be able to accommodate two other people with me.” Prezzo is currently working on videos for over 20 songs he is yet to release.
