The petitioner had claimed that some forms in 34As and form 34Bs had not been signed. He said there were many cases of bribery, violence and intimidation. But in his two-hour ruling, Ngaah ruled that the MP was validly elected and the elections were held in a credible manner and in compliance of the constitution. “The petitioner did not submit sufficient evidence. No evidence of such deliberate refusal to sign forms by those in charge. The petitioner’s application has no merit and is hereby dismissed,” said the judge. He added that there was no evidence that the KIMS kit was misused as alleged by the petitioner. Rigathi garnered 52,757 votes against his closest rival Wambura Maranga who garnered 28,893 votes. Hundreds of the MP supporters jammed court on Friday before bursting into celebrations in Nyeri town after the ruling.
