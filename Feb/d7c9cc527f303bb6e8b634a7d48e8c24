Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has backed the arrest last weekend of DJs in various clubs for "noise pollution". Posting on social media, he urged the DJs to respect the hustle of schoolchildren and hardworking Nairobians who need to rest. All he asks of the DJs is to avoid violating rights of people, especially in residential areas. He said: "The issue of arrest and harassment of DJs has come to my attention. I appreciate youths trying to make a living. However, DJs especially in the residential areas, should not violate the rights of Nairobians to a good working and living environment. Watoto wa shule and hard working Nairobians should be allowed to have a peaceful night so as to have productive days. "In many cases bar owners and managers are never in the scene during operations thats why at some point our DJs are held responsible coz they're the operators of the music machines. Also note that, we receive complains from residents before we act. Kwa hivyo tunaomba Djs waangalie hio."
