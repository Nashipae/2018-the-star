World Bank and Nakuru county will conduct a clean-up exercise at Lake Nakuru National Park on Friday. The lake is heavily polluted posing danger to wildlife and the tourism sector. Gioto, the main dumpsite in Nakuru has been blamed for the high levels of pollution. Environmentalists say people living near the lake and seasonal rivers flowing into the lake dump raw sewerage and poisonous chemicals into the lake. Areas notorious for polluting the lake include Njoro, Makalia, Nderit, Naishi and Larmudiak. “Reduced river flow in the past three months compromised the rivers capacity for natural self purification, worsening pollution,” Integrated Lake Basin Management coordinator Jackson Raini said. Tests on one of the key rivers flowing into the lake confirmed water is contaminated with chang’aa and waste from licensed distillers in Mwariki, Rhonda and Kaptembwa estates. “The effluent has high chemical oxygen demand which makes water highly acidic, have strong odour and dark brown colour,” Raini said. This has made birds like flamingos to migrate to the nearby lakes like Elementaita, Simbi Nyaima and Bogoria. Raini said the public should be sensitised on the importance of conserving the environment, especially near the lake. The county will involve stakeholders to ensure business and human activities in and around the lake do not affect wildlife. Governor Lee Kinyanjui has promised to establish an independent agency to manage the lakes.
