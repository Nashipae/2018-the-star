Former Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti has asked Governor Martin Wambora not to appeal the nullification of his victory and instead brace himself for a fresh election. Wambora’s election was nullified by High Court Judge William Musyoka on Thursday. “He should be man enough and agree to face the people,” Kivuti said after the court delivered its judgment. Kivuti ran against Wambora in last year’s election. He petitioned Wambora’s win, asking the court to declare him the winner. On Thursday, Kivuti said he will accept the court’s verdict.
