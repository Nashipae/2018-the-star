Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka will sue the government over the 200-acre piece of land in Yatta, on which his retirement home sits. The Nasa principal has dismissed claims that the property was grabbed from the National Youth Service. “The parcel belonged to the former Machakos municipality and was crown land. It was later allocated by former President Mwai Kibaki on the same presidential decree as that of the NYS,” Kalonzo said in a statement on Saturday. The former Vice President promised to fight the affront on his rights to own property. "This land has never been the property of NYS. It was allocated to Ketrako that eventually sold to me. The NYS was also allocated a share." Kalonzo's remarks came after the service advertised orders for the owners of specific parcels of land to surrender them in 14 days. Critics believe the government's bid to repossess the parcel, adjacent to the NYS training centre, is political witch-hunt. Kalonzo says the "witch-hunt" has been on for a while now but he has always been vindicated. "This is the only thing they try to use to malign me. They have been frustrated because I am corruption-free so no shoddy deals can be traced back to me," he said. He noted he is strong and will continue to fight political battles that have seen his security withdrawn. The Wiper boss noted intimidation will not push him to recognise President Uhuru Kenyatta as the country's leader.
