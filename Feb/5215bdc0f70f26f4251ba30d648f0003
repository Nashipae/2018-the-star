Residents of Kiamariga village in Salama ward in Laikipia West sub-county have accused the Anti Stock Theft Unit officers in the area of laxity following perennial theft of their livestock. This was prompted by theft of 80 goats on Thursday last week and efforts to recover them have been allegedly thwarted by the officers attached at Kiamariga station who have been demanding for fuel to pursue the thieves. Speaking at Naibor trading centre in Segera yesterday, Johnson Maina, a resident said they decided to take up the challenge of pursuing the thieves .
