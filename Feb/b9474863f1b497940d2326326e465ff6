Illegal connections have been blamed for the water shortage in Mombasa schools and hospitals, Mombasa Water Supply and Sanitation Company has said. There has been an acute shortage over the last two weeks after Kenya Power also cut off electricity supply to the Baricho Waterworks in Malindi. Baricho is the main reservoir for the Coast region. Kenya Power is demanding a Sh60 million bill from the Coast Water Services Board. Nearly half of the water from Baricho is supplied to Mombasa residents. Mombasa has a demand of about 186 million litres per day against the 40 million litres supplied by the CWSB. The company has been forced to ration the supply. Mombasa Water Company manager in charge of West Mainland region David Munguti yesterday said illegal connections had exacerbated the problem. “We have been uprooting illegal trappings since Tuesday. These connections contribute to the huge amount of non-revenue water,” Munguti told the Star in his office yesterday. At least one person has been arrested and arraigned in court for illegal water connection. Some 50 households with illegal connections have been disconnected Culprits include doctors who have channeled the water to their private clinics, sources conducting the crackdown said. “They have evaded arrest but we will soon catch up with them," Munguti said. He could not immediately estimate the amount of shillings the company loses due to illegal connections. By yesterday, Munguti said they had uprooted pipes worth Sh100,000 that were used in the illegal connections. “Some people cut the pipes just before the metre so that they are not billed. We are also aware that some people go ahead and sell the stolen water to other residents,” Munguti said.
