NASA coalition and family members of self-styled NRM general Miguna Miguna have accused the police of barring them from seeing him. He is reported to have been locked in various police stations. Miguna was arrested on Friday at his Runda home in Nairobi after playing a key role in the swearing-in of NASA leader Raila Odinga as the People’s President on January 30. On Saturday, family members went to Lari police station and demanded to see him. They alleged Miguna was transferred from Githunguri police station on Friday night to Lari after being arrested and taken to Kiambu police station headquarters. However, OCPD Isaiah Odhiambo denied Miguna was in Lari police station cells. He said the family had been misinformed. Even though family members declined to speak to the Star at Lari police station on Saturday, NASA politician and lawyer Edwin Sifuna wrote on his Twitter handle, “They are aware that Miguna was being held at the station, but they were not allowed to see him.” “We do not need the press for now. Please give us time. We are in darkness” a family member told this journalist before boarding their vehicles. “Miguna is at Lari Police Station. The OCS and the OCPD have denied lawyers and his family access to him. We do not know his state,” Sifuna’s tweet read.
