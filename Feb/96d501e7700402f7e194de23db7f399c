A secondary school teacher was on Thursday arraigned in a Nyahururu court in connection with the murder of his sister. Peterson Igathe, a teacher at Kuribariba Girls' Secondary School in Thika, is accused of killing his sister Anastacia Igathe together with other five siblings who were not in court. Prosecution said they jointly committed the offence on December 24, 2016 at Passenga in Ol Kalou. Anastacia's body was found dumped in Dundori Forest in Nakuru. Nyahururu High Court Judge Roseline Wendoh directed that the suspect undergoes psychiatric tests before he can take a plea. Police were allowed to gold him at the Ol Kalou police station for 14 days pending the mental examination. “The court directs that the suspect having been informed of the charges against him be taken for a mental examination,” Wendoh said. Nyandarua Central OCPD Wilson Kosgei said investigations have revealed that Anastacia was killed by family members because of a land row. Anastasia was the administrator of her late father's expansive land. She wanted the land to be subdivided, a decision her siblings opposed. The five members were arrested and charged in court. The case is still pending. Igathe went into hiding after the murder. he was arrested on Wednesday in Thika, Kiambu county. Police say Igathe used his vehicle, a Probox, to transport the body to the dumping site after the murder. The vehicle is at the Ol Kalou police station. Among those in custody is a woman who was arrested in Embakasi, Nairobi in January last year. Some of the family members have been charged with murder, including a woman who was in January last year, tracked by detective to her hideout in Embakasi, Nairobi. Kosgei said the arrest of Igathe has completed their circle of investigation, and what now remains is for police to prove their case in Court for Anastasia to get justice.
