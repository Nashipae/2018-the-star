A family has been ordered jailed for six months for disobeying a court order and burying a relative on disputed land. The woman’s body yesterday was exhumed and buried at a public cemetery in Longonot. Beth Wanjiku’s husband Evans Kagecha and children hurriedly buried her in the middle of the night last month. The land in question has been in dispute for years, leaving a trail of destruction and injuries in its wake. “The body of the deceased has since been buried in the public cemetery in Longonot and the case will come up for mention early next month,” an officer told the Star. Meanwhile, a lorry driver has been hospitalised after he was waylaid by highway robbers who attempted to steal the vehicle on Wednesday night. The thugs beat him up after he threw away the keys, ruining their plans.
