Education CS Amina Mohamed has warned of a trend of al Shabaab militants targeting learning institutions in their attacks on Kenyan soil. She said this on Friday following the attack on Qarsa Primary School in Wajir county where three teachers were killed and scores injured. The Cabinet Secretary said this was a clear indication that learning institutions in the country, like is the case other countries across the world, remains a soft target for terrorists. "The Ministry of Education is alive to this reality and has formulated appropriate measures and guidelines in order to ensure the safety of our learners, teachers from terrorism and other threats," Amina said. Four people were butchered by suspected al Shabaab militants at a school Friday morning. County AP commander Mohamed Sheikh said they were ambushed at around 1 am as they slept at Kharsa Primary School. The school is in Kharsa village near Konton border town, which is 70km from Wajir town.

She said she has appealed to all education stakeholders especially the security agencies to partner in mobilizing the necessary resources needed to ensure all learning institutions are well secured. This comes as non local teachers in the county threatened to vacate the area for fear over their lives. The teachers said they have formally written to their employer TSC and expect a response in shortest time failure to which they will have no option but to scamper for their safety.
