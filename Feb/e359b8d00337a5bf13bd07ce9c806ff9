The national government has denied claims that Lamu youth are being sidelined and denied employment in the LAPSSET projects. The Lamu Port South Sudan Ethiopia Transport corridor project is ongoing at Kililana area in Lamu county. Transport PS Paul Maringa, during a tour of the project on Friday, said government's objective is to ensure local benefit from the venture. He said no capable youth will be sidelined both during the construction and operationalisation of the major port project. The official urged Lamu youth to join TVET institutions and colleges in
order to acquire skills and knowledge that will enable them get jobs at
the project. The PS said the venture has the ability to employ
thousands but reminded then that only those with the right skills and
knowledge will be considered. "We are doing the much we can to ensure everyone is included, especially of
the youth of Lamu. Let people get trained on the
necessary skills so they get employed when the port starts
functioning," Maringa said. CEO Sylvestre Kasuku said more people will be recruited and trained
under the LAPSSET presidential scholarship initiated by President Mwai
Kibaki in 2012. "So far, 120 students have already graduated from
various institutions and colleges and more are expected to graduate
later in the year." The scholarship programme envisioned to train at least 1,000 youth from Lamu on port matters related to port management. Five tranches of 200 students were to be recruited into the programme each year, of which 400 students have been listed so far. The comments followed complaints by Mombasa and Lamu MCAs who said the counties' leadership wasn't being involved in the LAPSSET projects. The MCAs also accused the national government of sidelining Lamu youth in terms of employment, and threatened to hold demos to voice their concerns.
