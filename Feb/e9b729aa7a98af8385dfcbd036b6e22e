 While signing the memorandum, Governor
Ndiritu Muriithi said health facilities accredited to the NHIF in Laikipia county would be increased to 44 from
the current seven. The
document was signed by Muriithi and NHIF CEO Geoffrey Mwangi. It was agreed that each of the 15 wards will have two accredited facilities. The development comes at a time when the
county government targets to enroll and fund 25,000 poor households into the
insurance scheme beginning July this year.
