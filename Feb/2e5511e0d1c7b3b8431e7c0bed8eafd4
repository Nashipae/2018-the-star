Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu’s ban on charcoal production and trade has received a boost. On Thursday, the county assembly unanimously passed a motion to endorse the ban. The ban had been opposed by some quarters. The assembly also resolved that  Ngilu’s  government should  act with speed and  facilitate alternative  sources of  income  for resideants. During the afternoon session presided over by temporary speaker Jane Mutua, all the 33 members voted to pass the motion moved by minority leader John Kisangau. It was seconded by Ngui Kiruru, the MCA for Nguni ward in Mwingi Central. The assembly also resolved the national government should enforce the ban. Ngilu’s administration was told to immediately develop a framework to ensure people in charcoal-producing areas have sustainable livelihoods. The MCAs resolved to support budgetary allocations for the sustainable  livelihoods framework in a bid  to save Kitui forests, water sources and fight drought and famine. Kisangau said the import was to ensure Ngilu’s directive gets backing.
