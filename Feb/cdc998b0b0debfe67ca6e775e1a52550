Brian and Risper Faith are finally husband and wife. The two married on Saturday in a blue-and-white theme wedding at Radisson Blu attended by close friends and family. She had initially stated during a Nairobi Diaries reunion that only her close friends would attend the wedding and the rest would read about it in blogs. At that time, Pendo and Bridget were her closest friends, but at the moment, Pendo and Risper are not seeing eye to eye. Risper looked stunning in a white gown with crystal details, while Brian wore a fitting suit with a top hat. They both looked amazing on their special day. Congratulations are in order.
