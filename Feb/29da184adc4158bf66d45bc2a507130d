Leaders from Laikipia North constituency support the ongoing security operation to recover more than 600 head of cattle stolen from a private ranch close to three weeks ago. The leaders include MP Sarah Korere and five MCAs. They cautioned police against harassing innocent residents, saying cattle rustlers are from neigbouring counties. “We know the operation is going on to recover animals stolen from Ole Naishu Ranch by armed raiders,” Lekorere said. There have been claims that the operation in Laikipia North subcounty is targeting the local community accused of helping the raiders drive away 875 animals. Only 300 animals have been recovered so far. The leaders yesterday urged the government not to withdraw the services of more than 300 National Police Reserves completely, but instead target the criminals among them. Since the NPR were deployed in the region late last year, crime had reduced. “These are people who volunteered and sacrificed for the sake of the community and should not be condemned. There might be some bad elements among them but that does not justify total condemnation,” said Mukogodo East MCA Daniel Nyeusi.
