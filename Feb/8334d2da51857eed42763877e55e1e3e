Mathare United head coach Francis Kimanzi has hailed the contribution of new signing Francis Omondi to his side’s terrific start to the Kenyan Premier League season. United are perched atop the standings with maximum points from their two games. Omondi netted the winner from the spot as Mathare, for the second game running, came from behind to beat Nzoia United 2-1 and maintain their early season momentum. Omondi, who was acquired in December 2017 from second tier side Modern Coast Rangers, is slowly becoming a fan favorite at the club and Kimanzi was equally impressed by his exploits against Nzoia. “That surprises a lot of us because he has the belief and we think Francis just needs good guidance. He has the capability and character to fight at the top level,” said Kimanzi of the prodigy. It was another great performance from his charges, who rallied from a goal down to clinch the 2-1 win in dramatic fashion. “The boys are showing some character because it’s the second game that we worked very well. It also shows that we have some maturity and depth in the team. We can always get better,” added Kimanzi after guiding his side to the top of the table. He also spoke glowingly of substitutes Daniel Mwaura and Chris Ochieng’, who made a telling contribution in the second half. “It is important for players to show that they are ready and sharp when they are needed. Mwaura and Chris showed it and it is great to have such players who can do a good job for the team when called upon,” assessed Kimanzi. Mathare’s championship credentials will face an even sterner test this weekend when they travel to Nakuru to face former champions Ulinzi Stars. The soldiers, who are sixth in the standings with six points lost their tie against Sony Sugar last weekend. Clinton Omondi’s strike proved to be the difference in an entertaining match played at the Green Stadium in Awendo.
