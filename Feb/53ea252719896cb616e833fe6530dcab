Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo has reignited his political war with predecessor Rashid Bedzimba, accusing him of mismanaging a school the former MP himself helped build through CDF. Bedzimba Primary School, which has a population of 1,300 pupils from class 1-7, had its electricity supply cut off eight months ago due to an outstanding bill of Sh108,000. This has caused a major disruption as exam papers, letters and other correspondence cannot be printed at the school. Additional expenses have been incurred when such operations have been outsourced. The school was opened on August 8, 2015, by Governor Hassan Joho.
