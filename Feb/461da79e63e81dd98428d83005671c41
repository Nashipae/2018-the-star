Liquidity “African Indices have been on a roll this year with Ghana surging +23.80 per cent, Nigeria +14.73 per cent and Nairobi hitting an all time high two sessions ago,” Satchu said. He said it is time for caution since the outsize liquidity injection whose effect was felt as far as Africa is now coming to an end and that will have negative knock-on effects.
