Budalangâ€™i residents have thanked the national government for reviving an irrigation project in the constituency. The project was started in 1981 by the late Peter Okondo, a former minister. Sisenye Irrigation Scheme chairman Joseph Wanyama said the project in Bunyala North ward stalled because of poor management and the negative attitude of the community towards it. He said the main aim of establishing the project was to uplift the living standards of residents. Wanyama on Monday said the 500 acres project was revived by area MP Raphael Wanjala during his first tenure, but the project stalled when he failed to recapture the seat in 2007. He said, despite being removed from the seat, the MP utilised his cordial relationship with the Jubilee government and went with the project committee members to former Water CS Eugene Wamalwa, who toured the project site last year and donated Sh73 million towards its revival. Wanyama said the Agriculture department had advised the farmers to set aside 60 acres of the 500 acres for sorghum cultivation. The sorghum is used by East African Breweries Limited to produce beer. He said apart from the sorghum being sold to the brewery, residents also use it as it is highly nutritious. Wanyama said the beer company has promised to provide tractors and all farm inputs to the farmers. He said the Agriculture department has also advised them to grow sunflower at the edge of their farms to keep away birds from destroying the sorghum. Last month, the Busia government announced it will partner with the EABL to commercialise sorghum farming. Five thousand farmers will supply the EABL plant in Kisumu for the production of Senator Keg beer. Most farmers currently grow sorghum for subsistence.
