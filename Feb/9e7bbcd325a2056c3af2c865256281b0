At least 139 tramps are in jail and nearly 500 homeless children have been rescued from the streets since the county launched a crackdown two weeks ago. The tramps pleaded guilty to littering, being a public nuisance, peeing on the streets and smoking, among other misdemeanors. County enforcement director Peter Mbaya said they failed to raise the Sh500 fine. Their terms range between 30 and 60 days. “This operation has been continuous but we intensified it two weeks ago and we can see positive results,” he said. The rescued children were taken to social halls and homes. They said 70have been taken to Kayole Social Hall, 106 are in Bahati, 30 in Shauri Moyo, 52 at Joseph Kang’ethe and 114 in Makadara. They did not name the other centres. It’s all peaceful The authorities have targetted street families, parking boys and vagabonds especially on Moi Avenue and Tom Mboya Street to restore order and security in the CBD. Head of security and compliance Tito Kilonzi said the crackdown has restored order. He said the social services department has been facilitating those willing to return to wherever they came from, after they pay fines or serve their jail terms. Kilonzi said those who are suspected of committing crimes are charged in court. However, there are those who want to hang around and go back to the streets, prompting the authorities to rearrest them. “We cannot say that we have cleared them in totality but we can confirm that the town is peaceful and the streets are now much better,” Kilonzi said. “You remember a few weeks ago there was an outcry over muggings in the CBD and we formed a team jointly with the National Police Service and that team has done a wonderful job. If you walk in the streets today, you realise that there is a lot of calm.”
