Sheena Chiteri, 28, is on a mission to put Kenya on the map of internationally recognised designers. The founder of Strategic Fashion Development Consortium was in the UK last week for the Commonwealth Fashion Exchange. Her consortium is an initiative seeking to further the interests of the emerging Kenyan fashion/culture industry and its designers. Chiteri's visit to the Big Ben coincided with the London Fashion Week, the UK’s biggest fashion event. Although she did not get to attend the session when Queen Elizabeth made a surprise appearance, she did attend a roundtable with the crème de la crème of the UK. She along with other designers and industry influencers had a 30-minute session with the Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton, iconic supermodel Naomi Campbell and Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. She and other participants got to share their thoughts on the future of fashion and how to tap into opportunities. The SFDC seeks to inspire, empower, share expertise and knowledge. It works with institutions teaching fashion design, legal professionals and the government to create a functional fashion industry that is credible, dynamic and economically sustainable.
