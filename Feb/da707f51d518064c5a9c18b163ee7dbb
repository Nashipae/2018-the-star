The Nairobi county government will subsidise school uniforms for public primary and secondary school students. The programme aims to hellp poor families in Nairobi to access education. Speaking in Dandora yesterday, Governor Mike Sonko said parents in slums are grappling with the high cost of uniforms, leading to dropouts. Sonko attended the official opening of the Dandora Green Light Vocational Training Centre. “The majority of parents struggle to educate their children. Apart from assisting in paying for the fees, we will give them school uniforms at subsidised prices,” he said. The Dandora Green Light Vocational Institute has been constructed by the South Korean government at a cost of Sh200 million. “After training, the youth will secure jobs in county, public and private institutions. This will also make them self-reliant and crime will decline,” Sonko said. Korean Ambassador Young Dae Kwon said education and skills are important for development.
