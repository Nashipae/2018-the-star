Kenya Commercial Bank will not underestimate the threat posed by rivals Kabras when the two sides face off in Kenya Cup match on Saturday at the Lions Den. Coach Curtis Olago said past wins over the sugar millers will count for nothing despite boosting a winning record against them. KCB beat Kabras 27-3 to win the crown in 2015 and reclaimed it last year with a 36-8 crushing win in the final. They retained the Enteprise Cup with a narrow 27-23 victory, coupled with a 22-17 win in the group phase. “All that is now history and this is a new year with new challenges. We have to be at our best and we cant afford to be complacent,” added Olago. Kabras are placed third on the log with 38 points and have a new coach in Charles Cadovillis. They have also signed several players who have gelled well so far in the season as they seek to bag the trophy they won in 2016. Champions KCB are unbeaten in nine matches and aim to become the first side since Quins in the 2011-2012 to go through an entire Kenya Cup season unbeaten. Olago though is not entertaining such kind of talk. “For me and the team, we are not thinking of going unbeaten. For us is one game at a time. We face Kabras on Saturday and Impala next. We need to have momentum before we go to the season ending playoffs,” he observed. KCB lead the log on 44 points and Olago said the there has been a professional approach to the this season. The bankers attended a 10-day training camp in June in Cape Town and its paying dividends on the pitch. “This season we are doing things differently there is a more professional approach to the way we are doing things in term of training, strength and conditioning and even coaching,” he added. “He said there is depth in the squad and the various combinations are working. This being long season its key when you have depth in you can rest and rotate players and save their energies for the key games later in the season,” added Olago.
