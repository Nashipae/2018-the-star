Last year, the Tanzanian government shocked many when it publicly named and shamed celebrities among suspected drug peddlers, as it sought to fight drug abuse. Many artistes were arrested and taken to the police station for questioning. Vanessa Mdee was one of those who were summoned and was jailed for seven straight days, something that really affected her as well as her family and close friends. In an interview with Shaffie and Adelle, her boyfriend Juma Jux said the arrest had a big impact on Vanessa. "Nilikua natamani hata ingekua possible tubadilishane, yeye awe nje na mimi niwe ndani. It was a hard time. When she left jail, Vanessa had changed, she wasn't the same Vanessa Mdee I knew. She even started saying she wants to live the country, if it was not for music then she wouldn't have been caught in all that. Lakini hiyo situation imemtengeneza na pia imemfundisha kitu flani. Tunashukuru Mungu," he said. When asked how the whole situation affected their relationship, he said, "Before Vanessa, I had a girlfriend called Jacky. Alikua na matatizo na kufanya mambo flani ambayo si poa, but I didn't know anything about it. So Vanessa alipofika akasema 'Jux maybe all this is because of you coz bila wewe mimi singeitwa hapa'. So Vanessa alipotoka alibadilika, alikua na mambo mingi, she was doubting everybody na mtu yoyote akija kwake anamwambia vitu tofauti. From that time alipotoka pale, ndio tulibreak up."
