The county government of Nyeri has launched a Sh50 million soil liming programme. Liming is the application to soil of calcium- and magnesium-rich materials. The lime will be purchased by the government and then be availed to farmers for free. Governor Mutahi Kahiga on Thursday said Nyeri soils have very high pH or acid due to fertilisers' overuse. He spoke in Ihururu, Tetu,when he launched the liming programme and opened a cooling plant at Ihururu Dairy Cooperative Society. "We are going to do the liming for the next three to four years to ensure we reclaim the quality of our soils. This will increase crop production," Kahiga said. He said 58,000 farmers will benefit in the first phase of the programme. The governor said the county government will procure a soil testing machine for Sh400,000 in the next financial year to cushion farmers from high cost of soil testing. He was accompanied by Agriculture executive Henry Kinyua.
