It
is easy to condemn the ongoing evictions of hawkers and demolition of illegal
structures across many urban centres in Kenya. In Mombasa and Eldoret, affected
traders have complained of lack of notice. In Nairobi the “cleanup” exercise to
restore order to human and motorised traffic in the estates and central
business district is affecting many livelihoods. Yet these exercises are
necessary for urban planning to ensure the safety of residents as well as
visitors. The
chaos in our urban areas is symptomatic of the general indiscipline in our
society. It is the result of negligence, expedient compromises and sheer
disregard of laws and processes. If they had been enforced we would not be
witnessing the battles being fought today between authorities trying to restore
order and those resisting. Yes,
the vagaries of survival can push anyone to set up shop anywhere to earn a
living. And the authorities are accomplices in these illegalities for happily licensing
and collecting taxes from such enterprises until they turn against them. 
But this vicious cycle must stop because it is a time bomb. However,
the exercise must be conducted in a civil manner and comply with due process.
The authorities must embrace public participation in finding solutions which,
once agreed, must be implemented by all parties.
