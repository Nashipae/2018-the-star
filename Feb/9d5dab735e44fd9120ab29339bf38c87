A public health officer from Budalang'i constituency, Busia county, has attributed rising jigger cases to dirty environment and poor hygiene. Dr Lillian Otsiengi a public health officer based at Bunyala subcounty headquarters on Thursday said jiggers attack are common during the dry season. She spoke after leading a team of community health workers in Ruambwa during a jigger treatment drive at Munani ECD centre. Fifty jigger victims from Munani village and its environs were treated in a day-long drive. “Dirty environments are a breeding ground for jiggers. I want to appeal to parents and the respective schools in the subcounty to ensure their homes and schools are kept clean,” she said. Otsiengi also urged parents to ensure they children keep their finger and toe nails short and clean. She said long nails store dirt and attract jiggers. Otsiengi said pupils affected by jiggers cannot do well in school.
