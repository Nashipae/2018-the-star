Thika United will continue to search for their first win of the 2018 Kenyan Premier League campaign without Emmanuel Kapchanga after it was confirmed he suffered an injury set back following a foot fracture against Nakumatt in Ruaraka. Kapachanga, who joined Thika this season from Agro Chemicals, came on as a sub in the league match and became the fourth victim to suffer a serious injury in the same ground. Last season, Dennis Odhiambo, Boniface Baraza and Baraka Badi were laid off for 3 weeks, 8 weeks and 4 months respectively after injuries incurred during Nakumatt vs Thika United league match at the same venue. According to the teamâ€™s medical unit, Kapchanga now has cast on his foot and will be out for eight weeks before rehab training commences. This is after a scan confirmed a fracture on the calf bone (Fibula). Michael Mutinda and Christopher Oruchum, who have been out also on rehab training after a Metatarsal injury in December, are reported to be picking up well according to the team doctor but are still weeks away from making their first appearance for the campaign. Thika have two points from their three matches and 14th on the table following their goal-less draw with Bandari last weekend. Coach Nicholas Muyoti has partly attributed the goal drought to bad luck. Thika next travel to Kericho to face off with Zoo Kericho.
