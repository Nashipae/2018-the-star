Last week I visited a wonderful place called the Nairobi Tented Camp. The friendly and helpful staff informed me that wildlife occasionally lions wander nearby, like the elusive Narina trogon, suni, bushbuck, buffalo and black rhino. The camp is carefully planned to ensure minimum environmental impact and maximum comfort. Guests enjoy a delicious meal and relax in the open lounge or spend some quiet time in the comfortable tents. It is hard to comprehend that this “green gem” is just a few kilometres from a busy city, and not in the Masai Mara, Tsavo or even Meru. What a fantastic place, the ideal retreat for some real “soul tonic”, surrounded by the most amazing variety of flora and fauna. Game drives are a wonderful experience when using the camp as a base, as guests also have an advantage over day visitors. On the plains below the forest there is much wildlife to be viewed, and guests are often thrilled with incredible sightings, like tiny lion cubs, or a glimpse of a leopard. The camp is located in the forested part of the Nairobi Park, catering for a maximum of 16 guests. It’s definitely a recommended place to stay. So why not get away from the maddening crowd and spend some treasured time in this “green gem”, while enjoying creation as God made it? Guests with reservations can enter the park at Langata gate or Main gate and drive through the forest to a wonderful secluded place called the Nairobi Tented Camp, which has a serene atmosphere, surrounded by the beauty of the Langata forest. Please enquire for resident rates, park fees apply.
