World Under-18 400m silver medalist Mary Moraa is keen on a place in the Team Kenya to the April’s Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia.
Moraa, a student at Mogonga Secondary School in Kisii County, is among youthful athletes who will battle it out for places in Team Kenya with elite athletes.
“She has trained well from December and we are hoping she will perform well and qualify to represent Kenya,” said her coach Haron Onchong’a.
Onchong’a, who is the principal of the school, however, said Moraa’s main target this year is the World Under-20 Championships planned for Tampere, Finland from July 10-15. Moraa, however, faces stiff competition from Maximila Imali, Millicent Ndoro, Jacinter Shikanda and Margaret Ndereba among others.
Dominic Ndigiti, who won a bronze medal during the World Under-18 championships in Nairobi last year, has also been invited. He faces Samuel Gathimba, Simon Wachira, Silvanus Karani and Eric Shikuku. “I’m ready for them though I know it will not be easy,” said Ndigiti, a student at Kiendege Secondary School in Nyamira County. David Saruni, who captained Kenya during the World Under-18 Championships has also beenn invited but it is unclear if he will make it. He is currently in the US, where he landed a scholarship at the Western Kentucky University. Kelvin Tauta, who participated in the 400m event during the championship, has also been invited to participate in hurdles, where former world champion Nicholas Bett is favourite alongside Boniface Mucheru.
George Manangoi, who clinched 1,500m gold in the World U-18 show has also been invited for the trials alongside his brother Elijah, his training mate Timothy Cheruiyot, Leonard Kwemoi and Silas Kiplagat.
Junior 800m champion Jackline Wambui is also relishing a chance to battle it out with her seniors including former world champions Eunice Sum and Janet Jepkoskei and Olympic bronze medalist Margaret Nyairera.
