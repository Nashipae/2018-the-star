Kenyans will pay less for calls across networks, mobile money transactions and messaging services from May if the Communications Authority adopts findings of a study released onTuesday. The study by Analysys Mason of the UK conducted since May 2016 was to establish the degree of competition among telecommunications firms with a view of creating a level playing field. "Safaricom should not be permitted to charge different rates for on-net and off-net calls or messaging to any customers under any circumstances either through its standard tariffs,promotions or permanent loyalty schemes," the study reads. It further adds that any bonus airtime granted to Safaricom customers should be usable for on-net and off-net calls and messaging at the same rates. DOMINANCE ABUSE The study notes that for fi ve years, Safaricom, should provide 2G, 3G and 4G roaming on its network to other Tier 1 mobile operators in the counties identified for regulated tower sharing. The recommendation is that this will be done to in seven northern counties based on principle of proportionality and in recognition of investment made by Safaricom in rural infrastructure. "The implementation of these laws will help to prevent any temptations to abuse dominance, its not an accusation of being powerful in the sector, but a measure to safeguard the interest of the sector, investors and consumers," Economist Jino Kim said. The telco will also be required to unveil standard tariff s, permanent loyalty schemes and promotions that can profitably be replicated by efficient competitors. This will ensure that consumers are not confined to one service provider but have unlimited choice on tariffs and promotions. Loyalty bonuses or promotions such as bonga points should be banned according to the study because they are discriminatory. For mobile money transactions, a flat rate should be used across all platforms so that consumers can withdraw and deposit money on any platform without any additional charges.
