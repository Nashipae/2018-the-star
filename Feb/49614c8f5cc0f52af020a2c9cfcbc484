Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has carried out a major shakeup in his administration. He has transferred some subcounty administrators, moved others to serve as administrators in various departments and promoted some ward administrators to subcounty administrators. The heads of the County Audit and ICT departments have been moved. Last Wednesday he named nominees to his new County Executive Committee. He has retained only three executives from his first cabinet and moved five to other positions. During the campaigns, Oparanya said he would sack lazy staff. In December he asked those engaged in graft and witchcraft to leave his government. “With these changes, I am putting all government employees on notice. We will no longer tolerate absenteeism, apathy, poor service delivery and corruption,” Oparanya said.
