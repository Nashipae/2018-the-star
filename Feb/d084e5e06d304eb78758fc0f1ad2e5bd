The suspected ringleader of a criminal gang in Kiambu has been arrested and Sh1 million property recovered from his house. Police recovered hardware stock, including barbed wire, structural iron bars, iron sheets, nails, windows and bicycles during the raid in Kiambaa. They also recovered household items and jewellery, suspected to have been stolen from homes. Kiambaa OCPD Wilberforce Sicharani said said they had been given a tip-off by the public that the suspect stores stolen items which he sells to unsuspecting customers. The suspect was seized at his home in Laini Area in Banana and taken to the Karuri police station. Sicharani said police would ask for more time to complete their probe when the suspect is taken to court. Villagers flocked at the station to identify their property. “We are urging residents to continue cooperating with police to help us end house break-ins and robberies,” Sicharani said. He said the arrested suspect was helping with investigations and leads to apprehend other gang members. “We will do everything to arrest them. Unless they stop their criminal ways, they will continue being in trouble,” Sicharani said. He listed Banana,Laini, Kanunga, Red Hill and Tigoni as areas where the gang had terrorised residents.
