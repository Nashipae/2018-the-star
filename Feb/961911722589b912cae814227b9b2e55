DJ Mo has been embroiled in a nightmare affair that just doesn’t seem to go away: the allegation that he charges gospel
musicians to play their music videos on his popular Crossover 101 on NTV. The show can be a linchpin for an artiste who desperately wants to make it in the industry. Nexxie claims to have sent Sh20,000 to DJ Mo for his song to be played on his show. He said, “To them it was, ‘What is 20,000?’ to me it was ‘everything’. I was promised ‘a rise to
stardom’ in two months, with consistent airplay on high
rotation and exposure through interviews.
I lost my mum when I was
only 13 years, and since then I promised myself to take care of
my now ageing father and siblings. So when this opportunity came my way, I
had to do all I can to raise the amount, including not paying
rent for that month and skipping some meals. To me, it was not just Sh20,000; it was my whole life.” But the Crossover host vehemently refutes the claim.
He provided evidence that he returned the money to Nexxie’s manager,  contrary to claims he had kept the money. The messages also show
that Nexxie is being used by “some people” with nefarious motives, who
want to take down DJ Mo.
