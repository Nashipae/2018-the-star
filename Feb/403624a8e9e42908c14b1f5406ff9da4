The alternative is "at least 10 years' experience as distinguished academics or legal practitioners, or such experience in other relevant legal fields,” the advert reads. Other than reviewing decisions to prosecute or not to prosecute criminal offences, the DPP has powers to direct the Inspector General of Police to carry out investigations. The office holder can also institute legal proceedings against suspects. Tobiko's successor is expected to take over pending cases. Regarding terms of service, selection panel chairperson Elizabeth Muli says: “The DPP shall hold office for a term of eight years and shall not be eligible for reappointment. "The gross monthly salary attached to this post is Sh765,188 plus other benefits as determined by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission."
