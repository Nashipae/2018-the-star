A group of Wajir residents yesterday took to the streets to protest escalating clan tension between two neighbouring pastoralist communities. They blamed the anxiety on Governor Mohamed Abdi’s fight for survival after the High Court nullified his victory on January 12. Abdi has since moved to the Court of Appeal. Former Governor Ahmed Abdullahi is challenging his victory. Elder Abdullahi Amin said they are protesting the court ruling. He said the court did not take into account the interests of the people of Wajir. ‘victory was stolen’ The ruling has sparked tension and animosity. Residents are sharply divided on clan lines. “Residents are worried about the situation in our county. The court ruling has put us back into campaign mode, Abdulahhi said. “Clans are regrouping, while others are battling it out on social media platforms. This is not good.” Another elder, Bishar Ali, hit out at the High Court, saying the ruling will require them to elect another governor, yet they already voted for one in the August 8 General Election. Resident Asha Mohamed urged politicians to learn to respect the people’s verdict, and stop rushing to court whenever they are defeated. Governor Abdi recently assured residents he would complete his five-year term. He pledged to implement projects his administration promised. On the other hand, former governor Abdullahi is optimistic he will carry the day in court, and in the subsequent by-election. “It is an open secret that we were robbed of victory in the election. I am very sure if the elction is held today, I will by a landslide,” he said after the High Court ruling.
