The alarming drought in Mandera has become severe and animals may soon begin to die, experts have warned. “If it does not rain within the next two weeks we might lose entire herds of cattle as pasture has been completely depleted, with boreholes drying up so fast,” Hussein Alio said. He is the area’s National Drought Management Authority  Drought coordinator Alio was speaking on the sidelines of a drought alleviation meeting on Wednesday. He said the entire county is suffering a major drought and is need of urgent intervention. Alio said the only available pasture and water is in Banisa county in neighboring Ethiopia, and even that is very little. Residents have moved their animals to Banisa, increasing the threat of conflict over grazing land and water. In efforts to lessen the effects of the drought, the NDMA has introduced livestock feeding programmes across the county, where it supplies nutrient-rich drought pellets. County Livestock Marketing Council chairperson Abdilatif Haji Yusuf said the current situation has been aggravated by persistent droughts over the years. He said livestock prices have gone down. Yusuf said the Middle East market prefers livestock from Ethiopia over that from Kenya. Yesterday local leaders, headed by county assembly majority leader Abdi Hassan, urged the national government to provide relief aid and livestock feed. The Kenya Red Cross Society yesterday launched a fresh food appeal.
