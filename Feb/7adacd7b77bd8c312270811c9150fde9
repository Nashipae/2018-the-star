Hundreds of Marsabit residents turned up for an anti-jigger drive in Mlima Tatu, Saku subcounty, on Wednesday. The drive was launched at Mlima Tatu Dispensary by Deputy Governor Solomon Gubo and Governor Mohammed Ali wife’s Alamitu Jattani. More than 2,000 residents are infected. Gubo said it is time to rid the county of jiggers. He said eradication of jiggers has been on his mind for a long time. Gubo said the administration will look for a donor to help make the campaign a success. Jattani urged residents to maintain high standards of cleanliness. She helped to wash and disinfect the feet of infected residents. “Jiggers cause disability and death if the victim is not well treated and monitored,” Alamitu said. She and Gubo also donated food.
