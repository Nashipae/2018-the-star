ANC officials in Kakamega county have said that COTU Secretary General Francis Atwoli has no authority to remove its leader Musalia Mudavadi as Luhya spokesman. Speaking to the press after a meeting at Jamindas Hotel on Monday, county chairman Julius Arunga said Atwoli should have had the courtesy to summon Mudavadi and register his displeasure instead of attacking him in public. They said it was not Atwoli’s responsibility to install and remove Luhya leadership. Atwoli on Saturday said that he had dropped Mudavadi as the Luhya spokesman and vowed never to support him again. He accused Mudavadi of abandoning NASA leader Raila Odinga at the hour of need. Raila was sworn in as the peoples’ president on Tuesday last week. Mudavadi, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Ford-K’s Moses Wetang’ula skipped the event at Uhuru Park, sparking attacks from NASA supporters on social media who termed them cowards. “We are asking our supporters to remain patient until Mudavadi and Wetang’ula shed light on what led them to skip Raila's oath,” Arunga said. He said it could not have been coincidence for all the three NASA co-principals to avoid the event. County ANC treasurer Zakayo Nabwera said that Atwoli did not appoint Mudavadi the Luhya spokesman and should stop threatening him. “It is the people of Western who picked Mudavadi as the most popular Luhya leader and not Atwoli,” he said. Nabwera said Atwoli has himself unsuccessfully contested the Khwisero MP seat several times and cannot march Mudavadi. ANC delegates Albert Wetundu said attacks on Mudavadi by Kakamega senator Cleophas Malala and nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi were motivated by Jubilee. “Malala should leave Luhyas to discuss their issues and stop abusing our leaders because he is a senator because of Mudavadi,” he said. Wetundu said that ANC followers will push to ensure Osotsi is kicked out as a nominated MP since he was no longer serving the interest of the party.
