Oserian women’s football team will again have to do without the services of dependable defender Irene Ogutu as the women’s Premier League kicks off on February 24 across the nation. Ogutu was ruled out of the team for the better part of last season with knee injury as her team finished third during the premier league play-off. The injury also saw Ogutu, a regular national team player, miss the Cosafa Cup held in Zimbabwe last year. Oserian coach Hudson Odari said they were hoping the player will be back early this season but the way things look, they will have to wait little bit longer. Odari, who attended the clubs’ pre-season meeting hosted by Football Kenya Federation (FKF) yesterday, said they will have to do without her services but remained optimistic that the player will be available for the second leg. “It is sad that we will not have Ogutu as we start our title campaign in the first leg of the unified league. She is a good player and her services will be missed,” said Ondari. He added: “Being a unified league, it will come with competition which is good. But having finished third last season, we want to go a step further and win the title. We haven’t recruited and I believe this squad having played together for a long, have what it takes to deliver.” Oserian will take on Soccer Queens in their opening match of the season at Hope Centre.
