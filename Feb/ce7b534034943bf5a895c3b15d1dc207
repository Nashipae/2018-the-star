Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya has ordered residents who sold Mwereni Ranch to record a statement with the police over claims the whole deal was a fraud. Speaking on Monday during a community meeting to solve land disputes, Mvurya said surveyors and committee in-charge of the ranch to also record statements. Intruders came in and claimed ownership of 3,000 acres at the ranch. “We will not allow selfish people to sell a community land to satisfy their empty stomachs. The law will take its course,” Mvurya said. He asked those who bought land that is under a ranch to claim back their money in court as they were conned. He advised them against selling property as it could make them poor.
