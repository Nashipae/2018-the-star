Fifteen families were left homeless after their houses were razed down in Kimende, Kiambu on Monday night. Lari AP commander Gilbert Nyunyi said the fire burnt the plot that contained 17 houses. "The other two houses were a hotel and a shop. No one was injured in the inferno," Nyunyi said. The public had tried to put out the fire but were unable to due to strong winds. It was eventually extinguished by firefighters from Limuru. Residents have asked the county to put up a firefighting station in the area. â€œIt is hard for us to salvage anything in case of a fire breakout because there are no firefighters in Lari constituency," Rosemary Njoroge said. Njoroge urged area governor Ferdinand Waititu to ensure all fire fighters are stationed near major towns within the county, where they can access emergency scenes.
