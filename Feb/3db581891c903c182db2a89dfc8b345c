Former Rongai MP Luka Kigen is on the spot for allegedly demanding Sh500 million from a family. A court ordered that the family be paid Sh2.9 billion as compensation for land in Uasin Gishu county. Kigen lodged a claim at the Commercial Court division seeking the sum for allegedly facilitating payment to the administrators of Malakwen arap Sisiwa’s estate. He is dead. Kigen filed the suit on January 24 against Musa Kitur, Hassan Sisiwa, Salim Kiptoo and their mother Sophia Cherotich. He said they signed a deal to seek the payout, after which he would get a 20 per cent commission. But the family’s lawyer Ham Lagat says it is unclear how Kigen helped them get the compensation. Lagat said, “It’s against public policy for Kigen to allege he mobilised the Treasury and Parliament to release the funds.”
