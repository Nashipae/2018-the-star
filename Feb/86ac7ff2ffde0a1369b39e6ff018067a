Fewer students from Busia are applying for funding from the Higher Education Loans Board, an official has said. County director for vocational training Manasi Echaune said only 400 students have applied for the loan, compared to 1,000 last year. This year’s deadline for Helb application ended yesterday. “It is wrong for students to seek help from the county when they fail to apply for the loan meant for them,” Echaune said. Busia county has allocated Sh37 million to be disbursed as bursary. Echaune said the drop occurred despite county’s campaigns to urge learners to apply for the Helb funding. “We passed the information through the media and county administrators at the subcounty, ward and village levels. The drop is a cause for worry,” Echaune said. He urged those who have downloaded the Helb forms to submit them to the county offices today. Vetting of bursary applicants will start soon after the formation of a committee. About 11,000 students benefited from Sh90 million in bursaries during the 2016/2017 financial year. Echaune said they were looking to benefit from the Sh63 million conditional grant by the state to improve youth polytechnics countrywide.
