Struggling East Africa Portland Cement’s half-year losses widened almost three fold on the back of a tough macroeconomic environment during the second half of 2017. The cement manufacturer reported a Sh969.57 million after tax loss during the six month period compared to Sh248.12 million a similar period in 2016. The firm saw its revenue dip by about Sh660 million or 17.74 per cent which it attributed to low cement purchases as a result of the economic shocks the country witnessed during the period. “Revenue declined due to slow market uptake on account of prolonged political activity which dampened investment decisions and thus slowed down economic activities,” the firm said in its financial statement. EAPCC also attributed the poor performance to effects of the interest rate cap and the prolonged drought on the general macroeconomic environment. The State-owned manufacturer is banking on government’s Agenda Four initiative where affordable housing and manufacturing are among top priorities to return to profitability. The firm will also undertake initiatives geared towards reducing its high finance and administrative costs. “The company will continue with the ongoing restructuring programmes covering both operations and financial aspects of the business,” the firm stated. Latest provisional data collated by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics shows about 6.16 million metric tonnes of cement were produced as at December 2017, an 8.2 per cent drop compared to 2016.
