Police yesterday arrested a public service vehicle plying a Mombasa route for playing loud music and showing lewd videos as the Kenya Film Classification Board began a crackdown on matatus with obscene content. The move follows complaints by religious leaders, parents and members of the civil society. The matatu plying the Mombasa-Mtwapa route has been singled out for showing obscene videos. Last week, the matatu's crew threw out two passengers who had complained about the loud music. The commuters' registered their complaint with the KFCB regional manager Bonventure Kioko who asked police to take action. The complainant, Jason Murimi, said was in the matatu with his family members including a 10-year-old daughter, when the obscene music video was played. “I complained together with other passengers but our please fell on deaf ears. The crew ordered that we alight at the next stop," Murimi said. The matatu crew were arrested and taken to the Mtwapa police station. Kioko said the driver and the conductor will be charged today with exhibiting unclassified video content against the Films and Stage Plays Act. “This is the start of action. There will be no more talk. We want to ensure that all TV screens in matatus are removed because they have failed to show decency,” Kioko said in Mtwapa. He said matatus plying the Mtwapa-Mombasa, Bamburi-Ferry and Tudor-Ferry routes were among the most notorious.
