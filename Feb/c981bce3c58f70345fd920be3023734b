Four matatu passengers received minor injuries. They were treated and discharged. Witnesses said Kamau had been overtaking when he collided with the matatu. “The driver underestimated the speed of the matatu while overtaking. We only heard the car breaking, but it was too late. They collided and it swerved off the road, leaving the matatu standing on the road with passengers screaming,” Rachel Wanja said. Lari OCPD Isaiah Odhiambo urged drivers to drive at moderate speeds
