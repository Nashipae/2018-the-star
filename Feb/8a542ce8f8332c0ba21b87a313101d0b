Some 15,000 tea workers in Nyamira county have protested the overturning of their 30 per cent pay increase by the Court of Appeal. The tea plantation workers were awarded the pay rise by the labour relations court in September last year, but last month the Court of Appeal slashed it to six per cent. The Kenya Plantation and Agricultural Workers Union leadership from Kericho, Bomet, Nandi and Nyamira met in Borabu, Nyamira county, on Sunday. National organising secretary Henry Omasire said the 30 per cent pay rise was reasonable and employers have no option but to agree on the payment modalities. “...we are not happy with what the Court of Appeal did. We vow to challenge it so that our workers can get what is rightfully theirs,” he said. Omasire said the courts are supposed to protect the workers not the masters who have turned workers into slaves. “We shall not be colonised at this time. The courts have been empowered to enslave us, that we are very sure, but we shall not allow it to happen to our workers,” he said. Omasire said the workers will go on a nationwide strike. The workers criticised the management of Eastern Produce for moving to court and overturning the 30 per cent pay rise. “We want the government to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible with the leadership of KPAWU and make sure our money is paid, without any delay,” Bomet secretary Dickson Sang said.
