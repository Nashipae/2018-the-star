A bubbly TV host is going through a tough time—her hubby of eight years just walked out of their marriage. The couple have a son together. It is not clear why the man walked away, but sources close to the couple say the two had reached a point in their life where they could not see eye to eye on anything. The couple's wedding was ostentatious and it was the talk of the town—only 100 people were invited to the ceremony. It was so exclusive that paparazzi found out about it weeks after the grand ceremony. The couple is now preparing itself for a protracted court battle over the custody of their child. Pray for them.
