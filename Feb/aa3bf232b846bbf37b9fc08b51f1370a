Victims of the Kijiji fire in Lang’ata yesterday were relocated from Ngei Primary School to their newly built temporary homes. Five people were killed and 600 families displaced in the fire last month. The families have been camping at the school. The homes were put up on land where their destroyed houses stood before. National Disaster Management Unit deputy director Pius Masai said the victims have been given basic needs. “The supply of items such as maize, beans, rice has been going on,” he said in a statement. Masai said a man attempted to steal the supplies on Tuesday. He was caught with 11 25kg bags of rice loaded in a Toyota station wagon. “With information and the help of families and security officers, the vehicle was seized, but the suspect escaped. The vehicle was towed to the Lang’ata police station,” Masai said.
