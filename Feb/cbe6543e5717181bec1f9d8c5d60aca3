A lawyer has sued to block the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions from hiring senior officers, saying it is not properly constituted. The ODPP currently lacks a substantive head following the resignation of former director Keriako Tobiko last month. Tobiko was appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta as Environment CS. Francis Waigwa, in an application filed at the Milimani law court yesterday, said the ODPP lacks legal capacity to hire. The ODPP wants to hire a deputy director, a senior assistant director, principal prosecutors, chief finance officers, clerks, librarians and supply chain managers. Waigwa said the advisory board that handles the recruitment was not sufficiently established. An advert calling for applications was placed by secretary of public prosecutions Dorcas Oduor. But Waigwa said the advert was illegal. He wants the court to stop Oduor from shortlisting candidates for interview. “Shortlisting candidates for purposes of the recruitment is an abuse of the due process of law,” Waigwa said. He asked the court to suspend the hiring.
