Embu county has been asked to close down all unguarded hostels to prevent incidents like last week's rape of five students. Embu Woman Representative Jane Wanjuki condemned the incident that occurred on Thursday night in the Castle Hostel in Bondeni Estate in Embu town. Gangsters allegedly stormed the hostel, raped the Embu College students and made way with their items. Wanjuki asked owners of the hostels to employ guards to provide security to the female students. The MP urged the county and relevant authorities to close down hostels that do not comply with the security measure. She also urged parents to ensure their children stay in safe places wherever they are seeking education. Wanjuki asked police to strengthen security in the area and establish a 24-hour patrol. “It is unfortunate that gangsters raped innocent girls who have gone to the college in search of a better future. We want police to bring to book the perpetrators of that heinous act,” Wanjuki said. About 10 armed gangsters stormed the female hostel, situated some 100 metres away from the AP regional headquarters in Embu. They attacked at about midnight. It is not yet clear how the attackers gained entry into the compound before breaking into the hostels. The students said the gangsters demanded money and laptops. They also took away gas cylinders. "They beat those who did not cooperate and raped some of our colleagues," A student who sought anonymity told the Star.
