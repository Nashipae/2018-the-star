BET's Top Actor finalist, Alex Khayo has revealed that Kenya is the "hotbed of talent" in Africa. "Kenyan actors are the best. Honestly, we are not yet where Hollywood is but were heading there, we are in the right direction." Talking about the BET gig, Khayo says it was no bed of roses. "In Top actor I worked so hard, sleepless nights but i pulled through.It was eye opening, it was a great experience." Currently, he is ruling the airwaves in the much talked about Swahili telenovela, Selina. "I play Xavier, a wannabe, he is a driver but doesn't believe he is supposed to be a driver. I auditioned for Nelson but I landed Xavier. I love the role." Previously, he has been cast in 'play boy' roles, something he says its not based on his real life adding, "securing roles, as an actor you have to be open to so many people, the biggest challenge is getting a job that will pay you well and market you the right way. I've acted as an extra so many times." We couldn't help it but ask how he keeps his attractive physique. "I work out a lot and eat a lot. The type of job I'm doing is based on first impressions, so I have to improve in it. I eat four meals a day." So, is he dating? "Yeah, I'm dating an actress. She is very supportive. My ideal woman is very confident, you have to deal with a lot of stalkers, attention. I don't like insecure people."
