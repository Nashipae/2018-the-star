A group of NASA supporters on Friday attacked and seriously injured a police officer on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. The officer had flagged down a mini-bus ferrying the supporters back to Kisumu after attending NASA leader Raila Odinga's swearing-in ceremony on Tuesday. The officer was robbed off cash and part of his police gear during the incident that occurred in Naivasha. More than 300 supporters were travelling to Kisumu in a fleet of mini-buses. Fellow officers, who were not armed during the 8am incident, watched in horror as their colleague was roughed up. He was rescued by members of the public.
