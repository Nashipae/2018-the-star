Kenya Film and Classification Board officials from the Garissa office on Saturday conducted an inspection targetting matatus plying the Garissa-Madogo route. Buses playing the Garissa-Nairobi route were not spared in the early morning swoop. They cracked down on matatus showing and playing obscene content. Garissa office manager Justin Ombati said members of the public have complained that some matatus and buses play obscene, unpleasant loud music and videos. But matatu crews seemed to have got a hint of the impending clampdown, as targetted vehicles had their music gadgets tampered with or removed. Only two buses were found to have video content that was unclassified and unsuitable for children. The officials seized their flash disks for inspection. Ombati said crews found to have flouted the law will be prosecuted.
