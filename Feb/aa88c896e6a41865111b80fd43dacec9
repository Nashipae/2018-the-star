Residents of Mt Elgon want a fresh military operation to track down a gang that has killed more than 20 people since the beginning of the year. Six people were killed on Sunday night by an armed gang at Sirai in Chepyuk settlement scheme. Two died while receiving treatment at Cheptais Hospital. The following day, a family was attacked and police suspect the same gang is behind the raid. Residents have already started fleeing in fear of more attacks. Speaking to the Star yesterday in Cheptais, resident Jacob Teben, who is admitted to Cheptais Hospital after being attack at his home on Monday, said the only solution is a fresh military operation. “I missed death by a whisker. The gang raided my home at midnight. My cries for help fell on deaf years. I struggled with them, they left me for the dead after shooting me,” he said. Teben said the attacks are similar to the ones by the SLDF militia that reigned terror in the region between 2002 and 2007. At least 1,200 were killed and 10,000 displaced. The army launched “Operation Okoa Maisha”. Militia leader Wycliffe Matwakei was felled near Cheptaburbur village in Kopsiro in May 2008. “Teben said regular police, GSU and administration police manning the region are inadequate and inefficient. Most attacks happen a few meters from their camps, he said. Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati asked interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i for urgent intervention, saying the killings are getting out of hand. “Every day you hear about brutal killings, yet the national government is just watching. It is hurting. Enough is enough, something must be done,” he said. He said Deputy President William Ruto, who will visit the region on Saturday, should come with a long lasting solution. Western police regional commander Moses Ombati blamed locals for “hiding the gang”. “The people never collaborate with the police,” he said.
