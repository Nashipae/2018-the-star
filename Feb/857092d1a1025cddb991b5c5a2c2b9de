The body of Mary Waithera, 27, who was killed in Germany three weeks ago is in the country. The body was flown in on Wednesday night and was received by relatives and friends at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Waithera was found lying lifeless in her shop in Essen town and was confirmed dead at a nearby hospital. Police have released the photo of a Tanzanian said to be the main suspect. Waithera’s younger brother Samuel Njuguna said the family, with the help of friends, had managed to raise the amount required to fly the body back. The family called for justice for the departed. She will be buried in Kinamba village on the Naivasha-Kinangop road today. “This has been one of the hardest times for the family and we thank friends who stood by us and we pray that no family will have to go through such an experience,” Njuguna said. Body found dumped Njuguna said they are still waiting for word from police in Germany but they are confident justice will be done. Meanwhile, police in Naivasha have found the body of a man dumped along the Naivasha-Kasarani road. The body, which did not have any identification documents, was found by herders near Marula Farm. “We first thought the man was sleeping but on getting closer we discovered that he was dead and informed the police, who have since picked it up,” herder Jackson  Surani said. A week ago another body was found dumped in the notorious Kinale Forest along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. The body had strangulation marks. The body found yesterday was taken to the Naivasha Subcounty Hospital mortuary. Many bodies have been found in Kinale Forest, usually without any form of identification on them.
