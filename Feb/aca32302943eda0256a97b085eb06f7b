Forty administrators have been swapped in a major exercise by the Baringo government on Thursday. They include 30 ward administrators from the entire Baringo North, Central and South, Tiaty, Mogotio and Eldama Ravine subcounties. Also affected were administrators from Kabarnet. Deputy Governor Jacob Chepkwony said the drive is “normal” and aims to improve service. “Transfer is inevitable for every public servant who has signed a Public Service Board contract and can be called to serve anywhere at any time,” he said. This comes after Governor Stanley Kiptis promised to ‘sweep’ the house and make changes to various departments.
