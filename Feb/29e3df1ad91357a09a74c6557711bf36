More than 3.4 million Kenyans are at risk of starvation following prolonged drought, the Kenya Red Cross Society Authorities said yesterday. The areas affected include Kilifi, Kajiado, Isiolo, Garissa, Wajir, Mandera, Turkana and Baringo. Kenya Red Cross deputy secretary general Ayaz Manji yesterday said Kajiado and Baringo require urgent intervention as they are the worst affected. He toured Ganze and Bamba water projects by the KRCS in partnership with the Kilifi county government at a cost of Sh125 million. The project is part of drought mitigation measures. Kenya Red Cross has started mitigation measures to ensure residents in drought-stricken areas access water. They include cash transfers, water for livestock, vetenary services and recovery efforts. Manji said, “Drought is not new, it’s just continuing to evolve. The short rains were poor.” In Ganze, Kenya Red Cross spent Sh75 million, while the county government of Kilifi spent Sh50 million to set up the project which is almost completed and serving 88,000 residents. Once completed, the Ganze-Bamba water project will serve 106,000 people. “The infrastructure inhabited by the Kilifi Mariakani Water and Sewerage Company is dilapidated. It’s time to change the systems,’’ Manji said. Kenya Red Cross Coast regional coordinator Hassan Musa said 241,000 people have been affected by drought in three counties. Kilifi is on top with 129,000 people affected, followed by Taita Taveta’s 77,000.
