Kajiado residents will no longer travel to other countries for treatment as its referral hospital has acquired its first five renal dialysis units. Governor Joseph Lenku has commissioned the equipment on Friday, noting the people ha suffered for too long. “Patients with chronic kidney diseases, who require renal replacement therapy, have been suffering for years because of lack of visionary leadership,” he said during the ceremony. He  noted his people's suffering had pained him as the government offered ‘free’ medical equipment. Former Governor David Nkedianye initially declined to receive the equipment from the national government. The Sh38 billion Medical Equipment Scheme equipped 94 hospitals in counties - two in each. President Uhuru Kenyatta noted that services only offered at Kenyatta National Hospital, Moi Referral and private hospitals had been taken closer to cizitens. But it was later said that the equipment lay idle because of lack of training on how to use them.

The hospital will provide dialysis for patients with NHIF cards, who have fully paid their monthly contributions." County Health Executive Esther Somoire said hemodialysis treatment will be provided for people with end-stage chronic kidney diseases that require renal replacement therapy. She said patients under the care of consultants from tertiary hospitals, who reside in catchment areas, will also have access to the services. Patients undergoing dialysis sit on special recliner chairs that can be adjusted to their comfort in the newly installed units. Click here for the latest political stories
