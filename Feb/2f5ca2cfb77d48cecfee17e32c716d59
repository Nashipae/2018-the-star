A fire razed Bomet county's Tenwek Mission Hospital restaurant on Friday evening. Pius Masai, head of the National Disaster Management Unit, sent out an alert calling for support to put off the flames. "We are appealing to anyone with fire fighting equipment nearby or from Kericho, Kisii, Nyamira and Narok counties to respond and support." "Updates to follow," Masai said in the alert, adding that: "Patients are safe." Vitalis Kimutai, an official in Governor Joyce Laboso's administration, told The Star "the fire started at the restaurant before it spread to other areas". "The fire team is already activated and have responded to the distress," he said. Masai said the fire, which destroyed the storey building, was contained. "Some other four rooms were damaged when they were destroyed to act as a fire break." "All patients were successfully evacuated to other rooms. The cause of the fire is not yet known," the disaster management boss said. He said relavant authorities will conduct investigation into what sparked the fire. Masai added that the hospital operations have not been affected as they have another restaurant. Click here for the latest political news
