Squatters on plots bordering the Manda Airport in Lamu County have asked to be issued with title deeds. This follows increased cases of land grabbing by tycoons. Speaking in Manda yesterday,the more than 500 squatters said they are worried they could easily be displaced in plans to expand the airport. They urged the National Land Commission to survey the land and issue them with title deeds. Their spokesperson, Ahmed Twalib, said squatters also want the NLC to probe lands earmarked for development in Manda that have been grabbed by private developers. “All we want is for the NLC to give us title deeds.”
