Meru MCAs have promised to pass laws that will protect macadamia farmers from exploitation. Assembly's trade committee led by David Kaithia on Thursday visited farms in Tigania West as they compile a report on the plight of farmers. The farmers have complained on exploitation amid price wars that left two Chinese nationals deported two weeks ago. They claimed the deportation was orchestrated by local macadamia buyers who had accused the Chinese of unfair competition. The Chinese were buying nuts at Sh170 per kg. Local buyers pay Sh90 less. Last week, farmers demonstrated outside Governor Kiraitu Murungi office to protest the deportation and demand protection. Kaithia's committee visited Akithi ward to listen to the farmers' grievances. "Many farmers in Tigania depend on macadamia after the coffee industry collapsed. They must be protected from exploitation," Kaithia said. Some farmers have declined to sell their nuts to the local buyers, citing low prices. "We will write a report and send it to the executive to compel the county to protect macadamia farming," Kaithia said. Ntima East MCA Mutethia Mauru asked the assembly to set a fixed price for macadamia. He urged farmers to add value to their products for higher returns. Kiegoi MCA Kimathi Ithibua asked the county to set up a macadamia factory in Tigania. He said local buyers should not eliminate foreign competition. "It is unfair to kick out the Chinese buyers. If local buyers want the macadamia, then they should raise their prices to Sh200 per kilogramme," Ithibua said. Kiguchua MCA Linus Athinya accused cartels of exploiting farmers. Athinya also faulted the Agriculture and Food Authority for allowing the harvesting of macadamia yet the crops were not yet ready.
