No additional constituency will be created in the planned boundaries review, an MP has said. Constitutional Implementation Oversight Committee vice-chairman and Mt Elgon MP Fred Kapondi said any increase in electoral units requires a national referendum. He spoke at the weekend in Kinyoro, Trans Nzoia, during the burial of Ruskin Kipling, a teacher who was killed in a road accident in Cheptais. Kapondi told Kenyans not to confuse the review of electoral boundaries with the creation of new electoral zones. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chairman, Wafula Chebukati recently said constituencies can be increased or reduced based on a number of factors that include cultural practices of communities. Administratively, the State has been increasing the number of locations, divisions and districts. Chiefs, assistant county commissioners, deputy commissioners and county commissioners have been hired without constitutional amendments. Review to begin this month Kapondi urged leaders to educate Kenyans on the Constitution. “It is important that those asking for an increase in constituencies know that it can only be done through a referendum,” Kapondi said. Former Trans Nzoia Senator Henry ole Ndiema took issue with the IEBC for seeking Sh8 billion to conduct a second review of ward and constituency boundaries. “That amount is too much for the exercise. The National Assembly must take into account the country’s economic status when allocating funds,” Ndiema said. He suggested Sh1 billion is enough for the drive. Endebess MP Robert Pukose, Kinyoro MCA Lawrence Mogusu and his colleagues from Trans Nzoia and Bungoma attended the burial. MCAs from Trans Nzoia and Bungoma also attended the burial. Last week, the IEBC asked Parliament to allocate them Sh8 billion to conduct a second review of the ward and constituency boundaries within four years. The IEBC boss and the commissioners appeared before the CIOC chaired by Ndaragua MP Jeremiah Kioni.
