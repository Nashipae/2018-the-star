Police in Elgeyo Marakwet on Thursday arrested two suspected criminals and
recovered an AK47 rifle, three rounds of ammunition and a knife. The duo was
arrested after a dramatic chase by police officers and boda boda riders along
Iten-Kapsowar road. Keiyo North
police boss Mwenda Meme said the two men had attempted to escape
using a motorbike. Meme said
members of the public spotted the suspects and tipped off police
officers. "The
suspects attempted to stab our officers but they were finally arrested and are
being interrogated in Iten police station," he said. The police boss said the
motorcycle used by the suspects has also been impounded. He said the suspects bought the rifle at Marigat, Baringo county and were transporting
it to Kapyego, Marakwet East in a suitcase. "We are
interrogating the suspects to establish the motive of buying and transporting
illegal weapons. We will be arraigning them on Friday." Kapyego is
near the troubled Elgeyo Marakwet-West Pokot border which is prone to banditry attacks. "The firearms are in a serviceable
condition and can fire," he said. He lauded
Iten boda boda operators for helping the police in identifying criminals in the
area. Click here for the latest political news
