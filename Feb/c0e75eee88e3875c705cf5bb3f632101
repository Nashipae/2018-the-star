The High Court has upheld the election of Wajir East MP Rashid Kassim. Justice James Wakiaga said the petition filed by Mohamud Abbas lacked merit. He said the petitioner did not prove that assisted voters were misled and technology failed. “Mohamud’s claims that IEBC officials using the KIEMS kits on that particular day were not familiar with their operations, and that results were announced without forms from six polling stations could not stand because [he did not rely on any evidence],” Wakiaga said. Kassim won on the Wiper ticket. Wakiaga said Abbas failed to prove how the unsigned Forms 35As affected the final outcome of the election. He said the petitioner only made general allegations on violence and intimidation but no suffering was proved in court. Wakiaga said the election was conducted in accordance with the law. The court also found no basis for the claims that voting went on after the official hours and residents were allowed to vote without IDs or passports. Kassim thanked his supporters and said justice had been served.
