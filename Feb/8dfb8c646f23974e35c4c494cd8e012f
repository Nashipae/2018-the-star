Chase Sailors were the biggest casualty of a Kenya Hockey Union decision to create a Super League in between the current Premier and National leagues. Chase, who joined the Premier League in 2016 were set for another stab in the top tier after evading the drop in a relegation dogfight alongside Kenyatta Universities and Technical University of Kenya last season. Instead they will feature in a newly-created 11-team Super League alongside Wazalendo Masters, Mvita X1, Impala, Mombasa Sports Club, Multimedia University, Youngsters, Dedan Kimathi University and Kabarak University, TUK and KU. The decision also reduced the top flight by three teams to 12 and will feature champions Kenya Police, Butali Sugar Warriors, GreenSharks, Wazalendo, United States International University Africa and Parkroad Badgers, Nairobi Sikh, Strathmore University, Western Jaguars, Parklands and Nakuru. The National League will also feature 11 teams including Karate Axiom, University of Nairobi, Wazalendo Youth, BAY Club, Jomo Kenyatta University Agricultural Technology, Daystar University, Gorilla, Mombasa West, Thika Rovers and Parkroad Tigers. KHU secretary general, Wycliffe Ongori said: “We had a successful meeting with the team managers over the weekend and the development is meant to make our leagues more competitive. The leagues will kick off in the first week of April and so far registration of teams is going on and the transfer period is officially open.” Ongori revealed that the Premier League will feature 10 teams next season if the current move proves a success. In addition, Ongori said, two team will join the women’s Premier League to make a 13-team championship. He said: “There is no glaring changes in the women’s league but of importance is that two teams — Nakuru and Wolverins — have joined the league and I wish to welcome them on board. Our objective is to make the women’s league as competitive as possible.”
