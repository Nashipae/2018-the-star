Cyril Ramaphosa has taken over as the new South African President after Jacob Zuma resigned amid pressure from his ANC party. Ramaphosa was elected unopposed at the Parliament and was sworn in by the Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. The road back to prosperity and self-respect under Ramaphosa, who became ANC head in December, will be long and hard in a nation still polarised by race and inequality more than two decades after the end of white-minority rule. Still, Zuma's departure late on Wednesday provided evidence of the strength of South Africa's democratic institutions, from the courts to the media and the constitution. Ramaphosa faces a major challenge in turning the country round. But his pledges to boost growth and fight corruption have gone down well with foreign investors and ANC members who thought Zuma's handling of the economy could cost the party dearly in a parliamentary election next year.
