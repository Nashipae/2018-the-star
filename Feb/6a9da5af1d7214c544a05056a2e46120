Property worth millions of shillings has been gutted down by fire in Kabarnet town, Baringo County. The fire broke out in one of the buildings near Sorowo and Garissa hotel a few minutes past 7 pm. Several shops including bars, hardware and a garage were all burnt down to ashes. The cause of the fire was not immediately ascertained although traders claimed that it might have been caused by an electric fault. Residents blamed the county government for laxity as no fire engine arrived to fight the fire. “Where is the fire brigade team to put off the fire and at least rescue some of our belongings,” a trader was heard crying. The county has three fire engines, two in Kabarnet town (County headquarters) and one in Eldama-Ravine.  Click here for the latest political news
