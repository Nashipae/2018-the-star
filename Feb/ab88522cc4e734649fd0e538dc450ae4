Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has criticised the government and the police for continued disobedience and subjective application of the law. He said the government's refusal to restore three TV channels it closed last week, the police's failure to produce lawyer Miguna Miguna and stopping the Communications Authority of Kenya's move to block MD Francis Wangusi from resuming work are indications the country is headed for the wrong direction. "While the citizens accept to be governed, the leadership must listen to the voices of the public," Kidero said. "Kenyan security services, the police and the executive must respect the law without discrimination. A government agency that disobeys court orders compromises our nationâ€™s dignity and integrity." The former city boss urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to ensure his administration adheres to the rule of law. He warned that that country risks becoming a banana republic if the arms of government do not respect each other. "It is incumbent upon the President and Executive to preserve the integrity and dignity of our nation," Kidero said. His criticism comes in the wake of the government's crackdown on NASA politicians for taking part in swearing-in of Raila Odinga as the People's President last Tuesday. Three NASA leaders - TK Kajwang (MP Ruaraka), George Aladwa (MP Makadara) and Miguna have been arrested. Kajwang' and Aladwa have been released, but Miguna is still being held, despite the court ordering police to produce him. The Court also last week ordered CAK to restore the channels, but this has yet to be done.
