Dr Temi Mutia, Value Chain Specialist in the Office of the Governor told the Star that Ngilu will use the opportunity to appeal to India to lift the ban of Ndengu from Kenya. “The governor is travelling later today [Sunday] at the invitation of Supporting Indian Trade in Africa (SITA). She will use the chance to appeal to the Indian authorities to lift the current ban on imports of Ndengu from Kenya, the bulk of which as you know, comes from Kitui County,” Mutia said. The governor is also keen to cement the county's relationship with other large-scale green gram buyers that will be present at the conference. The conclave is part of the global federation of pulses and will bring together over 3,000 delegates, a majority of whom are leading buyers and sellers of pulses worldwide. This year, Kitui County is expected to harvest no less than 15,000 metric tonnes of Ndengu in spite of poor rains. During the visit, Ngilu will also visit the Central Leather Training and Research Institute in Chennai, the leading textile and apparel manufacturing park in the world. The governor will be accompanied by Dr Mutia as well as two ministers –– Philip Mumo of Trade and Emanuel Kisangau of Agriculture.
