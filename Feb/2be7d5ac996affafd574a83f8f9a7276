The inter-clan clashes between the Degodia and Ajuran in Wajir North and Eldas has nothing to do with the boundary, Northeastern regional commissioner Mohamud Saleh has said. Speaking in his office yesterday, he said the fighting is politically instigated, “possibly because of the anticipated boundary review”. Saleh accused some politicians from the area of inciting their communities in order to gain more land. He spoke a day after a man was killed at Adawa, Wajir North. The deceased was looking after his camels. A week ago, a nine-month pregnant mother and her son were brutally killed at Malkagufu in Wajir North. Imaginary border dispute Saleh said it is the responsibility of the national government and the IEBC to review borders when the need arises. A tough-talking Saleh said the state is investigating the conflicts that have been going on for the last one year. The politicians found culpable will be named, shamed and prosecuted, he said. “It is unfortunate the two clans have decided to fight over an imaginary border dispute. As far as the government is concerned, there is no border dispute in that area. The area was demarcated in 1996 by the then Electoral Commission of Kenya,” Saleh said. Arming themselves “As the chairman of the regional security committee, I am not going to sit back and watch as innocent Kenyans are butchered in the guise of a border dispute and other issues which do not make sense to me,” he said. “Over the years, there has been no dispute. Certainly, now we are seeing an occurrence of land disputes. I don’t agree with that. I think this is all politically instigated. We are aware of what is going on and the State will take action in the coming days,” he said. “It has come to our realisation the two communities are arming themselves. The State is stepping in to stop further bloodshed,” Saleh said. All peace efforts have failed. The State will rollout an operation, he said
