According to the Times of India, police found Abdalla Said hiding the bars in his waist belt and knee caps. Said 29, was arrested on Tuesday while trying  to check into a five-star hotel near the international airport. It is reported that his accomplice known as Ibrahim Hussein, 26, was to collect the gold which was handed to the airport's customs officials for investigations Said landed at the airport on February 11 and was thought to have been carrying 156 old biscuits. He had been cleared when he was picked up and taken to the hotel. Police said the KQ employee arrived at the hotel at around 7.30 pm and had checked in by 8pm. But one of the hotel's employees got suspicious as another foreign national kept walking close to him on the premises. The hotel worker immediately alerted police. "Said told us he had easily cleared the customs check at the airport because airline crew members are not frisked physically. Only their baggage is checked," an officer said. Preliminary findings showed Said had been staying at a hotel on Mohammed Ali Road in South Mumbai since January 4 and that he had been on a three-month tourist visa. He told police he was a clothes dealer who was in Mumbai on an official tour. Click here for the latest political news
