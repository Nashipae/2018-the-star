The Trans Nzoia government will put in place a performance monitoring and evaluation system to monitor its workers. Trans Nzoia Govenor Patrick Khaemba on Tuesday said the system will be used to track performance in real time. He said the move will ensure the county government delivers its mandate to residents. “All county governments are in the process of institutionalising performance management to ensure they demonstrate results to citizens who are calling for transparency and accountability,” Khaemba said. He spoke after opening the training of county staff on performance management in Kisumu. Khaemba said performance management is supported by guidelines such as the Vision 2030 blueprint, the County Integrated Development Plans, sectoral plans, departmental strategic plans, development plans, performance contracting guidelines and appraisal guidelines. He said although he is ready to support the workers, they must deliver. The governor said there is need for a major improvement in the way public servants work.
