a public university. Kajiado governor Joseph ole Lenku announced this on Monday after meeting the institute’s top managers and members of the new university's task
force. Last

to the institution in view of beginning collaboration." The institution will focus on technical training to fill the skills gap in the county. “A public university will spur economic development in the county.
Our people are thirsty for education which is key to success," the governor noted. “This is a flagship project in my manifesto. I will ensure it gets my full support and that of the national government." Click here for the latest political news
