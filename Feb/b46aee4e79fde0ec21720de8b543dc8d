Water levels at dams supplying South Africaâ€™s Cape Town fell further this week, data showed on Wednesday. This was the latest sign of a deepening crisis that could soon see taps in the tourist hub run dry by May. Dam levels in the Western Cape province fell to 23.7 per cent this week from 24.5 per cent the previous week, and from 36.5 per cent a year ago, according to a weekly update from the department of water affairs. Cape Town is counting down to dry taps due to severe drought. Officials predict taps in the South African city will run out of water on May 11, in a crisis that has brought to the fore the effects of climate change across the world. "Cape Town is not going to be the only city on this continent that's going to suffer significant water shortage," Jean-Pierre Labuschagne, an infrastructure expert with Deloitte, said at the launch of its Africa Construction Trends report. Cape Town authorities have imposed water restrictions that could hurt agricultural and industrial output, and have begun to affect tourism.
