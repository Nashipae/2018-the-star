The government has denied claims that its arresting al Shabaab returnees and undermining human rights. This is after youth from the Coast started disappearing, with lobby groups hinting at extrajudicial killings. Mombasa county commissioner Evans Achoki on Friday said returnees will be integrated. “We will not harass them. The government is ready to welcome and listen to those  willing to surrender. We will ensure they are rehabilitated,” he said. He was speaking during ‘The Mombasa Action Plan’ workshop organised by Haki Africa in partnership with other civil society groups. MAP focuses on preventing and countering violent extremism. Haki Africa director Yusuf Aboubakar said use of brutal force by the state pushes youth to extremism. “Iraq, Syria, Britain, Northern Ireland and Spain faced terrorism because of such violation. Respect human rights and succeed in the war on terror,” he said. Police been conducting massive swoops to arrest terror suspects, netting innocent people too. The authorities have however denied the claim. Achoki said the police operation will go on but in a more professional manner and targetting arrest with a view to prosecute. Mombasa Deputy Governor William Kingi said spying on the Muslim community by security agencies is worrying, while leaders accused the government of collectively blaming the Muslim community for violence. The region has experienced attacks on churches and passenger buses. The opposition has criticised the decision to send Kenyan troops to Somalia and believe the move has fueled terror attacks.
