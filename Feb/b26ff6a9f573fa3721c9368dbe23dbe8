Wanyore have a date with Mwamba next weekend while Strathmore have a tough clash against Homeboyz in their final group phase match. Try scorers for Nakuru were Walter Okoth and Charles Odhiambo with Martin Muita adding a conversion and two penalties for the hosts.
Filden Sinei kicked over two penalties for the visitors with Mark Ongayo scoring a consolation try for the losers. Nakuru led 7-6 at the interval. Nakuru coach Mitch Ocholla was delighted with the result and has now set his sights on getting a win against Mwamba next weekend at the Railway ground. “If results go our way, we will be in the playoffs but we must win our game against Mwamba which won’t be easy as they are also angling for a strong finish,” he added.
Ocholla was satisfied by the resilience shown by his charges in the win over Nondies. “The match was close in the first half. We had some opportunities which we didn’t take but our play improved in the second half and our execution in attack and defence was superb,” he added.
