Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa (pictured) has warned the Luhya community to stop banking on “cowards” NASA principals Moses Wetang’ula and Musalia Mudavadi. Speaking at Naomo Secondary School, Bumula constituency, where he donated Sh500,000 for land, Wamalwa said the community should reconsider their political stand. He said the duo have shown they have no political standing of their own and only follow NASA leader Raila Odinga for survival. “They skipped Raila’s swearing-in on January 30, showing they are cowards. All they come to tell you here everyday about courage is all but propaganda,”Wamalwa said. The CS said if the Luhya community continues banking on the two, their dream to lead the country will never be realised. “Cowards die many times before they meet their death. If you continue banking on these two cowards your political future will die so many times,” Wamalwa said. The CS urged the community to reconsider working with Jubilee-affiliated leaders, saying they mean well. The Luhya community overwhelmingly voted for NASA in the last election.Wamalwa rubbished calls by Opposition leader Raila to have fresh polls in August. He questioned why Raila could call for fresh elections yet he swore himself in on January 30 as the People’s President.
