Kenyan Premier League debutants Vihiga United have bemoaned the level of officiating in the top flight with coach Edward Manoah terming it dubious. Following their 1-0 defeat to Kakamega Homeboyz at Bukhungu Stadium over the weekend, Manoah has blamed the officials of foregoing their code of ethics and wants them to hit a turn-around and exercise professionalism that befits the status of the league. “Our league is very competitive and therefore calls for match officials who are equal to the task as we expect fairness at all times,” said Manoah. “I want to commend and congratulate few officials who have exhibited high standards of officiating that should be emulated and lauded. However, I have issues with a few, who are easily intimidated by home teams, forcing them to make decisions against visiting teams.” Manoah added that they invest heavily in ensuring that the team is in good shape but all these efforts become futile due to wrong decision-making by match officials. He said centre referee Andrew Juma, made numerous decisions against Vihiga in the clash against Homeboyz. “I have enough experience in Kenyan football, both as a player and a coach but what I have witnessed is not good for our the sport locally. We are contemplating forwarding our protest to the authorities since we have a lot of evidence in regard to this,” warned Manoah. Meanwhile, Manoah has refuted claims that the team was contemplating switching back to Mumias as their home ground from newly refurbished Bukhungu Stadium. “Bukhungu will remain our home ground as we command a lot of following there. The fans are turning out in large numbers to cheer us something that is good for the team,” observed Manoah. Vihiga have started their 2018 poorly, registering two draws and two loses from their four matches which places them in 17th position on the table.
