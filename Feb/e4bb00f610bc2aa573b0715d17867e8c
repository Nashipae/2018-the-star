Flower sellers will be smiling all through today as couples buy the commodity in celebration of Valentine’s Day. According to Kenya Flower Council CEO Clement Tulezi, the month is a peak period for the industry with high demand for red roses.  “The red rose is one of our greatest gold this month. People associate it with love and being the month of love, our annual industry bottom line is reaping from this glory,” he said in a statement. The flower export values grew from Sh35.5 billion in 2010 to Sh70.8 billion in 2016 as international demand in new markets continues to emerge. “Kenya remains the third largest exporter of cut flowers in the world and accounts for about 35 per cent of all sales in the European Union markets including Holland, Germany, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and France. We have also created inroads in Russia and the US, as well as China, the Middle East, Japan and all other emerging markets. Currently, Kenya flowers are sold in more than 60 countries,” Tulezi said. Peter Kimani, a flower vendor in Nairobi said he expects to make a killing today. “On an ordinary day, we sell a single flower at Sh20, and one bunch goes for Sh300. During the Valentine’s season, a stick goes for Sh50 and a bunch goes for Sh500,” he said. Motivational speaker and life coach Kinyanjui Ng’ang’a and the Sense 101 Life Club have organised a dinner for couples at The Node, Westlands. He will tackle the issue of how to survive marriage, rekindle love within marriage and deal with divorce. The dinner and dance will cost Sh6,000 per couple. Couples who prefer a quiet outing have their needs catered for, with five-star hotels giving sumptous offers. Villa Rosa Kempinski is offering “My Suite Valentine offer” from February 1 to 28. For Sh95,290, guests will enjoy luxurious suite accommodation, return transfers from home in state-of-the-art vehicles for those visiting from within Nairobi, early check-in and late check-out and freshly cut flowers delivered to the guests.
