Lawyer Tom Ojienda has moved to court under a bill of costs to demand more than Sh75 million legal fees for representing Bomet county in a land case against Moi University. His firm represented former Governor Isaac Rutto and the county government in a case that sought to block construction of Moi University’s Bomet Town campus. This was both in the High Court and the Court of Appeal. In an application dated February 22, Ojienda (pictured) claims Sh25,378,850 for a high court suit and Sh50,406,125 for appeal case. The 43-acre parcel claimed by Moi University and the Bomet government was on a dumpsite and  a stadium was being built on it. The county lost the petition at the High Court on June 8, 2016 and appealed on grounds that granting the disputed land to the university would lead to demolition of the stadium, hence hurting thousands of residents. Justice Martin Muya said the claim by the county was an afterthought and the university had already put up learning premises. Again, the appeal was thrown out on May 21 last year on grounds the notice of appeal was filed out of time. Ojienda, through his associate Steve Biko, represented Bomet and took instructions from Governor Laboso after Rutto lost at the August 8 election. Biko told appellant Justices Fatuma Sichale, Giberet Kariuki and Michael ole Kantai that Laboso does not want to pursue the case. “The political developments in Bomet county has resulted into the replacement of the applicant. The current governor has no interest and has instructions to withdraw the case,” Biko said.
