The new system of education is
good but challenging to those who have not understood it fully, according to a
head teacher. Eronge primary school head teacher Kepha Bwana the government
through the ministry of education will have to take time to elaborate the whole
curriculum to be understood in depth with the stakeholders. “It is a challenge to the ministry of education to make sure the
new curriculum is clearly defined to avoid the confusion to many stakeholders
in the sector. This will only be done through setting the pilot exercise to all
the schools in the country,” he said. Read: New 2-6-3-3-3 curriculum: How different is it from the 8-4-4 system? He spoke at the school on Sunday during
a consultative meeting with the parents. According to Bwana, whose school is among the pilot centers the
system requires measures put in place to make it clear to some who have not
fully understood how the new system will work. The planned rollout of the new curriculum had earlier been
blamed for the confusion witnessed since the opening if schools in first term
when most parents shunned bookshops in a wait and see attitude with the hope of
getting clarity on what books they should purchase. The argument has been that the curriculum neglected the sectors
which accelerate economic growth such as agriculture, construction, and
fishing. An influx of white-collar job trainees over time created a
skills imbalance in the job market, resulting in one of Kenya’s biggest obstacles
to development – youth unemployment, which currently stands at 40 per cent. Bwana urged the teachers all over the country to interact with
the curriculum design to help them be more effective. “I call upon everyone to support the process and not be anxious
as by the end of the year, an evaluation report will have been developed to
give more guidelines in the new system,” he said. Read: It’s all systems go for new curriculum  Click here for the latest political news
