Nairobi governor Mike Sonko has denied a media report that the county intends to use Sh50 million to beautify the city. Sonko in a statement on Friday said the county has not put in place such a budget for such a project.

The Star had run a story indicating that the county would spend a whooping Sh 50million on the program.
