Kenya has the third highest newborn mortality rate in East Africa, according to a report by Unicef. The country's ranking stood at 22.6 deaths per 1,000 births after South Sudan (37.9) and Burundi (24.2). In the report released on February 20, Rwanda had the lowest ranking - 16.5 deaths per this number of births. It was followed by Uganda at 21.4 and then came Tanzania at 21.7.  Deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo numbered 28.8 while Sudan had 29.4, Ethiopia 27.6, Somalia 38 and Central Africa Republic 42.3. According to the report, more than 80 per cent of newborn deaths are due to prematurity, complications during birth or infections such as pneumonia and sepsis. "Every year, 2.6 million newborns around the world do not survive their first month of life. One million of them die the day they are born," Unicef Executive Director Henrietta Fore said. Kenya's rate is reflective of one in 44 deaths reported daily. In low-income countries around the world, the average newborn mortality rate is 27 deaths per 1,000 births.  'A TRAGEDY SHROUDED IN SILENCE' Just as the number of newborns who die during the first month is far too high, so is the number of babies who are stillborn – born without signs of life. Every year, an estimated 2.6 million babies are stillborn, the vast majority in low- and middle-income countries. Half of the babies who are stillborn are alive at the start of labour. These deaths typically are not counted by public health systems or policymakers. In most cases, stillborn babies do not receive an official birth or death certificate. Although they leave no official record, each loss leaves an indelible imprint on the hearts of parents and families. In 2015, Doctors at Kenyatta National Hospital said premature births among women carrying twins are on the increase. Doctor Bonayo Adovo, an expert in delivery of twins, said the risk of stillbirths at the facility has become a major concern.

For every 1,000 babies born in Pakistan in 2016, 46 died before the end of their first month – a staggering one in 22. Of the 10 countries with the highest newborn mortality rates, eight are in sub-Saharan Africa and two are in South Asia. These include Central African Republic 42.3, Afghanistan 40.Somalia 38.8, Lesotho 38.5, Guinea-Bissau 38.2 , South Sudan, CÃ´te d’lvoire 36.6, Mali 35.7 and Chad at 35.1.

But the progress in reducing the deaths of newborn babies – those aged less than one month – has been less impressive with 7,000 newborns still dying every day. The United Nations Children's Fund notes that this rate is partly because newborn deaths are difficult to address with a single drug or intervention – they require a system-wide approach.  "It is also due to a lack of momentum and global commitment to newborn survival," the report states. The deaths can be prevented with access to well-trained midwives along with proven solutions like clean water, disinfectants, breastfeeding within the first hour, skin-to-skin contact and good nutrition. Fore said: "We know we can save the vast majority of these babies with affordable, quality health care solutions for every mother and newborn. Just a few small steps from all of us can help ensure the first small steps of each of these young lives. "If every country brought its newborn mortality rate down to the high-income average by 2030, 16 million lives could be saved." But a shortage of well-trained health workers means thousands don’t receive the life-saving support they need to survive. In Kenya for example, about 4,000 doctors serve 45 million people, that is roughly 1:17000, that ratio is 1 per 10,000 in Somalia.   Unicef recommended solutions including: 1. Improving access to maternal and newborn health services by, for example, having an adequate number of competent health-care workers, backed by facilities with the capacity to deal with the main causes of newborn mortality 2. Supporting early initiation of breastfeeding 3. Guaranteeing clean, functional health facilities equipped with water, soap and electricity within the reach of every mother and baby 4. Recruiting, training, retaining and managing sufficient numbers of doctors, nurses and midwives with the competencies and skills needed to save newborn lives 5. Making the top 10 life-saving drugs and articles of equipment available for every mother and baby 6.
