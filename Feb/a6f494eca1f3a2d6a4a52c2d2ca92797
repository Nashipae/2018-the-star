Learning has been disrupted in a primary school in Janju, Lagdera subcounty,
after a fresh border dispute. The dispute is between Isiolo and Garissa residents. The Janju Primary School yesterday was closed after 30 armed attackers burnt 19 houses on
Sunday at 5pm, leaving more than 200 families homeless. It is not clear if anyone was hurt. Most residents were out grazing. The attackers
burnt food, personal effects, school uniforms, cash, solar panels and other house hold items. Residents have urged the government and
well-wishers to step in and provide them with temporary shelter and food. Some women and children have taken refuge at the nearby Barkoge village and Modogashe town. Elder Omar Siyat urged the national
government to hasten the process of recruiting more Kenya Police Reservists in Garissa. Lagdera deputy county commissioner Jackson ole
Chutta said the government is still verifying personal characters of 60 KPRs, whose names were forwarded to the Office of Inspector General. He said they are pursuing the Sunday attackers. There
have been conflicts over grazing fields and watering points in the recent past, but it has never degenerated into arson, although lives were lost and animals stolen. Area MP Mohammed Hire ruled out
friction over pasture and water. He said there could be a hidden
motive from the Isiolo side and urged the security team to speed up
recruitment of the KPRs so they can supplement what police are doing.
