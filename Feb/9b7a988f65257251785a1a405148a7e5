Religious leaders have called on Samburu county communities to abandon harmful cultural practices such as cattle rustling and instead embrace education. Catholic diocese of Maralala Bishop Virgilio Pante termed the culture as primitive and out dated since they have led to loss of lives and property. He said men have turned into polygamists since they always marry more wives after stealing cows.
