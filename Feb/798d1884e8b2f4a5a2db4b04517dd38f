If you dont have a friend like Shaffie Weru, then you need to think about your life. The radio presenter just gifted Adelle Onyango two pairs of designer shoes, Dolce and Gabbana and Balenciaga Race Runners, worth Sh140,000. Dolce & Gabbana and Balenciaga have the best shoes in the market, and their prices are not so cheap. Adelle's reaction was priceless. She couldn't believe the kind gesture she was offered by her co-presenter. She just turned 29 yesterday, and she was more than happy to share what her plans are. "It’s my BIRTHDAY today and 29 looks hella good on me! I’m celebrating how SELF AWARE I’ve become over the years - that has been my saving grace. This next year will be spent continuing to gracefully be human in its totality, in its grime and its shine!" With friends such as Shaffie Weru, life is bound to be quite interesting.
