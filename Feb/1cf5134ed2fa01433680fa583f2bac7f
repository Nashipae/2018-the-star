Two people were burnt to death after fire razed their houses in the Kisumu Ndogo slum in Athi River, Machakos county on Saturday night. Vincent Baraza and Gerald Oluoch were asleep when the fire broke out at about 1.30am. The two worked at the Kifaru Unga Limited in Athi River factory. Residents said they were drunk when the fire broke out. “It's their routine whenever they get their salaries," Josephine Wambua said. Most workers of the company live in rented shanties in the slum because it is close to the firm. Mavoko chief Nzau Komo said the two did not have families. Residents efforts for help from the county fire emergency services did not bear fruit. “We wonder why the Mavoko subcounty fire engine cannot be fixed to help during emergencies. We were told that there is no functional engine when we called the fire brigade to help," Wambua said.
