Bishop Maurice Crowley of the Eldoret Catholic Diocese has criticised the recent "inhumane" transfer of secondary school principals. He said the massive transfers which were effected in December last year was hurried and tutors not given adequate time to prepare to leave for their new stations. "I would ask the TSC to remember that these people are human beings and they must be treated in a humane way," he said on Friday. "And if not, they will not deliver and then education in the country will go down," Crowley said adding that some principals were given only two days to vacate their stations. He spoke at Sing’ore Girls High School during a thanksgiving ceremony following the school's top performance in the 2017 KCSE exam. Crowley said the transfers were done during the Christmas season when head teachers were spending time with their families and friends. "Giving teachers transfer letters during Christmas, which is a very important feast and further giving them two or three days to leave their station is inhumane." "I wouldn’t like to see such a thing again," he said. Crowley further accused TSC of transferring head teachers in Catholic-sponsored schools from Eldoret and Kitale dioceses without consulting the church. "They took away the best teachers of our schools and took them somewhere else. I am not against the government policy of transferring teachers but it should be done in a better way," he said. He said hurried decisions in the sector will scale down Kenya’s education standards, which are hitherto among the best in Africa. The cleric urged the TSC to carry out the impending transfer of at least 10,000 primary school heads in a more humane way.
