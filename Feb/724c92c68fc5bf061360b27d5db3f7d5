Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has warned  people applying for county jobs against bribing officials. He said the jobs must be awarded on merit. Ojaamong also warned “cartels involved in the illegal business” against conning unsuspecting jobseekers. He said their days are numbered. “I’ve received reports some parents have sold land so they can get money to bribe and secure jobs for their children,” he said on Saturday. “The same cartels allege the money is meant for me. Why should I demand bribes? Jobs  are advertised and successful applicants picked on merit. I’ll not sit back and watch innocent  residents being conned.” Ojaamong spoke during the burial of former KDF officer Julius Olekete, 76, in Aboloi village, Teso North. Olekete enlisted in the Kenya Army in October 1964. He retired in 1988 as Warrant Officer II. Ojaamong eulogised the mzee as humble and selfless. He will be remembered for his service to the country and community, he said. Former deputy secretary in the Office of the President Ben Akwara said the late mzee was his contact in the Department of Defence when he was the chairman of Harambee Sacco.
