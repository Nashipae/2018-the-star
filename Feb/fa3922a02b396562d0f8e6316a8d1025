A Kandara court on Wednesday dismissed a case in which a former Maragua MP aspirant is accused of sexually assaulting a man, after the complainant failed to appear. Samuel Ndung’u, 29, who was vying as an independent candidate, was accused of sexually assaulting Joseph Kinyanjui on July 14 last year in Kenol town. He said the charges were politically instigated and pleaded not guilty. The matter was scheduled for hearing on October 17, December 13, January 12 and January 19. Senior resident magistrate Margaret Kurumbu said the accused had attended all the sessions but the complainant did not. Kurumbu also said the prosecution was unable to produce any witness and the accused had not been provided with the complainant’s statements. The prosecution sought temporarily withdrawal of the case on January 19, pending arrest of the complainant. Kurumbu acquitted Ndung’u and prohibited the prosecution from preferring new charges. Ndung’u had protested the application by the prosecution to have the case withdrawn, saying he wanted the prosecution to produce evidence that he committed the offence. He said the case was fabricated and aimed at locking him out of the MP race. The magistrate said the complainant might show up and explain why he failed to attend court. Kurumbu said it is the role of the court to ensure prosecutorial powers are used within the law.
