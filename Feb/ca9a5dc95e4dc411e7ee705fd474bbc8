Marakwet
chiefs have been asked to intensify public participation to reduce residents' opposition to the Sh30 billion Arror Dam in Kipsaiya, Marakwet West. Some residents are opposed to the multipurpose dam, which will be built by the Kerio Valley Development Authority. The chiefs
will start the sensitisation drive today. Senator Kipchumba Murkomen asked the chiefs to talk to residents against the project and landowners seeking compensation. He promised to ensure those affected are paid before eviction. “This project will create 2,000 new jobs for youths. It will supply water to Kerio
Valley and end perennial fights for resources,” he said. The Senate Majority leader urged locals in Kipsaiya and Maina, where the
dam will be established, to form committees in which to raise concerns on the
proposed dam. On Tuesday last
week KVDA managing
director David Kimosop said the authority has secured 7,000 acres to
resettle residents who will be evicted. The dam will provide water to 10,000 households
and irrigate 8,000 hectares of land in drought-prone areas.
