One of the suspects in the Qarsa Primary School attack last Friday when three people were slain was arrested on Sunday. Northeastern regional commissioner Mohamud Saleh said the operation to track down the suspects is narrowing but two others are still on the run. Speaking yesterday when he opened a five-day training workshop for Wajir chiefs and assistants, Saleh said security officials are determined to ensure all the culprits are arrested. Last week, he named Maalim Abdullahi, Daud Mohamed and Abdirashid Osman as well-known Kenyans suspected be working with the Somali based terror group. He did not reveal the details of the arrest. He warned chiefs and their assistants sleeping on the job that they will be sacked. Teachers have been leaving the area for fear of their lives.
