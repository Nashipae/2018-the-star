The High court on Monday extended orders suspending the January night travel ban as imposed by the National Transport and Safety Authority. The court issued the orders in January after activist Okiya Omtatah filed a case challenging NTSA's decision to ban night travel after an accident killed 34 people on New Year's eve.

Justice Chacha Mwita directed the NTSA to file its responses and appear in court for hearing on April 24. The court further consolidated two other matters, which were also challenging the NTSA's decision regarding the Omtatah case. In the petition, Omtatah argued that the ban was contrary to Article 232(1)(f) of the Constitution, which requires the provision of timely, accurate information to the public. He said the ban was vague and violates Articles 28 and 29(1) on human dignity and freedom and security of individuals. Omtatah also said the ban is discriminatory, as it only affects long-distance travellers. It breaches Articles 27 of the Constitution, he said. NTSA director general Francis Mejja banned night travel for all matatus after an accident in Salgaa claimed 36 lives. In a joint statement with the Traffic department on New Year’s Eve, he said the rise in road accidents led to the decision. There was a public uproar after the ban was implemented.
