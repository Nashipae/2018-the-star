The Kitale KMTC will be improved to offer more courses to attract more students. Currently, the campus only offers three courses out of 20 offered at the Nairobi main campus. This expansion follows an agreement between the Trans Nzoia government and the college management to have the institution’s size increased from 1. 7 acres to 10. Deputy Governor Stanley Tarus said the upgrade was driven by a high demand for medical training in the region. He said the three courses offered do not meet the demand. “There will be an increase in the number of courses that will be offered. We have also agreed that 30 per cent of the admission slots will be reserved for students from this county,” Tarus said. The campus, which is opposite the Kitale County Referral Hospital, will be extended next to the Trans Nzoia Teaching and Referral Hospital.
