There has been rumours going round that Kameme FM presenter Moses Kanyira was fired last week for allegedly going ham on Muranga’s water tunnel and the resultant shortage of the precious commodity. His fans went wild when the news broke and they couldn't hide it on social media. Moses Kanyira has not been on air for a week and that raised eye brows among his die hard fans. Kanyira, went ahead and posted on his facebook page that he is in a trying time of his life; "Am passing the most trying period in my life. If it is not my God, this can amount to commit suicide," he posted on his Facebook. Well, Kameme FM management have come out to clear the air regarding the firing claims. The statement that was posted on social media read in part: "Let me make this clear. No one has been fired from Kameme FM. Least of all, no one will ever be fired for speaking about real issues affecting our people. It's what Kameme actually stands for. To us it's the people who matter. How can anyone be fired for speaking about our listeners problems? Forget anything else you read on social media. That's the real position. Guys, only this week, social media had killed Syvelster Stallone!!! Don't believe everything you read. Thanks. Much love."
