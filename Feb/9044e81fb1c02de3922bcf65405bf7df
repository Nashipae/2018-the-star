The Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development yesterday allayed fears that textbooks being used in schools do not meet standards. Chief executive officer Julius Jwan said in a statement they are investigating claims that some textbooks are below standard. This follows reports on social media that there are some mistakes in one of the secondary school textbooks. “We don’t take anything for granted, especially when it comes to the curriculum and support materials,” Jwan said. He said evaluators from the institute, who work alongside subject specialists from schools and various agencies, rely on standard guidelines that any book must meet. This include quality of the cover pages, relevance of content to the curriculum, appropriateness of language used, layout and use of illustrations that enhance teaching and learning. “There is a checklist that eventually guarantees quality,” he said. Jwan said the KICD will verify if indeed the Kiswahili textbook in circulation is the final copy that was endorsed for printing. He, however, appealed to Kenyans not to generalise an error noted in one book to all the learning materials, saying such a move causes unnecessary panic. Jwan said KICD has always stands for the highest quality standards in instructional materials. “We make efforts to ensure these standards are met in all the books, approved for schools,” Jwan said. Publishers with manuscripts, which have been given a “conditional pass” are expected to resubmit them to KICD.
