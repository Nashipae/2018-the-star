Governor Mike Sonko has asked the highways authority to fast-track Nairobi's ongoing road projects. Sonko urged Kenya National Highways Authority to speedily complete pedestrian crossings, footbridges and walkways on all highways in the county. "We are calling upon KeNHA to ensure roadworks in Nairobi meet international standards. We need to see CCTV cameras on the roads to ensure vandals are brought to book," he added.
