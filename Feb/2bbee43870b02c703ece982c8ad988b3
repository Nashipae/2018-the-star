Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti wants Governor Martin Wambora’s election nullified after a recount revealed 5,049 votes were unverifiable. Kivuti’s lawyer Tom Ojienda said the report of the deputy court registrar after a recount in 356 polling stations the court ordered, showed excess ballots were stuffed in boxes in 18 polling stations. In his final submission, Ojienda told Justice William Musyoka the stuffed ballots are 2,157 and they did not match counterfoils of the ballot booklets used in each station. He, however, did not explain whether the excess ballots were in favour of Kivuti or Wambora, Ojienda claimed the 2,157 votes must have been brought from somewhere else and stuffed in the ballot boxes. He said the counterfoils for 2,892 ballots in 11 polling stations were missing. Ojienda said, the final margin by which Wambora had beaten Kivuti was narrowed to 520 following arithmetic errors. “There was no governor election in Embu. There was a total mess. My lord we are applying for nullification of Governor Wambora’s win and order for fresh one or declare Kivuti the winner,” Ojienda said. The ruling is set for February 22.
