Police officers on Saturday fired tear gas to disperse boda boda riders who had blocked the Nanyuki-Meru road to protest against a traffic accident involving one of them. Kevin Ngunjiri collided with a van near the Nanyuki police station. He was heading to Nanyuki town. The van severed his right leg from the body. He was rushed to the Nanyuki Teaching and Referral Hospital, where he is admitted. His colleagues barricaded the road. “Many accidents have happened on this spot. If the government is not willing to erect bumps to check speeding vehicles, we shall do it to prevent more injuries and deaths,” one rider shouted to the officers. Laikipia East police commander James Kithuka and station boss Joash Nyachiro ordered the riders to disperse, but they remained defiant and started pelting the officers with stones. The two called for reinforcements. Additionall officers were deployed and they swiftly fired tear gas, dispersed the crowd and removed the illegal roadblocks. Kithuka said the scene has become a blackspot, but added only the Kenya National Highways Authority can build bumps.
