Wajir leaders have raised concern over
the consistent inter-clan conflicts in the county. This comes after three people including an expectant mother were seriously injured in recent violent clashes
between Degodia and Ajuran clans in a dispute over boundary demarcation in Eldas and Buna subcounties. Led by Senator Abdullahi Ibrahim, they on Sunday called on Interior CS Fred Matiang’i and IG Joseph Boinett to tour the area and assess the security situation to ensure peace is restored. Tarbaj MP Ahmed Bashane said residents should be protected just like other Kenyans. Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi urged the two warring communities to end hostility and embrace peace. “I condemn the recurring clashes. The root cause has
not been addressed. Let the government and relevant authorities take it upon
themselves to address and arrest the situation. We need to live in harmony”,
said the senator while addressing the media in Wajir Sunday on the sidelines of
a peace meeting between the two warring communities. On his part, Tarbaj MP Ahmed Bashane noted that just
like the rest of Kenya,
Wajir residents need government protection when such violence is experienced. The leaders urged Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred
Matiang’i and Inspector General of police Joseph Boinett to personally tour the
affected area of Northern Wajir to assess the
security situation and ensure that peace is restored in the area. Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi had two weeks ago urged
the two warring communities of Wajir North and Eldas sub-counties respectively
to cease hostilities. “We need peace in Wajir and we will not tolerate
people who create conflict”, said Abdi during the peace meeting. The Governor asked the national government and
religious leaders to cooperate and ensure that peace prevails and pointed out
that his administration with work hand in hand with the national government to
ensure sanity is restored in the region.
