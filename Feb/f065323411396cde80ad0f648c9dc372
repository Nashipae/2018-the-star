Former giants Shabana FC are seeking to return to the National Super League this season. Coach Andrew Kanuli said they want the team to return to top flight league by 2020. The club, which plays in the National Division One Zone ‘B’ have signed 11 players from National Super League and Kenya Premier League sides ahead of the kick off on February 24. “We went for experienced players who will push us to NSL and KPL. Last season, we had an inexperienced team and that is why we struggled,” said Kanuli after yesterday’s training session at Cardinal Otunga High School, Mosocho.Some of the players the club has enlisted include veteran Andrew Ongwae from Kericho Zoo, Justine Monda (Sony), Wycliffe Nyangechi (Western Stima), Dennis Ongeri (Nzoia) and Moses Otieno (Zoo). Others are Oscar Oketch, Brighton Luvai (Talanta), Felix Tindi, Hamisi Handi (defunct Agro Chemicals), Fred Oyugi (Nairobi City Stars), Stephen Ogati (defunct Palos), and Nixon Sinyo (Nakuru All Stars). The club will play their home matches at Cardinal Otunga, Mosocho Academy and Kenyenya Stadium, according to Kanuli. “We have been training at Cardinal Otunga because Gusii Stadium is unavailable due to ongoing renovations. We are appealing to the County Government of Kisii to hasten the renovations,” he added. Last season, the former glamorous side played their home matches in Migori, Machakos, Kericho, Nairobi and Nakuru counties due to the dilapidated state of the Gusii Stadium. Shabana intensify their preparations tomorrow with friendly matches against Nyabururu Sportive and Keroka Combined. Last weekend, Shabana beat Isibania FC 2-1 and succumbed to a 2-0 loss against Western Stima on Wednesday at Moi Stadium, Kisumu. Fredrick Nyarombo and Calvins Wekesa scored for Western Stima, who will play in the NSL after being relegated from the top flight league. Stima coach Richard Makumbi opted to field two teams in each half.
