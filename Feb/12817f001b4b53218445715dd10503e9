Media personality Njambi Koikai has criticised the Nairobi government for not acting fast to save her hood from a raging fire that
got out of control. Several people were left homeless last night after a fire broke out in Riruta. Locals
and police say the fire started from one of the structures
before spreading fast to others, and that there was no one killed or injured. Njambi says the fire was put out "na maji ya kisima" because firefighters were nowhere to be seen. "What is the construction authority doing about hizi nyumba za
mabati zimejengwa mpaka na upstairs? Who adheres to the building code? Many thanks to the gentlemen who helped put out the fire. Now the MP will be here tomorrow to donate a few things and make some 'promises', then leave to go doodle," read part of her post.
