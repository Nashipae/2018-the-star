Don’t reject the Governor Cornel Rasanga’s Cabinet nominees because they are more qualified than you, Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has told Siaya MCAs. He faulted MCAs for “constantly rejecting the Cabinet for selfish reasons”. Speaking during the swearing-in of five Cabinet members on Friday, Odhiambo warned MCAs against “creating nonsensical friction”. He said the delay in approving Rasanga’s Cabinet is “shenanigans play” that will not be tolerated. According to the law, a governor is supposed to constitute his Cabinet within 21 days of being in office, but it has taken Rasanga five months to constitute half of his Cabinet. This is after the assembly rejected nine of the names he proposed, citing failure to meet Section 35B of the County Governments Act. Five more members are needed to constitute the Cabinet. Odhiambo has warned MCAs not to oppose nominees because “it will not be business as usual this time round”. He said all elected leaders are part of the county and its upon them to ensure development. Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda called for harmony between the assembly and the executive.
