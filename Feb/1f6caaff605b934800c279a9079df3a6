Kitui Environment CEC John Makau has been arrested in connection with the torching of a lorry ferrying charcoal at Kanyonyoo last Thursday. He was arrested by DCI detectives on Monday alongside Governor Charity Ngilu's advisor David Mbisi. The two were detained at the Kitui police station. The DCI officers reportedly duped the official by asking him to appear in their office for questioning before he was arrested. Police sources said the two will be arraigned in Embu to answer charges related to the burning of a lorry which was transporting charcoal on Mwingi-Thika highway. The vehicle was razed by Kitui residents who were apparently effecting a ban on charcoal burning and transportation imposed by governor Ngilu. The affected traders held protests along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway demanding the governor's arrest. Click here for the latest political news
