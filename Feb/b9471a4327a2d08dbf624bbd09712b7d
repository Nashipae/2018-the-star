Five people died while at least 10 were injured in a multiple-vehicle accident at Kikopey area on Monday night. Two people died at the scene on Nairobi-Nakuru Highway and three at the nearby St Mary’s Mission Hospital. Those injured were taken to St Mary's and Gilgil Sub-County Hospital following the incident at about 10.30pm. Some of them were later transferred to Nakuru County Referral Hospital. Majority of the victims had been heading from Eldoret to Nairobi in a North Rift Shuttle. Witness Samuel Wambugu said the accident occurred after a trailer lost control and rammed into a fleet of vehicles heading towards Nairobi. "The driver of the trailer had been speeding. He hit six vehicles, including two trailers, before landing into a ditch," he said. “The matatu was hit first. People in personal cars were seriously injured." Regional Traffic boss Ziro Arome said the brakes of the trailer, registration KBC 419N/ZC2453, failed. Gilgil Sub-County Commissioner Ndambuki Mutheki said traffic police launched investigations. "We hope those injured will recuperate," he said and asked drivers to be cautious as the number of accidents had decreased. The bodies were taken to the Gilgil hospital mortuary and the wreckage towed to the area police station. Click here for the latest political news
