According a tweet by the opposition coalition, a group gathered at Kamukunji grounds and demanded Miguna's freedom. The protesters said they were aggrieved by the manner in which he has been kept in the cells despite his release on Sh50,000 cash bail. They are sharing their views under hash tag #FreeMigunaMiguna. The coalition noted that two days after a court order was issued for Miguna's release, police are still keeping the lawyer in their custody.  /Courtesy  /Courtesy Lawyer Edwin Sifuna, who vied for Nairobi senator, wrote: "It's true. We received information that Miguna has suffered an asthma attack. I have with me an inhaler but the OCS has become hostile. He won't let me see my client to give him the medication." Via Twitter on Saturday, he had said: "Miguna is at Lari police station. The OCS and OCPD have denied access to counsel and family. We do not know his state." Miguna was arrested in a dramatic fashion at his Runda home in Nairobi on Friday; police used force to break into his house before arresting him after a brief standoff.  /Courtesy The lawyer is also the self-declared 'general' of the National Resistance Movement, which Interior CS Fred Matiang'i declared a criminal grouping. Hundreds of of people from the Nairobi slum took to the streets on Friday to protest his arrest.
