A fisherman from Port Victoria in Bunyala subcounty has petitioned the assembly to protect fishing.John Kulohoma wrote to the Agriculture Committee calling for the ban on crude fishing methods. “This will enable us achieve more revenue and boost the economic standards of the people,” Kulohoma said. Committee chairman Joab Oteba tabled the report on the petition on Wednesday seeking members’ input. Recommendations include night surveillance and introduction of cage fishing. Oteba said the main challenge fishermen face is indiscriminate fishing. He urged fishermen to consider animal rearing and crop cultivation.
