A report tabled in the National Assembly last week has revealed massive grabbing of land belonging to the Kenya Railways Corporation. The 2016/2017 report by Auditor General Edward Ouko (pictured), which was tabled in the House by Majority leader Aden Duale, also shows the corporation could not account for Sh1.9 million. “The scrutiny of the corporation records indicates that during the year under audit, a total of Sh1,981,920 was collected as museum revenue and surrendered to the corporation cashier for banking. However, no banking slips were availed to confirm banking of the cash,” Ouko says in the report. The report indicates three acres belonging to KR within Limuru Railway Station were allocated to private developers. “Land measuring approximately three acres within Limuru Railway Station, constituting industrial plots NO 7882/2-10, was allocated to the private developers ,” he says. Ouko, who flagged the grabbing of the corporation’s land in the previous report without action being taken to recover the parcels, also points out that private buildings have been put up on another two acres within Kikuyu Railway Station. In Mombasa, two parcels adjacent to Mombasa Railway Station have been allocated to developers. Click here for the latest political news
