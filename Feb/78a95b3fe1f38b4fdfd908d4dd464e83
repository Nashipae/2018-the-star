Zari Hassan has said she will not be taking her ex Diamond Platinumz to court for child support for their two children, Princess Tiffah and Prince Nillan. It seems like they will have to punch out a co-parenting plan on how they will raise their two tots. "Wale ni watoto wake, he has the right [to see them]. I'm not the type of person. Hata my ex, vile we broke up, he would have the kids other weekends. If he says, 'You have to send the kids to Tanzania!' Siwezi sema, hawawezi kuja. It has nothing to do with our relationship. They are still his kids." Adding, "I don't have much but at the same time, the little I have I can be able to take care of the kids. I'm a working and a hustling mum. Yeye mwenyewe akiona that he is supposed to take care of his kids, he will. Akiamua, ameniacha, sitaki anything, it is okay, you know. It is fine. I will still manage to raise the kids." As part of her healing process, Zari said, "I have decided to stay completely away from him to digest this whole thing and I need to be in a proper mental situation. I don't need to be in an emotional situation for me to start saying anything. So, I really don't want to speak so much about this issue."Zari's plan going forward is to continue doing her appearances at high-end clubs and hosting gigs, as well as continue shooting her realty TV show, titled, The Life of Zari the Boss Lady.
