The National Assembly Committee on Delegated Legislation yesterday asked the Ministry of Lands and Physical Planning to improve regulation.The committee is chaired by Uasin Gishu Women Representative Gladys Shollei. It told outgoing Lands CS Jacob Kaimenyi and NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri  there is a need for public participation, consultation and approval from Parliament before regulations are implemented.“We are asking the ministry to revoke the regulations and re-submit them. They have to come through Parliament before publication,” Shollei said at Parliament Buildings. In December 2015, the High Court ruled that the title deeds issued without involvement of NLC and enactment of the regulations by Parliament are irregular.

They are long overdue because the Acts were enacted in 2012 and in 2016,” he said. On Wednesday ,the House approved a motion by Majority leader Aden Duale seeking extension by 90 days for the legislators to go through the regulations and approve them.When questioned why NLC delayed in submitting the regulations to Parliament, he blamed the Ministry of Lands, saying his commission developed the regulations by March last year and submitted to the Ministry.“There was no mischief or bad faith on our part , the regulations were developed and forwarded to the Ministry,” he said.
