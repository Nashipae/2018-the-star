Cases of viral Chikungunya
fever have drastically gone down over the past few weeks, Mombasa Health CEC Hazel Koitaba has said. The disease, which is
predominantly transmitted by mosquitoes, has affected dozens of Mombasa residents since December last year. A report by the
Ministry of Health and the Mombasa county government shows that as of January
31, only 32 tested positive out of the 453 cases reported. Speaking during a press
conference at Governor Hassan Joho’s office on Friday, Koitaba said the viral disease
has been contained, hence no cause for alarm. "Let members of public be informed that Chikungunya has already been contained and
it is no longer an epidemic in Mombasa," Koitaba said. She said the county government
has put measures to curb further spread of the disease. Joho’s administration bought five fogging machines from
Malasyia at Sh5 million which are being used to spray the residential areas. According to the county government, Malaysia was the country
worst-hit country by Chikungunya and has developed effective spraying
techniques and equipment. Koitaba said: "The fogging and
spraying of the residential areas has really helped containing the spread of
Chikungunya." In Mvita, 140 cases were
reported, Changamwe (65), Jomvu (43), Likoni (104), Kisauni (63), while Nyali had 20
cases. Read: Mombasa fights chikungunya virus with Sh15m fogging machines Click here for the latest political news
