Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi will fail in his bid to form a Coast based party, Mombasa ODM chairman Mohamed Hatimi has said. On Sunday, Kingi announced that elected leaders were in talks for the formation of a regional party to champion their development agenda. "That was his personal opinion and we respect it. What we know is that the region is in ODM to stay," Hatimi said. Kingi is an influential ODM leader at the Coast. He is the party chairman for Kilifi county. He led the party to a clean sweep of top electoral positions in the county in last year's General Election. Kingi and Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho have also been at the forefront of those calling for secession of the Coast. The two also want the region to go it alone in 2022 and field their own presidential candidate. Political analyst Rocha Chimera said there was something behind Kingi's latest move. Some leaders from the region have accused ODM of not giving them key parliamentary positions. "Kingi is not Kilifi and if he moves out, it doesn't mean Kilifi voters will follow him," Chimera said. While Joho was present during Raila Odinga's swearing-in ceremony in Nairobi last week, Kingi was conspicuously missing. "It shows Joho is serious about ODM matters and he could be scheming ahead," Chimera said. Chimera said Kingi was better off in NASA that if hr formed another political party. "I don't see how a Coast party can make Kingi successful. He is bound to lose because he would have disassociated himself with a powerful alliance with roots countrywide," Chimera said.
