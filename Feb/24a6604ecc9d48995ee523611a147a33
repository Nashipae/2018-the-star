Bungoma county has denied claims that money has been lost in the procurement of new chairs for assembly Chambers. Speaker Emmanuel Situma said the tender for the purchase of chairs and renovation of the chamber was awarded to Frepsos enterprises but the contractor failed to meet the standards. “The first batch of seats that was supplied was rejected by the Inspection and Acceptance committee. The second batch has also been rejected by the same committee. We expect the supplier to meet the right quality before a completion certificate is issued,” Situma who also doubles as the chair of the County Assembly Service Board (CASB) said. Situma said no payment has been made and the county will only do so if the contractors meet all requirements. Situma further said he works with all Members of the Assembly to ensure service delivery. “I was elected by more than 47 members of the County Assembly drawn from across parties. You cannot brand me a Ford Kenya speaker. Ford Kenya has a total of 25 members in the Assembly. Members from other parties also voted for me,” he said. “We have always worked in consultation but independently performed our work as an Assembly without any undue influence from any other person. The Governor does not prefect the County Assembly. Each arm has its roles clearly spelt out in the constitution,” he said. The County Assembly Clerk John Mosongo challenged the Media to be seeking clarification on all matters touching on the assembly for fair and accurate reporting. ‘We are open to scrutiny. All our issues are public so we expect criticism but always seek our side of the story.” He added. This comes amid claims on social media that the MCAs were collecting signatures to impeach him for ‘going to bed’ with the executive.  Click here for the latest political news
