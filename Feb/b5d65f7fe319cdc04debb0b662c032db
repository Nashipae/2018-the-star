Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka broke down during NASA's presser on Thursday when Raila Odinga spoke of his sick wife. Raila, who is now the "people's president", said the attack on Kalonzo's Karen house in Nairobi was uncalled for and that it scared his wife Pauline. "I say pole (sorry) to my brother Kalonzo after the attack on his home. He has a sick wife...imagine the kind of shock they got." Kalonzo was seen wiping tears off his face with a handkerchief. For more than two years now, Pauline has received treatment, including in Germany, for an unknown ailment. The NASA principals addressed the press at their Okoa Kenya office, where they noted Raila was not "mad" to swear by the Bible on Tuesday. They also criticised the Jubilee Party administration for going after the media by shutting three key TV station - NTV, Citizen and NTV.
