Mutahi Kibugu will be the country’s junior representative at this year’s Kenya Open slated for Muthaiga Golf Club between March 22 and 25. Kenya Open Golf Limited’s Director of Publicity and sponsorships, Kathleen Kihanya, said Mutahi is at the peak in as far as playing form is concerned and will definitely do the country proud come next month. “Mutahi has been playing really well lately and being on home course, we can only hope for the best,” said Kihanya. 17-year-old Mutahi is among the four Kenyan amateur golfers who will represent the country at the Kenya open. Others are Edwin Mudanyi, Dennis Saikwa and Daniel Nduva. Kibugu won the Strokesplay championship after carding 233 gross to emerge the overall winner at the par 72 Royal Nairobi course. In the three round-event, Kibugu started round one on a  five over par 77 gross, then played an eight over par 80 gross in the second round before finalising the third round on a four over par 76 gross to lift the title. A total of 156 golfer (six amateurs) will play in the 50th edition of the Barclays Kenya Open which will go down in history as the most lucrative. Two of the six amateur slots have been given to Uganda and Tanzania. KOGL have increased the prize money kitty to Sh62.5m making the Kenya Open the most lucrative event on the European Challenge Tour calendar. This follows a directive by President Uhuru Kenyatta during the 2017 tournament. The President’s directive was aimed at two focus areas; to raise the bar of the championship and increase participation of local players while also attracting a higher calibre of players from across the globe. The second focus area is golf development from junior ranks to the elite category across the country.
