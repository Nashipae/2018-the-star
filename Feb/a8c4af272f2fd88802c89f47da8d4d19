Kenya should invest at least Sh11,300 per person every year for the next 12 years to ensure all Kenyans have access to electricity and clean cooking energy by 2030, a new report suggests. Currently, more than 60 per cent of Kenyans have access to electricity but 56 per cent of households rely on firewood and 17 per cent on charcoal because it is cheaper. Only 12 per cent use the cleaner liquefied petroleum gas for cooking. The Poor People’s Energy Outlook report, released in Nairobi yesterday, says the two are the biggest causes of indoor pollution, which kills about 15,000 Kenyans every year. The report recommends massive investments in clean cooking options for Kenyans for the country to achieve the UN 2030 sustainable development energy targets. “The health of more than 36 million Kenyans is therefore affected by exposure to household air pollution,” the report says. Two years ago, the government removed 16 per cent VAT on LPG and efficient biomass stoves, and reduced import duties on fuel-efficient stoves from 25 per cent to 10 per cent. But still no major new investments were made towards clean cooking options such as financing improved cookstoves, or offgrid solar power. “Energy investments should go to decentralised energy systems such as solar mini-grids and stand-alone systems for faster and economical results, but energy finance has not shifted or grown accordingly,” Jechoniah Kitala, the head of energy at Practical Action said. Energy CS Charles Keter says most clean energy investments will be done by the private sector. Last year, Energy CS called on private sector players to support the endeavor. The report says a shift away from traditional cooking methods will significantly reduce the time households spent on cooking, collecting, and preparing fuel by 45 per cent. This is from 6 hours per day on average to 3 hours and 18 minutes. Nationally, this adds up to more than 7.6 billion hours annually which could be better spent in other ways.
