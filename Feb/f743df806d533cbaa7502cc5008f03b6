President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday praised the Kenya Defence Forces for fighting terrorism and supporting civil authorities to maintain security. He was speaking during a passing out parade at Moi Barracks Recruits Training College in Eldoret. Uhuru said KDF has degraded al Shabaab and it is unable to launch major attacks in the country. The President said KDF soldiers have displayed a high level of integrity and discipline. Those who lost lives in the line of duty sacrificed their lives for their country, he said. “KDF’s engagement in Somalia and in the Linda Boni Forest operation in Lamu have severely dented the terrorists’ ability to attack the country,” Uhuru said. However, numerous reports indicate al Shabaab is still launching attacks in Lamu and the Northeast. The country is experiencing peace because soldiers have sacrificed their lives in defence of the country for the pursuit of peace, equality and freedom in the nation and the region, he said. “The gallant soldiers who lost their lives in the line of such duty did not do so in vain,” Uhuru said. The President said KDF is a symbol of nationhood and national unity. Uhuru said KDF soldiers were recruited from all parts of the country. “Your unity and cohesion stands as a proof of the greatness that can be achieved when we all live in harmony, irrespective of ethnicity, race religion or gender. It serves as an example to be emulated by all Kenyans,” he said. Uhuru said the state recognises the role played by KDF in development projects and maintaining law and order. The training offered at the RTC is of high quality, he said. Governors Jackson Mandago and Alex Tolgos, Chief of Defence Forces Samson Mwathathe and Kesses MP Swarrup Mishra attended the event.
