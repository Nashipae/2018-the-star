The High Court has directed activist Okiya Omtatah to serve CSs Fred Matiang’i, Joe Mucheru and the CA board in person with the contempt of court papers. Justice Chacha Mwita said Omtatah should also serve them through the media to show cause why they should not be jailed for disobeying a court order. On Monday, Omtatah filed contempt proceedings against the state officials for failing to comply with orders requiring them to restore NTV, KTN News and Citizen TV signals. This comes even as the government restored signals of two TV stations – NTV and KTN News. It did not restore those of Citizen TV and Inooro TV for unclear reasons. They were switched off last Tuesday. In the petition, the activist says he served the parties with a copy of the orders on Friday, through a paid up advertisement, but the state officials have blatantly disobeyed the orders and should be punished. Omtatah says the court has the unfettered powers and jurisdiction to stop the blatant disregard of the rule of law. Apart from the two CSs, the activist also wants the court to punish PSs Kamau Thugge, Karanja Kibicho, Sam Itemere, and the entire CA board. The board members are Ben Ngene, Paul Kukubo, Mugambi Nandi, Ken Tikolo, David Cheruiyot, Levi Obonyo, Christopher Guto and Patrick Kimama. He wants the respondents committed to civil jail for a period of six months. The case will be mentioned on February 9.
