A well-known music producer has worked very hard at hoodwinking his fans and the general population at how good he is at being a parent. The truth is what happens behind closed doors, who breaks your soul and gets some of you admitted in hospital. A source narrated how the producer would leave his baby mama without food, despite her being heavily pregnant. Her source of food would be the upcoming artistes, who would come to the producer's studio to record. They would share their food and give the baby mama the little cash they had. Meanwhile, the producer would be away, hanging out and making merry with a slay queen. After the girlfriend gave birth, the parents devisedÂ ways to steal her away from the abusive producer, who was known to beat her up and leave her black and blue. Fast forward to late last year, his other girlfriend died and there are whispers her death could have been caused by the constant battering she got from the producer. This is extremely sad.
