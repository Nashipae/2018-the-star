The Kenya Wildlife Service has raised concerns over Murang’a county government's move to allow residents to trap monkeys. This comes after the county government issued the farmers with cages to rid their farms of the cheeky primates that have been destroying crops. Farmers have been getting minimal or no harvest as the primates invade their farms. Residents have also said the monkeys have also been harassing women and children. Speaking to the Star on the phone on Friday, KWS spokesperson Paul Gathitu said they are the only agency mandated by law to carry out such activities. He said they are worried about the safety of the animals as the county did not engage the KWS in the drive. Gathitu further said the service is concerned about the handling of the primates once they are trapped and the duration they have to spend in the cages before being returned to the Aberdare Forest. “Putting primates in cages is a violation of the law. Some may be starved to death, while others killed by the angered residents,” he said. Gathitu said the KWS cannot take action against residents as the cages they received were from the county government. “We are having ongoing discussion with the county government and we hope to give a comprehensive report on the long-term solution to this menace by mid next week,” he said. Gathitu said the use of cages to trap wild animals, especially primates, is a specification mode that is used for translocation in areas that the wildlife are many and causing a problem. On Monday and Tuesday farmers caught more than 100 monkeys and returned them back to the Aberdare Forest. The move to capture the monkey has received mixed reactions by residents. Some say it is wrong, while others say it will save the county from food shortage. Governor Mwangi wa Iria had earlier in year pledged to help farmers deal with the monkey invasion.
