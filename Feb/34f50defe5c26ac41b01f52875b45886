Lawyers in Mombasa on Monday joined their counterparts in condemning defiance of court orders by the state and government agencies. Branch LSK chairman Mathew Nyabena led the group which donned yellow ribbons in solidarity with their colleagues. The lot said they will be pushing for the government and its top officials to respect the rule of law. "We want to defend our Constitution by showing that impunity will not be tolerated in this country," Nyabena said.

The lawyers pointed out that the government should demonstrate to its citizens the importance of adhering to the law. Lawyers had planned to boycott work on Monday, a move which would have paralysed court cases, but shelved the idea to give room for better preparations. On Sunday, LSK President Isaac Okero said: "Upon further consultation, it has been decided that the campaign shall proceed with all components save for the court boycott which stands postponed for now to facilitate better preparation." Okero had on Saturday said lawyers across the country would keep away from court sessions save for election petitions. "The Yellow Ribbon Campaign shall proceed from Thursday where lawyers countrywide are expected to hold demonstrations to ensure state organs abide by the rule of law." The protests follow in the wake of state ignoring several orders for the re-opening of three TV stations and for NRM 'general' Miguna Miguna to be produced in court.
