Non local teachers in Mandera and Wajir counties have vowed never to go back to their respective schools despite assurances by the government to do everything to protect their lives. “I am a teacher in one of the primary schools in the boarder towns of Mandera. We live in fear and always thank God when a day passes without any insecurity incidences,” a teacher in an interview with the Star saidXXX. He said the government needs to walk the talk on the security issue and suggested that more police offices including police reservists be posted in the towns along the boarder. Another teacher said that the issue of insecurity is only talked about for a few days after it happens. and after that ‘it is business as ussual’. But Internal CS Fred Matiang'i on Tuesday assured the locals that the teachers will be back. More than 200 non local teachers have left Wajir county over security concerns. He was speaking during a security meeting in Wajir during his maiden tour in the region to address security challenges affecting the boarder county. He however said the local leadership and the residents have a role to play in protecting lives of government officers including teachers, nurses and security officers. Matiang'i regretted having a section of the country where some Kenyans fear working for fear of their lives. He was referring to a case where three people were killed by suspected al Shabab militias in Qarsa, Wajir county. But residents who spoke to the Star said that they were tired with the empty talk by the government and the local leadership on matters of security. On Tuesday, police used teargas canisters to disperse hundreds of non local teachers working in Northeastern who had gathered at the TSC headquarters asking for transfers. The teachers vowed to push for transfers to safer areas.
