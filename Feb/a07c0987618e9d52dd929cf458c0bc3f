Thirty one children from Garissa, Meru and Kitui are set to benefit from from free cardiac camp in Mai Mahui by Heart Gift Foundation. Kaaba Maalim, a pediatrician, said they will accompany 54 children who were diagnosed with the disease last year for review at Garissa Referral Hospital. Team of doctors from the US based foundation annually carry out screening and recommend for operations where appropriate. Those who require treatment are put on medication. Maalim said those who will require surgery will be flown to the US. He said 9 out of 64 patients screened last year underwent an operation in the US. The medic said that the condition is either acquired through infection or the patient is born with it. The foundation meets all the medical and operation costs while the county government takes care of other logistics, he said. Dagane said the county government is commitment to supporting the programme and will ensure accommodation, meals and transport expenses for the parents, their patients or guardians accompanying them are met.
