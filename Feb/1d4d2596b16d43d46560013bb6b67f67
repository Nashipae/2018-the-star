Kameme FM radio presenter Moses Kanyira was fired Monday morning for allegedly going ham on Muranga’s water shortage. Blogger Wahome Thuku posted on Facebook, “According to sources close to him, Kanyira was dismissed today [Monday] for speaking about Murang'a's water problem on radio. Apparently, the show he aired did not go well with the Muranga county bosses and the station top management/owners. "Kanyira sent a very emotional farewell message to his colleagues today. He says the events today almost led him to commit suicide. Losing a job when his mom is in hospital.” Kanyira Facebooked: “I am passing the most trying period in my life. If it is not my God, this can amount to commit suicide (sic).” He was not available for comment.
