The High Court has directed the Communications Authority to restore live transmission for TV stations shut down on January 30. Judge Chacha Mwita has barred the government from interfering with the signals. Speaking at the court premises on Thursday, Mwita said the conservatory orders will remain until the matter is heard and determined on February 14. He certified the case as urgent. The government shut down NTV, Citizen and KTN hours before NASA leader Raila Odinga's defiant swearing-in at Uhuru Park in Nairobi. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i later claimed the coalition had planned a massacre and that some media houses were aware.
