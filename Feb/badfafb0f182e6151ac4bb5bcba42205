Safaricom on Monday launched a new music streaming service called 'Songa', which offers customers music at a fee and artistes a marketing platform. In an interview with Kiss FM, Kagwe Mungai gave his two cents about the new music app in town Songa, stating that if one can easily access his music, then it's definitely a good idea. "The easier the access the better. At the end of the day, you want as many people to hear your music as possible. If there are people working hard to make that possible, then I think it's a good thing." Customers can download the music app by simply dialing *812#.
