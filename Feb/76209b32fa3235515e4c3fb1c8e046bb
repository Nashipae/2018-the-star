Nairobi’s domestic air travel capacity is set to grow further this year as regional carrier Jambojet seeks to expand to other African destinations. “We would like to serve Kenya and the greater Eastern Africa region with future plans to go into Somalia, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Rwanda and Burundi,” Jambojet chief executive Willem Hondius said. A report by ForwardKeys released in August shows Nairobi’s domestic air travel capacity grew 22 per cent, making it the only city in Africa whose airports are recording higher growth in domestic than international flight capacity. “After proving our operations are sustainable and getting the air operators certificate, we can now go international,” Hondius said. The low-cost airline is now operating two daily flights from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Entebbe International Airport at an introductory price of Sh11,740. This, Hondius said, will boost tourism and trade between the two countries as it will encourage more East Africans to travel by air. The barely four-year-old airline recently increased the number of routes from four to six, increasing flight frequency due to fleet expansion. Other routes on which the airline operates include Eldoret, Kisumu, Malindi, Mombasa and Ukunda.
