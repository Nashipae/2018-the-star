Victoria Kimani has opened up about a sexual assault case she experienced during a show in Kisii. Using the hashtag End Rape Culture, the China Love hitmaker exposed a man who touched her behind. “To the guy that grabbed my a$$, That HOT SLAP you got in the Face by the security detail… You fully deserved it! BOYS Stop touching GIRLS without their consent! #ENDRAPECULTURE.” Kimani accused people who make light of sexual assault of being part of the problem. "Perhaps your fathers and brothers did not teach you well. I will be your teacher today. RAPE CULTURE is what you are promoting when you laugh or make jokes out of sexual violation. It is when you down play these actions and BLAME the VICTIM for what was done to them." Victoria said she takes the matter personally because she knows victims who were left to suffer alone. "I am passionate about this because I have friends and sisters and brothers who have been raped or molested, and had NO ONE to support them. You boys (and shockingly, girls, too) I will pray for you on this good Sunday. There is a special place in HELL for you if you do not stop what you are doing"
