Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga and Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo will know the outcome of petitions challenging their elections on February 26. Their elections were challenged by rivals Nicholas Gumbo and Jakoyo Midiwo respectively. The two cases are before Siaya High Court Judge Esther Maina. She will deliver the ruling in Odhiambo’s petition at 9am and follow that up with the Rasanga verdict at 11am. The date was set after parties filed their final submissions. Esther promised to give a fair and just ruling in the two cases. Gumbo wants Rasanga’s election nullified, citing massive violation of election laws. Rasanga told the court that the election was free and fair. Rasanga’s lawyer Francis Wasuna said Gumbo failed to prove his allegations. He asked the court to slap the petitioner with Sh5 million costs. A scrutiny of votes in 51 polling stations in Alego Usonga revealed no stuffing of ballots took place as Gumbo had claimed.
