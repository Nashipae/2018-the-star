The Bungoma government has bought Sh47 million medicines for its Level II and III health facilities. Another Sh20 million consignment for 10 subcounty hospitals will be disbursed next week. In total, the county has 133 health facilities. The drugs from Kemsa will help the county for the next six months. This ends an acute drug shortage that had hit most health facilities in the county in the recent past. Flagging off the drugs at the county headquarters, Governor Wycliffe Wangamati yesterday said his vision is to ensure every resident accesses cheap and quality healthcare. He said this is the fourth pillar of his agenda. “At the core of my manifesto was a promise to stock up all hospitals and dispensaries,” Wangamati said. He warned medics against stealing the drugs. Culprits will face dire consequences, he said. “During my campaigns, I assured you that every dispensary would have enough drugs. This is just but the first step. I’ll not allow any person to sabotage this effort by diverting these drugs to the market for personal gain,” Wangamati said. Health CEC Anthony Walela said his ministry has put in place measures to curb theft. The county has honoured the nurses’ CBA and paid all their arrears, he said. Wangamati urged nurses to serve diligently. “We’ve played our part. It’s my first step towards revamping the health sector,” he said. The county also plans to pay doctors their arrears, the county chief said. Kemsa MD Fred Wanyonyi said they have launched a new business system that will ensure the counties to access their stores online to place orders. “Through this model, which is backed by a web-based logistics information management system, Kemsa will inject efficiency in the supply chain,” he said. The system will enable the counties to monitor their inventories by tracking stock levels and movement. The firm will also be able to make real-time reports to the counties for records and reduce delivery time.
