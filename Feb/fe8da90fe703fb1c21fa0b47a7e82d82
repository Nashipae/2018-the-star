The Controller of Budget’s First Quarter National Government Budget Implementation Review to be released this week is a depressing read. It exposes profligate expenditure in the Presidency — the offices of the President and the Deputy President — and raises serious questions about accountable use of public resources during electioneering time. On domestic travel alone, the Presidency used Sh174.4 million in just the period July to September 2017, up from Sh60 million the previous year. The report says Sh167 million was spent on hospitality — meaning refreshment and flowers. It is highly probable that public funds were being used to finance ruling party political campaigns, which is an offence under the Elections Act. Similarly, the National Intelligence Service spent Sh3.7 billion in the same three-month period on unexplained activities. It’s anyone’s guess what the money could have been used for, considering its operations are shrouded in secrecy. But it is nothing new; in the-run up to the 2013 election, the Office of the President operated a mysterious security expense account that gobbled up billions. It is now up to the CoB to explain to the country, thoroughly and comprehensively, how all this money was spent and whether it was in the public interest. Any impropriety must be punished with prosecution and recovery.
