The Kenya Revenue Authority has introduced an App to fight counterfeits in beer products. KRA marketing surveillance chief manager Caxton Masudi said the Soma Label App will help identify counterfeited products in the market Alcoholic Beverages Association of Kenya chairman Gordon Mutugi said importation of fake products has become a big problem in the country. He said 28 companies have been licenced to produce alcoholic products.Mutugi said the industry remits more than Sh70 billion annually to KRA. He said 70 per cent of the association members are genuine manufacturers. The association has also rejected a move by some county governments in Central Kenya to impose new levies on bar owners and alcohol manufacturing industries. Mutugi said the law is clear on how the money revenue collected should be spent. "The continued proliferation of illegal brew and abuse of alcohol in Central Kenya cannot be fought by introducing additional taxation," he said.Mutugi said imposing more taxes on bar owners is illegal.
