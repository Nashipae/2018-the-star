ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi yesterday warned members against violating the party constitution. He said there are individuals going round the country, particularly in Western and Nairobi, purporting to hold meetings and making resolutions in the name of the party. “Their objective is clearly to cause confusion and disunity in the party,” Mudavadi said. He cautioned individuals against posing as party officials. Mudavadi said attempts to destabilise the party secretariat would be punished. “I’m disturbed that these elements have questioned the NEC as presently constituted,” he said.
