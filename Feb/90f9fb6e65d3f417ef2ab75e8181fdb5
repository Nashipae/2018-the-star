Uganda President Yoweri Museveni on Friday apologised to heads of EAC partner states for poor services and non-functioning air conditioners at the EAC Summit. Museveni told the 18th Ordinary Head of States Summit he was sorry that the protocol officials had spoilt "their working holiday". He issued a stern warning to the officials saying this was the last time he would tolerate such poor organization of a high profile event. "I am very sorry for your suffering, I can see you are all sweating. Thanks to the poor organization of the Uganda group. They are always determined to inconvenience our visitors I don't know for what reason," Museveni said.

Museveni said it would have been better if the organizers set the event outside where the guests could enjoy the fresh breeze from Lake Victoria "instead of squeezing us in this small place". "This will really be the last time I tolerate these officials who habitually inconvenience our visitors with poor arrangements. Even the doors are not properly sealed and I can see protocol officers moving up and down," he said. "Once again I am sorry for spoiling your working holiday over here," Museveni added. The heads of states from Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan are congregating at the Lake Victoria Resort of Munyonyo, on the outskirts of Uganda's capital Kampala for the Summit.
