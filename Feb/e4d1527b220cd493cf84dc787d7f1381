Celebrated Genge rapper James Mburu, popularly known as Jimwat, has opened up about how he struggled with alcoholism back when his star was still rising. The rapper, who is well known for his hit songs 'Sitoi Kitu Kidogo' and 'Under 18', revealed that he was at the darkest moment of his life. His close friends turned into foes after his health and financial status deteriorated. To make matters worse, the one-time poster boy for Calif Records changed his lifestyle, spending time in clubs and and bars to the extent of sleeping at the bar counter. "I used to smile but deep down I was suffering, and that's when I realised I did not have real friends around me, I had fake friends," Jimwat said, speaking exclusively to Word Is. "I had 1,000 friends before things went south. They all disappeared and ignored my phone calls. Soon as they start seeing my posters as I try to make a comeback, they have now started crawling back." Jimwat said he is working on a song that is based on his real-life experience. "The thing is, I used to spend a lot of cash in the bar compared to my monthly rent," he said. "Also, I used to spend more time in the bar than at my place. At times, I never even used to go home, since I would sleep on the bar counter. It was that bad," added the father of one.
