In view of the above, I wish to remind you that the office of the appointing authority for Cabinet Secretaries is vacant, hence no need to constitute the Committee on Appointments.” Read: NASA boycott of CS vetting disappointingYesterday, sources within the committee that vetted the nine nominees on Thursday and Friday last week said the report was ready and all the nominees have sailed through the vetting process.“We will be meeting this evening (yesterday) as a committee to adopt the report ahead of tomorrow, when it shall be tabled in the House,” a member of the committee said.The committee had on Saturday and Sunday retreated to Naivasha to write the report.
