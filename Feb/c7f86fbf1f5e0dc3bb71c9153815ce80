Makolanders striker Neddy Atieno and United States-based Marjolene Nekesa are the notable inclusions in the Harambee Starlets provisional squad of 31 ahead of the 2018 Africa Women Cup of Nations (AWCON) qualifiers. Atieno missed out on the 2016 edition which was held in Cameroon as she was taking her military induction course with the Kenya Defence Forces. Nekesa, who is attached to Oklahoma Wesleyan University and recently named the Most Valuable Player during the womenâ€™s Soccer All-Conference, is expected to bring valuable experience to the team. The players, who were called up by coach Richard Kanyi, are expected to assemble at Kandanda House on Monday before proceeding to Machakos for residential training at the Kenyatta Stadium. Starlets, who failed to impress on their debut in Cameroon after falling to Nigeria, Ghana and Mali in the group stages are expected to take on neighbours Uganda in the two-legged qualifier, slated for between April 2 and 10. Should Starlets ease past Uganda, they will face Equatorial Guinea in a two-legged knockout encounter that will determine who graces the continental showpiece.
