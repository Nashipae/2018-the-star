The Kisumu County Public Service Board has suspended county secretary Olang’o Onudi over irregular recruitment. Board chairman Nashon Oguya said accused Onudi of abuse of office. It did not specify which jobs Onudi hired for. Oguya said recruitment should be done by the board, not county secretary. “We have been made aware that when such things are irregularly conducted under the board’s watch, it is held responsible and can even be charged,”he said on Saturday. Oguya said positions have to be advertised and people cannot just be hired arbitrarily. Concerning whether the board has the mandate to suspend Onudi since he was appointed by Governor Anyang Nyong’o, Oguya said the the board is responsible for carrying out disciplinary action. Staying put There were concerns Onudi was hiring staff and promoting others without the board’s knowledge. Oguya said te board has not delegated its hiring role to any official. That includes hiring staff in an acting capacity. Onudi said the board has no power to suspend him, adding he will stay put in office. Onudi served as the Kenya Medical Training College director before Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga appointed him health executive. He replaced Ojwang Lusi.
