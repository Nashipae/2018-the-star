A woman who was allegedly assaulted by a prison warder has protested over the delay in prosecuting her assailant. The suspect has not been charged, despite appearing in court. The suspect was arrested on Tuesday in connection with the assault on Esther Nyambura on December last year and was taken to Nanyuki law courts yesterday morning together with other suspects. Other suspects were locked in the court cells, he remained in the vehicle and was not booked in the criminal register. Kieni East police commander Michael Mbaluku said the warder wasn’t charged oninstructions from the DPP’s office.
