Banditry attacks in the Kerio Valley and other parts of the North Rift has scared away investors, Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago has said. He said governors from eight counties in the region will soon meet soon to look into ways of ending insecurity that has been a thorn in the fresh in West Pokot, Turkana, Baringo and Elgeyo Marakwet counties. The region has also been grappling with cattle rustling for a long time. The governor, who is also the chairman of the North Rift Economic Bloc, said banditry has turned out to be a costly affair, because several investors had expressed concerns over the problem. "As leaders for the counties, we are in discussion to see how we can end the problem in the Kerio Valley. The region has high potential, which cannot be exploited due to banditry," Mandago said. Mandago spoke on Saturday when he met with county executives from the Noreb region in Eldoret town. He also urged the devolved units in the region to align their County Integrated Development Plans with the Jubilee government's 'Big Four Agenda'. Mandago said this will enable the counties in the region to benefit from the national government's development projects. The Jubilee administration has identified manufacturing, universal healthcare, food security and provision of 500,000 affordable housing units as its key agenda. Mandago said the region should position itself in a way that will enable it maximise on the mega projects that will be initiated under the 'Big Four Agenda'. He also said there are plans for the eight counties in the North Rift to establish a common trade law. "We need to have common trade legislation within the Noreb as we need to open barriers. We can easily access resources if we come together," the county boss said.
