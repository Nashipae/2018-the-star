Self-styled National Resistance Movement  General Miguna Miguna will start a 10-day tour in the US to popularise the movement. On March 2, Miguna who was "deported" to Canada on February 6, will tour Washington DC and later proceed to New York and New Jersey the next day. He will then take a break in either of the cities before heading out to Houston and then finish his tour in Dallas Texas on March 9. Through his twitter handle, Miguna urged Nasa supporters in the US to turn out in large numbers and support the cause. “Contact your local #NRMke organ for more information. #UhuruMustGo! The mother of liberation.” Miguna tweeted.

Miguna, however, accused the government of defacing his passport to deny him his right to return to Kenya. The document is perforated, meaning the NRMKe General will have to apply for a new one.

But he noted: "We must prove them wrong. The respondents believe, wrongly, that the guns they wield are far superior to the courts. The struggle against the purveyors of impunity and abuse of power will continue."
