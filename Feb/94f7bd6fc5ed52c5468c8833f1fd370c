A teenager has been arrested with a loaded AK-47 rifle during a joint operation to recover more than 600 cattle stolen from Ole Naishu Ranch in Laikipia two weeks ago. The suspected cattle rustler was nabbed at Loruk, on the Laikipia-Isiolo border as security officers from three counties launched an operation to recover the cattle. Laikipia county police commander Simon Kipkeu said security officers from Samburu, Laikipia and Isiolo are carrying out a joint operation to end cattle rustling.
