Every home in Kiharu constituency will be connected to electricity by March next year, MP Ndindi Nyoro has said. The constituency has received funding for 83 power projects from the African Development Bank, European Union and the Kenya Power Company. Commissioning the installation of a transformer in Karinga village yesterday, the MP said the African Development Bank is funding 20 power projects in the constituency that will provide electricity to more than 1,000 homes. “The AfDB has given us funding to connect individual homes to power,” Nyoro said. Kenya Power has installed 35 transformers through the Last Mile Connectivity Project to connect 75 per cent of Kenyans’ homes to power countrywide. Through the programme, residents will pay connection fees of Sh15,000 in monthly installments.
