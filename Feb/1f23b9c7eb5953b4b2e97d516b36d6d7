Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi has supported Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu’s move to ban burning and transportation of charcoal in the county. Ngilu’s directive on charcoal has agitated some businessmen. Mulyungi on Sunday said there should be no more charcoal burning and Ngilu was right in her directive. He said the move should not be viewed as a war against any community. The MP said Ngilu is only fighting to end environmental degradation in Kitui. “We have had hard times trying to convince residents to stop aiding charcoal burning. I’m now happy they are in the frontline in the war on charcoal burning,” Mulyungi said. He said the charcoal business has hurt the ecosystem and it is turning Kitui into a totally arid area. The MP urged other visionary leaders to back Ngilu as well. He said Ngilu should not turn back in her efforts to restore Kitui’s glory. Mulyungi said no amount of uproar from Kiambu businessmen or any other leader should stop the governor. He accused a local administration officer, who he did not name, of being behind the rampant charcoal business in Nuu, Mwingi East subcounty.
