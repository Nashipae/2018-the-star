Divisions are likely to be experienced in Mandera county assembly as House begins second session sittings. The county speaker Mohamed Khalif has a task of controlling the 48-member house to ensure they execute their mandate and avoid side shows. The assembly is divided between the Economic Freedom Party MCAs who are the majority and the Governor Ali Roba's Jubilee Party members. Roba’s inaugural speech in September last year was marred by walkout protests by EFP members. The assembly rejected rejected a list of nine CECs in the first session in December Governor Roba had presented to the house for vetting. Khalif while presiding over the opening ceremony on Wednesday told the press he expects members to be guided by standing orders and the Constitution in all their undertakings. Khalif said members had ironed out their differences in the first session. He said the MCAs have gone through an induction and have a chance to draft private Bills and deliberate on them. The governor is waiting for a ruling by a Nairobi court at the end of this month in a petition filed by EFP gubernatorial candidate Hassan Noor challenging his reelection.
