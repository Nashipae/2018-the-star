Parliament’s Public Investments Committee chairman Abdulswamad Sharif yesterday said the NHIF management will be summoned to explain  cancellation of civil servants’ Sh836 million scheme. Speaking at Parliament Buildings, Sharif said next week the committee will question CEO Geoffrey Mwangi  and the board to explain reports that at least 400,000 civil servants, police and prison officers are without life insurance. He said cancellation of the scheme procured for them last year will hurt civil servants. “My committee will be dispatching letters to various institutions and state parastatals from next week. We want to get to the bottom of this matter on NHIF so the public will know what is happening,” he said.

It cited  irregularities in awarding the tender by NHIF  to two local insurance companies. NHIF will now be forced to award the tender to UAP after a rival firm withdrew a suit it filled in the High Court. CIC insurance gave up the court battle on Tuesday. This paved the way for UAP which had been awarded the tender after a protracted legal duel at the board. “Take notice that CIC Life Assurance has withdrawn the Chamber summons application dated February 8, 2018,” CIC lawyer Eric Gumbo said. NHIF initially awarded the tender to Britam and Pioneer Assurance. The board, which is headed by lawyer Paul Gicheru, put NHIF on the spot and said detectives could take over the matter if they wish. This is because NHIF awarded the tender as a joint venture, yet all 11 bidders participated as individual firms. “The board has looked at all the original tender documents and notes that none of the bidders submitted their tenders as a consortium or as a joint venture,” the PPARB said.
