More than 3,000 street children have flocked to the Nakuru CBD, causing fears of crime.
In the last six months, more street families have been spotted, causing security concerns among residents.  The street children are shaggy and rowdy, and the majority sniff glue. They harass shoppers, especially on Kenyatta Avenue. They are pick pockets and threaten residents to give them money.
Once described as among East Africa’s cleanest towns, investors are worried the street families may turn Nakuru town into a dirty crime den.
Hawkers’ chairman Simon Sangare said the county needs to take action or investors will flee. “Visitors walking on the main streets are greeted by mothers begging for money with children in their arms and backs,” he said. Many of the street children are aged above 18.
