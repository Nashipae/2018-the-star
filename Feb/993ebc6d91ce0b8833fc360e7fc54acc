Starring: Dakota Johnson, Jamie Dornan, Eric Johnson, Rita Ora, Marcia Gay Harden BASED ON: Fifty Shades Freed by EL James RELEASE DATE: February 9  Following the engagement at the end of the previous film, Fifty Shades Darker, the final instalment of the Fifty Shades trilogy begins with a montage of the wedding and the honeymoon of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey. While on honeymoon in Europe, the two get a call to inform them that there was a break-in at the Grey headquarters. From the security tape, Ana recognises the assailant as Jack Hyde, her former boss and a man who was obsessed with her. The Greys return to Seattle, where they try to settle into their new life as a married couple. The couple later realise that marriage is not as easy as they imagined. Ana fights for her identity other than being Mrs Grey, and Christian fights to maintain his control on Ana. Their troubles are fuelled by Jack’s invasion into their lives. I might be the only one to admit this, but in this threequel, I found the main two characters to be as dull as a hard-boiled potato. Their performances were not desirable, their whispery dialogue was hardly audible, and after two prequels, their characters had no development. The only salvable element to this third franchise is the introduction of Arielle Kebbel as architect Gia Matteo. The character’s flirtatious and ambitious nature is refreshing in a world of comfortably rich people. Just like its predecessors, the film offers no takeaway. The film’s sappy lines and sex scenes only make it bearable as a girl’s night-out film. There’s nothing to it that we haven’t seen before. After all is said and done, we are glad that this is the end.  Star Rating: 2/5
