The High Court in Malindi on Wednesday nullified the election of MP Stanley Muthama because the results were manipulated. Justice Weldon Korir ordered a by-election and told the respondents to pay Sh3 million for costs. Muthama will pay Sh1.5 million, while the IEBC and the IEBC returning officer were slapped with Sh1.5 million. Muthama said he would appeal. “If the Appeal Court orders us to go for a by-election, I’ll ask residents to join hands to defend the seat,” he told The judge also referred the returning officer and his deputy to the Office of the DPP to be investigated and charged if it was proved they were involved in malpractices. He said the August 8 election violated the Constitution, citing manipulation of results in forms 35A and 35B. Rishad Amana of ODM challenged Muthama’s election. “The petitioner clearly brought out the issue of vote suppression and inflation. Stanley Muthama wasn’t duly elected as MP, so the election was null and void,” Korir said. In his sworn affidavit, Amana said, “The IEBC copy of the Form 35A for Lamu Fort Hall 1 polling station indicates that I garnered 178 votes and the third respondent [Muthama] had 66. “My agent’s copy of the same form indicates I obtained 261 votes, while the third respondent had 36 votes. Curiously, the IEBC portal indicates that I garnered 241 votes as per the agent’s copy of Form 35 A.” Korir said it was the duty of the court to ensure those who occupy elective posts win fairly. He said Amana proved that at Lamu Fort hall polling station no 1 of 5 his result was reduced by 63 votes, while Muthama’s was inflated by 28. The game played by the returning officer was “high-tech”, Korir said.
