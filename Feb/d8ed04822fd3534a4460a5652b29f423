He will later lead a fundraiser at Namwela Secondary School in the constituency. The fundraising will take place at a school whose buildings have been condemned by health officials. Regarding the hospital, Sirisia MP John Waluke said Ruto's visit may result in a face lift as it is a "terrible state". He asked residents to turn up in large numbers to welcome the DP. On Sunday, Ruto will attend interdenominational prayers at Cheptais Secondary School, Mugonyi told the Star by phone. He will also go to Mt Elgon on his last day of the visit. County leaders had asked Ruto to first visit the area where gangs have been wreaking havoc. Though the county largely voted for the Opposition's Nasa coalition, Mt Elgon is predominantly occupied by the Sabaot, a sub-tribe of the Kalenjin tribe. Mt Elgon primarily voted for Jubilee Party so residents expect Ruto to take them a lasting solution to the crimes. Resident Ben Cheshire said: "It is good that the Deputy President is coming to asses the situation on the ground. Let him state the actions that should be taken." Police in the region say poor road and communication networks and lack of enough vehicles slow their response to distress calls. Click here for the latest political news
