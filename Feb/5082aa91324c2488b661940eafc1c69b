Blogger Cyprian Nyakundi was yesterday charged in a Nairobi court with publishing obscene information on his Twitter account against Interior CS Fred Matiang’i. The blogger appeared before Milimani chief magistrate senior principal magistrate Martha Mutuku and denied the charges. On Monday, chief magistrate Francis Andayi issued an arrest order against Nyakundi. The prosecution sought the warrant after he skipped court. Nyakundi was expected to answer to charges of publishing the obscene information against the CS. On January 23, Nyakundi allegedly published defamatory information against Matiang’i. The blogger was arrested on Tuesday by CID officers following the order issued by the court. He had earlier been arrested after he allegedly posted statements on his blog that were considered defamatory towards the CS. Nyakundi was released on police bond to present himself in court on Wednesday to take a plea. Nyakundi’s blog is called @C-nyakundiH. The alleged defamatory article was initially published by the Standard under the title ‘Vocal Minister in illicit affair with choir girl.’
