Vera Sidika, who has a knack for making funny and controversial posts, has done it again. She wrote on her Snapchat about the men she deems worthy of spending her hard-earned money on. Yes, this post will surely hurt all the broke ninjas ouchere. She said: "If I’m paying for my flight, is cause I wanna take myself on vacation somewhere nice, treat myself, not paying to go see a man. Sorry unless it’s my dad, brother or future son — that I will hire private jet to go see him #Blood." Vera further said, “If you’re single, sexy and independent, you can get any hot guy you want in this world. Most won’t be rich but they’ll entertain you, keep you young and happy."
