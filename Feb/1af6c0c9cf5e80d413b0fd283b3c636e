North Kadem MCA Boaz Okoth on Friday claimed political enemies of Governor Okoth Obado are behind his woes. This was after his election as Migori speaker was nullified by high court. Okoth said enemies have plans to frustrate Obado's government to work for the electorate. On January 19, Migori High Court threw out election of Obado and his deputy George Omamba (North Kanyamkago MCA) which was marred by violence on August 31. Advocate Kerario Marwa filed the petition challenging the election after he said he was poised to win when youths invaded the assembly and disrupted the process. Both Boaz and Omamba are close confidents of the governor with campaigns. He said God is with him and the governor to ensure they win the cases. “The struggle we are having in the assembly is not mine, the war is for excellency Obado. The same people who took the governor in court are behind my woes,” he said. Obado on Monday testified in the court case against a petition filed by former cabinet minister Ochilo Ayako who lost the august 8 elections on Independent ticket. Immediate former God Jope MCA Ochieng’ Abwao, who also attended the funeral, said they were sure of retaining back the speaker seat in fresh elections pending a February 8 High Court decision. County assembly employer Charles Alao, filed a petition in court seeking orders to have Obado barred from contesting for the seat on ground that he is yet to resign as a elected MCA. The petition filed before judge Hillary Chemitei will be decided on February 8.
