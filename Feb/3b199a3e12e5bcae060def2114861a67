grant them bond with the alternative of cash bail. They informed the court on Thursday that they were "mere security guards" who needed reasonable bond terms and added they were their family's breadwinners. Mwalungo and Hare further said that even
though the matter is of public interest, this factor should not be
used to deny them bond. But the lawyer representing Wokabi's family, Leonard Shimaka, objected their release on bond saying they were likely to abscond. Shimaka said an earlier report showed the suspected had disobeyed the court by failing to honour summonses. This forced the court to issued a warrant for their arrest. The lawyer further noted that only two of nine suspects in the murder had been apprehended. “The whereabouts of the other
suspects are still unknown." Shimaka also revealed that the bereaved had been threatened by people who may have taken part in the crime. “The family lost their breadwinner
and emotions are still high. The court has powers and discretion to deny
them bond depending on circumstances," he added. State counsel Erick Masila asked the
court to grant him seven days to respond to the bond
application as he had not received the investigations report. He also sought orders for the accused
to be remanded to Shimo la tewa prison. The case will be mentioned on February
