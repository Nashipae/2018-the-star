Kenyatta National Hospital has unveiled clinical guidelines to
curb growing cases of resistance to antibiotics. The
guidelines will provide a standard practice platform for
all KNH health workers responsible for the dispensing and
application of antibiotics. They were developed by infectious disease experts at KNH
in conjunction with Andrew Seaton - a Scottish-based antimicrobial specialist. Loice Ombajo said the guidelines will be used by physicians, clinical pharmacists, and nurses. "With
the development of these guidelines, KNH is now well positioned to
standardize clinical operations relating to antibiotics
administration," Ombajo said on Friday. "Such standardisation remains a critical component towards improving
patientsâ€™ outcomes and reducing the incidences of antibiotic
resistance." There are concerns most of disease resistance as most Kenyans buy drugs at pharmacies without a prescription from clinical workers. Seaton maintained that the overuse of antibiotics is harmful because it causes resistance. Click here for the latest political news
