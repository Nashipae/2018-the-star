Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has tasked a multi-agency team to investigate all the grabbed public property and lands. The governor on Saturday said the team will come up with a report naming all land and property grabbers. "My administration and the multi-agency team is working round the clock in the investigations. We shall soon release a review report," Sonko said. He spoke after meeting Wairimu Mwangi, an elderly woman from Kariobangi North, who sought his intervention in a 21-year land dispute. The governor, during the campaigns, pledged to restore sanity in the city and repossess all grabbed public property. He promised to fight corruption and dismantle cartels behind the land grabbing menace. Lands CEC Wachira Njuguna said the county is committed to the plan. The county administration is also in talks with experts towards the construction of modern garbage recycling plant at Dandora. "We highly believe that many youths will be employed once this plant is complete," Sonko said in a statement. "We are focusing on service delivery. Nothing will thwart our aspirations. We want every resident's life to improve." The governor further added that he has set up an emergency team who will deal with the effects of the expected long rains. "The experts and emergency teams will deal with flooding, disease outbreaks, and displacement," he said. "We are set for heavy rains. We have already started clearing clogged drainage systems," Sonko added. Click here for the latest political news
