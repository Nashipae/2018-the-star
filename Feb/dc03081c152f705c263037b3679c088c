Before I start my open letter to Bongo star Diamond Platnumz, I would like to let you all know that all the clubs Nema closed down have been opened. These were Kiza Lounge, Jiweke Tarvern, Space lounge and B Club. Nema has given them a clean bill of health after they fully complied with all its requirements. No more police raids enjoy your month of love in peace. Now, to get back to Diamond's drama. He has been caught pants down many a times. And I was like Nigggagggah! This is an open letter to Diamond Platnumz. The little braaaah from Tandale en his larger than life attitude because of his music. They say Sir Jah never gives you everything busy and in Platinumz case his talent is unmatched but...before women become his downfall. As a baby father, player and certified Raverend I have been branded the bad boy of Nairobi. But that has not stopped me from being a good human being to my baby mamas and my children. Dear  Diamond, "You are not the first one to become a super star, and you won't be the last. So if you want to have affairs, do so in secret. Remember that Zari Hassan has grown kids who are watching and reading about your dalliances and they bidding their time patiently waiting for a time when you won't be in their mother's life. Disrupting it, disrespecting her and making her sad. Right now, hands down you have a high SMV (sexual marketplace value). You are all the rage, handsome and have the money. Your social media appeal proves it all. Not to mention the headlines you grab, weekly.
