An eight-month-old baby is recovering from two panga cuts allegedly inflicted by his uncle during a squabble with his father. The baby was taken to Rangwe Sub-County Hospital in Homa Bay after the incident at  Kamidigo village in Kasipul constituency on Thursday afternoon. His uncle Jonny Odhiambo is accused of attacking him after quarreling with his father Jack Otieno about Sh1,000. Witnesses said the quarrel resulted from Odhiambo's refusal so share the money with his brother - this was their payment from ploughing a villager's farm. One said the two engaged in a " bitter exchange of words" before the fight turned physical. “People thought Odhiambo had retreated but he later emerged with a panga from his house and slashed the baby twice on his thigh as he slept." Area Assistant Chief Harrison Ogigo said the man turned wild when he was asked to share the money. “It’s unfortunate that the two decided to go physical after disagreeing over a minor issue." The baby was rushed to Nyawita Health Centre but was transferred to Rangwe as his condition worsened. “The baby’s condition deteriorated so he was transferred for further medication,” Ogigo said. The administrator reported the matter to police who arrested the suspect. Ogigo said angry villagers had surrounded Odhiambo’s house with the aim of beating him up and then killing him. The Assistant Chief said they did so after the man allegedly insisted he would kill the baby at the hospital. “We arrested and took him to Oyugis police station. We condemn all acts of mob justice." The uncle will be arraigned once investigations are completed. Click here for the latest political stories
