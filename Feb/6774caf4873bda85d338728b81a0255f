A petitioner seeking to legalise female genital mutilation wants public discussion on the case stopped. Dr Tatu Kamau (pictured), who has filed her case in a Machakos court, yesterday said the discussions are likely to prejudice her case. “My petition is about whether we should consider consent for adults in the female circumcision matter,” Kamau said. The court allowed nine interested parties, who had applied to be included in the case, to file their submissions within 21 days. They include Amref Health Africa, Equality Now, Federation of Women Lawyers Kenya (Fida), Centre for Rights Education and Awareness Africa, Katiba Institute and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The others are Samburu Girls’ Foundation, Msichana Empowerment and the Kenya Women Parliamentary Association. An elder from Nandi county, Kiplangat arap Koech, also asked to be included. The parties want the Chief Justice to constitute a bench to hear the case due to the wide public interest it has attracted. Justice David Kemei said there is need for a bench to be constituted, but did not make a determination on the matter. Sofia Leteip, representing Equality Now, said the case had elicited global interest because FGM is widely practiced. She said FGM is still practiced in 21 African countries. This is despite the African Union resolving that the practice is “unAfrican”, because it is harmful to women. The case will be mentioned on April 19.
