Members of Parliament on Wednesday approved the nine nominees for appointment as Cabinet Secretaries. The session was entirely a Jubilee affair as opposition MPs boycotted the sittings. The approval now paves way for President Uhuru Kenyatta to appoint the officials who will join their other Cabinet colleagues who were re-appointed. The nominees are Margaret Kobia (Public Service and Youth), John Munyes (Mining), Farida Karoney (Lands), Peter Munya (East African Community), and Monica Juma (Foreign Affairs). Others are former DPP Keriako Tobiko (Environment and Forestry), Simon Chelugui (Water), former Marsabit Governor Ukur Yatani (Labour) and Rashid Achesa (Sports).

"It is not about the PhD you have or the prestigious university one attends," he said. This was in reference to Achesaâ€™s academic qualifications which have sparked varied views from Kenyans across the country. The MPs appeared to follow in the footsteps of the vetting committee which totally avoided questioning Achesa about his academic background.
