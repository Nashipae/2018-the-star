The UN Security Council has unanimously approved a resolution demanding a 30-day ceasefire in Syria. The 15-member council voted to allow aid deliveries and medical evacuations in conflict areas. It follows a week of intense bombardment of the Eastern Ghouta rebel enclave by the Syrian government. The vote had been delayed several times since Thursday as members struggled to come to an agreement. Russia, an ally of Syria's government, wanted changes. Western diplomats accused Russia of stalling for time. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres previously said the situation in the Eastern Ghouta was like "hell on Earth". The US envoy to the UN called for the ceasefire to be implemented immediately.
