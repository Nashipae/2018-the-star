A 50-year-old businessman from Ihithe village in Tetu constituency yesterday hung himself thinking he had killed his wife during a quarrel. Maina Maranga allegedly slashed his wife Susan Wanjiku with a panga and she became unconscious. Thinking he had killed her, he hung himself. Locals took Wanjiku to hospital. Maranga ran a matatu business in Nyeri. Police boss Job Lesinikwa said Maranga could have hung himself for fear of being lynched by locals. A neigbour said the couple quarrelled constantly. Wanjiku was admitted at Nyeri Outspan Hospital in critical condition. Marangaâ€™s body was moved to the Nyeri Referral Hospital mortuary. There has been a rise in couples injuring, and in worst case scenarios, killing their partners following arguments.
