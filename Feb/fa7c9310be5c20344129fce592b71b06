Scientists
are using the goat grass weed to help
improve breeding
of wheat. Researchers
from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center have
developed a number of wheat varieties
by crossing wheat and
grass. The
goat
grass is considered a weed in some countries. In
a paper published in Nature Plants yesterday, researchers stated
that genes from goat grass contribute to the tolerance of wheat to
cold and diseases, hence wheat
is able
to grow in many parts of the world. “Understanding
the complex genetic features of goat grass could help develop new
wheat varieties that adapt to climate change extremes and diseases,”
said the authors. Kenya
produces below 500,000 metric tonnes of wheat annually against a
consumption of one million tonnes according to data from the Kenya
Bureau of Statistics. The Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research
Organisation, Food Crops Research Centre in Njoro states that besides
the
unstable weather conditions, wheat production in Kenya is
constrained
by widespread use of recycled seed by farmers, and the resultant
prevalence of the wheat stem rust (Ug99) diseases
such as wheat stem rust and while subdivision of land hinders
efficient
wheat farming. Professor.
Rudi Appels, a co-author of the paper said as the world's
population
increases
and
the climate grows more extreme, it is important to be able to produce
wheat varieties which can survive and thrive. “The
availability of the genome sequence for goat grass provides further
opportunity to explore and understand the properties which help wheat
improvement,” he said. Wheat
is the second most important cereal in Kenya after maize and
it is mainly
grown in Narok, Nakuru, Njoro, Timau and Uasin Gishu areas.
