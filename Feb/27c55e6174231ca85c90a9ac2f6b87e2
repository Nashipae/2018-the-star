Mwingi North MP Paul Nzengu has promised to initiate development projects and enhance service delivery after the conclusion of a court case that challenged his election. The petition that was filed by former MP John Munuve was dismissed by Kitui High Court judge Lillian Mutende last week. “They went to court to challenge your unanimous decision to elect me but failed because the petition was malicious,” Nzengu said on Saturday. Speaking in Kavang’o village in Tseikuru, Nzengu praised the court for upholding the decision of the electorate.He said the petition had caused disillusionment among residents. “I’m now invigorated and ready to serve you all without fear or favour,” Nzengu said. The MP was speaking at the funeral of 86-year-old Katite Mutemi who died last week. “All Mwingi North residents are my people regardless of whether they voted for me or not. It is time to focus on development because the elections are now behind us,” he said. Nzengu promised to improve education standards in Kavong’o. He said the area has the lowest number of learners transiting to secondary schools. “It is sad that only a few students proceed to university. I will ensure that we have more learners joining universities by 2022,” Nzengu said.
