Ten pupils from Bridge International Academy, Majengo Mapya in Likoni, Mombasa are among 28 from Mombasa to represent Kenya in Under-14 Sky Blue Taekwondo Championships in Rwanda this weekend. The 10 qualified after taking part in the Korean Ambassador’s Championships in Nairobi late last year and impressed the judges. Bridge International Academy, Majengo Mapya head teacher Andrew Mwambingu said they will travel to Rwanda on Thursday by road. “We got an invitation in late December to take part in the Rwanda edition of the Korean Championships this coming weekend,” said Mwambingu. The Bridge International Academy team includes eight boys and two girls aged between nine and 13 years. It will be captained by 13-year-old class 7 Mwinyi Bakari. The school has 24 pupils doing taekwondo but only 17 are active and take part in competitions. Parents of the team members will cater for the upkeep of their own students. The team’s patron Asha Kui, however, called on well wishers to chip in and support the team. “We will be travelling by road but my worry is the children will get tired and may not perform at optimum level. If we get sponsors who can help us get air tickets we will be grateful,” said Kui. Mombasa Taekwondo Association, through chairman Crispin Mwadime, has also been trying to source for funds to help the 28 pupils from Mombasa get sponsorship for their trip.
