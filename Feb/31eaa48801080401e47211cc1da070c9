Kipkelion Coffee Mills has launched two brands by two women’s groups - Kabngetuny and Kapkiyai. The Zawadi and Champion brands were launched in Kipkelion West subcounty in a ceremony attended by Nandi Deputy Governor Julita Cheruiyot. The women’s groups have 480 farmers - 330 from Kapngetuny and 150 from Kapkiyai. They got certification from Fair Trade Africa. Since its launch 10 years ago, Kipkelion Mills has grappled with middlemen who buy beans at throwaway prices and sell them at exorbitant prices elsewhere. Roasing has declined from one million tons per year to 600,000. The mill serves farmers from Kericho, Kisumu and Nandi counties. Mill founder and former Kipkelion MP Magerer Langat urged farmers to engage in proper crop husbandry for better yields. Unlike many parts of Kenya whose soils have been depleted, South Rift region still has potential for coffee farming.
