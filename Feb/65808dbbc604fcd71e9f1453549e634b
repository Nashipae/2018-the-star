A Kuria woman whose hand was chopped off using a panga by her husband has refused to leave the hospital for fear of her in-laws. Maria Roba Musa lost her left hand and doctors worked hard to save the other through surgery at St Joseph Mission Hospital in Migori town two weeks ago. Her husband Musa Matiko Gisiri from Tarang’anya Village assaulted her on January 18.

She said that already her in-laws, accusing her of victimizing their son have taken all her household items. “My children have also run away from our home, I need them to be safe with me, but in a different place,” Maria said. Maria said her life remains in danger as long as the culprit is not arrested and charged. “I need to have him answer before a court why he chose to make me disabled,” she said. She was speaking to the Star at the hospital bed on Thursday where she called on well-wishers to help her get another home to take care of her children. Her daughter, Elizabeth Ghati Musa said their family has broken down as her mother was the sole breadwinner. Ghati said they experienced hostility from their home and going back there was not safe for them. “Our father is still at large, we hear he is in Tanzania but he may come back to finish what he started if we go back to our home,” she said. Vincent Were, a social worker at Ombo Hospital, asked well-wishers to come to the aid of the woman and her children as her family has abandoned her. Maria owes the hospital Sh42,650, a bill which increases daily by Sh600.  Click here for the latest political news
