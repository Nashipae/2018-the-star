The Bloggers Association of Kenya has gone to court to stop the prosecution of Embakasi East MP Babu Owino. The association questions the validity of sections 77 and 94 of the penal code under which Owino has been charged. General Manager Jane Gachango argues the sections violate the right to freedom of expression and “could be used to charge bloggers, journalists and online activists.” Babu was charged last December with subversion and offensive conduct conducive to breach of peace. He is alleged to have uttered the words, “kama Gadaffi alitolewa na wananchi, kama Gbagbo alitolewa na wananchi, kama Yahya Jammeh alitolewa na wananchi, wewe ni nani? Wewe ni mtoto wa mbwa”. The remarks are allegedly calculated to excite disaffection against the presidency. The MP is alleged to have uttered the words in Dagoretti North on September 24 last year. Section 77 prescribes a mandatory imprisonment of up to seven years for “any words with a subversive intention, prejudicial to public order, the security of Kenya or administration of justice.” The association argues that Section 94 criminalizes free expression in a public place or at a public gathering. The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and the Attorney General have been named as respondents while Paul Ongili alias Babu Owino and article 19 of East Africa have been named as interested parties in the petition. In a circular dated December 8, Kinyua said this is in line with the Electiion.
