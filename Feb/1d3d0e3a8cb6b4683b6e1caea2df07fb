Stop early campaigns and focus on development, Endebess MP Robert Pukose has urged Trans Nzoia politicians. He said development will be derailed if politicians concentrate on 2022 succession campaigns. Pukose said some politicians have been crisscrossing Trans Nzoia to popularise their 2022 bids at the expense of development. “It is time for development, not campaigns. When the time comes, we will tell you who to support,” he said. It is said Pukose is uncomfortable with several visits his Kiminini counterpart Chris Wamalwa is making to his constituency without his knowledge. According to the law, official campaigns should be conducted three months to the election after candidates are cleared by the electoral agency. The main position the politicians are said to be focused on is that of the governor.
