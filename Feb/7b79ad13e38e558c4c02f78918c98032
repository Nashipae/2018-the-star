The head of the AIC in Kenya Bishop Silas Yego has praised Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu for her exemplary public service over the years. Speaking during a fundsdrive at Kitui AIC church on Sunday he said Ngilu has served well in various dockets in the Cabinet. “She worked performed as a minister. I know she is a leader who can be relied on,” Yego said. He said because of the experience she has gained over the years, he was optimistic Kitui was in good hands with Ngilu as the governor. “She is a very unique leader. Her lifestyle tells it all. I pray that she will continue showing us the way,” Yego said. Ngilu pledged to work with the church to uplift Kitui. She said any government that doesn’t recognise the church was poised to fail.
