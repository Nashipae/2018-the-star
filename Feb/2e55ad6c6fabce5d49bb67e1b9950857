Lawyer Miguna Miguna has been arrested in a dramatic fashion at his Runda home in Nairobi. Police used force to break into his house before arresting him after a brief standoff. Miguna was arrested days after he and Ruaraka MP TJ Kajwang administered an oath to opposition leader Raila Odinga at Uhuru Park. Kajwang was arrested on Wednesday. He is also the self-declared 'general' of the outlawed National Resistance Movement. Earlier, Miguna reported that an "assassination squad" is looking for him at his home. Text messages believed to be from him state: "They have arrested me. They have bombed my house and broken everything. They are still here. "They are searching all rooms. It’s an assassination squad. I can’t speak. They are still here ... looking for me." More on this: Miguna claims arrest amid Raila oath crackdown  More to follow
