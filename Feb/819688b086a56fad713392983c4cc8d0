Tana River Governor Dhadho Gaddae Godhana has threatened to sack all revenue collection officials . He said it would be difficult to work with a team that cannot bring revenue to fund county programmes. Speaking in Hurara Tana Delta subcounty on Friday Dhadho wondered why Tana Tiver was collecting a paltry Sh29 million monthly while other neighbouring counties such as Kilifi and Kitui are collecting more than Sh600 million and Sh1 billion, respectively. He said there was a lot of revenue supposed to be collected from livestock, motorcycles, charcoal, gypsum and salt business. Godhana suspects the low revenue collection is due to corruption . He has vowed to transform the department to boost the revenue generation.
