New county commissioners have taken charge in Baringo and Elgeyo Marakwet in a security reorganisation by the state to help deal with insecurity in Kerio Valley. In Baringo Henry Wafula will replace Peter Okwanyo, while in Elgeyo Marakwet Abdullahi Hiddi will replace Fredrick Ndambuki. The two counties are among those hard hit by banditry. The changes were announced by Interior CS Fred Matiang’i on Monday. He however retained administration chiefs in most counties in the North Rift. Turkana county commissioner Seiff Idi Matata and West Pokot’s Apollo Okello have retained their positions, while Erastus Mbui will now be in charge of Trans Nzoia. Uasin Gishu’s Abdi Hassan, who has played a critical role in stabilising security, has been retained, while Mohammed Barre has been posted to Nandi.
