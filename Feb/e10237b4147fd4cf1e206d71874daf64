Mandera Knut branch has threatened to withdraw teachers working along the porous and often dangerous Somalia border. Branch executive secretary Mohamed Sheikh yesterday told reporters teachers in Lafey sub-county are a soft target for al Shabaab terrorists. Sheikh called on communities living along the border to protect non-local teachers. He said teachers in affected areas will be posted to schools near towns where security has improved. He condemned the recent Wajir attack that killed two teachers and a woman in Qarsa Primary School last week. He said the union will not sit back and see more teachers dying. “We are tired of sending condolences. We will act to protect teachers in terror-prone regions,“ Sheikh said. “We will withdraw all our teachers working in Lafey sub-county due to its proximity to the Somalia border if local communities and the government do not assure us of security,” he added. Sheikh said the current wave of attacks on teachers is a strategy by the militia to instil fear in schools. However, he criticised the call by leaders from other branches to recall teachers from Wajir, saying it is misguided and lacks foresight. “Recalling teachers will make children stop schooling and become vulnerable to radicalisation. This is in direct support of terrorism,” he said. Sheikh said schools in secure regions such as Banisa, Takaba and Rhamu sub-counties are facing an acute shortage of teachers.
