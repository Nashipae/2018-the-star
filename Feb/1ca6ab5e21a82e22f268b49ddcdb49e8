Four people were butchered by suspected al Shabaab militants at a school in Wajir County on Friday morning. Reports indicated they were ambushed at around 1 am as they slept at Kharsa Primary School. The school is inÂ Kharsa village near Konton border town, which is 70km from Wajir town. The victims were three non-local teachers and the wife of one of them. It was also reported that several other teachers were injured and that some students were missing. They fled during the attack. The road leading to the area is believed to have landmines, making it difficult for ambulances and security reinforcement to quickly go to the scene. County AP commandant Mohamed Sheikh is leading the rescue operation. Click here for the latest in local politics
