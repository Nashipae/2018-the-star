Elders in Nandi have intervened to resolve a land ownership row pitting Lands CS Faridah Karoney and the family of a former MCA. She said she bought the land in in Sironoi village last year from Linus Kogo. The elders have asked Karoney to pull down a fence, which her workers erected on the land. The Talai Council of Elders, who are respected as Laibons in the Nandi community, on Wednesday met to discuss the matter. They said workers sent by the CS fenced-off 34 acres, instead the 16 acres she says she bought. Of the 16 acres, the Korir family is claiming it owns eight acres. Police on Friday last week used tear gas to disperse hundreds of villagers who attempted to block fencing of the land as directed by a court. This was after Karoney sought orders to access the land also being claimed by the family of former MCA Amos Korir. The elders said even the 16 acres the CS claims to have purchased were owned by two families. The Korir family is said to have lived in the land for more than 50 years. “We condemn the force and violence used against the family of Korir by those who fenced off the land,” council vice chairman Christopher Koiyogi said on Wednesday. He said Karoney workers fenced-off more land that they should have. “We want that fence pulled down before that areas is interfere with because that will have serious consequences,” Koiyogi said. Karoney has in court papers said she bought 16 acres and the public can confirm details of the purchase transactions in the Lands Registry. But the elders said the Korir family genuinely owned part of the land fenced-off. “The Talai Council of Elders had on October 6 last year settled the same land dispute between Kaptitomet and Kapcheptile families. They each got eight acres,” a statement by the elders said.
