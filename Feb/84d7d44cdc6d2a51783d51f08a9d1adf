President Uhuru Kenyatta has eulogised Buuri MP Mugambi Rindikiri's father as a patriotic and courageous Kenyan who stood for truth and justice. Mzee George M’Murwithania died last week after suffering chest complications. He was 97. In a statement to newsrooms on Wednesday, Uhuru said he was a well respected and humble man who had a singular sense of duty to his family, his community and the nation. “We
will fondly remember Mzee M’Murwithania alongside other icons of the
freedom struggle who were ready to lay down their lives for the sake of
our country’s independence," he said. During the rule of the colonial government, the man was jailed and his livestock confiscated for supporting the independence struggle. The President also praised Mzee M’Murwithania for his leadership, saying he exhibited great skills when he served as chairman of the Njuri Ncheke Council of Elders in Kibirichia Location, Meru County, as well as a representative in the wider council. “He was a man of great insight and unique leadership qualities," Uhuru said, further describing him as an illustrious son of Kenya who played a crucial role in the country’s liberation struggle. The President further noted that Mzee M’Murwithania devoted much of his wealth and time to helping community projects, especially building of churches, schools, water projects and cattle dips in Kibirichia and the larger Meru County. Uhuru hopes Rindikiri's inspirational life will remain a great legacy to his family, his community and the nation. He said M’Murwithania’s legacy and commitment to community development will be remembered for many years to come. "As we mourn and pay homage to this visionary leader, let us also celebrate his life and achievements," he said and prayed for strength and grace for his relatives and friends.
