Car wash owners in Garissa town have protested a decision by the county government to close down their premises. They accused the Garissa Water and Sewerage Company of malice in closing down the businesses, saying they were not given any notice about the move. Thirty car wash owners affected by the closure said they will incur huge losses. Led by Ahmed Abdullahi, the businessmen said they had borrowed loans to set up their premises. “We are in shock that GAWASCO just decided to closed down our business without any notice or reason for their actions," Abdullahi said. He said the closure will affect many people because the sector employs hundreds of youths. The car wash owners accused the water company of discriminating against them. Car wash operations at petrol stations were not affected. Abdullahi said the have been paying monthly fees to the water firm. They have asked Governor Ali Korane to intervene. GAWASCO public relations officer Ali Awdol said they only disconnected illegal water tapping by unscrupulous business owners. He said car wash owners have been paying similar subscription fees with households, despite using large amounts of water at their premises. Awdol told the affected businessmen to apply for new licences. He said car wash operations were affecting drainage. “We are determined to crackdown on illegal water tapping. We will also be going for irrigation firms that are illegally connected,” Awdol said. He denied the discrimination claims, saying petrol station owners had complied with all requirements. “We want to bring sanity to the water sector. Everyone will pay for every drop of water they use to ensure efficiency,” Awdol said.
