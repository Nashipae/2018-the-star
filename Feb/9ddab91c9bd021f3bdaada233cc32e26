The High Court in Kisii will on February 28 deliver a ruling on a petition challenging the election of Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tong’i. The court dismissed an application for scrutiny and recount filed by petitioners Zaheer Jhanda and James Kenani. Former MP Chris Bichage is the first petitioner. The application by the petitioners had no basis, the court said. The application was filed on January 17 when parties in the petition had tabled evidence. “There is no way the court can allow an application for scrutiny and recount which was filed at the tailend of the hearing of the petition,” justice Herman Ndung’u said.
