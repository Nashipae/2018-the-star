Elgeyo Marakwet farmers have been asked to stop burning on their farms during the dry season as fire spreads to forests. They are preparing for the maize planting season and burning husks from the previous harvest. The area is experiencing strong winds. “Fire may spread to forests and lead to degradation,” Agriculture executive Shadrack Yatich said yesterday. He spoke in Iten town. He urged farmers on the Elgeyo Marakwet-West Pokot border, which is prone to banditry attacks, to sell their livestock at market prices. This follows reports that farmers are selling valuable merino sheep at Sh1,000 each for fear of losing the animals to rustlers. There have been attacks in Kamelei and Kipsitona villages.
