Outgoing Lands CS Jacob Kaimenyi has been criticised for upholding land leases issued by the ministry without the input of the National Land Commission. Last month, Kaimenyi, in an advertisement, said all leases and titles issued by the ministry since 2012 when the current land laws were enacted are valid. NLC commissioner Abdulkadir Khalifhas told Kaimenyi off, saying all leases issued without the endorsement of the commission are invalid. Khalif said the ministry's declaration means all irregularly acquired public land whose titles NLC has revoked will be valid. He said schools, forests, national parks and other public lands have been left at risk of grabbing by private developers because their leases and titles cannot be revoked. “They have been exposed to invasions by organised criminals and possibilities of double allocations," Khalif said. Khalif said vulnerable land owners in Nairobi, whose leases are due for extension or renewal might not get justice because the documents were being intercepted and falsified by fraudsters and their accomplices in the ministry. He faulted the government's digitisation of land records, saying it was being used to protect land grabbers. "The land information system is still a far fetched dream for Kenya because digitisation of records is being used to facilitate extensive land fraud," Khalif said. He asked the ministry to work with the commission to establish accurate and reliable land information system that is free from digital manipulation. “Otherwise all officers and fraudsters who facilitated land fraud will continue to operate with impunity," Khalif told Kaimenyi in a letter dated January 18. The commissioners gains made in the land sector have been reversed by stalled reforms caused by numerous amendments to land laws.
