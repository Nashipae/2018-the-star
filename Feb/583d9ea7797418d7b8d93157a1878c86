Sam West may be becoming more of a household name, since his foray into the comedy industry. The Hero Radio CEO has been in the radio industry for five years. He has been growing his regional station and making loads of money while at it. The man has also been able to snare one of the industries' most attractive media personalities, the musician Vivian. He has not been silent about expressing his love for her. He did so with a Sh400,000 engagement ring. So one would expect that after such a public announcement, people would recognise Vivian's fiancee. But that was not to be. "When we go out, fans come running to Vivian asking for a selfie with her. They even ask me sometimes to take the photos," he said.
