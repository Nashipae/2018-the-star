Kenya Ports Authority women’s coach coach Anthony Ojuku believes they have what it takes to sweep United States International University out of the play-off semi finals this weekend. KPA host the student in Mombasa for Game Three and if need be Four and Five. Unbeaten KPA won the opening two games 77-38 and 60-29 respectively in Nairobi last week. “We will surely finish them when they come to Mombasa. I expect the series to end in Game 3. This I am sure,” predicted Ojukwu after two easy wins against the former champions last weekend. KPA will rely on Felmas Adhiambo, Annerose Mandela, Brenda Angeshi, Betty Kananu and Georgia Odhiambo, who punished the “Flames” with a polished display. The other games on card at the Makande Welfare hall will see reigning men’s champions KPA host Co-operative Bank of Kenya. This fixture was thrown into chaos last December when the bankers failed to honour the two matches. KPA were given a 2-0 advantage. In Nairobi, former national champions Ulinzi Warriors meet Blades in what should be a cracking pairing. The series are deadlocked 1-1 after the soldiers took Game One 56-45 before falling 60-56 in Game Two. It will once again be a battle hardened duel between the soldiers sharp shooter Eric Mutoro and the students high-flying scorer Emmanuel Soja. The duo set the tone last week. A lower division match up will see Strathmore University play Masaku Sparks, who won game One 34-33 before being felled 48-42 in Game Two. The sinners will play Footprints in the finals.
