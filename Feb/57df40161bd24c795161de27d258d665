Hundreds of Embu residents grumbled in court on Wednesday when it was ruled that the report on the governor votes recount will be sold. Supporters of governor Martin Wambora and former senator Lenny Kivuti jammed the High Court, some sitting in the dock and the witness stand. Groups arrived hours before justice William Musyoka who reported at 3.30pm for the mention of the case and receipt of the report from deputy registrar Vincent Nyakundi. They had eagerly waited for the report thinking it would be easily available. After Musyoka arrived, lawyer Ahmed Abdullahi shot up, introduced lawyers from both sides and noted they were in court to hear the report and know the way forward. But the judge said he would not read the report. "After the scrutiny of votes, the deputy registrar compiled his report which he launched at the registry today. It will be available to you at a fee,” he said. The people were disappointed as they had debated the possible contents of the report in person and on social media. The judge further ruled that he will make his judgment on the petition filed by Kivuti on February 21. Parties will make their final submissions on February 13 from 2.30 pm. On January 18, Musyoka ordered the recount of votes cast in the August 8, 2017 general election and the scrutiny of results entry forms. He said there had been inflation, swapping, doctoring, and stealing of votes.
