Pastoralists in Kajiado county are reducing the number of cattle they keep and rearing more goats and sheep, which better withstand drought and diseases. Most farmers have lost half their cattle in the ongoing drought, which has lasted since last year. The long rains outlook released last week by the Meteorological department paints a gloomy picture. The Met said most parts of the country will receive poor rainfall. To avert more livestock losses, many farmers from Namanga and Loitokitok are now turning to sheep and goats. James Leposo, a resident of Loitokitok, Kajiado county, on Friday said he lost 112 cattle worth about Sh4.5 million to a deadly disease. Speaking during a field visit, Leposo said the disease killed 15 animals per day. The animals developed swollen legs and diarrhoea. The animals fell sick after he grazed them at Kiya near Mt Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Sh500m boost Stephen Sadara, a village elder from Namanga, said, “Goats are easy to sell in case of an emergency or need for money, unlike cattle. “It is easy to sell 10 goats for Sh5,000 each than to sell one cow at Sh40,000 and, therefore, many of the community members are opting for goats, which are more profitable.” Dr Hezron Wesonga, from the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation, said they are carrying out research on the diseases killing cows in the region. He urged field officers not to make any diagnosis on observation alone but to back it up with laboratory research. Wesonga said research to develop multiple vaccines is underway to help reduce the time and cost of vaccination by a quarter as well as treat many diseases. Dr Monica Maichomo, director of the Veterinary Research Institute, said sufficient investment in the multiple vaccine research would help improve on delivery. Animal health research in sub-Saharan Africa recently received a Sh500 million boost from the UK government through the International Livestock Research Institute.
