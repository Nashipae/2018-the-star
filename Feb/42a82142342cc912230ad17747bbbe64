A man alleged to be a cousin to Jubilee Party secretary general Rafael Tuju was yesterday charged with threatening to kill the former Rarieda MP. Appearing before Nakuru senior principal magistrate Liz Gicheha, Richard Aketch (pictured) denied the charge. He was accused of threatening to kill Tuju through a short mobile text message. “Do not set foot in your motherland. In case you come, please come with an extra coffin,” reads the text according to police. The message was sent to Tuju on February 2 after the two had exchanged a series of mesages. Aketch fled to Eldoret upon realising that police wanted to arrest him. He was arrested on Friday by Flying Squad officers. Prosecutor Hillary Songoyo told the court that the investigative officer had told him to suspend bond terms for the accused person since the investigations are not yet completed. “The message was sent through electronic means (phone) and the forensic experts are yet to finalise investigations,” Songoyo said. Aketch’s lawyer Steve Kabita opposed the request to deny bail to his client, saying it was his constitutional right. “The accused person has already surrender his phone and pin to the officers. He has also recorded a statement and he is not a flight risk because he has no intention to leave the country,” Kabita said. He asked the court to summon Tuju, saying the two exchanged words. Kabita said his client had been denied food, adding that police also blocked Aketch’s family members from seeing him. The court allowed police to detain the accused until February 9, when the case will be mentioned.
