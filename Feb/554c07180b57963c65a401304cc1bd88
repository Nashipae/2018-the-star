Parliament will seek to ensure the price of a two-kilogramme packet of maize does not exceed Sh115.National Assembly Committee on Agriculture, Livestock and Cooperatives chairman Adan Ali on Friday said the House will take to task all state departments at the Ministry of Agriculture to ensure the price remains constant. Speaking after being elected unopposed, Ali said his committee will not allow Kenyans to be subjected to manipulation by rogue millers. “The price of ugali will not go above Sh115 and in the event this happens, we will obviously summon the state departments in charge to answer questions,” the Mandera South MP said. “I recently heard the CS saying the price of a 2kg packet of maize meal will not go above Sh115. We will oversight this ministry effectively.” Read : Unga prices to rise to Sh200 as another shortage looms Mid-this month, then Agriculture CS Willy Bett sought to assure Kenyans there are sufficient maize stocks to ensure prices are not hiked. “Millers are also becoming businessmen, but we don’t want them to overstretch their business acumen. With profits and everything else loaded in, the price of flour should never exceed Sh115 per two-kilogramme bag,” Bett said while on a tour of the Galana Kulalu irrigation project. Adan said the committee will from Monday start gauging the state departments under CS Mwangi Kiunjuri’s docket for effective oversight. “I want to assure Kenyans that we will move fast to bring to bear all challenges affecting the ministry. We will interrogate all state departments by comparing their performance against their set targets,” he said.
