Singer Cece Sagini and photographer Victor Peace are married. Cece says once they knew they were about to take things seriously, they decided to take sex off their plans. She said: "By the time we met, we knew that we weren’t playing, and we knew how serious we took our relationship, so how about we don’t mess up this thing by going in that direction?" This is what we call marriage couple goals! Cece said she would get friends who would ask her, "Girl, what if the sex will not be what you have always hoped for? What if he is boring in bed?" Her simple but loaded answer was: "There is a greatness in the anticipation. I know a lot of people usually ask ‘What if the sex is not good? Will you go back home?' But if you are married, you guys fix it up."
