Police are looking for a NASA supporter who allegedly tried to shoot at a police vehicle before Raila Odinga's unofficial swearing-in on Tuesday. The man was in a black leather jacket. "We have launched a manhunt for a man captured on CCTV cameras, aiming a firearm at a police vehicle with intent to fire on Tuesday, before the NASA event began at Uhuru Park," read the tweet by the National Police Service Commission. "A cash reward will be offered to any person with information that could lead to his arrest," the NPSC added on Thursday. This comes just a day after Interior CS Fred Matiang'i accused NASA of plotting a massacre of its supporters with the intention of blaming police. Matiang'i claimed the coalition wanted the crime committed on live TV, necessitating the shutdown of Citizen, NTV and KTN. Shortly after declaring the National Resistance Movement a criminal group, the Interior minister spoke of a "well-choreographed attempt to subvert or overthrow the legally constitutional government of Kenya". "Many Kenyans might not be aware of this but we can tell you there was going to be a blood-birth, a massacre or catastrophe was going to happen there," he told security chiefs on Thursday. He added some opposition supporters were armed.

Since then, Raila has asked his supporters to boycott products and services by companies including Safaricom, BIdco, Haco Industries and Brookside Dairies. Matiang'i noted the country is grappling with serious insecurity issues in line with provocation and bits of incitement. But he added the service has realigned its operations and coordination structures to facilitate proper service delivery and protect all Kenyans.
