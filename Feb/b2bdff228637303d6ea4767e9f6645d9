Three mentally ill patients disappeared and another, who was in remission, relapsed after county officials raided and closed the Eden Rehabilitation Centre in City Park last Friday. Eden treatment director Tony Njeru yesterday said another three patients were seen wandering around City Park , but another four, who were in stable condition, returned home. There were 15 recovering addicts at the time. Others were transferred to a guesthouse in Ngara and another group to a facility in Parklands. “We’re trying to find out where the three are. It is a hectic task. We just don’t know why the county did this to us and to the poor patients,” Njeru said. Governor Mike Sonko on Sunday said the organisation was given a fake allotment letter by officials of the Evans Kidero administration. The raid has caused an uproar after county officers carted away property in a lorry and handcuffed patients. Members of the public have accused City Hall of “inhumanely evicting the patients”. Njeru said the officers destroyed everything, including medicines.
