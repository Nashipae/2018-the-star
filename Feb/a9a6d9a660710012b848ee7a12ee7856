Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has said the Kikuyu community has made an irreversible decision to back DP William Ruto to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022. Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi hinted that the search for Ruto’s running mate was on, but a decision would be made at the right time. “I know Kenyans are anxious to know who will be the running mate, but a decision will be made at the right time,” Sudi said. Kuria said no one will go against the decision which he described a sure bet. Kuria said the Kikuyu community will not renege on the decision because Ruto has been steadfast in supporting Uhuru. “If there are people who may want to abandon Ruto, perhaps it may be the Kalenjins. As for the Kikuyu, we decided long ago.” The Gatundu South lawmaker said the guaranteed support for the DP is to the Kikuyus like a cheque in Ruto’s name. “You know Kikuyus have money and our cheque cannot bounce. In the place where the amount is written we have clearly indicated President 2022 and that is automatic. The cheque is with me and I will deliver it in 2022 so he can cash it.” Read:Kikuyus have made irreversible decision to back Ruto in 2022 - Moses Kuria He spoke at St Andrew’s Kipkenyo in Eldoret, where he was with area MP Sudi. “Ruto means what he says and says what he means. He is a reliable leader,” Kuria said. He said in 2022 Jubilee will win more easily because the DP has worked to unite Kenyans and enjoys countrywide support. “The other contenders recently tried to take Kenyans to Canaan, but they don’t know where it is. One of them thought it’s in Bondo, the other in Bungoma and the third thought it is in Vihiga,” Kuria said. Sudi said leaders from Western should unite so that the DP can consider picking a running mate from the region.
