Muhoho High School has unconditionally re-admitted the student who allegedly stole a loaf of bread from the dining hall last week. The form three student was suspended last Thursday and ordered to report back with 1,000 loaves of bread as punishment. But Kiambu County Education Director Ali Abdikadir directed the administration of the Gatundu South school to discipline in line with rules and regulations. “The child will not have to pay outstanding fees or buy loaves of bread as claimed in the letter suspending him,” Abdikadir said on Monday. The school's deputy head teacher had directed the student to clear his fee balance on the day he would report back. The official had said the loaves would cater for all students. Abdikadir further urged the institution to take the learner through guiding and counselling so he can shun bad behaviour. "In education, discipline [results from] a set of rules and regulations that remind students of the proper code of behaviour," he noted. "Without learning and [ensuring] discipline in school, [students end up paying the price] later in their careers." Click here for the latest political news
