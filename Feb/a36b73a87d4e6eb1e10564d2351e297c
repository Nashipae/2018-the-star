Guardian Angel is a lot of things. Beside his exploration of God, which is influenced by his own personal encounters, his music brings him out as a prodigious and pyrotechnic artist. He has donned many forms in his past releases, transcending from genre to genre with ease. While his relationship with God and religion play a huge role in his lyrics and sound, Guardian wants potential audiences to experience his creative diversity. As much as he wants to remain cool for school, he doesn’t shy away from trying out different sounds like he did on “Manukato Ya Sifa”, which features Ali. It is tracks like “Liwe” and “Amazing Grace” that crossed him over to the mainstream scene without him having to compromise his faith. He has constantly found himself fishing for the current trends, and his hooks have constantly given us something to have on our religious playlists. It’s unfortunate that an artiste of his level of endless brilliance is hardly acknowledged for his contribution. He has great command of his vocals and knows how to effortlessly get soulful tunes, like his latest drop “Swadakta”. Instead of settling on one style of music, Guardian Angel decides that for every single song, he can try out something radically new: refusing to settle down into something predictable. His lyricism, bold stance and soulful delivery make for brilliant music creation. He knows how to create heartfelt tunes that find peace in the midst of struggle. He works through his situation, truckling to radio trends, offering the music scene impressive, inspirational tunes. The argument of his potential is undeniable. But for Guardian, considering what unfolds from his releases, the greatest value of his music is to inspire hope and deliver the word of God. And he does so in the most fashionable way possible.
