Taps in Jomvu have dried up after water pipes were destroyed during construction of the Mombasa-Jomvu highway. Vendors are making a killing by selling water at high prices. They are selling a 20-litre jerrycan for Sh60, up from Sh20. MP Badi Twalib on Tuesday said residents have gone for weeks without water. The Kenya National Highways Authority awarded the Sh6.5 billion tender to the Third China Engineering Company. The project is funded by the African Development Bank and the government of Kenya. Work on the 10km Mombasa-Jomvu stretch is going on. The Mombasa-Jomvu section is the first phase of the project to turn the 41km Mombasa-Mariakani road into a dual carriageway with six lanes. The construction of the superhighway is expected to take two and a half years. The road starts at the junction of Kenyatta Avenue and Digo Road in Mombasa CBD and runs to Makupa area and to Changamwe. The road then runs through Changamwe, Mikindani junction, Kwa Jomvu, Miritini, Mazeras before ending beyond the Mariakani Weighbridge. The ruined water pipes compound the water problems in the constituency that already is under water rationing. Twalib said no notice was issued in regard to the destroyed pipes. “Previous works in my constituency involving KeNHA were well-coordinated and residents were informed in advance of any action that might affect them,” he said. On Wednesday, KeNHA Coast regional manager Jared Makori was unavailable for comment. Calls went unanswered and an SMS was not responded to. Twalib said construction should not be delayed. “They should speed up the process as Mombasa is the East and Central Africa gateway,” he said. Twalib also urged contractors to employ residents. “There will be no economic sense if those who build these roads are hired from elsewhere while Jomvu can provide the required labour,” he said.
