The unique identifier registration system by which every child is given a number for life upon first joining school, using a birth certificate, is commendable. This will rid the education system of frauds who use others' certificates to procure jobs. Such claims have been rampant, raising questions on the integrity of some of our state officials. But on the flip side, many Kenyans are not born at health centres or hospitals where birth notifications are issued. As a consequence, many parents have experienced difficulty registering their children under a very rigid deadline, which has been extended to next month, as they grope around for birth certificates. This brings to fore the need for simplification of the process. We support the Garissa Knut branch and school heads’ appeal to remove the ongoing issuance of birth certificates to the region’s six sub-counties (see P35). This should be done nationwide so that all births are notified and registered at the county level. Anyone giving birth in Kenya should notify a chief for the birth certification process to kick in as part of our national statistics. The government should reach out to the remotest and most far-flung parts of the country where statistics such as births are rare to find. These measures should be concluded before next year, when Kenya conducts the decennial National Census, after which our statistics should be watertight.
