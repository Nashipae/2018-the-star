The government has been urged to allocate enough funds to help curb the spread of armyworms in Nakuru county. County Agriculture executive Immaculate Maina on Tuesday said the region has lost more than 70, 000 acres of maize due to invasion of the worms. She said the invasion also made farmers to incur losses due to high cost of pesticide and labour.“We lost more than 30 per cent of our crop last year. Continuous use of pesticides also had effects on the environment and on pollinators such as bees,” she said.Spoke during a workshop on combating the worms in Nakuru, Maina said farmers and county governments should over the years employ indigenous ways which do not require use of chemicals to fight the pest.Maina also added that farmers should be trained on the responsible use of pesticides to minimize exposure to harmful effects to human and environment.“We are working with the national government and partners in devising strategies for early warning and rapid response to any other emerging pest in future,” she said.She said the county had trained and dispatched a technical team apart from working with research institutions on enhancing knowledge to help manage the pest.Food and Agriculture Organization Kenya representative, Gabriel Rugalema said massive awareness, scientific approaches, adequate funding and taking a regional approach was required in controlling the worm. “We can't underestimate the fact that yield loss due to the worms contributes to food insecurity especially when we are being faced with frequent droughts,” Rugalema said. He said FAO had released funds under the Technical Cooperation Program to counties for awareness through information and advocacy campaigns.The organisation and the national government are in the process of  distributing 500 fall armyworm pheromone traps to farmers for surveillance to facilitate timely and effective control actions and  minimise avoid crop losses. The worm was first reported in 2016 and has spread fast across African countries. Only Wajir, Mandera, Isiolo, Lamu, Garrissa and Marsabit counties have not reported fall armyworm outbreak.
