Kenya has been urged to adopt modern technologies to end the vicious cycles of drought and emergencies. The Vision 2030 Delivery Secretariat yesterday said drought and emergencies risk undermining the gains made. Secretariat director general Julius Muia said ending drought and emergencies has for a long time become a tall order. “Climate change is one of the issues that the country has to contend with. Rain seasons have become less predictable and temperatures are rising,” Muia said. He said extreme weather conditions have made life difficult. This, he said, has escalated into conflicts in some parts of the country. Muia said the Secretariat, through the Medium-term Plan, is keen on addressing drought and emergencies,  one of 24 sectors being focused on. “We are cognisant of the fact that even in the Sustainable Development Goals, the issue of climate change has been identified as one to be dealt with by mankind,” he said. Muia spoke in his office in Nairobi, during the signing of an MoU with the Kenya Climate Innovation Centre. The two organisations will collaborate on sustainable development initiatives with the aim of actualising Agenda 2030. He denied claims the Lamu coal plant will contribute to pollution, saying latest technology will be used. Kenya Climate Innovation Centre initiative CEO Edward Mungai said they are looking into ways to make Kenya resilient to climate change. Mungai said they are concentrating on renewable energy, agribusiness and water management. The Centre is an initiative of the World Bank and funded by the Danish government.
