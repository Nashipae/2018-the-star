Sports and Heritage Cabinet Secretary nominee Rashid Achesa only underwent basic formal education, a report on his vetting has revealed. According to the report by the Committee on Appointments, the former ODM national youth chairman went to Shibale primary school between 1990 to 1997. The report says the nominee told the committee chaired by National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi that he dropped out of school for lack of fees. "That though his academic credentials show that he only underwent basic formal education, his professional training and experience in sports and entrepreneurial and resource mobilisation are impressive," the committee says. The report is set to be discussed in a plenary after which those whose nominations will be approved will be forwarded to the president for appointment. Achesa's nomination was unveiled by President Uhuru Kenyatta when he announced changes in his administration on January 26.
