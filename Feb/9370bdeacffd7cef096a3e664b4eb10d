Three players have been recalled to bolster the women’s national sitting volleyball team ahead of the World Para-Volley Championships’ last chance qualifier in Jeju Island, South Korea between March 27 and April 1. Mary Olongo, Jane Ndenga and Agnes Akoth have been named in the final team of 12 who will report to camp next Friday. The Kenyan team will be seeking to win tournament and gain the sole slot up for grabs. This is after the outfit missed a ticket at the Africa showpiece in Kigali, Rwanda, where they finished third. Head coach Vitalis Ojukwu recalled Olongo, Ndenga and Akoth to his lineup to replace Esther Asega, Beth Wanja, and Lillian Atieno Leanne due to their experience at the international stage. “My changes were informed by the need of light enough players with swift movement on court, which the trio possess in addition to their experience,” said Ojukwu who is also the overall volleyball (both conventional and para-volley) tutor at Kenyatta University school of Sports Science. “For this crucial tournament, I could not make several changes in a team that finished third (behind Rwanda and Egypt) at the African qualifier because then I would not know the kind of performance to expect from the team,” he added. The other players are Sylvia Aliero, Purity Mweni, Dorris Atieno, Florence Manza, Rahel Akoth, Jackline Odiwour, Linet Achieng, Gladis Osinda and Edna Mweni. Kenya Para Volley Federation opted to field the women’s squad due to their performances in Kigali.
