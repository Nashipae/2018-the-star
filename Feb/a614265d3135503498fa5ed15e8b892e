Bishop Hannington Khuduru Primary School in Matayos, Busia county, is seeking help to improve its infrastructure. Teacher Polycarp Makatiani yesterday said they relieve themselves in the bush for lack of enough toilets. “It is very unfortunate that we share the toilets with the pupils, worse still it is not roofed. We have portioned the two rooms using a mat,” he said. “When desperate, we seek assistance from the neighbors around who at times see us as a bother and lock us out.” A classroom under construction has stalled, despite Sh600,000 being injected into the project. Lack of water is another major challenge posing a health hazard to the pupils and teachers. Every Friday, the teachers cancel two afternoon classes and send the pupils to look for water. The water is used to smear mud and cow dung on the classroom walls. Some classrooms have been partitioned using mats. The school has 175 pupils. It was registered last year as a government school and has six teachers employed by the TSC.
