Environmentalists want to stop the hiving off of 100 acres from Nairobi National Park for construction of Phase 2A of Standard Gauge Railway. On Friday last week, China Road and Bridge Corporation moved about 40 workers and their machines inside the park under heavy security and cordoned off a section near East Gate. This was in readiness to build the line through the park, despite a pending stop order. This week, the contractor is expected to cordon off a 3km stretch inside the park, as conservationists plan a protest march against the contractors and proponents of the project for defying court orders. “We are still consulting but we plan on moving to court to have that gazette notice quashed, because it was issued in disobedience of an already existing court order and ongoing contempt proceedings against proponents of this project,” said Sidney Quantai from the Kenya Coalition for Wildlife Conservation and Management. Other than the contempt proceedings against top officials of Kenya Railways Corporation and the CRBC, the organisation and activist Okiya Omtata have at least four other cases against the construction, one at the National Environmental Tribunal and three at the Environmental and Land courts. The latest suit will be the fifth. CRBC project coordinator Jasper Liu said they had started construction inside the park, but pledged there will be minimal disruption to the wildlife and ecosystem. “We are just complying with contract and instruction from our employer, which is Kenya Railways. We moved in after getting official approval from KWS and KR,” he said. In January, despite protests from private land owners demanding compensation and proper land acquisition procedure to be followed, contractors took over property of residents of Tuala that borders the park on the West, Rankau, Nkoroi, Duka Moja, Suswa and Ngong Hills. The project will also see 40 acres of Oloolua forest hived off for the construction.
