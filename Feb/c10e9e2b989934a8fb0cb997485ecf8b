Upcoming gospel artiste Ben Libe has accused against Kaymo of "Thitima" fame of conning him of Sh6,000, late last year. Ben says he approached the gospel star requesting a studio session. He paid Kaymo the money on December 27, but two months later, he is yet to get any material out of it. "It hurts me a lot that those artistes at the top use us instead of supporting us. I visited him at his studio and played him some of my sample songs. He liked one. Kaymo then said he would make the song even better, and that's when I paid him Sh6,000 via Mpesa for the recording. However, since then, he has been evading me," Ben said. "At first, he was saying he is busy. I understand artistes are busy because they have shows, but this does not add up. He never picks my calls and even seems to have blocked me since my calls are not going through. I would like to call out these big artistes who are so full of themselves and keep on taking advantage of us upcoming ones. I even wonder if he really does gospel music for legitimate reasons because honestly, he should not have done this to me." When I reached out to Kaymo, he denied being a con. "I sent Ben the instrumental. After that, he was not satisfied with it. He said it does not sound good. So I told him to visit me at the studio, we redo it, and he did not come," he defended himself. But Ben reiterated, "I just want him to refund me since he is not able to honour his word. A big artiste like him cannot lack 6k."
