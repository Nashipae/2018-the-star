Nurses in Taita Taveta have blamed poor health services on lack of modern equipment. Boniface Mrashui, the county’s nurses’ union secretary, said many health centres lack basic equipment and hardly receive medical supplies. “We are willing to improve services, but our efforts have terribly failed because the county government has turned a deaf ear to our demands,” Mrashui said. “In some cases, we are forced to refer patients to either Coast General Hospital in Mombasa or to Makindu Hospital in Makueni county.” He blamed the government for failing to repair the X-ray machine at Moi Referral Hospital and the CT Scan  machine in Wesu Subcounty Hospital. Mrashui said nurses are demoralised because of working in deplorable conditions. KNUN chairperson Halima Hassan said rural health facilities are the worst hit by shortage of drugs, water and laboratory reagents. She said a huge gap was created when 20 nurses contracted by the previous administration left. Hassan urged the government to employ more nurses to reduce their heavy workload. “There have never been replacements of those who left. The remaining nurses are overwhelmed,” she said. Health executive Frank Mwangemi however denied the claims, saying the county government has bought enough drugs since November last year. He said the department is in the process of recruiting more nurses and health workers to address the deficit. Mwangemi said engineers from a South African company have already assessed the broken CT scan. “There is only one spare part we expect them to fix before mid-March. From there, we shall be able to use the machine,” he said. Mwangemi urged union officials to be professional and desist from inciting health workers, and instead work closely with the administration to address their challenges.
