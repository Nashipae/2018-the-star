The Law Society of Kenya has warned of a possible due to the shrinking media space and disregard of court orders. LSK chairman Isaac Okero yesterday criticised the government for ignoring court orders, saying the move sets a dangerous precedent. "It is extremely alarming when it is the government that willfully disobeys the law. The state should demonstrate, by example to the citizens, the importance of adhering to the law for the preservation of a constitutional democracy," Okero told the Star on the phone from Dar es Salaam. Last week, human rights activist Okiya Omtatah was denied entry to the Communications Authority offices in Nairobi where he went to serve a court orders directing the agency to suspend the shutdown of TV broadcasters. Okero said it will be impossible for citizens to obey the law when the government shows blatant contempt for the same laws."By violating the citizens' fundamental rights to receive, impart and disseminate information and the freedom of the media, the government is exhibiting the characteristics of a dictatorship and sowing seeds of anarchy leaving its own existence at risk," Okero said. Okero said there exist a strong correlation between freedom of expression, political stability and freedom of the media. He urged judges to issue orders that are specific to those who bear personal responsibility to facilitate ease of service and avoid the use of layers of government security to frustrate receipt of the order. The LSK boss said the orders ought to make clear natural persons within the arm or agency of government concerned who will bear personal responsibility for the failure to comply. He urged the courts not to fear while following through the consequences of noncompliance. Click here for the latest political news
