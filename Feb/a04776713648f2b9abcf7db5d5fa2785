The Raila Odinga-led NASA coalition will from this weekend be calling on Kenyans to disregard President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration. NASA National Assembly Minority leader John Mbadi yesterday said they will lead Kenyans countrywide in to civil disobedience. Speaking to the media at Parliament Parliament, he and 14 opposition lawmakers said the Jubilee administration has set a precedence of disobeying the law by trampling upon the Judiciary. “Kenya is a democracy and not anarchist. If this trend does not stop, beginning this weekend , we will ask law- abiding citizens to stop obeying these laws, stop cooperating with law enforcement agencies and stop cooperating with the state and its agencies,” Mbadi said. They said Uhuru’s administration has clamped down on the media, intimidated NASA leaders, cancelled their passports and defied court orders. “When the state stops obeying the law, it’s time for citizens to follow suit. It’s time for civil disobedience,” the Suba South MP said. Mbadi said self-declared NRM “General” Miguna Miguna was illegally deported in violation of Articles 14, 16 and 17 of the Constitution. He the state is also targeting MPs Simba Arati and Babu Owino. Read:Drop economic boycott plan, Governors tell Raila Click here for the latest political news
