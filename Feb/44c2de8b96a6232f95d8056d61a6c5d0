Bungoma county Maendeleo Chap Chap chairman Ken Wanjala, known as Mkombozi, yesterday urged Bungoma MCAs to work with their speaker to deliver in their oversight and legislative role. He said in Webuye that it was unnecessary for MCAs to start threatening to impeach speaker Emmanuel Situma, who has been in office for barely six months. Last week, there were claims on social media some MCAs were collecting signatures to remove Situma. Mkombozi said it was too early for MCAs to claim the speaker will be a puppet of the executive. He urged them to “serve residents wisely.”
