Days after TV legend Swaleh Mdoe claimed he is flat broke, another TV news icon is in the doldrums. Louis Otieno is in need of financial help for his medical treatment. "As you all may be aware, Louis has been unwell and in and out of hospital, being treated for acute pancreatitis. During one of his admissions, Louis lost his hearing. Efforts to fix it have failed," read a statement from the Louis Otieno Medical Fund Committee, adding that he has been incapacitated. "After consultations with doctors, it was agreed that the only way the hearing could be fixed was by having a procedure undertaken in India called Cochlear implant. The committee is also planning a harambee to support Louis." To help out, send your contributions to paybill number 333957.
