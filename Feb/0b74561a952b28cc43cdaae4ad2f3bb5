Exchange of guns for livestock is fueling banditry in the Kerio Valley, Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos has said. The illegal business involves people seeking to arm themselves, leading to misuse of illegal arms during attacks. “There are too many guns in the wrong hands, fuelling banditry that has led to the deaths of more than 150 people since last year,” Tolgos said at a peace meeting in Eldoret town yesterday. Those who attended the meeting included politicians, clerics and professionals from Pokot and Marakwet.
