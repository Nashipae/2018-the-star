Most health centres in Kisumu are understaffed and have inadequate infrastructure, according to a report by Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. The survey dubbed ‘the Right to Health’ focused on accessibility, availability, acceptability and quality of health services in the respective facilities. The findings are from health facilities in Kisumu East, Kisumu Central and Seme sub-counties. It revealed that most of the county’s health facilities lacked adequate infrastructure and were ill-equipped hence jeopardizing efforts to provide quality and timely health services to the residents. Speaking during the launch of the report, Jedidah Wakonyo, a commissioner with KNCHR said they discovered that a lot of attention was needed for efficient management of public health services within the county. "We also witnessed huge shortages of maternal facilities and patient beds in the hospitals which is causing a lot of suffering,” she said. Wakonyo said it is the right of every citizen to access quality and comprehensive health care. She further said the study showed that there was irregular supply of drugs leading to shortages and cases of patients being referred to buy the drugs from private chemists.
