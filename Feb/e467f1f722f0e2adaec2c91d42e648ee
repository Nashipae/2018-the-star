Health officials in West Pokot on Friday ordered Kacheliba primary school closed for lack of latrines. Paul Kipkoech, Suam ward public health
officer, said the school failed to honour a 14-day notice to bid other pit latrines. The official said he issued the school management with the
notice on January 31. "The notice expired on February 14 and we
cannot put lives of children at risk," he told journalists. The school was ordered to
build 17 pit latrines for boys, 8 for girls, treat bedbugs in the girls dormitory, and ensure proper waste disposal. The officer said the notice did not affect standard eight pupils. "They
will be in school until they are done with the registration for the national
exams," Kipkoech said. Head teacher Emmanuel Komolle said the school has already started digging new toilets. He said they were given a short notice and they were
not able to dig latrines for over 1000 pupils in the school within the
stipulated time frame. "We hope to reopen in a weekâ€™s time since we have began
setting up new structures," Komolle said. Click here for the latest political stories
