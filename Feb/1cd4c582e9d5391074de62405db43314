Embu leaders have differed on the nullification of Governor Martin Wambora’s election, but urged residents to avoid ethnic politics and incitement. On Thursday, the High Court annulled Wambora’s election in a petition filed by former Senator Lenny Kivuti. County leaders have separately called for unity and a stop to bitter wars on social media between Wambora and Kivuti’s supporters. Senator Njeru Ndwiga yesterday told residents to be calm and wait for the outcome of Wambora’s appeal. Heightened politics is not good for the development of the county, especially considering Wambora has decided to appeal the ruling, he said. “At the end of everything, we shall have a governor — even now we have one. Let’s go about our businesses as usual,” Ndwiga said. “The judgment should not divide the Embu people. Kivuti had the right to go to court for redress and Wambora has the right to appeal.” Woman representative Jane Wanjuki warned residents against allowing themselves to be divided along ethnic lines — the Waembu and the Wambeere. She said God put the two communities together to live harmoniously and they must respect that and ensure peace prevails — whatever the outcome of the legal process. Njagi Kumantha, who was a governor candidate at the August 8 election, welcomed the ruling. He said the election was bungled and he is ready to enter the fray in case of a by-election. Kumantha called for unity among residents. Embu Chambers of Commerce chairman Samuel Kanyi urged the courts to fast-track the appeal so residents, especially traders, have a peaceful environment. The Reverend James Mugo of the Great Commission Centre urged locals to keep the peace.
