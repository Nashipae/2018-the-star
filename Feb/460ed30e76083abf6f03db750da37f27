United States International University of Africa (USIU-A) Spartans’ coach Willis Okeyo is optimistic of his sidemaking an inpact as they debut at Africa Cup of club championship later this year in Nigeria. USIU-A secured second place in the women’s Premier League, thanks to a barren draw against Strathmore University Scorpions last week that saw them qualify automatically for the annual event. The team coached by Willis ’Awilo’ Okeyo, will now play their last match of the season against Mombasa Sports Club next weekend at the City Park Stadium to seal their second position. Following the development, the students will join regulars and national champions Telkom, who failed to defend their title in the just concluded Africa Club Championship after going down 1-0 to Ghana Revenue Authority in the final in Accra, Ghana. The student have 47 points—10 behind leaders Telkom, who have a match in hand against MSC. Strathmore settled for the third position with 43 points and will miss the event they recently participated and finished in the fifth position. Okeyo, who had a exchange program with Bad Kreuznach Hockey club in Germany last year, said consistency has been their secret weapon this season. Kenya Police and national team midfielder said they now have to start early preparations for both the Africa club show and the league. “The ladies deserve the accolades. They have been consistent the whole season and the end results justifies it. We now have a chance to make our first appearance at the event and hopefully, we will leave a mark.” He added: “We intend to recruit one or two more players to beef up the squad and show our worth against teams in the continental event when the time comes but all in all, I am delighted with the development.”
