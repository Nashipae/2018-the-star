Tusker Mattresses is leveraging on its Mavazi Clothing store to increase revenue with two new stores in its Eldoret and Kisii branches. The two stores developed at an estimated cost of Sh120 million will increase the retailer's clothing store network to 10 in the country. Tuskys Group CEO, Dan Githua said the retailer planned to roll out at least 25 such stores countrywide by the end of this year. “We are moving to plug existing market opportunities in various categories including the lifestyle clothing segment. Backed by extensive feasibility studies and the pilot rollout of the first few Mavazi stores, we remain confident that the new stores will provide much needed leverage to secure our market position.” Githua said in Eldoret. The Mavazi stores will stock clothing items, shoes, baby-wear and related accessories, sourced both locally and internationally. Early this year, the retail chain took over the space occupied by troubled Nakumatt supermarkets in Eldoret and Kericho at a coat of Sh220 million.
