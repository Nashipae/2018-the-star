Early this year, Sharon Mundia a.k.a This Is Ess had to deal with public scrutiny after her marriage deteriorated. She, together with her ex hubby, Lonina Letaipan are yet to comment on the split. They have kept mum. But for Sharon, her life has to go on and it includes vlogging. In her recent vlog, Sharon talks about her work that includes being a social media influencer. Sharon revealed that she is learning to enjoy Instagram again. The fashion blogger's Instagram was like her picture journal of her life. When her whirlwind romance with Lonina began, everyone was checking out her profile page to see what they are up to. The couple was the talk of town when Lonina's proposal broke the net and trended for weeks. "I feel like I started off being in love with Instagram and I just fell off at some point and then I got back and I was trying to understand it. It is like coming back to a relationship. It is like, does it work? Are we still compatible? Does it feel right?" She added, "And now I'm really getting into the groove of things. I'm really enjoying it."
