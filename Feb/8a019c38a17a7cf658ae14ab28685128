AFC Leopards playing unit has been slammed for a sluggish home display against Madagascan side Fosa Juniors in the CAF Champions League on Sunday where they surrendered a 1-0 lead to draw 1-1 at Bukhungu Stadium. Team manager Gilbert Selebwa termed the performance as awful and a let down to the fans, who had thronged the facility in their hundreds. Selebwa accused the players for ‘not showing up’ in the entire match and vowed to get answers before the team jets out for the return leg. Selebwa said the result was a disappointment despite camping in western Kenya for a week to acclimatise and work on their best first eleven. “We are very much disappointed with the result after making proper prior preparations. The whole team did not turn up for the match. All departments were not clicking at all and we must say sorry to our fans who turned up to support us. I cannot lay blame on an individual or the management for the draw, it’s the players to shoulder the blame. We will be getting solutions in the course of the week and we are confident of good results in the return match. We will play attacking football and pile pressure on them and we will be through to the next round.” Selebwa also wants the club management to fast-track the acquisition of the required documents for Salim ‘Shittu’ Abdalla and Erick Bekoe, who missed the first leg. “We really missed the two. Salim is a good defender while Bekoe has been the top scorer for the Ghanaian league twice. I urge the management to get the documents ready for the return leg. Their contribution will be highly relied upon.”
