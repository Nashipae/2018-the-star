Killer alcoholic drinks are returning to Kiambu county, despite efforts of the government to fight it, psychologist Gladys Chania (pictured) has warned. She said on Friday that the dangerous wines and spirits are being sold to youths as early as 7am, making them waste their day staggering or sleeping near the roads in trading centres. “When the dangerous drinks were destroyed by the government four years ago, there wasn’t any meaningful activity they were directed to,” she said. “The drinkers started looking for somewhere they could buy it, no matter how far it was. The sellers realised their customers were thirsty and started carrying it in college bags.” Society needs to have a strategy that will keep heavy drinkers engaged in productive activities, Chania said.
