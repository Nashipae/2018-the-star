Some 95,757 people in Turkana and Marsabit counties last month received malaria control interventions, a Unicef-Kenya report says. The move was to contain an outbreak that killed 30 people in October last year. The report says of the number, 15,321 were children aged below five years. Some of the measures included indoor residual spraying, distribution of insecticidal-treated nets and education on behaviour change. “The control interventions are part of a continued response in the war against malaria outbreak and to halt any resurgence in Turkana and Marsabit counties,” the report says. The worst-hit areas were Dukana, North Horr, Illeret and Loiyangalani wards. There was also an outbreak in Tiaty subcounty, Baringo county. Lack of blood, medical supplies, government funding, shortage of health workers and poor regional security have undermined the war on malaria. The report indicated that of the total number of those reached, 41,684 people in 6,008 households in Turkana were protected from malaria and leishmaniasis, through indoor residual spraying. Leishmaniasis is a devastating parasitic disease that is transmitted by small biting sand flies. It kills 95 per cent of untreated patients. A total of 31,897 long-lasting insecticidal nets were distributed in Turkana, protecting 54,073 people from malaria and leshmaniasis. In addition, 186 educators in Turkana county were trained and engaged in door-to-door communication. “As a result of Unicef’s rapid response to the malaria epidemic in Turkana and Marsabit counties, there has been a sharp decrease in the malaria caseload and the outbreak has been contained,” the report reads.
