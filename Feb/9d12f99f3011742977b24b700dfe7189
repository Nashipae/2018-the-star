Migori youths on Tuesday barricaded roads to press for Miguna Miguna's release from police custody. The latter was arrested last Friday following his role at the unofficial inauguration of Raila Odinga as the people's president on January 30. The youths said they will not allow any form of harassment of opposition politicians by the Jubilee administration. They used boulders to block the Migori town bridge, which is the main link to Tanzania, and lit bonfires.  /COURTESY Public service vehicles plying the route were forced to seek safety in estates and at Migori police station. Traders closed shop in fear of looting. The youths waved twigs and placards saying they stand by Raila's decision to be sworn in. "We will also stand by him (Raila) and his supporters against police intimidation," Jared Okinti said. Okinti said they will only remove the boulders after Miguna is set free as ordered by the court. They said any arrested politician should be charged before a court of law instead of being held for long in police custody. Miguna was released on a Sh50,000 bond on Friday before the police detained him.
