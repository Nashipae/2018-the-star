Gospel artistes cannot serve two masters at a time, an upcoming artiste in Mombasa has said. Rosemary Akinyi said singing is a calling and not a business. “It is good to stick to your call,” she said. “I like singing because I feel it is a calling by God, others just sing for fame.” Akinyi has released three gospel songs and is focusing on
releasing her first video next month, and even more music meant to inspire people
and bring them closer to God. She said being a widow with four kids has been difficult, since she must juggle her career with motherhood. “As a singer, I want to reach my
goal as an artiste, but I also have to raise my kids,” Akinyi said. She said many different artistes are being misused, as rich
people use their talents but don't give them a cent at the end of the day. Another problem in the industry is that many people prefer other songs to gospel music, she said. Akinyi named the late Angela Chibalonza as her
inspiration and role model.
