Njogu a former Kenya Open Junior champion lost the first set in his quest to sail to the finals but his resilience and reaction earned him victory in the second and third sets. The hard-fighting Njogu dropped two games in the second set where his might serves and skill of handling returns saw him restore parity. Proceedings in the third set were similar to those of the second set where Njogu eased to the finals in a 6-2 win. Njogu said: “The match was evenly contested he was strong in the first set but I grew in confidence and fought for points. I have played Kabura before he beat in the first leg quarter finals and I think the final will be tough. I don’t want to lose an outcome which he will also be fighting.” Following the win Njogu will confront Kabura in the finals where the Burundian will be aiming to make amends to his first leg finals defeat to India’s Rithvik Bollipalli.
