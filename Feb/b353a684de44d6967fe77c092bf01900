Data on schoolgirls in need of sanitary pads has been forwarded to the Gender ministry to help kick off the free distribution initiative. It targets schoolgirls between the age of 12 and 18. The project will prioritise schools in slums, arid areas and poverty-stricken regions. Sh470 million was set aside. The project will no longer be run by the the Ministry of Educationâ€™s Basic Education department. Basic Education PS Belio Kipsang yesterday told the Star that the Education ministry had provided the required data to help guide the Gender ministry in distribution. The sanitary pads will be given to school heads who will in turn organise to have needy children get them. Kipsang said the new Education Information Management System launched last week will also play a vital role in helping identify needy girls.
