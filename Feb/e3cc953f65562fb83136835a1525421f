Garissa Governor Ali Korane has urged leaders and residents to focus their energy on service delivery saying that time for politics was over. He was speaking in his office after overseeing the swearing in ceremony of the county's PSB chair Ebla Salah, secretary to the board Mohamed Sheikh and the county secretary Abdi Muhumed. Korane said the petition challenging his win was over hence he can now concentrate on service delivery. The Nairobi High Court upheld his election in which former Governor Nathif Jama had moved to court citing massive irregularities during the voting exercise. Korane urged the county officials who have been mandated with various responsibilities to work as a team in addressing the myriad of challenges facing the residents “I am challenging you to rise above clan politics and serve residents without fear or favour. We shall give you enough space to operate and will not allow interference from any quarter,” Korane said. “Remember that you will be held personally responsible for any failures in your docket," he added. Korane urged residents to work with the relevant department in bringing sanity in demarcation and allocation of land. “As a county we mean good for the residents. No one will loose his or her land. There is plenty of land and I don’t see why we should fight and kill each other over the same,” he said. He pledged to work with the national government, aid agencies, and other stake holders to address the issue of drought.
