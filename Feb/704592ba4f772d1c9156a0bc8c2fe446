Education CS Amina Mohamed wants rules applied strictly in colleges to ensure quality learning. She said yesterday that the sector needs tough regulations to ensure quality graduates. Amina spoke when she met Vocational and Technical Training heads. She promised to sustain the reforms her predecessor Fred Matiang’i started. “I know how much work it takes to get our reform process moving. We’ll move forward,” Amina said. The ministry has planned a series of meetings involving top leaders so new state officers can understand its problems and opportunities. All departments have been urged to provide brief on policies, programmes, projects and initiatives.
