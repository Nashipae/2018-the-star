Kenyans woke up to the news that their favourite TV news anchor Swaleh Mdoe is broke and in need of financial assistance, ASAP. Speaking to Word Is, Swaleh said, "Yes, I'm broke and that is a fact of life. I have pressing financial issues that need to be resolved and the bank cannot top up and help me." The Citizen Swahili news anchor has decided to sell one of his kidneys in the hopes that he will get some money in return. Swaleh's phone has been ringing nonstop this whole morning with people calling out of curiosity and some sympathising with his plight. "I cannot even talk to you for long because my phone has been ringing since morning. Everyone is sympathising with my problem but no one has sent even a shilling. Some are asking me to give them a paybill number but I cannot. I don't have the time to come up with one. Others are asking me not to sell my kidney," Swaleh said. Asked why he would resort to such a drastic measure to get money? Swaleh said, "Why go and steal and get caught in the process yet I can sell my kidney. It is not illegal." Swaleh refused to explain what the nature of his financial issue is but insisted that the timelines for his need for the money is "as soon as next week."
