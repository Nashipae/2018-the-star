Each household in Kakamega will have electricity in five years, Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has pledged. He said on Sunday that this was one of his campaign promises and it must come to pass. In this financial year, the county has allocated Sh500 million to the project. Oparanya spoke at Kongoni ACK Church in Likuyani subcounty. He said the county has been neglected by the national government, despite its large population of 2.2 million. It was left out of the Last Mile Connectivity project, he said. The county chief said all households will also be supplied with piped water to reduce waterborne diseases. “We will develop a water and sewerage masterplan and improve the infrastructure,” he said. Kakamega’s pillars of transformation agenda include improving agricultural production, diversifying livelihoods and increasing farmers’ incomes, Oparanya said. They will also focus on infrastructure development to spur economic growth by improving roads. On January 31 while unveiling his new County Executive Committee members, Oparanya said the executive would have the arduous task of delivering on the pledges he made to the people and implement projects highlighted in his manifesto to transform residents’ lives.
