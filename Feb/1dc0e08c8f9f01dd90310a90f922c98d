An ongoing audit has revealed that Laikipia county was on the verge of losing Sh500 million in fictitious claims by contractors and suppliers. Acting county secretary Karanja Njora on Tuesday told a meeting called by the county assembly Public Accounts Committee that of 908 pending bills inherited from the previous administration, 434 had no supporting documents. “The current administration inherited a bill of Sh1.1 billion, which we were expected to pay. Surprisingly, almost half of the claimants do not have any document to pursue the payments. The money they are demanding from us is about Sh500million,” he told the committee. The Daniel Mugweru-led committee had summoned Njora and Finance CEC Murungi Ndai to explain why Governor Ndiritu Muriithi’s administration was delaying payments to suppliers and contractors. Upon assuming office, Muriithi said he would only pay the bills after a full audit established the nature of work done and whether procurement regulations were followed. The audit, though not yet complete, has so far revealed some projects were overquoted and bids were too high.
