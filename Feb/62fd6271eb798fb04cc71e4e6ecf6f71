Medical experts in Mombasa have come up with a new way to encourage early screening for cervical cancer. Self-collection of samples from their reproductive tract to test for human papilloma virus that causes cervical cancer has been mooted as a way of encouraging women to go for early screening. The experts say self-collection of material using the Lancet V-brush may be the way to go. Suleiman Mbarak, a laboratory consultant at Pathologists Lancet Kenya, said on Sunday 95 per cent of women still fear getting a pap smear for lack of privacy. “In Kenya, people go for cancer screening when it is too late. Few, mostly women get tested,” Mbarak said. He spoke during a cancer awareness forum at the Lion’s Eye Clinic hall in Mombasa organised by the Fadlcarda Leukemia Foundation, an NGO which raises funds to help families with people suffering from cancer. Mbarak said Kenyan women should embrace the V-brush kit, which can be inserted into the cervix to collect the samples from the comfort of their homes or offices.
