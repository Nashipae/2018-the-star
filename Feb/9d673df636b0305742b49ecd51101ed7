NASA lawmakers yesterday warned Jubilee against interference with the Judiciary. Addressing a press conference at Parliament Buildings, the 15 legislators led by Minority leader John Mbadi said attacks on judges and magistrates are meant to intimidate them. “NASA is disturbed by the repeated attacks on judges and magistrates by the Executive and leaders of Jubilee Party,”Mbadi said. The latest of the attacks that begun in the thick of elections last year happened yesterday when JP Secretary General Raphael Tuju directly attacked Chief Justice David Maraga.

Tuju, in a letter to Maraga, accused the Judiciary of being pro–opposition in delivering rulings. Tuju also wrote that the courts showed open bias against Jubilee in the run-up to the August 8 General Election. But the MPs said the Opposition will “not stand aside and watch the attacks happen”. They told Uhuru to “defend the Judiciary and the rule of law”.

The attacks undermine the capacity of the Judiciary to apply the law impartially. Mbadi demanded that the judges and magistrates should decide cases without fear, restriction or improper influence. “We remind Jubilee that our hopes for building a strong democracy and the rule of law lie in the independence and impartiality of our Judiciary,” he said. “Launching personal criticism at judges crosses the line.” Read also: Don’t intimidate judges, Maraga tells Uhuru, Raila  Click here for the latest political
