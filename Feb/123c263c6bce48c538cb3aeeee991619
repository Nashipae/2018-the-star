Garissa Water and Sewerage Company is losing more than Sh18 million monthly due to illegal connections, the firm’s managing director Yussuf Mohamed has said. He was addressing the press in his office on Friday after touring four zonal offices the company is expected to open in two weeks. He was flanked by Deputy governor Abdi Dagane and top water firm officials. Mohamed said in the last four years, water meters were tampered with and there was corruption among staff who collude with customers to evade paying their bills. During the tour, the team came face to face with the realities of illegal water connections. Two men were got red-handed connecting water from the company’s line illegally. They were hauled into one of the officials vehicles. They will be taken to court and charged. Dagane said already 90 per cent of all potential customes have been connected to safe and clean drinking water. The remaing 10 per cent will be connected by June this year, he said.
