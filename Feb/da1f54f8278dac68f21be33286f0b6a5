Mandera county Deputy Governor Mohamed Ahmed has asked area communities to help the government end violent extremism. He was speaking in a stakeholder’s consultative forum on counter violent extremism in Mandera town on Thursday. The deputy governor noted lack of structured mechanism in reporting culprits perpetrating the practice is a major challenge hindering the county from fighting radicalisation. The county's proximity to the Somalia border has also been cited as another major challenge.The county is one of the most affected with extremism as many youth are believed to have been lured into joining the militia group. Ahmed called for an end to continued mistrust between security agents and the local community saying it is a big blow in the fight against radicalisation. “Security agents must win the confidence of the local community and stakeholders and read from the same script if we are going to stop our people from joining terrorist groups, “he said. Area county commissioner Kutswa Olaka said the government was keen in bringing all stakeholders on board in line with fighting the vice. He said the aim of calling for the forum was to come together and develop a five-year-plan to be followed in curbing terror activities in the region. Taita Taveta University College Vice Chancellor Hamadi Boga called on stakeholders to come up with amnesty master plan for dealing with al Shabaab returnees from Somalia. The forum which ended on Friday was aimed at mapping out the way forward on dealing with curbing radicalisation in the region.
