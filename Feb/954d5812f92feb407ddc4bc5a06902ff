The Public Service
Commission is working on a partnership with the Judiciary to ensure
cases involving civil servants are solved faster. PSC chief counsel Jacqueline
Manani said a bulk of cases take more that 15 years before they are determined. The delays have led
to those acquitted to lose out on promotions. According to the
Draft PSC Regulations 2018, when
disciplinary proceedings have been
commenced against an officer, the authorised officer may interdict or
suspend the person who has been accused of committing an offence. The new regulations will replace the 2005 Regulations. Offences that may lead to interdiction or suspension are
criminal offences. They include offenses under the Penal Code, and those under the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act, where a prison sentence may
be imposed. However, minor
offences may be disregarded. “When a case
proceeds for 15 or 20 years some of these public officers end up being
acquitted. Some are disadvantaged as they only have a few years
left to work before retirement. They also miss out on promotion opportunities in the
years they have been suspended,” Manani said. He said the
partnership with the Judiciary is important to ensure no gaps are left in the public sector
work places. According to the PSC Regulations an accused public officer's role cannot be taken up by another person until he or she is proven guilty. “Being short of a
single employee in a work station causes a big disruption in the
institution. The Judiciary's intervention will be appropriate in
helping the smooth running of the public sector,” Manani said. In the new PSC Regulations on disciplinary control, the commission outlines that it
may delegate power of dismissal or reduction in rank or seniority of
officers in job groups. “We give all
public officers a right to fair hearing and trial during the cases
and they are represented in court by lawyers before disciplinary
action is taken,” Manani said.  Click here for the latest political news
