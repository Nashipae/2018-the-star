The environmental challenges facing Mount Kenya will be discussed next month during a festival attracting the international community. The Mount Kenya Festival will be held from March 1-11 in the forest and surrounding areas. Donations from events and activities across the week will be made to the Mount Kenya Trust. They will support the projects to protect and conserve the mountain. Donations will also support KWS and local communities. The festival has been organised by Mount Kenya Trust in collaboration with Safarilink, the KWS and African Ascents. Even though Mount Kenya is one of the five major water catchment areas in the country, it faces serious threats. They include of wildlife poaching, illegal logging and encroachment. Mount Kenya Trust executive director Susie Weeks yesterday said the mountain has a lot of value and must be protected at all cost. “We hope this event will not only help raise awareness of Africa’s second-highest mountain, but also give visitors the opportunity to enjoy what the mountain and the local community have to offer,” Weeks said.
