Fifa have stepped up its investigation into the Russian national football team over its alleged part in the national doping conspiracy, with the scandals still threatening to undermine this summer’s World Cup, being hosted by Russia. Football’s world governing body has confirmed that they are now actively seeking co-operation with Russian whistle-blower Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of the Moscow anti-doping laboratory, who oversaw Russia’s doping and who is now in witness protection in the USA having fled in fear of his life. Dr Rodchenkov’s lawyer, Jim Walden confirmed that his client is working with Fifa to help gather evidence against footballers, having previously been immersed in testifying to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against Russian winter sportsmen and women, who are appealing against their sanctions imposed after Russian cheating at the Sochi 2014 Olympics. Walden said: “I do understand from Wada that Fifa have submitted questions. You can understand that for the past several weeks Dr Rodchenkov has been preparing for his CAS testimony. “Now that the CAS testimony has concluded we will pick up questions from Fifa and a number of other federations, which have been forwarded to the Wada coordinator. We’ll respond in due course.” Dr. Rodchenkov has previously told sources close to the many investigations into Russian doping that Russia’s national football teams and their 2014 World Cup squad were part of a system designed to fool testers and protect players from any positive tests. Despite the fact that 28 Russian winter Olympians were last week cleared by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, with 11 having their anti-doping violations upheld though their ban reduced, it is claimed there is much evidence against Russian footballers. Professor Richard McLaren, the independent investigator appointed by the Wada, identified 34 suspect football samples in his initial probe.
