Clifford Kiptarus, an X Class shooter was the surprise package as he finished second overall to Christopher Saina during the Deputy Inspector General shoot at the Defence Forces Rifle Range in Nanyuki. Kiptarus withstood the atrocious wind and mirage to down an impressive 493 points for 23 vee-bulls. With 251 points for 11v in the long range (800m and 900m), and 242 for 12v in the short distances (300m, 500m and 600m), for a total of 493 points for 23 vee-balls to rank second behind Saina’s 266 for 15 vee-bulls in the long range and 247 for 24 vee-bulls in the shirt distances).

Otundo blew his three-point lead at the end of the Deputy Inspector General (Administration Police) Shoot and let fellow Senior Sergeant Saina take a 19-point lead after the Director of Directorate of Criminal Investigations Trophy. Saina was in a class of his own, especially in the long range shoot outdoing 14 fellow SuperX firers. He carded 513 points for 39 vee-bulls to take the lead. Saina proved to be the king of long range shooting as he was the only firer to rake in over 260 points out of the Highest Possible Score of 300 for 60 in the distances. The General Service Unit officer tallied 266 for 15v in the long distances and 247 for 24v in the short stretches out of 300, 60v and 255,51v respectively.
