Three teachers and a wife to one of them were on Friday morning murdered by suspected al Sbabaab militants at Qarsa village near konton border town 70km from Wajir town. The three, who were teaching at  Qarsa Boarding Primary School were ambushed in the wee hours of night at around 1 pm while they were asleep. One teacher, who was allegedly shot in the hand, escaped with injuries. He has since been traced. The militants seemed to have gathered enough intelligence and planted landmines on roads leading to the area. The made it extremely difficult for an ambulance and reinforcement teams to get there on time. The county AP commandant Mohamed Sheikh  led a security team. An other group of officer from Khorot Harar AP camp pursued the attackers. Area MP Rashid Kassim confirmed to the press in Wajir town four people were killed. He said there was urgent need to reinforce police posts especially those on the border, because they are vulnerable to the militant attacks. “We appeal to the state equip officers. If not,  terrorists will continue with their ambushed,” he said. The incident comes a day after four people were seriously injured  after two pastoralist families in Wajir East clashed over water and pasture.
