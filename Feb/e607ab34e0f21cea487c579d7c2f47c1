The High Court in Kerugoya on Wednesday allowed former Kirinyaga Senator Daniel Karaba (pictured) to withdraw with costs an election petition challenging Senator Charles Kibiru’s victory. High Court judge Abigail Mshila ordered Karaba to pay Sh10 million to the IEBC and Kibiru. Each will receive Sh5 million. The judge also rejected an application by three other people who had filed a petition challenging Kibiru’s win. She termed Stephen Karua from Murang’a and Ondieki Nyairo from Kisii county, who had applied to be substituted as petitioners, “busybodies for hire who have no stake in the petition”. Mshila said the petitioner withdrew the case too late in the day.
