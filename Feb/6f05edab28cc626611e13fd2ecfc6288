A motorcyclist accused of kidnapping a two-year-old boy and demanding Sh20,000 ransom will be produced in court today to take a plea. James Kigaa was charged in a Limuru court on Monday, but police asked for five days to investigate. They told Limuru senior principal magistrate Evelyne Olwade the suspect was arrested last week on Friday for kidnapping Mark Gichuru for three days. The boy was found with Kigaa in Kikuyu, when he was arrested. The prosecution asked the court to allow police to lock up the suspect at Lari police station. The request was granted, but police were directed to present him in court today. Kigaa is accused of kidnapping the boy from his motherâ€™s salon in Kimende town, Lari constituency, on January 31. Mother Mary Wairimu said Kigaa sent her short messages that evening, demanding the ransom. She reported to police in Lari. Police, led by DCI boss Mugo Mithamo, traced Kigaa to Naivasha, Elementaita, Nairobi and later in Kikuyu town, where he was arrested. Wairimu says she sent the suspect Sh9,000 using M-Pesa.
