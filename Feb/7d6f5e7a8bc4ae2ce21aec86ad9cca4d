Residents of Kwale county are set to benefit from Sh16 billion Mwache Dam project set to start this year. Speaking yesterday, the officer in charge of the project management unit Simon Mwangi said tenders for the mega project will be advertised in June and bids received in August. Mwangi and said final designs and tender documents will be ready on Friday. Completion is expected in 2022. Governor Salim Mvurya welcomed the project, saying it has been a subject of discussion and its implementation was long overdue and said the community must be adequately involved to avoid delay and ensure smooth implementation. “Transfer of skills, employment,investment opportunities and other  benefits will accrue from this heavy investment. Kwale people should get first priority,” he insisted. The Roller Compacted Concrete Dam on Mwache River near Mazeras will be 84 metres high and 425 metres long. More than 3,600 people will be affected by the project in one way or the other. The government will spend Sh1.4 billion for compensation in areas like land, crops and trees, graves, residential structures, community infrastructure and shrines. Lazarus Kubasu from Kenya Water Security and Climate Resilience said Sh150 million had been given to the National Land Commission for compensation and an additional Sh250 million will be given this year for that purpose, the rest coming gradually. Kubasu requested the county government to help in the acquisition of land ownership documents to hasten compensation to ensure it is completed by April.
