About 23 out of 1,000 children die at birth in Kenya, according to new Unicef statistics. That is slightly below the developing world’s average of 27 and the third highest in East Africa, after South Sudan ( 37.9 ) and Burundi ( 24.2 ). Rwanda is the lowest ranking - 16.5 deaths per 1000 births — followed by Uganda ( 21.4 ) and Tanzania ( 21.7 ). More than 80 per cent of the deaths are due to pre mature birth, labour complications or infections such as pneumonia and sepsis. “Every year, 2.6 million newborns around the world do not survive their first month of life. One million of them die the day they are born,” Unicef executive director Henrietta Fore said. In Kenya, the rate means one in every 44 deaths reported daily is an infant. Other countries in the region are worse off, with Democratic Republic of Congo at 28.8, Sudan 29.4, Ethiopia 27.6, Somalia 38 and Central Africa Republic 42.3.  ‘A TRAGEDY SHROUDED IN SILENCE’ Just as depressing is the number of babies who are stillborn – born without signs of life. Every year, an estimated 2.6 million babies are stillborn, the vast majority in low and middle income countries. Half of the babies who are stillborn are alive at the start of labour. These deaths are typically not counted by public health systems or policymakers. In most cases, stillborn babies do not receive an official birth or death certificate.
