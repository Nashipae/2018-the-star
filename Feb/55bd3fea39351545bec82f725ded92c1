The road commonly known as “slow going”, has shortened the journey from Nyambare shopping centre in Lari to Maai Mahiu by about 20 km. Lari Kirenga MCA Joseph Karichu told the Star yesterday the road used by pedestrians and motorcyclists joins the Maai Mahiu Kamandura highway. thugs’ days numbered He said traders used to hire vehicles to ferry their luggage to Kamandura junction where they would pick other vehicles to take them to Maai Mahiu. The road from Kamandura to Maai Mahiu is 30km, with 19km being surrounded by Ngubi forest. “There are traders who do their business between Maai Mahiu, Suswa up to Narok. Their journey has been shortened,” the MCA said. He said wholesalers, fruit vendors, charcoal dealers as well as local residents stand to benefit. Karichu said the road used to be insecure. But when vehicles and road users increase, people with ill motives will have nowhere to hide. “There is a history of robberies, muggings and carjackings. Criminals cannot continue hiding there. Police will patrol the road. The place will no longer be a hideout for thugs,” he said. Earth movers dug the road which was graveled with stones and murrum. Karichu said Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu will soon open the road official.
