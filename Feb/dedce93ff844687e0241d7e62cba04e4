Leaders in Lamu yesterday threatened to sabotage the Sh2.5 trillion Lapsset project. Led by Lamu East MP Athman Shariff, they have called for dialogue among parties and demanded that their needs be addressed within seven days. They accused the government of failing to honor the initial agreement to ensure residents are given jobs and fishermen are compensated for loss of their fishing zones. The leaders also accused the National Land Commission of duping residents out of of their land in a bid to expand acreage acquired for the project. “The project is in our county and our concerns must thus be taken into account. We shall make their work unbearable,” Shariff said. Mkomani MCA Yahya Ahmed pledged to launch a house-to-house campaign to ensure residents sabotage the project completely. The chairperson of the Shungwaya Farmers Welfare Association, a civil organisation, said they would move to court to stop any further construction until their concerns are addressed. Work at the first three termini at the site are ongoing with the first one is expected to be completed latest by June.
