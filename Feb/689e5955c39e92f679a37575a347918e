The Sh13.5 billion Garissa solar plant project in Balambala subcounty is ongoing and is expected to be complete by
September this year. The project, which is the biggest in East and Central Africa, lies on an 80 acre piece of land and will
consist of 300,000 solar panels and is expected to light more than 200,000 households. The project is part of the long term programme
to replace the expensive and environmental hazardous diesel powered engines. Speaking during an inspection tour at the plant yesterday, the CEO
of Rural Electrification Authority Peter Mbugua said the project
will inject an additional 54 megawatts of power into the national grid as the
country moves towards adopting emerging clean energy technology. The project is being implemented by the government but funded by EXIM Bank of China. On
completion, the power from plant will be connected to the national grid at Raya
sub-station. “We are happy with the progress since we have a target to deliver the project by September. The local leadership has helped us in
achieving this,” Mbugua said. “The project will go a long way in
stabilising power supply in Garissa town and its environs,” he added. Mbugua who was accompanied by engineers from China Jiangxi
International Kenya Limited, said the government was in consultation with other
development partners to expanding the project to Wajir and Mandera counties. This comes barely a year after President Uhuru Kenyatta commissioned the national grid power line from Kindaruma constructed by the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company. There have been frequent black outs in the county as a result of breakdowns by aging diesel powered engines. Garissa has been described as one of the fastest growing towns in the country. With improved security, small scale industrial investors will
have the opportunity to open up food processing industries and boost
irrigation farming along River Tana.
