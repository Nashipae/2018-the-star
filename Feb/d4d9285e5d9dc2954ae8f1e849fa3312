Kisumu residents hit the streets in demonstrations on Tuesday demanding the release of lawyer Miguna Miguna. They barricaded roads with boulders and lit bonfires at Kondele before marching to the Central Business District. The lot chanted "No Miguna! No peace" temporarily disrupting businesses in the lakeside town. They were led by Kisumu speaker Onyango Oloo and Market Milimani MCA Seth Ochieng among other politicians. The procession snaked its way through Jomo Kenyatta Highway, to Oginga Odinga street, and back to the bus stop. Oloo, when he addressed the group, asked the government to release Miguna unconditionally without further delay. The latter was charged with attending and aiding Raila Odinga's unofficial oath on January 30 at Uhuru Park. Miguna was taken to Kajiado law court as his lawyers put a fight for him to be produced at Milimani law court.

"Let them not select few Nasa leaders for arrest but should take all the coalition's supporters who attended the swearing in ceremony." Oloo at the same time told off US Ambassador to Kenya Robert Godec asking him to stop meddling with the countryâ€™s affairs. "Kenya is a sovereign state which governs itself and no country like United States, through its ambassador, should tell people how it is governed," he said. Police were dispersed the protesters with teargas with similar incidents reported in Ahero, an urban dwelling in the outskirts of Kisumu town. Earlier, there were also protests in Migori where youths blocked the road linking Kenya to Tanzania.
