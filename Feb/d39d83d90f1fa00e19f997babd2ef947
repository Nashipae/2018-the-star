Interior CS Fred Matiang’i yesterday told leaders from the conflict-prone Kerio Valley to shun parochial politics and work together to restore peace. He said the region will only have lasting peace if local leaders appreciate the critical linkage between peace and economic development. Matiang’i said the government is committed to doing everything within its power to help find a solution. “It was towards this end that the government recently appointed a special administrator to help shepherd and coordinate peace-building processes in Kerio Valley,” he said during a meeting at his Harambee House office, Nairobi. Matiang’i was accompanied by PS Karanja Kibicho, Deputy Head of Public Service Wanyama Musiambo, Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet, Interior secretary Amos Gatheca and Rift Valley regional coordinator Mongo Chimwaga. Politicians present included governors Josphat Nanok (Turkana), Alex Tolgos (Elgeyo Marakwet), John Lonyangapuo (West Pokot) and Stanley Kiptis (Baringo). Senators Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet) and Samuel Poghisio (West Pokot) also attended. Tolgos lauded the government’s peace efforts. Lonyangapuo said drought has created a serious food shortage in the region and urged the government and well-wishers to provide relief food.
