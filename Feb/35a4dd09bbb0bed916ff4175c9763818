Two Jubilee MPs have urged the government to protect water catchment areas to stop increasing desertification across the country. Maara MP Kareke Mbiuki and Tharaka Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki on Monday said conservation of water towers is key to economic growth. Kindiki said most regions will become deserts in five years if no action is taken. Mbiuki said the problem must be fixed to avert a crisis. "We must conserve forests, especially for future generations," the House Environment and Water committee chairman said in Mwimbi, Maara. The lawmakers were inspecting water projects. The government must ban harvesting for now and stop illegal logging in Mau, Mt Kenya, the Aberdares, and Cherangani Hills, he said. Mbiuki urged Environment CS Keriako Tobiko to crack down on illegal loggers and have them prosecuted.
