Senators yesterday faulted the teachers’ unions call on their members to flee Northeastern over increased al Shabaab attacks. The Senate Education Committee termed the call by Kuppet and Knut “dangerous”. Team members said the call would deny children their constitutional right to education. Committee vice chairperson Margaret Kamar said the call for non-local teachers to leave will promote the enemy’s goal of sabotaging development in parts of the country. Al Shabaab militants last Friday attacked Qarsa Primary School in Wajir, killing three people. “We don’t need to worsen a situation that is already ugly. Asking public servants in Northeastern to leave will be giving the enemy a chance to extend attacks in other parts,” Kamar said. Kuppet secretary general Akello Misori and his Knut counterpart Wilson Sossion on Sunday condemned the murders and asked their non-local members to leave the region until the government improves security. Already, teachers in 15 schools in Wajir County have started fleeing. Non-locals make up to 60 per cent of teachers in Mandera, Garissa and Wajir. “We are in solidarity with the Teachers’ Service Commission that our children must be taught. The security agencies should deal with the issue of insecurity. We ask teachers in Northeastern to stay strong, because such incidents are isolated,” Kamar said. She was flanked by Senators Sam Ongeri (Kisii), Yusuf Haji (Garissa) and Mary Senata (nominated). Kamar said her team has taken up the incident and they will interrogate various government officials. Ongeri said, “The government should provide adequate security for our children to learn.” Haji asked residents to share information of suspected criminals with security agencies.
