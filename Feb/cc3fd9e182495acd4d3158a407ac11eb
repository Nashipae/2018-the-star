Agriculture and Irrigation CS Mwangi Kiunjuri yesterday said he regrets the standoffs between the national and the county governments. Speaking while handing over the Devolution docket to his successor Eugene Wamalwa, he said the rows affected service delivery. To improve their relationship, Kiunjuri said the ministry has operationalised an inter-governmental framework. Governors are on record accusing the government, through the ministry, of crippling devolution by under-funding and delaying cash. The Council of Governors chairman Josephat Nanok has on various occasions said the amount of money being given to counties, it is difficult for the governors to implement key projects. He said this led to a bad relationship between the two levels of government. “In the last Summit we had in Nakuru, we all agreed that these fights are not helping the devolution agenda,” Kiunjuri said. Despite the challenges, the government managed to disburse over one trillion to the counties since inception of county governments. He said this has already exceeded the 15 per cent requirement stipulated by the Constitution. “In 2013-14 we disbursed Sh 210 billion, 2014-15 we gave 226 billion, 2015-16 another Sh287 billion, in 2016-17 Sh302 billion was given and in 2017/18 about Sh 327 billion was given. There has been an increase in funding,” he said. Also Read:Counties and state wrangles threaten food security, says Devolution boss Click here for the latest political news
