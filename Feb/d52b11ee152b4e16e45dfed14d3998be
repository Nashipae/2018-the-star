The government has revoked NASA principal Musalia Mudavadi's firearm licence in the ongoing crackdown on National Resistance Movement members. Mudavadi becomes the first principal to have his gun licence cancelled after Tuesday's unofficial swearing in of Raila Odinga. In a statement to the media, Mudavadi said he has owned the firearm for 25 years since 1993 for his personal safety. "I wonder if this is one of the many weapons of mass destructions that NASA has been accused of harbouring," Mudavadi said. Read: NRM crackdown? State revokes Simba Arati's gun licence He said NASA is not a military operation and do not have weapons of war as it is being alleged by the government. "The clampdown by the state agencies on our personal being is quite unfortunate as the country has not been placed under any state of emergency," he said. Mudavadi said NASA is fighting for electoral justice and no amount of intimidation by the state will slow down their drive. "We are also fighting for police reforms. The police service must operate under the constitution,' he said. Earlier on Thursday, the government also revoked legislator Simba Arati's firearm licence. The Firearms Licensing Board revoked the permit on Thursday and asked Arati to surrender his pistol and shotgun by close of business on Thursday. "You are unfit to be trusted with a firearm," noted board secretary Samwel Kimaru. The Dagoretti North MP is a member of the movement led by NASA boss Raila Odinga. On Tuesday,  Interior CS Fred Matiang'i invoked Section 22 of the Prevention Organised Crimes Act, 2010 to declare the opposition movement as "an organised criminal group".
