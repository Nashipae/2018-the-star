Police in Nandi yesterday lobbed teargas canisters and fired in the air during a burial before taking away the body. The body was set for burial follow- ing a court order. Mourners scam- pered for safety as a contingent of armed officers took away the casket bearing the body of a widow, Sally Maiyo, 63, at Chemalal village in Kap- kures, Tinderet subcounty. She died a week ago. Two groups have been fighting over the ownership of a piece of land at the former Kapkures ADC Farm, an extension of Kimwani Complex in the Songhor area. Confusion reined as armed officers fired live bullets in the air and others lobbed teargas canisters at grieving residents in Chemalal village. The burial programme was in its final stages and the casket was in the process of being lowered into the grave when suddenly, all hell broke loose. COURT ORDER As the mourners fled in all directions, officers from Songhor police station grabbed the coffin bearing the body and loaded it onto their vehicle and drove off. The officers were effecting a High Court order to block the burial on the disputed Kapkures Farm invaded by squatters. The squatters have been on the for- mer ADC Farm for the last 20 years. Chepchumba Barng’etuny is claiming ownership of the farm. She is the daughter of the late veteran Nandi politician Ezekiel Barng’etuny and claims to have been allocated the land by the government after paying the required fees. Nandi police commandant Peter Wambani said the officers were car- rying out a court directive to stop the burial on the disputed piece of land. “They are free to collect the body and bury it elsewhere, but not Kap- kures land as another person has the legal ownership document,” he said yesterday.
