Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko wants an appeal filed by the ODM deputy director of campaigns to revive a petition challenging his election dismissed. Through lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui, he told the Court of Appeal yesterday that Noah Akala has no grounds to reinstitute the case. Sonko said the appeal cannot stand in law as it raises issues similar to the ones filed by Japheth Muroko and Zachaeus Okoth. Akala wants to pursue the petition after it was dismissed by Justice Msagha Mbogholi last month. Sonko says there is no way he can take up the case because he was a witness in the petition that was struck out by Mbogholi.

Sonko’s petition was terminated after Muroko and Okoth applied to have it withdrawn, just a day after Muroko claimed his life was in danger. Justice Mbogholi, in striking out the petition, said the two were no longer interested in prosecuting the case. The two later faulted the decision to strike out the petition without hearing their application for withdrawal. They have appealed. They say the judge should have set the application for hearing and leave it open for any party to pick it up. Mbogholi  further  ordered the two petitioners to pay Sh5 million costs. He was of the view that withdrawing the case and leaving in abeyance, would cause anxiety to Sonko.
