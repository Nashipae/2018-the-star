Hundreds of Muslim faithful in Malindi on Friday held protests against two tycoons they accused of grabbing of a
cemetery land. The lot, together with Haki Africa civil rights activists, waved placards which read: "Grabbers, where will you be buried after you die." They marched from the Malindi municipal stadium to the deputy county commissioner's office demanding action against those behind the syndicate. The protests followed an incident where one of the said developers shot two people opposed to the hiving off of the 16-acre parcel. One of those shot sustained serious injuries while another is still missing to
date after the February 5 attack. Police tried to disperse the faithful but the group did not budge until they were addressed by the administrators. DCC Karungo Kamau asked them to form a committee so as to begin
discussing the matter on Monday next week. Mohamed Mbwana, one of the activists, said such injustices are the ones which force people to join illegal groups like al Shabaab. He said one of the defenders of the cemetery land was
attacked by a suspect who is well known yet the police are yet to act. Also read: Misconduct, inaction on public complaints top list of police flaws - IPOA "The cemetery is over 200 years-old.Â  We want action to be
taken strongly so as to see an end to this intimidation," he said. Twahir Abdulkarim, a local leader, said: "The land grabbers and their political allies have
acquired allotment letters as well as illegal and false tittle deeds for parcels of
the plot." "Due to vested interests of these parcels of land, we have faced a lot of
difficulties," he said. Waqf Commission of Kenya, the trustees of the cemetery,
reportedly allowed the youths to manage the land and stop further encroachment. Abdulkarim said they want the attacker arrested and
taken to court and the firearm be withdrawn
from him. Click here for the latest political news
