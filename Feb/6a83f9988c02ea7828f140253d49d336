Mandera town that was once on her knees due to constant insecurity especially from terror attacks is now back to life. Businessman Aden Hussein has attributed this to the decision by locals to closely work with security agents by volunteering information and reporting suspicious people to the authorities. Residents can now move freely and carry out their daily business without fear. Frequent attacks from the dreaded al Shabaab saw a mass exodus of non-locals who were the main target by the militant group. The Garissa University attack of April 2, 2015 that left 148 people majority of them students dead led to the reshuffle and interdiction of top security chiefs at regional and county level. Residents could close their businesses as early as 5pm because of curfews. Hotel industry and small-scale traders were the most affected. “This town was literally going to the dogs. Everything was at a stand still and most people left,” Hussein said. “Residents, elders, and elected leaders could hold meetings to preach peace so as to save the town from
being taken over by the militants,” he added. The executive member of Maendeleo Ya Wanawake Bishara
Hussein said Mandera was now peaceful and urged all
those who fled the area especially the teachers, doctors, nurses and civil servants to come back. The residents however maintain they are conscious and alert because the threats posed by al Shabaab remain real. Northeastern regional
commissioner Mohamud Saleh told residents to work with security teams and peace elders to kick out al Shabaab or risk loosing the region to the terror group. He recently released a list of 35 youth suspected to be working with
the terror group, and said Mandera has been the worst hit due to its pproximity to the Somalia.
