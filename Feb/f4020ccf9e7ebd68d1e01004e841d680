Wildlife conservationists in the world-famous Masai Mara Game Reserve have petitioned the local county government to ban fencing, saying it poses a threat to the ecosystem. The conservators led by Narok Wildlife Forum chairman Nicholas ole Murero raised over the fencing of private land around the reserve, which he says interferes with wildlife corridors. Owing to land fragmentation and subdivision of group ranches, owners have sold or leased their land to private developers who have been fencing them to wade off wildlife, he said. He spoke to the media in Narok town on Saturday.
