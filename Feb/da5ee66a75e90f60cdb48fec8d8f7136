For months now, Jubilee Party MPs have been gagged from engaging in public discourse. The party leadership expressly barred lawmakers allied to the ruling party from making public pronouncements on national issues without permission. That elected MPs cannot feature on TV and radio talk shows or respond on record to media inquiries without prior authorisation reeks of excessive control and suppression of freedom of speech only found in the communist societies of yesteryear. Jubilee is shooting itself in the foot. There is no likelihood that a Jubilee MP will go on-air to support NASA leader Raila Odinga. So what, exactly, is the party freaking out against? The MPs are representatives of the people who elect them and not chattels of a party. The party stands to lose much more than it can ever gain from such suffocating and draconian orders. Its point of view will become weaker in the public sphere. There is another lurking danger: Rather than enhance the credibility of government communications, anything that comes out from official sources will invariably begin to look like canned party propaganda. This is a self-defeating strategy for Jubilee that is in neither the national nor party interest. It is also anachronistic to our democratic ethos.
