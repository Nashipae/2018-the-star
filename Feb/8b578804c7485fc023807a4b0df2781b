The transfer of non-Muslim (or local) teachers from some areas of northern Kenya has irked the region’s elected leaders. The dissent has been amplified by no less a voice than the government's Majority leader in the House and Garissa Township MP Aden Duale. On the surface, it looks like the Teachers’ Service Commission has acceded to parochialism and discrimination against the learners from these areas, which have been targetted by terrorists. But on a balance of probability, and as has been proven by the incidents which have occurred, upcountry workers are at greater risk as prime targets of these attacks. Certain rare situations call for discriminatory measures, and this is one. The safety of public servants deployed in these areas far outweighs the noble objectives of equality of all Kenyans in accessing government services. Besides, the country is not short of culturally-affiliated teachers to deploy — for if indeed such a shortage exists then this adversity provides the ample opportunity for redress by training more teachers from the locality to take up the responsibility. Myopic chest thumping by politicians will not secure the innocent teachers. Nor should these temporary and precautionary measures be seen as a lasting solution or yardstick used to stereotype the region. We must avoid branding and characterisation that can be used to institutionalise marginalisation.
