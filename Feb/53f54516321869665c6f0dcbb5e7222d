A High court in Lodwar on Friday upheld the election of James Lomenen as Turkana South MP. Justice Daniel Ogembo, in the decision, slapped Ebenyo Ekuwom with Sh3 million in cost of the petition. He dismissed the petition, which was based on claims that the MP bribed voters with relief food, on grounds it lacked merit. The petitioner argued that his well-known name of Nakipor was omitted on the ballot paper making him lose more votes. He also alleged the legislator unlawfully campaigned on the material election day and convinced people that polls were to be held on August 9, 2017. Lomenen and Ekuwom garnered 12,152 and 5,442 respectively during last year's general elections. Ogembo said the election in Turkana South was free and fair in accordance with the Constitution. "The petitioner will pay Sh3m to be shared equally by the first respondent and second respondent." Click here for the latest political news
