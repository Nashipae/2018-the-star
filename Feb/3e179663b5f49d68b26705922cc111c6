Justice Hillary Chemitei on Tuesday held that Migori Governor Okoth Obado was validly elected during the August 8, 2017, polls. He said former Cabinet minister Ochilo Ayako did not provide sufficient evidence to warrant the annulment of Obado's win. Migori High court was tense moments before the judge delivered the verdict as supporters of the two political factions clashed. Judge Hillary Chemitei was forced to retreat to his chambers following the tension at the premises. When he resumed, the judge said the petitioner failed to give tangible evidence on the 12 points he raised in a bid for the results to be annulled. Ayako, in his case, cited irregular voting, violence during campaigns, bribery, use of public resources among others as grounds. "I have not found any sufficient evidence to nullify the election," Chemitei said. He said there was also no evidence of ballot stuffing, the irregular hiring of IEBC staff, and intimidation. The judge said the petitioner will bear the Sh6 million cost to be shared by the IEBC and Obado. After the ruling, Obado said it was through God’s power that he won the case. He called upon Ayako as well as his political competitors to join him in building the county. "The court case is now behind us. We need to work together to develop Migori. We are happy the court upheld the people's will." For his part, Ayako said he will consult his lawyers on the way forward. "As Ochilo, I don’t have a reverse gear when it comes to matters of justice, democracy, and public service," he said. "We have seen enough gaps in the judgement and I will consult with my lawyers to see the way forward." Click here for the latest political news
