KTN News and NTV were back on air last evening, as activist Okiya Omtatah filed contempt proceedings against Cabinet Secretaries Fred Matiang’i, Joe Mucheru and the CA Board over failure to reopen the TV stations. The CSs were ordered to restore NTV, KTN News, and Citizen TV signals in a court order issued Thursday last week. Citizen TV is not back on air. In his application, Omtatah said even after serving the CSs with a copy of the orders on Friday through press, they have blatantly disobeyed the court’s directive and, hence, they should be punished. Last Thursday, Justice Chacha Mwita suspended the media shut which enters the eighth day today. Omtatah says the court has the unfettered powers and jurisdiction to stop the blatant disregard of the rule of law. He says unless his application is heard immediately, Kenyans will continue to suffer great loss and damage. Apart from the two CSs, the activist wants the court to punish PSs Kamau Thugge, Karanja Kibicho, Sam Itemere, and the CA Board. The board members are Ben Ngene, Paul Kukubo, Mugambi Nandi, Ken Tikolo, David Cheruiyot, Levo Obonyo, Christopher Guto, and Patrick Kimama. He says they must be stopped from ignoring the rule of law, which is a key national value and principle of governance. “I believe that in regard of the continuing violation and threats to the Constitution, it is of utmost importance and urgency that the violations of the constitution be stopped,” he says. Omtatah argues the respondent sare guilty of criminal contempt because by deliberately disobeying the court orders they have substantially undermined the cause of justice. He wants the government officials committed to civil jail for a period of six months for the disobedience. The contempt proceedings, he says have been brought to safeguard the rule of law. The TVs were switched off for airing Raila Odinga’s swearing-in on January 30.
