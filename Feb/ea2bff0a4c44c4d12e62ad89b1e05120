NASA lawmakers want Cabinet Secretaries Fred Matiang’i (Interior), Joe Mucheru (ICT) and Communications Authority boss Francis Wangusi summoned to Parliament over the shutdown of TV stations. Seven members of the parliamentary committee on Communication and Information yesterday wrote to House Clerk Michael Sialai, petitioning him to convene a meeting on Friday to discuss the matter. “Pursuant to Standing Orders, members of the departmental committee on Communications hereby petition your office to issue appropriate notice for an urgent committee meeting on February 9 at Parliament Buildings,” the petition reads. Speaking to reporters in Parliament yesterday, MPs Mark Nyamita (Uriri) and Godfrey Osotsi (nominated) said they want the three top officials grilled for muzzling media freedom through the shutdown. They claimed that the government had not given a concrete reason for move. They urged committee members to support the initiative, saying Kenyans have constitutional rights to access to information. “Jubilee MPs are unable to convene a meeting since they receive orders from State House. We have been frustrated because the government controls the parliamentary committees,” Osotsi said. Nyamita said committee chairman William Kisang (Marakwet West) had promised to convened the meeting next week.
