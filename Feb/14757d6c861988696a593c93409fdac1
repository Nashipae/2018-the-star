The High Court in Nyahururu on Friday dismissed a poll petition challenging Samburu Governor Moses Lenolkulal’s win. Justice Roseline Wendoh said the case lacked merit and ordered the petitioner, ODM’s Simeon Lesirma to pay Sh6 million in costs. Lenolkulal of Jubilee won with 40,467 votes. Gabriel Lengoiboni of Kanu was second with 20,204, while Lesirma was third with 3,260. Lesirma had said the election was marred by irregularities in Forms 37A and 37B, and said his agents were deliberately locked out of polling stations and tallying centres. But Wendoh said he failed to tell who his agents were and to produce them as witnesses, or demonstrate that they were locked out, she said. Wendoh said polls are conducted by human beings — not programmed machines, hence, there’s room for error. She ordered Lesirma to pay Sh2 million each to the governor, returning officer Benard Misasti and the IEBC.  Click here for the latest political news
