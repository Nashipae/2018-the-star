Three people reportedly have died of cholera in Tana North subcounty but health officials say they can only confirm one death. The outbreak was reported two weeks ago. The source has not been identified. Reports indicate about 155 people with cholera-like symptoms have been reported in six villages in Tana North. This has created fear as the cause is still unknown. The affected wards are Chewele, Hirimani and Madogo. County Public Health officer Samuel Jefwa on Tuesday said they did not know the source of disease. Jefwa said 56 of the 155 reported cases tested positive. The county Public Health office has said it requires Sh2.1 million to deal with the outbreak. Jefwa said they suspect the problem was caused by pastoralists coming in search of water and pasture for their animals. “It has become increasingly difficult to trace active infections and those who could have come into contact with victims,” he said. Tana River County Steering Group and health experts on Tuesday held a crisis meeting over the outbreak. Unicef, the Kenya Red Cross Society and others have launched public health awareness campaigns. Tana River county commissioner Oningoi ole Sosio said two-lorry loads of non-food items will be sent to affected areas to prevent residents from taking contaminated water. “Drought in most areas may have contributed to the outbreak of cholera,” he said. Sosio warned the disease could claim more lives if urgent measures are not taken.
