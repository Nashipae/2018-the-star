Murang'a Senator Irungu Kang'ata has petitioned the Senate to stop the construction of the proposed sanitary landfill at Gikono village in the county. Kang’ata said residents have expressed concern that the landfill would affect ground water, turn the county into a dumpsite and pollute the environment due to the waste. The project proposed by the Nairobi Metropolitan Services Improvement Projects is to be erected on an agricultural area that is fast developing due to its proximity to Thika town. The petition dated February 20 noted the landfill intended to collect waste from Nairobi, Murang’a, Kiambu, Kajiado and Machakos counties has the potential to cause serious health issues due to the presence of serious elements such as lead and mercury. Kang’ata now wants the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure to halt the project to allow for more consultation among stakeholders. The senator has also asked Senate to ensure appropriate safety audit is undertaken to guide on the implementation and effects of the project thereafter. He also wants the Namsip to conduct fresh public participation for locals to fully understand the implications of the project an they await on Nema to release a report of the environment impact assessment conducted. Kang’ata wants the project cancelled and relocated to another area if found unviable. Ichagaki MCA Charles Mwangi has however said it is unwise to make a stern stand for or against the project before fully understanding how it will operate and its implications. He urged residents to wait until sufficient public participation is conducted and all controversial issues surrounding it cleared. “This issue should also be subject to discussion in the county assembly for all MCAs to give their views as the people’s representatives at the grassroots,” Mwangi said.
