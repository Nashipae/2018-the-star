Kitui contractors who offered their services to the administration of former Governor Julius Malombe will be paid their debts this week, Governor Charity Ngilu has said. A communication from Ngilu's office yesterday said the contractors and service providers will be paid Sh356 million. Last Saturday, Ngilu told the contractors that only genuine contractors whose works adhered to set standards would be paid. The governor met the contractors in Kitui. She said the county was open to doing business with the service providers, adding that all genuine debts will be paid. “I want to work with you. Don’t be intimidated by anyone for it is your right to get paid for the work you did,” Ngilu said. The contractors were asked to produce documentations to legitimise their debt payment. “I urge that you produce the right papers for your contracts. That will streamline and hasten the payment process,” Ngilu said.  The Governor clarified that tenders will be awarded to all residents of the county to ensure that her agenda on wealth creation is attained thus reducing high poverty levels among the people. Noting that most contractors access high interest loans from commercial banks in the county, she advised that the contractors form saccos where they would access loans at a low interests rates. This will ensure that resources from the county circulate among the residents and contribute significantly to the economic empowerment of the populace, the governor said. She clarified that fairness will be observed during the award of tenders to ensure that many people benefit from the county resources. The service providers unanimously welcomed Ngilu's idea. The Lands and Infrastructure county executive member Eng. Jacob Kakundi urged contractors to maintain quality and standards in construction works.
