The Sh5 billion scandal at the Health ministry came back to haunt immediate former CS Cleopa Mailu during his vetting for Kenya’s permanent representative to the UN in Geneva, Switzerland. Mailu was yesterday tasked by members of the National Assembly Defence and Foreign Affairs committee to explain the Sh5.3 billion Afya House scam. Belgut MP Nelson Koech said Mailu’s tenure at the docket was dogged by graft scandals involving billions of taxpayers’ funds. “You know very well that Geneva is a corruption-free zone. Your previous docket was dogged by graft scandals. How do you defend that?” Koech said. But Mailu absolved himself from the scam, saying there were no funds lost at the ministry and that the entire matter was false and sensationalised by the media. Mailu said the matter arose from an audit conducted during the regime of his predecessor, but he opted to represent the correct position of the government. “Indeed, no money was lost and I believe the controller of budget and auditor general can attest that what happened in that ministry then was lack of following procedures in allocation of resources,” he said. He said the ministry issued documents to vindicate its position of his docket. Click here for the latest political news
