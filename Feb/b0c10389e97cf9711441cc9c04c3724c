Jackie Janmohammed has stepped down as Cricket Kenya chairperson following the team’s poor performance in the just concluded ICC World Cricket League Division Two tournament in Namibia. Kenya finished bottom of the six-team tournament and were relegated to Division 3 — the lowest Kenya has gone in cricket ranking. Janmohammed, who made sporting history in December 2012 by becoming the first women to chair the country’s cricket board, resigned on Saturday. Janmohammed didn’t give reasons for her resignation but sources hinted that the CK boss had contemplated stepping down last month but was prevailed upon by board members to stay as Kenya were to play in the World Cricket League Division Two event. But after Kenya were relegated two places down after five losses, Janmohammed decided to go ahead with her earlier plan to resign. "Following the board meeting held on January 13, I hereby tender my resignation as the chairperson of Cricket Kenya with immediate effect," Janmohammed said in a brief letter addressed to the board and CK affiliates. She took charge of CK in 2012, replacing Samir Inamdar. Upon being elected, Janmohamed, a lawyer by profession, said she believed she could make a difference in cricket and her election as the first woman to head a country board was supported by many. However, the going got tough for her after Kenya failed to qualify for the 2015 World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand and the worst was to come when Kenya lost the ODI status that was accorded the country in 1997, denying the country the initial support from the ICC. During her tenure, Kenya has only hosted one major event while Kenya’s Premier tournament — East Africa PL went under. Janmohammed was also allegedly said to have quit in 2014 but changed her mind.
