NASA MPs who have moved to court over anticipatory bail are not being sought by authorities, the police have said. "Those individuals should, therefore, not bother turning up at the DCI offices. They are not persons of interest to the police as of now." Police said via twitter on Tuesday that neither Hassan Joho, Jimmy Wanjigi, David Ndii nor the nine others are being sought in connection with committing any crimes. This was after the High court barred the DPP and the police from arresting and prosecuting 12 Nasa leaders who actively participated in the 'swearing-in' of Raila Odinga. The politicians filed an urgent application at the Milimani law court saying they were afraid of being arrested and held just like lawyer Miguna Miguna. They are James Orengo, George Aladwa, Simba Arati, George Khaniri, Jimmy Wanjingi, Norman Magaya, and Gladys Wanga. Others are David Ndii, Babu Owino, and Oduor Ong'wen, Cleophas Malala, and Hassan Joho. Justice Luka Kimaru released each of them on Sh100,000 anticipatory bail.
