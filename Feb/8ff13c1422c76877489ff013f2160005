Residents of Mkwakwani village in Kwale county are demanding Sh400 million compensation from the Kenya Airports Authority following the expansion of Ukunda Airstrip. They also want KAA to relocate them to a noise-free place, as the aircraft are distracting them. Speaking to reporters yesterday, the locals said they are greatly affected by the noise after the government used the neighbouring 247 acres to expand the Ukunda airstrip. Led by Nyangasi Mohammed, they said the government is unwilling to pay and relocate them to a safer place, even after presenting their grievances to the National Lands Commission. However, NLC chairman Mohammed Swazuri last year said no compensation will be done to the residents of Mkwakwani since the land on which the airstrip was expanded didn’t belong to them. According to Swazuri, KAA acquired the land in 1995, the same way the locals acquired plots of scheme and, therefore, the rightful owner is the company. “There is no compensation that has been done and there will be none that we are promising since no local has legal claim over the land,” Swazuri said. Hamisi Juma, a local, however said the land belonged to their grandparents and from whom they inherited after their deaths. “We have seen other people paid to relocate whenever a project that has environmental effects is initiated. Where were the owners when we were living here happily?” he said. “The government is robbing us of our right to own our land in exchange of a project. We are not objecting to this airstrip because it will boost tourism but what are we going to do in the long run?” posed Juma.
