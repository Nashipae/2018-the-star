What have I done? What is this hurry? These were Jacob Zuma’s words amid calls for his resignation as President of South Africa.Speaking to the South Africa’s state owned TV station SABC yesterday, the embattled leader said he has not been given enough evidence to step down as President.“I am not refusing to resign. It is the time frame...let us work out on a time frame that must accommodate a lot of things. I need to be furnished with what I have done. Why must I be frustrated to resign?” he said during the televised address. “The manner in which they want to remove me is suspicious. So, I will not resign.” Read: South African President Jacob Zuma resignsThe South African President said there was a plan in which the ANC would announce his resignation, but was scheduled for June. “I had a proposal to make after speaking to the officials because there was an urgency for me to resign. Once we had worked that out, the public and opposition would know,” he said. Zuma, 75, said Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa agreed with his proposal for a timeframe.The tables turned against him and pressure came from all sides of the ANC party of him to step down. “I am being victimised. I did not defy, but disagreed because the decision is not right. It is a misrepresentation...you have to forward facts to warrant my resignation.” The scandal-plagued President denied any wrongdoing following the allegations of graft in his administration. He took office in 2009.“It is unfair..the decision is not right and I disagree with it,” he said. The President downplayed his party’s decision to recall him and instigate measures for his removal from office. “You want to recall, then you recall...you are suggesting that I am not cooperating  in the decision... there are no factual reasons cited.” It would be his first time to defy the ANC leadership since he is yet to be convinced on the matters the party has raised.
