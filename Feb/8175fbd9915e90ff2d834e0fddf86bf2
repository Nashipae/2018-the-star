Residents of Nuu in Mwingi East subcounty seized 220 sacks of charcoal from a lorry on Wednesday night. They said they were on a mission to protect the environment and would not tolerate charcoal burning. “We were carrying as many bags as we could. We told police to sit back and watch as we protect our environment. They’ve gone too far and they aid the harvesters to destroy our environment. Enough is enough,” one resident said. “[Kitui] Governor Charity Ngilu told us to attack the lorries. We won’t let any lorry carrying charcoal or sand pass through this area. They have fake documents permitting them to get charcoal from Tana River county, but they don’t even set foot in Tana River.” Occupants of the lorry — a woman and two men — were caught by surprise after youths offloaded the charcoal and threatened to set the vehicle on fire if they objected. Their pleadings were unsuccessful. The woman said she was the wife of a police boss and the charcoal belonged to a firm. The youths said she should be in the forefront helping “your husband” in the war on charcoal, not abetting destruction of forests. A week ago, Ngilu permitted youths to take action against charcoal burners. On Wednesday while on her way from Nairobi, she stopped a lorry and a pickup in Kanyonyoo and ordered them to go back to the Kitui police station for further actions.
