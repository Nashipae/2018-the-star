The High Court has set April 5 as judgement day for self-confessed serial killer Philip Onyancha murder case. Justice James Wakiaga said this on Thursday after the prosecution and defence teams closed their case. Earlier, the judge had found Onyancha with a case to answer after testimonies from 13 witnesses, among them two doctors. Onyancha is charged alongside Tobias Nyabuhanga Aradi and Douglas Obiero Makori. "I'm satisfied that the prosecution has proved a case against Onyancha beyond reasonable doubt to enable me put him on his defence." "In addition to his confession linking his co-accused persons of the murder, l also put them on their defence under Section 306 (2) of the (CPC)," the judge said. The judge said that it is important to hear Onyancha's defence. The prosecution had claimed he was insane at the time he allegedly committed the offences. Wakiaga said that the issue of the suspect's state of mind should be addressed by the defence and not the prosecution. The court noted that Onyancha had confessed to the police of the alleged killings where he linked his co-accused persons. It is alleged that the suspect had confessed to killing 19 women and children around the country and showed their hidden bodies. He has since denied three murder charges preferred against him by the DPP. Onyancha entered a plea in 2014 before Justice Lesley Lessit and denied committing the offences. His co-accused persons also denied that on April 14, 2014 in Dagoretti, Nairobi they killed 14-year-old Anthony Njirwa Muiruri. Onyancha also denied killing Jacqueline Chepngetich on May 30, 2008. In 2010, Onyancha was convicted by a Kibera law court after he was found guilty of attempted rape and assaulting a woman in Nairobi. Click here for the latest political news
