After Otile Brown and Timmy Tdat fought at Vanessa Mdee's dinner party on Sunday night, the two have been subtweeting each other. Otile told Timmy on his social media pages, "Kasabunians, your woman representative can't shut his big mouth. I am playing it cool but he is out here giving false information and so I won't be quiet. Wish he could say what truly happened hehehe... Never underestimate a singer or the quiet ones, utapigwa ulie." Adding that rapper Timmy should "Thank Shaffie and Prezzo" because they saved him from further beating. Various fans reacted. Dinah Fabian: Wameingia kwa industry juzi tu na washaanza hizi ufala na wakifika je ligi ya Ali Kiba? Siprih Azurah: Ukitusi ndio umeshiba makamasi nyinyi ama... Buda hata comment zenu hazisomwi. Victor Anjere: Chill bro... The moment you started running into doing 'funny collabos' your game has gone down... Most of those artist can't match your talent they are dragging you. Stick to your lane and you will be fine.
