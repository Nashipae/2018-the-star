Jubilee Party yesterday failed in its bid to discipline four MPs who defied the party on the sharing of parliamentary committee positions. The party wanted the court to allow it to resolve the dispute, but Justice George Odunga declined to issue orders in its favour. Odunga said the court has jurisdiction to hear matters where violations of rights have been alleged. MPs Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills), James Mwangi (Embakasi North), Kangogo Bowen (Marakwet East) and Silas Tiren (Moiben) want to reverse the party’s decision to remove them from committee leadership positions . Jubilee’s lawyer Danson Mungatana had told the court that it was unprocedural for the legislators to rush to court before exhausting internal dispute resolution mechanisms. He argued that the party was best-placed to deal with the dispute. Mungatana said the MPs refused to hold talks, even after they were called by party secretary general Raphael Tuju. “We want them to come back home so we can talk. They can’t be allowed to blow hot and cold. They are either with the party or not,” Mungatana said. But Odunga said any political party purporting to limit the rights of their members must satisfy the provisions of Section 24 of the Constitution. He said being party members does not mean the four acted wrongly by seeking to protect their constitutional rights.
