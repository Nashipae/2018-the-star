Former Funyula MP Paul Otuoma on Monday downplayed assertions that his political career dwindled following the court's decision to uphold Governor Sospeter Ojamoong's win. He said his team has accepted the verdict much as they do not agree with it, adding that no one should act like they have vanquished their political competitors following the ruling. Addressing
journalists at the court premises, the ex-legislator thanked those who stood by him through the "protracted" election. "Today, we
have had this verdict. We may not agree but we have to respect it. We have to
respect our courts even if we do not agree with some of the decisions they
make." "Nobody is going to be a third
class citizen in Busia. We will have the services that we require. Distribution of resources will be
equitable," he said. He said his legal team will decide on the next
course of action after the verdict further urging his supporters to be calm. "I thank Peter
Odima (the petitioner) who took it upon himself to ensure that we seek justice at the courts of justice," Otuoma said. The petitioner was slapped with Sh12 million cost to the first, second and third respondents. "I hope those whom
the verdict has gone their way are going to look at their win but see what services they deliver to the people of Busia and to Kenyans," Otuoma
said. Odima said he accepted the judgement as it came and said that he has
left the legal aspects to his lawyers. Read: Ojaamong re-election case thrown out for lack of evicence Click here for the latest political news
