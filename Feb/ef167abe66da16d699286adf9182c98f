Murang’a county government will merge five water companies into one to deliver water services to all residents. Governor Mwangi wa Iria yesterday said Murang’a Water and Sanitation Company, Murang’a South Water and Sanitation Company, Kahuti Water Company, Gatamathi Water Company and Gatanga Community Water Development Company will operate as branches to the main company. The governor noted that merging the water companies will standardise water services in the entire county and help reduce the prices even further. He said this will enable it to provide water to the 25 per cent by the year 2022. He dismissed claims that workers of the companies will be fired.
