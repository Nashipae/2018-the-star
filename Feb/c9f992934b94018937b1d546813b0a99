Boda boda riders have urged the contractor upgrading the James Gichuru road to Rironi in Kiambu to speed up the work to curb accidents. They said vehicles are hitting thw drums placed on the road by China Wu Yi Construction Company. The riders who operate between Acre Tano and Rironi accuse motorists of not leaving enough space for motorbikes. “When vehicles overtake motorbikes, they come too close. It is easy to lose control of the bike,” rider Muriuki Mugo said. He was speaking on Saturday at Acre Tano where a rider and his passenger were hit by a vehicle and killed them on the spot. The two were heading towards Nairobi, when the hit-and-run accident occurred. Mugo said the passenger must have been stuck beneath the vehicle and was dragged for about 500m. The rider’s body was in the middle of the road. It was run over by other vehicles. “The accident scene was very ugly. We learnt about the accident about 20 minutes after it happened,” another rider, Simon Waweru, said. “It happened some minutes before 6am. People who were walking to the bus stop called up when they saw the bodies. We rushed there. “The motorcycle was in a ditch, and the rider’s body and passenger’s body were apart. We called the police.” Kikuyu deputy OCPD Eunia Wako arrived shortly after. Police took the bodies to City Mortuary in Nairobi while the motorcycle was taken to Kikuyu police station. “Investigations have begun. We are treating the incident as a hit-and run-fatal accident,” Wako, who was accompanied by DCI Ahmed Aden, told journalists.
