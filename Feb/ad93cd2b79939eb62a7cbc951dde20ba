Kenya, like many other African countries, is getting tired of dictators, impunity and graft, Tongaren MP Eseli Simiyu has said.This was in an apparent reference to leaders who have stepped down in recent months. It started with Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, who stepped down in November last year. Then there was South Africa’s Jacob Zuma who resigned last week, closely followed by Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn. Eseli said Kenyans will push until the “three monsters” - dictators, impunity and graft - are wiped out. He said Kenyans are yearning for liberation from bad leadership which has segregated the country. Eseli addressed parents, teachers and students of Mitwa Girls High School in in Tongaren during the opening of a block built by the Dutch. Present was Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati and MCA Stephen Wanjala. Independence Eseli said, “Zuma had to go home, Mugabe had to leave and even in our neighbouring country - Ethiopia - the Prime Minister had to leave.” He said the Judiciary, Parliament and Executive have to be independent for progress to be realised. Eseli accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of interfering with the Judiciary. “I know it’s a weighty matter, but these three need to be independent,” he said. Baggage The MP lashed out at Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju for bashing the Judiciary. He said it is a shame for Tuju to talk ill of the Judiciary. “I am shocked by his utterances. He was not even vetted. He knows he has too much baggage and those Jubilee MPs who were vetting CSs would not have passed his name,” Eseli said. Tuju accused Chief Justice David Maraga of “almost burning down Kenya” after the August 8 presidential election was nullified. He said during the election, the CJ and Judiciary showed evident signs of “bias, impunity and poor leadership”.
