A quantity surveyor will spend three years in jail or pay a Sh350,000 fine for killing a university student along Thika Superhighway in 2016. Job Wangila was found guilty of killing Brian Kiambati, who was a third year engineering student at the University of Nairobi. A Nairobi court heard on Monday that he made a wrong U-turn in attempt to evade the alcoblow test but collided head-on with a vehicle in which Kiambati had been travelling. Parties broke into tears before Senior Resident Magistrate Elector Riani. Riani noted Wangila had been driving on the wrong side of the road when the accident occurred in Kasarani area. "The postmortem report shows the deceased died of head and chest injuries. It's evident that the accused was driving carelessly." Asked to give his views to counter mitigation by the Wangila's advocate, the student's father Wilson Kiambati said "no amount of punishment can bring back Brian". In an interview with the press after the judgment, the father added that the justice he wanted for his son had been served. But the victim's mother Liliana Maina said the conviction did not match the pain the family suffered. The court relied heavily on testimonies by Citizen TV crew who covered a crackdown on drink-driving. Click here for the latest political news
