President Uhuru Kenyatta shocked journalists on Friday when he ordered them out of his function soon after delivering his speech. The reporters went to Lower Kabete in Nairobi to cover his opening of the Annual IG's Conference at Kenya School of Government. Uhuru had just finished speaking when he asked the journalists to pack up and leave immediately, seemingly not wanting to take questions. "Si nyinyi sasa mfunge hizo vitu zenyu na muende? Si sasa kazi imeisha?" he said. This loosely translates to: "Why not pack your things and leave now? Isn't your work over?" His media team, however, defended him saying he wanted to have a closed session with the security team. "[The media] included PSCU - the officers were getting into a closed-door meeting. Nothing wrong at all," senior director of digital communication Dennis Itumbi tweeted. This came hours after another group of journalists was chased from the Communication Authority while trying to find out if the order suspending the TV stations shutdown had been implemented. The government shut down NTV, Citizen and KTN hours before NASA leader Raila Odinga's defiant swearing-in at Uhuru Park in Nairobi. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i later claimed the coalition had planned a massacre and that some media houses were aware. The authority placed plain clothes officers outside the premises and ordered them to block reporters and anyone intending to sever the order. Earlier today, the CA blocked activist Okiya Omtatah from serving them with court orders lifting the shutdown on media houses. Omtatah said he would not give up amid concern by the United States and the European Union.
