The Bungoma High Court yesterday dismissed a petition challenging the election of Kabuchai MP James Lusweti, citing insufficient evidence. Justice Abida Aroni said Lusweti’s election was free and fair. The election had been challenged by Tale Nabangi, who ran against Lusweti as an Independent. He was asked to pay Sh7 million in costs. Nabangi asked the court to annul Lusweti’s win, claiming it was marred with irregularities. “I have looked at the witnesses’ testimonies and concluded that Lusweti’s victory was achieved through a free and fair poll,” Aroni said. The court said there was not enough evidence to nullify the election. Nabangi was asked to pay both the IEBC and Lusweti Sh3.5 million each. He said he will appeal. Speaking after his victory was upheld, Lusweti thanked the court for “respecting the will of Kabuchai residents.” He said the ruling will allow him to focus on delivering the promises he made to the electorate. “It was hard to juggle between court hearings and work. I will now ensure all promises made are delivered,” Lusweti said. He promised to prioritise education. Bungoma Woman Representative Catherine Wambilianga hailed the court for upholding Lusweti’s election. Both MPs are members of the Ford Kenya Party. “Next time you go to court after losing an election, ensure you have enough evidence or risk getting embarrassed,” Wambilianga said. Wambilianga asked Lusweti to work together with other elected leaders to take the county forward. Bungoma Deputy Governor Charles Ngome said the ruling was a big win for Ford Kenya. “On behalf of the party, I congratulate Lusweti for winning this petition,” Ngome said.
