Speaking at Muthaiga Golf Club, Kanyago said: “At the Kenya Open Golf Limited, we remain deeply committed to ensure the sport of golf grows not just among the professional players, but also among the junior players. To this effect, we are sponsoring PGK to the tune of Sh2m to ensure that they have the best preparations possible.” A total of 22 Kenyan pro golfers will be among those fighting for a total prize fund of £500,000 (Sh62.5m. The prize kitty goes down in history as the biggest amount to be vied for on the European Challenge Tour. Kanyago said the Sh2m deal will go towards specialized training of local pros ahead of Kenya Open. “As part of the partnership, we will be sponsoring two professionals from South Africa, who have been engaged by the PGK to train the local pros ahead of this year’s event. In addition, there will also be a trainer to help our local pros work on the nutrition and mental part of the game,” said Kanyago. Last year, the KOGL facilitated for two European teaching pros to train the local professionals in a bid to up their ante in the run up to last year’s show. The three-day training catered for all local professionals who had qualified for the Kenya Open. PGK chairman Charan Thethy thanked KOGL for their generous gesture towards the Kenya Open preparations. The final list of Kenyan pros will be named after the five-leg qualification series organized by PGK. Of the 22 pros, four have already qualified for the tournament.
