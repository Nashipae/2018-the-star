NASA members have been directed to remove President Uhuru Kenyatta’s portraits from their business premises. “We are ordering NRM soldiers to take down Uhuru portraits from all homes, businesses and every premises they occupy,” NRM leader Miguna Miguna said yesterday at the Okoa Kenya offices, Nairobi. Miguna said NASA will produce legitimate portraits of “President Raila Odinga”. “We will distribute the portraits ourselves. We are going to do it in an organised and fashioned way,” he said. On Tuesday, the government branded the National Resistance Movement an organised criminal group. The group was formed on October 25 last year, a day before the repeat presidential election, which followed the nullification of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s August 8 win. But Miguna, who helped administer Raila’s oath on Tuesday, said they “will ensure the coalition reclaims what was stolen from them”. “The people of Kenya decided to reclaim their power. We will ensure the illegitimate despots return back to the people what they rigged,” he said. Interior CS Fred Matiang’i, in a statement on Tuesday, invoked Section 22 of the Prevention of Organised Crimes Act to declare the NRM as an organised criminal group. Miguna dared Matiang’i to arrest him for administering the oath to NASA leader Raila Odinga. It was reported that Flying Squad officers were looking for Miguna, hours after arresting Ruaraka MP TJ Kajwang. “If you are looking for me, I’m ready and I’ve been ready since I was a teenager,” he said. “We fought retired President Daniel Moi and defeated him. You [Matiang’i] are nothing.” Click here for the latest political news
