The Trans Nzoia government is putting in place a new staff monitoring and evaluation system that is aimed at boosting public service delivery to locals in the region. Governor Patrick Khaemba said the system will ensure that County staffs are periodically evaluated and properly supervised to track their performance on a reel time basis. “We have to instill sanity within our public service to achieve our target goals. Poor service delivery has been dragging our development pace,” Governor Khaemba addressed a senior county staff workshop in the area. The training which is sponsored by Local Authorities Provident (LAP) Fund aims at improving County management skills to improve service delivery to residents of Trans Nzoia. The Governor also directed county public service management and the human resource officers not to be hesitant in taking disciplinary action against staffs found culpable under the new system. “Rapid results come with a disciplined workforce. I want the culture of lenience on employees who undermine our goals to be brought to an end since they must be punished,” said the county boss. The governor said the excuse of “constitutional rights” should not be entertained by senior staffs in the region saying the culture is breeding laziness and in turn hampering development. “We can’t always take cover in democracy every time we fail in our duties. We rather perform our duties as required by the people we serve instead of developing cold feet,” he said.
