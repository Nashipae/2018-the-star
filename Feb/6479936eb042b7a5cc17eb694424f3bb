The government has denied that it has been harassing and arresting al-Shabaab returnees and undermining human rights. Several lobby groups in Mombasa have been accusing the state of disappearances and possibly extrajudicial killings to most of the returnees. On Friday, Mombasa County Commissioner Evans Achoki said returnees will be integrated. “We will not harass them. We welcome them. The government is ready to listen to those who are willing to surrender. We will ensure that person is rehabilitated,” he said.

MAP focuses on preventing and countering violent extremism. Haki Africa director Yusuf Aboubakar accused the government of human rights violations. “Iraq, Syria, Britain, Northern Island and Spain are facing terrorism because of such violation. Respect human rights and succeed on the war against terror,” he said. Brutal force in stifling dissent, Aboububakar said, pushes youth to be extremist. This was a blunt attack on police who have been conducted massive swoops to arrest terror suspects. The innocents have been netted, too. Achoki said police operation will go on but in a “more professionalize manner”. “The operation will target arrest with a view to prosecuting,” he said. He noted government will not disrespect rights of any Kenyan “to avoid another problem”. Mombasa deputy governor William Kingi said spying on Muslim community by security agencies is worrying. “Let such action be done by those outside security forces,” he said. In a coastal city of Mombasa, people have experienced violent extremism firsthand with a series of attacks on churches.
