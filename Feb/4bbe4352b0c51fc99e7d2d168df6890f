ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi on Friday promised to push for prosecution of individuals he says profited illegally from the 2014 Eurobond. He faulted the government’s move to borrow another Sh200 billion. Mudavadi said the fresh Eurobond is mistimed, as the government has not given satisfactory answers about the 2014 loan. It caused a storm when Auditor General Edward Ouko stated the government could not pinpoint specific projects that were funded. The NASA principal expressed alarm about Kenya’s rising debt, and accused President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration of pocketing public funds to the detriment of Kenyans. Early in the week, global rating agency Moody’s downgraded Kenya’s credit scores, citing pressure from the country’s rising debt levels and its weak financial muscle to service existing debt. The agency downgraded Kenya’s issuer rating to B2 from B1. In a statement on Thursday, Treasury CS Henry Rotich said the new issue was oversubscribed seven times. This means Kenya wanted Sh203 billion, but attracted Sh1.4 trillion. Rotich said the funds will be for development initiatives and liability management. Mudavadi says the 2014 facility was embezzled through dubious projects by the national government. “When Kenyans sought to know what this administration did with the first borrowing, they were taken round in circles with vague answers that were only coverups. Finally, it emerged that the money ended up in individuals’ pockets through dubious projects under the NYS,” he said. “As a political party, ANC will resist this unbridled greed by Jubilee leaders. We’re going to push for prosecution of the real people behind the theft of the previous Eurobond. “Meanwhile, we’re watching closely what they’re doing with the latest tranche. We will take them on squarely if they attempt to steal this second borrowing again.”
