Uasin Gishu MCAs have asked their colleague Jenny Too to slow her English down so they can understand her contributions during debates. Jubilee Party recommended Too to the Assembly to honour her father, former Nominated MP Mark Too, who died a year ago.

We are requesting that she slows down so that some of us can comprehend what she is saying," he said on Thursday. "We would like to understand what she is saying, Mr Speaker Sir." He added that Too should understand they do not have the same capacity to grasp the language. Speaker David Kiplagat asked Too to speak slowly. “I don’t know, Honourable Jenny, if it’s possible that you slow down or something like that so that your colleagues can hear you clearly." Too, a graduate of Daystar University, apologised to members and agreed to be considerate. “Mr Speaker, I apologise to members. My English can sometimes be very fast but I understand and will comply with the request," she said. Too spoke in favour of a motion for Jackson Mandago's administration to recognise and reward the best farmers to motivate them. The motion was tabled by Cheptiret ward representative Gilbert Tenai. "Mr Speaker Sir, the angle I chose to look is that of a young man who wakes up every morning and plants cabbages that are sold all the way to Kiambu, and maybe the gentleman makes Sh1,000 in a month," she said. "It would be great and humbling to see such people recognised as they contribute to feeding the nation." She noted the county is Kenya's bread basket. Click here for the latest political news
