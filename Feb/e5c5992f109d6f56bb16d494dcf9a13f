Residents of Lari want NASA’s Miguna Miguna moved from the area’s police station, saying his presence has increased tension. “Who is Miguna to us? He has caused unnecessary tension. If at all he has to be detained, let him be moved elsewhere or be released on a bond,” resident Caroline Wanjiku told the Star on the phone yesterday. She said she is a regular at the police station, but yesterday she was asked for her ID. “Officers we speak with everyday, even crack jokes, are not smiling. They are heavily armed and we are keeping away,” Wanjiku said. Miguna was arrested at his Runda home last Friday and taken to Kiambu police station before he was later transferred to Githunguri. Lawyer Edwin Sifuna said Miguna was transferred from Githunguri to Lari on Friday, but officers at Lari have denied he is at the station.
