The Kenya Livestock Marketing Council has urged the national and county governments to prepare early for drought to alleviate the suffering herders go through every year. National chairman Dubat Amey yesterday said the short and long rains that were expected early and late last year failed in many parts of the northern counties and this year’s drought would be severe. “Drought is a complex matter. It requires concerted efforts — joint planning by all stakeholders and the private sector,” he said. “Indications point to a severe drought this year. We must start preparing early to avoid losses of livelihoods and human lives.” Amey warned that open water sources such as earth dams and wells will dry up in the next four to six weeks because of the sunny conditions that started last month. The average distance to water points for both households and livestock are likely to increase, he said. The council wants the governments to launch a livestock offtake programme so animals are bought from herders for slaughter when they are still in good condition and can fetch better returns. “We don’t want to wait until the animals are emaciated to start the programme. Purchase of animals should start early,” Amey said. For long-term solutions, he said the counties must develop policies to guide feed production and allocate funds for mitigation measures. “Counties like Garissa, Isiolo, Mandera and Tana River that have throughflow rivers should utilise the water to grow fodder — with respective counties providing seeds, fertiliser and other resources,” Amey said, urging the national government to allocate funds for the activities. He also urged MPs to pass laws that would support the activities.
