Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter has denied allegations that he presented forged Sh633 million Treasury Bills to the Central Bank of Kenya. The legislator, in criticising the manner in which the state handled his arrest on Friday, said he was at CBK on invitation of Governor Patrick Njoroge. He accused those behind his arrest, terming them as well-connected individuals working at CBK, of an attempt to cover up a "fraud committed against Desai Industries".

CBK second letter to Desai Industries following their query on the Sh633million Treasury Bills. /COURTESY In a statement on Saturday, Keter said this was the reason the media were allegedly given a script of what to report and himself denied a chance to give his side of the story. "I am neither a director nor a shareholder of Desai Industries on whose behalf the Treasury Bills were presented. Why then was I arrested?" he asked. The legislator added that CBK should be questioned on the matter following its letter to Desai on July 10, 2017 which stated that the bills had been paid. The said letter, signed by Jeremiah Tomno and John Njau, states in part: "After a perusal of our records, the Treasury Bills in question had been redeemed and proceeds therefrom paid in full."

At what point did they become fictitious if the same had been procedurally redeemed?" "Moreover, if CBK was communicating with Desai Industries, why did they not deem fit to arrest the said directors as early as July 2017?" he asked.

"The most fundamental question however remains, who was the beneficiary of redemption of Treasury Bills No. 1138 and 1148. When was this amount paid, to which bank account, and for what value?" the legislator asked.

The MP said he will not relent in the fight to ensure Kenyans investing in the country are not exploited and their rights infringed upon at will by the state. "This, I vow to continue even if my actions will lead to such unprocedural arrests and detentions." "I will not relent. I refuse to be intimidated and will not be cowed by those who seek to exploit Kenyans with impunity," he said in the statement.
