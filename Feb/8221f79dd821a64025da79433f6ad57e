A plain clothes police officer has allegedly killed the student leader of Meru University of Science and Technology. Evans Njoroge, who was student council Secretary General, was killed at around 1pm on Tuesday afternoon during demonstrations against matters including school fee hikes. The incident took place at a farm about a kilometre away from the institution. "A plain clothes policeman chased Njoroge and shot him in the head in a banana plantation. It's like he targeted Njoroge as he was with his colleagues who were not shot," a learner said at the scene. A crowd of students chased journalists and Red Cross officials from the scene. The body had not been retrieved from the scene by press time. Police ad the university did not answer calls for comment on the matter. Njoroge had been vocal in his push for students' rights. On February 2, he accused the university's management of hiking fees and failing to adhere to guidelines by the Education ministry. “We are here to continue with our push for justice. This is our fifth strike in one semester. We ask the ministry to look into the fee issue," he said at the time, shielded by other students from police officers who wanted to arrest him. "While other universities pay Sh33,000 in an academic year, we are required to pay more than Sh50,000." Njoroge accused Vice Chancellor Japheth Magambo of failing to honour a pledge to reduce the fees by Sh8,500 as agreed in a meeting between management and student leaders. The students have been engaging police in running battles since institution was closed indefinitely earlier this month. In November 2016, the institution was closed indefinitely by the senate after students went on a rampage following the death of their colleague. The learners accused the university's administration of negligence, saying it failed to treat their ailing colleague in good time.
