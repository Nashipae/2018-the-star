Treasury is withholding more than Sh4.2 billion required to pay farmers who delivered maize to the NCPB since last December. Some farmers yesterday protested against the delay by the National Cereals and Produce Board in paying them. They said if the money is not released they will not plant more maize. The next planting season starts next month. The farmers, led by Kimutai Kolum and Kipkorir Menjo, said the government has reneged on its promise to pay them promptly for the maize delivered. “If they continue withholding the money we will not be able to plan on how to buy farm inputs for the next planting season,” Kolum said in Eldoret town. Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe has said the state will release the money from next week. “We will pay them as soon as possible because they have to start preparations for the next planting season,” he said on the phone. The NCPB planned to buy about two million bags of maize using the Sh6 billion set aside. The board was allowed to surpass the plan and buy more than 2.7 million bags worth more than Sh8 billion. It has paid half of the farmers’ dues. Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba wants the government to increase funding to NCPB and the Agricultural Finance Corporation. Khaemba has faulted the government over poor planning and lack of support for farmers. Khaemba said the government has always readily availed money for importation of maize but is reluctant to support farmers financially. The county boss said money invested on Galana-Kulalu irrigation project would have been more useful if it was used to support other institutions like the NCPB.
