Former Nyamira MCAs on Monday camped at the county assembly premises demanding to be paid their Sh33 million gratuity. Led by former Kemera member Mating'a Nyachaki, the lot said the money was supposed to be paid immediately their tenure ended. The former legislators said they will camp at the county assembly building until they are paid their money. "We are urging the county assembly of Nyamira to ensure we are given the money since it was deducted from our salaries." "If the money is not made available to us, we should be informed where it is," Nyachaki told journalists at the county assembly. He said each of the former MCAs is entitled to Sh1 million including other benefits like airtime. They accused the assembly clerk of tossing them around whenever they demand to be paid the said monies. "We know the tricks they are playing. We will camp here until we get the way forward since the negotiations we held on the same bore no fruit at all." The former MCA's held a morning meeting with officials from the assembly in a bid to resolve the pay puzzle. However, the closed-door meeting seemed to have ended in disarray after the apparently dissatisfied members came out shouting. "We have not received any formal information on why our gratuity is being delayed. Most of us depend on the same and we have lots of responsibilities," Nyachaki said.
