A thrilling 20-minutes spell at the start of the second half made up for missed opportunities in the opening period as Kariobangi Sharks and Vihiga United battled to a 2-2 draw in a see-saw Kenyan Premier League clash at Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos yesterday. Andrew Murunga fired Vihiga into the lead two minutes after the restart but the lead barely lasted as Ebrima Sanneh capitalized on the visitors’ sloppy defence to equalize for Sharks. Sharks went in front for the first time as Eric Kapaito headed in the second in the 57th minute but Murunga was on hand six minutes later to restore parity. Kariobangi Sharks were the better side in the opening quarter of the match and should have taken a 15th minute lead when Eric Babulo fed Sanneh but from point blank range, the normally ice cold goal-getter could not beat custodian Barnabas Tiema. It was a huge let off for Vihiga who had been under pressure right from kick off. Patila Omoto and Bolton Omwenga took turns to test Tiema with long range efforts but the experienced shot-stopper was in his element. Charles Okwemba’s acrobatic effort after good work by Dennis Wafula went over. Sharks are now on four points, same as Bandari who drew 0-0 with Chemelil Sugar, while it was the first top flight point for Edward Manoah’s Vihiga United. On Saturday, Nakumatt FC and Thika United played to a 3-3 draw. Masakidi Mata grabbed a brace for Thika, getting his first in the sixth minute before Saad Musa Abdalla scored at the quarter hour mark to make it 2-0 in favour of Thika. Cornelius Juma pulled one back for Nakumatt in the 32nd minute but Thika responded by raiding them more and were rewarded in the 43rd minute, Mata scoring his second for the day. The drama was far from over as Donald Musoti scored for Nakumatt just before the break, game going into halftime with Thika leading 3-2.
