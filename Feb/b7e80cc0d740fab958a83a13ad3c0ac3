Unep has urged people around the world to “break up” with plastics as they prepare to mark Valentine’s Day. In a two-minute Valentine’s Day clip called It’s not me, it’s you, the UN says plastics remain a major source of pollution. Valentine’s Day is marked annually on February 14. The film explores dependence on single-use plastics and the struggle to break the dependence. The video has a happy ending-the main character finds new love in sustainable alternatives. Head of UN Environment Erik Solheim said the love with disposable plastics has a toxic side effect. “This Valentine’s Day we are urging people to break up with throwaway bottles, straws, utensils and bags and help turn tide on plastic waste,” Solheim says. Kenya banned plastic bags on August 28 last year, earning support far and wide. The Environment ministry is now contemplating action on plastic bottles.
