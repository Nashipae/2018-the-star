  Former Agriculture CS yesterday told a parliamentary committee the corruption allegations levelled against him were a fabrication by “enemies of development”. Speaking when he appeared before the National Assembly’s committee on Justice and Legal Affairs which was vetting him for the position of Judicial Service Commission member, Koskei said he has never recorded a statement with the EACC. “The enemies of development sneaked my name into the envelope that was tabled in Parliament. I went to the EACC to find out the allegations, but they had nothing against me. From that day to date, no one has ever contacted me,” Koskei told the committee. Koskei stepped down in 2015 to pave way for investigations into corruption allegations. He told the committee he is worth Sh867 million. Koskei promised that should his name sail through the vetting process, he will team up with other commissioners in the JSC to deal with corruption and ensure efficiency in delivery of services. He said he will use his expertise and experience in procurement to put strategies to help the Judiciary and its staff dispense justice on time.
