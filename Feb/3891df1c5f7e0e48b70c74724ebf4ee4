Immediate former Enviroment CS Judi Wakhungu,who has been named an ambassador, yesterday denied claims she has been demoted. She said in fact, she was assigned a new role due to her exemplary performance in her previous position. Wakhungu has been proposed as Kenya’s Ambassador to France. She told MPs vetting her that she was purposely nominated by the President to help him implement the “Big Four” agenda. “This is not a demotion but a chance to further my best performance in the international world,” she said before the National Assembly Defence and Foreign Relations committee. “My nomination is an affirmation of the record I left in the Environment ministry.” Wakhungu’s legacy is best marked by being the one who implemented the ban on plastic bags. The ban, which followed the example set by Rwanda, drew international praise.
