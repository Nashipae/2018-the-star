Police in Wajir on Friday evening intercepted 731kg bhang in Buna subcounty, Wajir. Wajir East police boss Jotham Wanyama said the bhang, whose street value was Sh7.3 million, was smuggled from Ethiopia. The police got a tipoff from the public. “We acted immediately. We found the truck driver and arrested him. The consignment is in police custody,” Wanyama said. Drug abuse among the youth is on the rise in Garissa, Wajir and Mandera. This has been blamed for increased school dropouts. Last week while on an inspection tour of Mandera, Northeastern Pharmacists and Poisons Board regional head Ali Omar voiced concern at the increasing number of addicts. He said some have turned to prescription drugs and cited Codein Syrup, saying it is used by some youths.
