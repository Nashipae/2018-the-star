Four people were killed and two others left nursing serious injuries after clashes erupted over the murder of a widow by an unidentified number of herders on the Tora Es- tate, Juja subcounty. Trouble began at around 5am yesterday, when a group of herdsmen cut through a farm fence belonging to Jacinta Wan- gari and drove their cattle to graze on her maize plantation. When Wangari and her two sons demanded an explanation from the herders, an argument ensued, prompting one of them to cut the mother on the forehead using a sword. The two sonsÂ raised the alarm to alert the neighbours who are said to have responded almost immediately. They then rushed her to a hospital in Thika before she was referred to Thika Level 5 Hospital, where she was pronounced dead on arrival. The news of her death elicited anger and ire among the locals who mobilised themselves and indiscrimi- nately started attacking any person of Maasai origin they found in the fields. This led to five herders being seriously injured by the mob, three of them succumbing to their injuries while being at- tended to at the Thika Level 5 Hospital.
