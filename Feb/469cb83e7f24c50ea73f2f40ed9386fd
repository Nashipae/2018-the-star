The Kakamega assembly resumes sittings next Tuesday. The vetting of nominees for the county Members of Executive Committee will be top on the agenda. Governor Wycliffe Oparanya will deliver his first address to the second assembly in the afternoon the same day. He is expected to outline his development agenda for his second and final term to the assembly. The governor’s agenda will guide the legislative agenda for the county assembly. The assembly will thereafter debate his speech for three days. “The first thing after the governor’s speech will be the vetting and approval of the names of the nominees to the county cabinet, because the names are already with the assembly,” assembly clerk Patrick Kamwesser said. Majority leader Joel Ongoro said members have not agreed on the vetting process. A group of opposition members say CECs who were retained in their current dockets should not be vetted. “Those who were moved to other departments must be vetted alongside the new entrants, because they have not been tested in their new dockets,” Sheywe MCA Job Mwamto said.
