World renowned motivational speaker Kute Blackson is in town for an inspirational talk titled 'All Lights On'. The charismatic visionary and transformational teacher was not deterred by the tense political climate. "I've been feeling a calling to speak across the world, and I felt it was time for me to speak in Africa," he said. "Kenya is the first place and I feel like something is happening in Africa. Kenyan has great potential and we're already doing great things, there is such potential to impact the African continent to really go to the next level." So, what is this calling? "I help people access the levels of their own consciousness and unleash more of their potential. I'm here to help people of Kenya do that. Expect radical transformation, expect miracles. Expect breakthroughs beyond your imagination." He was ordained as a minister at the age of 14 by his father, but felt of a different calling altogether. "My father has 300 churches in West Africa. He was the spiritual teacher to three former presidents and two kings of Ashanti, and some of the nations around. I started speaking at my father's church when I was eight and when I was 14 I was ordained as a minister. I knew that wasn't my path and I went in a whole different direction. I felt a deep calling, a burning desire. I felt so many people in pain and I wanted to help them." He is also the author of the national bestselling book, You. Are. The. One. "The book is about helping you to find purpose. We were born free. As we get older, what happens to the freedom? Trauma, hurt, divorce... We start shutting down, becoming someone we are not. The book is helping you to be yourself, freedom."
