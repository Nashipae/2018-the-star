Bien and Chiki are so cute and they are body goals, too. Have you seen how Chiki works the floor? You got to love her. Their relationship has been through so much, from when guys said he was cheating on her, to when we all thought they had broken up. As a sign of love for Chiki, he probably wanted to make a grand gesture to also prove us wrong on any doubt when it comes to their love. Chiki posted a video on her Insta stories, pretty much excited about her new toy. She said she will have a good week having a new car and she thanked her gifter. Now we are not going to assume it's a friend. I mean with this economy, there needs to be some serious love. She did not mention who gave her the gift, but we will go ahead and assume love runs the world and is about to run the streets of Nairobi, so Bien it is. So dear men, the bar has been set, what's your Valentine's gift plan?
