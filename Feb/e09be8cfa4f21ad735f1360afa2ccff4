Terrorism, lack of employment opportunities for youth and drought have been cited as the major challenges derailing devolution in Garissa county. Governor Ali Korane said al Shabaab attacks over the last seven years have scared away potential investors. Drought has led to loss of livelihoods as livestock perish. Korane said the county has enough resources to attract investors. He cited the Tana River, which flows for about 400 kilometres in the county and reliable underground water that can be used for large-scale irrigation. “No one is ready to come to Garissa because they fear they will lose their investment due to insecurity,” Korane said. He called on the state to strengthen security. Korane spoke at a Garissa hotel during a meeting with Swiss ambassador to Kenya Ralf Heckner and a delegation of UN implementing agencies’ representatives. The representatives were led by resident coordinator Siddharth Chatterjee. Korane said he was ready to engage donors to bridge the budget deficit on development programmes. He lamented the perennial drought, saying it had led to destitution among herders who lose their livestock. “In the absence of alternative sources of income, our people have been forced to depend on food handouts from the government and donors,” Korane said. Heckner said devolution will turnaround the county’s economy. He said they were ready to help the county develop. Devolution PS Michael Bowen said the national government is keen on helping regions initially marginalised to pick up. Bowen cited the creation of Arid and Semi-Arid Lands as a department of the national government as proof that the Jubilee administration was keen on developing the regions. The delegation toured Garissa after making a similar trip to Lamu. They will move to Wajir, Isiolo, Marsabit, Tana River and Mandera counties that are members of the regional economic bloc. The bloc aims to enhance and realise development goals for the seven frontier ASAL counties.
