The High Court yesterday declined to suspend the government’s declaration that deported Opposition activist Miguna Miguna is a prohibited immigrant. Justice Chacha Mwita gave the Attorney General until tomorrow to respond, enabling the court to give proper directions. The self-proclaimed National Resistant Movement ‘General’, who was deported on Wednesday last week, has launched a fierce legal battle to have the Jubilee administration compelled to facilitate his unconditional return. Lawyers John Khaminwa, Nelson Havi, Waikwa Wanyoike and Apollo Mboya yesterday urged judge Mwita to suspend the declaration by Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i, pending determination of the case. Khaminwa accused the Immigration department of failing to give Miguna a fair hearing. He was removed from the country in blatant disobedience of court orders, he said. “We urge you to give orders so he can be returned to participate in the proceedings pending before court. We require promptness to restore the rule of law,” Khaminwa said. hearing on Friday Waikwa said Miguna was entitled to a fair hearing. He asked how and he was taken to Kajiado where a charge sheet indicated he was a Kenyan, but was deported three hours later. The application was opposed by AG’s lawyer Charles Mutinda. “Citizenship is a question of facts. There were underlying facts that need to be brought to the court,” he said. Miguna’s lawyers will submit further responses by tomorrow mid-day ahead of the hearing of the case on Friday at noon.
