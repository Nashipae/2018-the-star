People illegally occupying land around Lake Ol Bolossat and its catchment areas will be forcefully evicted if they don't leave in 90 days. Outgoing Environment CS Judi Wakhungu made this announcement on Friday, noting the gazetting of the only lake in Mt Kenya region as a protected wetlands area. Wakhungu said she signed documents concerning the area in the Aberdare Ranges on January 24. "The documents are now with the Attorney General but the effective date of the gazzetement of Lake Ol bolossat was January 24," she said during World Wetlands Day celebrations. "Therefore, effective January 24, 2018, Lake Ol Bolossat was a protected wetlands area." Following the declaration, National Land Commission chairman Muhammad Swazuri announced that all title deeds for the land stood dissolved. Swazuri noted that according to sections 10,11, and 12 of Lands Act, 2012, the issuance of a gazette notice means the title deed of the land in question, and any others issued prior to the notice, cease. “In other words, once the notice has been given in favour of one person, no other person should hold another title deed. The implication is that all other titles in the area literally die," he said The chairman said he visited the lake in 2015 and informed those living in the area that their titles were illegal, but that they ignored him. He said the NLC will publish notices national newspapers and that after their expiry, the Nyandarua governor and county commissioner will lead forceful evictions. “According to Sections 152(a), 152(b), and 152(c) of Land Laws Amendment Act, 2016, we are giving you 90 days to vacate," he said. “We shall re-establish the boundaries to include the catchment areas because the problem started with people constructing, developing or cutting trees on catchment areas."
