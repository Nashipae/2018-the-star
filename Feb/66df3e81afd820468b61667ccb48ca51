A major standoff is looming over the nomination of members to the
Parliamentary Service Commission as elections take place today. MPs from the
coalition's affiliate parties yesterday differed over the decision by Kalonzo Musyoka's Wiper to front Borabu MP Ben
Momanyi to one of the seats. Addressing the media at
Parliament Buildings, they said coalition leaders were not consulted. The MPs include Godfrey
Osotsi (nominated), Ahmed
Kolish (Wajir West), Mark Nyamita (Uriri) and Janet
Ong’era (Kisii). Read: NASA won't give names of members to vet CSs, Mbadi tells Muturi MPs will elect seven members to the PSC. Yesterday, the Jubilee Parliamentary Group meeting chaired by
President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto resolved to kick out some NASA nominees. Osotsi said Kalonzo
wrote to Speaker Justin Muturi approving Momanyi's nomination. “We had agreed on
the issue of sharing of PSC slots but Kalonzo decided to write to the
Speaker, without consulting the coalition parties,” he said. "Instead of accepting the letter,
Muturi should have withdrawn that process and reverted back to the
coalition." Uriri said: “The
only thing we are awaiting from Wiper is when Kalonzo will be sworn
in. The Speaker should not receive any letter except from NASA as a
coalition”.  Click here for the latest political news
