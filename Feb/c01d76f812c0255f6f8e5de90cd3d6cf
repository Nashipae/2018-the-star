Kitui Governor Kaluki Ngilu has obtained court orders blocking police from arresting her for incitement. Kitui Resident Magistrate Ruth Mutende issued the orders on Tuesday. Ngilu is accused of asking locals to deal with pastoralists and charcoal dealers "who have invaded the county". On Sunday, she denied allegations she was targeting dealers from one community in the crackdown on charcoal trade. The NCIC had summoned the Governor to defend herself on the claims. "Following the utterances by Ngilu in regards to charcoal burning, the commission has summoned the Governor in a letter dated February 14," Kaparo said via twitter last Thursday. Sources say Ngilu has so far recorded a statement with the DCI officers in the county. The Governor has maintained that the ban on charcoal burning has been in force since 2014 and that the county is only enforcing the Kitui County Charcoal Management Act. But Kiambu boss Ferdinand Waititu criticised her over the matter saying she should not incite the public to take the law into their own hands. Waititu, who led protests outside his office last week in a demand for Ngilu's arrest, noted nobody should order the destruction of people's property. He said leaders in Ukambani should not create feuds among Kenyans.
