Police in Kikuyu are looking for the driver of a vehicle which hit a boda boda rider and his passenger at Acre Tano area on Nairobi-Nakuru highway on Saturday. Area police boss Eunia Wako said the pillion passenger was a matatu driver who was heading to work at the time of the accident. "The rider and his pillion passenger were heading towards Nairobi when an unknown vehicle is suspected to have hit them from
behind. They died on the spot." Simon Kamau, a witness, said he heard a loud bang only to learn after some minutes that one of them had been hit by a vehicle. "We didn't think of it as a serious accident since traffic kept flowing on both sides of the road," Kamau said. Kamau said one body was run on by other vehicles, while the other one lay at the roadside after the motorcycle landed in a ditch. Wako urged the boda boda riders to be extra careful while using the highway so as to avoid accidents. The riders urged other motorists to respect them as road users.
