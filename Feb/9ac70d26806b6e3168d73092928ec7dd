County hospitals will soon be restocked with medicines after operating for more than eight months without supplies. The Kenya Medical Supplies Authority - the county's main supplier - stopped provisions in June last year over a Sh285 debt. The Star has established that the county, through the Finance and Health departments, has been engaging Kemsa officials to resume supplies. The two parties have agreed that Kemsa resume supplies next week and the county pay part of the debt. Health executive Hitan Majevda confirmed that he and officers from the Finance department have been meeting Kemsa. “Yes that is true but we have not agreed on how much we will pay, though we are meeting today again to see if we can reach consensus,” he said. Majevda last month ruled out paying Kemsa until an audit ordered by the governor on all pending bills is completed. But it seems the county leadership has softened it stance following public outcry. The county's 78 health facilities have been transferring poor patients to private hospitals. But most residents, especially those from slums, complain that services at private hospitals are too expensive. County-owned hospitals have grappled with myriad challenges, including poor management, shortage of staff and dilapidated structures. Majevda said more than half of residents — about three million people, mostly slum dwellers — have no medical cover. They pay for their medication out-of-pocket and rely on public health facilities. Last year, he initiated talks with the National Hospital Insurance Fund to introduce special health cover for the poor who would pay Sh200 instead of the minimum Sh500 monthly subscription. Most residents have been avoiding county facilities because of poor services. Some go to Kenyatta National Hospital, a national referral facility. In 2016, Health CS Cleopa Mailu said his ministry would support City Hall to improve its facilities to ease congestion at KNH.
