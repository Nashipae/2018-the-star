National Olympic Committee of Kenya has put in place measures to curb against joyriders and missing kit for the forthcoming Commonwealth Games slated for April 4-15 in Gold Coast, Australia. Team Kenya chef de mission, Barnaba Korir, said the Nock executive and steering committee, have devised ways of ensuring that only genuine athletes and officials travel for the club games. He said unlike in the past, where countries were free to field teams without limits, this time the Commonwealth Games Federation have allocated quotas and Nock is to ensure that only genuine participants and officials are accredited through scrutiny. “As steering committee, we have been scrutinising the names that have been availed by the various sporting federations to ensure no person is sneaked in,” he said. Koris said sports apparel manufacturers, Nike will personally do the distribution of kit and equipment from shipping to clearance at the airport. “No Nock official will this time be involved in the clearance of the kit and equipment. Nike will use their agents to ferry and clear them at the airport, then hand over at Nocks headquarters for onward distribution by the steering committee,” he said. Korir said the kit and equipment will be passed to individual athletes who will append their signatures upon receiving them. The CDM said they are yet receive names from only two out of the 14 sporting disciplines thus —swimming and cycling–but expected them by the end of this week. He said the teams are expected to report to the training camp on March 2 before the first batch jets out on March 24. Marathoners will be last group to leave by on April 8.
