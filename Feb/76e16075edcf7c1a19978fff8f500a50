Interior CS Fred Matiang’i and IG Joseph Boinnet have been directed to personally appear in court and explain their failure to restore former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka’s security detail, despite an order. High Court judge Roselyn Aburili summoned the two to show cause why they should not be jailed for contempt of court. On February 7, Aburili ordered the two to reinstate Kalonzo’s security after it was withdrawn a week earlier. In the orders, Aburili stopped the state from withdrawing Kalonzo’s security detail. The court further suspended the revocation of Kalonzo’s firearm licence by the Firearm Licensing Board. Kalonzo yesterday told the court the state had not complied with its orders. The NASA co-principal has sued the state for withdrawing his security and revoking his firearm licence. REVENGE ATTACKS In his petition, Kalonzo asked the court to bar the state from cancelling his licence. He was one of the opposition leaders whose firearm licences were revoked by the government. Kalonzo faulted the move, saying it was done without notice. He said it was a breach of the Retirement Benefits Act of 2015, which entitles him to state security. Kalonzo told the court that the government had not explained to him why he was unfit to be entrusted with a firearm as required. The Wiper party leader said he has not violated conditions for possessing a gun to warrant the state’s move. “The unilateral action has exposed me and my family to revenge attacks,” Kalonzo said. The government withdrew security at Kalonzo’s three homes in Karen, Tseikuru and Yatta after NASA co-principal Raila Odinga’s sweaing-in on january 30. He accused the government of acting in bad faith, unfairly and with improper motive. Kalonzo was given the firearm certificate in 1998 and owns a Beretta pistol. The case will be mentioned on April 12, when Matiang’i and Boinnet are expected to appear in court.
