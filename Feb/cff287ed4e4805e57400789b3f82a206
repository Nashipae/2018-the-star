Collective Management Organisations will be scrapped and the Kenya Revenue Authority take over the collecting and remitting of royalties if the Copyright Bill 2017 is enacted. MMC Africa law partner Bernard Musyoka said the bill, which proposes radical changes to the Copyright Act, can be viewed as an effort to bolster accountability and verifiability in handling of royalties. “Considering the national scope of collection of such royalties, it is arguable that the KRA has greater collection capability, as already applied with taxes and county revenue collection, compared to individual CMOs,” he said. Musyoka said this particular clause, if adopted and enacted, might also reduce the exceptional administrative costs CMOs bear, which artistes have consistently complained of. The Copyright Bill also proposes that the Kenya Copyright Board be granted the mandate to inspect and supervise various aspects of CMOs’ operations, including the books of accounts and organisational records. It goes ahead to state that the person authorised in writing by Kecobo to investigate the CMO will submit a report on any arising issues that in their opinion requires a forensic audit or remedial action. Details that would warrant a CMO being investigated include failure to account for exploitation of works assigned or licensed to it, allegations of a CMO acting beyond its power, alteration of a CMO’s memorandum or internal rules to change its core business or exclude a section of its members, and a failure by a CMO to comply with a request for information or records. “It is in the best interests of all stakeholders to support this Copyright Bill. It is a significant step in the clarification of various uncertainties that exist in Kenya’s copyright legislation, and it could also relieve other stakeholders of persistent debates on pertinent issues of law through the certainty of having both an official copyright register and a distinct Copyright Tribunal to adjudge relevant disputes,” Musyoka added.
