Three elephants in the Rimoi National Game Reserve in Elgeyo Marakwet have been killed as as a result of human-wildlife conflicts. KWS said one of the jumbos was killed as it sought water from a borehole on the border of Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo counties. River Kerio, the main water source for wildlife in the park has dried up. Warden Melipiche Letomo yesterday warned that poachers were capitilising on the rising human-wildlife conflicts to kill elephants for tusks. On Tuesday, a carcass of an elephant was discovered without tusks. “We have lost three elephants over the last one month because of conflicts over water,” Letomo said. The drying up of River Kerio means boreholes adjacent to the reserve remain the only source of water for livestock and wild animals. Locals asked KWS to provide water for the wild animals.
