Generation Kenya program is set to increase its presence to all the 47 counties by 2022. Currently it operates in 17 counties including Nairobi, Embu, Mombasa and Kisumu. The USAID-funded program which empowers youth by imparting skills that will make them competitive in the job market has since its inception two and a half years ago graduated over 7, 900 youth and 89 per cent of the graduates are already in worthwhile careers. “Due to the receivership of the program in the country we are going to operate in all the 47 counties by the year 2022 so as not to leave any Kenyan out in imparting skills and sharpen them for the job competitive market’” Generation operative manager Douglass Moseti said during the graduation ceremony of Generation program 2017. Speaking during the graduation ceremony, Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja said that it is important for private entities to work hand in hand with the national government to instill the youth with expertise in various sectors to grow the economy. “By 2020 the US and Kenya hopes to have assisted Kenyan youth get over 80, 000 productive jobs and am impressed that 50 per cent of the program’s graduates are women showing that the gender inequality has been broken,” US ambassador to Kenya Robert Godec said.
