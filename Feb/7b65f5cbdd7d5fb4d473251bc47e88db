The Labour Court in Kisumu is today expected to give a ruling on whether the embattled Bungoma public service board will continue being in office or not. This is after it team was sent home by Bungoma ward representatives. A board member had filed an application seeking to stop their dismissal. The court directed the members remain in office, pending today’s ruling. . The board’s tenure expires next year. Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati and the board have been feuding over county appointments. Wangamati accused the board of demanding a Sh50,000 bribe from job applicants. But chairman Gideon Sirai has denied the claims. The board accused Wangamati of interfering with its work and wanting to influence how it appoints staff. Last November, the county Public Administration Committee, led by Naitiri Kabuyefwe MCA Joan Lukatiri, investigated the board. It presented its findings and MCAs voted to kick out the board. This follows a petition by activist Moses Lukoye who accused the board of lacking integrity and asking for bribes from job seekers on September 31 last year. The board comprises Sirai , Janet Manyasi, Elizabeth Wanyonyi, Peter Masengeli, Steven Wesonga and Bonvenja Wasikoyo.
