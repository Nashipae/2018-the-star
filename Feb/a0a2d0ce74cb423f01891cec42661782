North Mugirango MP Joash Nyamoko has told former Kitutu Masaba legislator Timothy Bosire to give his predecessor time to work. Nyamoko said now that an election petition against election of Jubilee Party’s Shadrack Mose has been upheld by the High Court, Bosire should allow him ‘time to breathe’. The petition filed by Justus Omiti was dismissed last week and the court slapped him with Sh5 million in costs. On Tuesday, Nyamoko said, “Bosire should refrain from constant attacks on his successor. We gave him space to work when he was an MP and we expect the same from him.” Last week, Bosire, the ODM national treasurer, said Mose was imposed on the people of Kitutu Masaba. When the petition was dismissed last week, Mose asked Bosire to join him in developing the constituency. Mose warned against retrogressive politics.
