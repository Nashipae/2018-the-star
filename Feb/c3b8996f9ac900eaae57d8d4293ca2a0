Ugandan singer Mowzey Radio died yesterday morning after a bar brawl last week that left him with a head injury. The Goodlyfe Crew artiste, real name Moses Ssekibogo, has been in a coma for days. The management of Case Hospital said in a statement they "regret to announce the passing on of Moses Ssekibogo, alias Moze Radio, on February 1, 2018, at 6am." Radio was reportedly being beaten into coma at De Bar, a hangout spot in Entebbe town. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni tweeted, "I had only recently made a financial contribution towards his treatment and hoped he would get better. He was a talented young person with a great future ahead of him. May he rest in peace."
