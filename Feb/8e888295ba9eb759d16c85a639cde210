The team that vetted President Uhuru
Kenyatta’s nine Cabinet nominees has been drafting its report in Naivasha and is
expected to table it in the House tomorrow. Vetting by the National Assembly is an
admirable aspect of our new Constitution, meant to ensure public appointees go
through a vigorous and transparent system. This is calculated to weed out
nominees of questionable background and retain only the very best for public
service. Questions have however emerged on the
seriousness with which the Speaker Justin Muturi-led Committee on Appointments
conducted the vetting. Committee members asked eight of the nine
questions about their academic backgrounds, but never asked Rashid Achesa of
Sports and Heritage any question about his education, let alone any serious
question on any other aspect. In the US, for example, the Congress and
Senate are known to grill vigorously presidential nominees and even reject
those who fall short of the threshold. In Kenya no nominee has ever been rejected,
despite glaring anomalies. Parliament is in danger of losing the essence of the
process. It is possible that Parliament has been very successful
in vetting or has it seriously failed in this key role.  Quote of the Day: “Don’t interfere with anything in the Constitution. That must be maintained, for it is the only safeguard of our liberties.” — US President Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809.
