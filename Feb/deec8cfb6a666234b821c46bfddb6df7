Kenya Prisons setter Joy Lusenaka will be making her debut at the Africa Club Championships following the unavailability of regular Jane Wacu, who is away on attachment with club Anse Royale (ARSU) of Seychelles. Luseneka has played second fiddle to Wacu for the longest time and she will now have a chance to prove herself during next month’s championships in Cairo, Egypt. Prisons will be seeking to upgrade the bronze medal they won during the previous edition won by SF de Carthage while El Shams took the silver. Lusenaka’s highlight tournament at the international level was the 2015 All Africa Games where she helped Team Kenya to the gold medal. Going by these credentials, Luseneka looks the outright choice in Josp Barasa’s starting line-up, relegating Herman Kipyegon to the bench. Barasa said the two setters are ready to step up to the task and are high in confidence ahead of the March 5-18 championships. “As a player when you know you are the first choice in a certain department, there is some feeling of ownership and Joy is not any different- she is in high spirit alongside Herman,” noted Barasa, who is also the national women’s team assistant coach. “Definitely, we will miss Wacu services. She has been a crucial player for us but we wish her well in her assignments. Currently, 19 players are training at the Safaricom Indoor Arena and they have shown growth and improvement. Technical bench will be spoilt for choice when we name the final squad of 14 players in a fortnight.” Barasa at the same time noted there were no injuries recorded and all the departments have gelled well in time. “All the training seasons are a joy to watch. We will use the few remaining weeks to tighten our lose ends,” added Barasa.
