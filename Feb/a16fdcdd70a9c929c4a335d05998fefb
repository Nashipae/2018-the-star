Eric Ooko extended his lead on penultimate day of the fourth PGK Kenya Open qualifier to improve his chances of qualification. The home player took a three shot lead from Ngugi Njuguna of Nyali to stay atop the leader board for the second day running. “My swing was good today. The course is playing really true and I can’t wait to be among the qualifiers of the Kenya Open,” he said. Ooko said he hopes to also play well in the remaining qualifiers to improve his qualification chances. “The trick will be to remain focused and hit the fairways well,” continued Ooko. Whether home advantage is working out well for Ooko remains to be seen as the qualifiers end at Windsor next week. PGK Captain CJ Wangai said they will announce the Kenya Open full team after the Windsor qualifiers which will be the fifth in the series. “The system of qualification will this time round not be based on points but on general performance. This is to avoid complacency for those who might have qualified early,” said Wangai. Only four professionals have qualified so far. They are —South Africa based Stefan Anderson who got a wildcard and the trio of Rizwan Charania (Windsor), Simon Ngige (Thika Sports Club) and long hitter Dismas Indiza (Mumias), who made the cut at the Kenya Open last year. Indiza, Ngige and Charania have all given the Royal qualifiers a wide berth and are playing in the ongoing qualifiers as a formality. Meanwhile, Kenya Breweries Limited will today announce their sponsorship package for this year’s edition of the Barclays Kenya Open tournament. KBL managing director, Jane Karuku through the Johnnie Walker brand, will hand over a cheque donation to the tune of Sh6 million, an additional Sh1 million from last year’s sponsorship package for the tournament that is sure to surpass the success levels of previous editions of years gone by.
