Kenyans Daniel Kipchirchir Komen and Benard Ngeno are expected to provide the perfect challenge to race favourite Soufiane El Bakkali of Morocco during tomorrow’s edition of Almond Blossom Cross Country in Portugal. Komen’s is a familiar name, having raced to back-to-back 1500m silver medal finishes at the 2006 and 2008 IAAF World Indoor Championships. He is also, with a 3:33.08 best, the fourth fastest ever over the distance indoors. Ngeno is a less tested quantity. Most recently, he finished second at the 2017 Philadelphia Half Marathon clocking 1:02:38. El Bakkali remains the athlete to beat in the 9350m race going by his recent achievements. He is a world 3000m steeplechase silver medallist and was fourth at the 2016 Olympic Games in addition to finishing third at the Antrim Cross Country earlier this season. Three days ago, he clocked 7:41.88 over 3000m in Lievin, France, again finishing third. Rui Pedro Silva leads the home runners. The 36-year-old was second at this year’s national road race championship and sixth at the European Champion Clubs Cross Country Cup. Others to watch includes José Moreira, who was ninth at the 2009 World Championship marathon; and Hélder Santos and Tiago Costa, 10th and 11st, respectively at the national road race championship. Another team, Benfica, will be represented by Olympian Ricardo Ribas and Hermano Ferreira, who was 12th at national road race championship. Emily Jepkoech and Mercyline Jeronoh, winner of the Morlaix 10 km in 32:46, lead the onslaught in the women’s edition. Portuguese Carla Salomé Rocha is the leading home contender in the 6150m race. She won the 2016 edition of the race, when she became the national cross country champion. This year she was ninth in the Cross Italica in Seville. She followed that up with a 12th place showing at the European Champion Clubs Cross Country Cup, in Mira, and most recently, finished third at the Caceres Cross Country last weekend. Other Portuguese athletes are expected to be in the mix: Doroteia Peixoto, who was third in the Viana do Castelo half marathon in 1:18:40, and locals Vera Fernandes and Catarina Guerreiro, who were 15th and 19th in the national road race championship. Ana Dias, a former international who competed in 12 European Cross Country Championships and seven World Cross Country Championships, is also among the entrants.
