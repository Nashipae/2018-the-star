Kenya’s budgetary allocation to agriculture has been pegged at a paltry 2.4 per cent for the next five years (see p15). This is way lower than the Food and Agriculture Organisation’s recommended 10 per cent. This is surprising, given that agriculture and food security are key planks of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four legacy agenda. The bad news is contained in the government’s Budget Policy Statement now before the Budget committee of Parliament. A vibrant agricultural sector has many benefits and underwrites prosperity. It can pull millions of Kenyans out of poverty, reduce rural-urban migration and make Kenya a food exporting economy. Instead of importing food from Uganda, Kenya would have enough for its people and a surplus to earn it foreign exchange from exports. A more prosperous population would be a boon to national stability and a safeguard against Kenya’s toxic negative ethnicity and marginalisation narratives. The FAO’s guidelines might appear ambitious but the proposed 2.4 per cent is way too little. Agriculture should not be seen or looked down upon as just a source of our own food security but as a potential employer of millions of Kenyans — just like manufacturing. That is why budgetary allocation should be increased yearly across the next five years as a mark of the government’s commitment to food security and an unstinting war on poverty through job creation.
