At least 240 residents from Nyayo Road and Manyatta Chille in Marsabit have received land allotment letters after many years. Marsabit Governor Mohamud Ali handed over the letters to residents on Saturday. He, however, advised them against selling the lands, but instead utilise it to produce food. Ali also said the land documents can now be used as collateral to seek funds from financial institution. The county boss urged residents in Marsabit to maintain peace. He promised to prioritise street lighting and roads. The governor also said he will waive fees previously charged on insurance documents. Marsabit Deputy Governor Solomon Gubo urged residents to participate in public forums so they can forward their concerns and help the county government put their needs in the County Integrated Development Plan. Land chief officer Abdi Aila said lack of land registry office in Marsabit has hurt services. Residents, led by committee chairman Abdi Anno, requested the county government to light the streets so as to minimise crime, especially robberies.
