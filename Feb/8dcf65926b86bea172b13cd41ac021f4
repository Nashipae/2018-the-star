KDF soldiers have displayed utmost integrity and discipline in their service to the country, the president has said. Uhuru Kenyatta praised them on Thursday for fighting terrorism and supporting civil authorities in the maintenance of peace and security. He said Kenya Defence Forces have reduced al Shabaab's capacity to launch attacks in Kenya, contributing to peace in the region. The president noted that soldiers who lost their lives in the line of duty made sacrifices for Kenya's greater good. “Our engagement in Somalia and closer home in the multi-agency operation in Boni Forest have indeed degraded capacity of the alShabaab to launch attacks in the country and elsewhere," he said. “The gallant soldiers who lost their lives in the line of such duty did not do so in vain." He spoke during a pass-out parade at Moi Barracks Recruits Training College (RTC) in Eldoret. Uasin Gishu county. Uhuru noted the force is a symbol of nationhood and unity as it has members from all parts of the country. “Your unity and cohesion stand as proof of the greatness that can be achieved when we all live in harmony, irrespective of ethnicity, race religion or gender. It serves as an example to be emulated by all Kenyans." Uhuru also recognised the supportive role Kenya Defense Forces plays in development projects and the maintenance of law and order by civil authorities. He added the training offered at the college is of high quality. Governors Jackson Mandago and Alex Tolgos (Elgeyo Marakwet), Chief of Defence Forces Samson Mwathathe, Kesses MP Swarrup Mishra and several top military chiefs attended the ceremony.
