The government has revoked legislator Simba Arati's firearm licence in what is seen as a crackdown on National Resistance Movement members. The Firearms Licensing Board revoked the permit on Thursday and asked Arati to surrender his pistol and shotgun by close of business on Thursday. "You are unfit to be trusted with a firearm," noted board secretary Samwel Kimaru. The Dagoretti North MP is a member of the movement led by NASA boss Raila Odinga. On Tuesday,  Interior CS Fred Matiang'i invoked Section 22 of the Prevention Organised Crimes Act, 2010 to declare the opposition movement as "an organised criminal group". The NRM was formed on October 25, 2017, a day before the repeat polls were held.
