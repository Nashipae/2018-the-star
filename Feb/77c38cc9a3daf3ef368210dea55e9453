Police in Mwatate have netted more than 800 liters of illicit brew ‘bangara’ in Msisinenyi village. One person was arrested in the Saturday morning raid. The suspect, Constance Egwa, is said to be a notorious illicit brew trader in the area. Mwatate deputy county commissioner Kennedy Muriungi confirmed the arrest. “A team of chiefs and assistant chiefs acting on intelligence reports raided an illicit brew manufacturers’ hideout in Msisinenyi and found the brew,” he said. The illicit drink was hidden in the suspect’s homestead. The brew was mainly sold in Mwachabo and Msisinenyi.
