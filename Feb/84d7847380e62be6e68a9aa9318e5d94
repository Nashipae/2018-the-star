Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya says he is not aware of the Sh9.2 trillion project happening in Shimoni, Lunga Lunga subcounty. Mvurya on Monday said the Shimoni Integrated Development project is a scam by people to lure residents with promises of jobs and rob them of their land. “People come in different styles and lure people that there will be billions, good roads and jobs, but the real intent is robbing poor locals,” Mvurya said. However, Shelter Solutions MD Saleh Mungángá said the project is strictly a private initiative, and the government will only be involved when they are handing over the activities. “We have the support of the national government. We will involve them fully after we are done with construction, which might be 24 years to come,” he said. Click here for the latest political news
