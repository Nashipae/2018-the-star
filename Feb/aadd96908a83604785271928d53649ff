Youths from Nyamira county have threatened to protest, following increased insults targetting Interior CS Fred Matiang’i. Led by Caleb Motari, youths said if leaders, especially those allied to NASA, don’t stop insulting Matiang’i, they will call for peaceful protest. Matiang’i has ordered the crackdown on many NASA leaders, arresting some, taking away their security, guns, passports and expelling Miguna Miguna out of the country. “We are not happy with the way opposition leaders, are abusing Matiang’i. We are warning them, especially Embakasi East MP Babu Owino who has been referring to Matiang’i as a dead person, yet he is alive,” Motari said. They said the CS should be respected as he is entitled to ensure all Kenyans are safe. “Don’t joke with the Interior minisitry,” Ben Mogaka said.
