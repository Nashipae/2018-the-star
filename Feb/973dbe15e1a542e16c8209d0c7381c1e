The High Court in Kisii yesterday upheld the election of two MPs. Justices Wifridah Okwany and Hellen Omondi dismissed petitions against Alfah Miruka of Bomachoge Chache and his Bomachoge Borabu counterpart Zadock Ogutu on grounds the petitioners failed to prove their cases beyond reasonable doubt. Delivering her one hour judgment in Miruka’s petition, Okwany said the burden of proof lies with the petitioner. She said an election petition is more serious than a civil suit because it affects the entire constituency. Okwany said elections cannot be completely free of human error. The judge said the petitioner did not prove how the irregularities affected the elections substantially or materially. “An election is a human endeavour and thus a few errors committed cannot guarantee the nullification of the entire results,” the judge said.
