At least 70 bogus chemists have been closed this week and their operators arrested.The majority were operated by individuals who lacked medical training in pharmacy, which is illegal. The Pharmacy and Poisons Board said others were selling substandard and counterfeit drugs.The chemists were closed in Nairobi and South Rift, where officers are carrying out inspections this week.“These outlets pose a great danger to the public. They can potentially end up giving the wrong medication, dosage, poor quality medicines or misadvise the public,” said Julius Kalua, the head of drugs inspectorate in Nairobi.So far more than 700 illegal pharmaceutical outlets in Nairobi and the South Rift have been shut down since 2016. Some 664 operators have been charged in court and their products confiscated.“Those arrested have been charged. The crackdown will continue until all outlets stocking medicines are licensed and those running them have appropriate training approved by the Pharmacy and Poisons Board,” said Dr Samuel Kerama, the head of the inspectorate in South Rift .To operate a retail pharmacy in Kenya, one must have a diploma or degree in pharmacy from a recognised academic institution. One then applies for a licence from the PPB and a trading licence from the county government.Those who lack relevant qualification can partner with someone with the qualification but must draft a partnership deed and register a partnership company.A licence and set up capital requires between Sh600,000 to Sh2 million, according to the Pharmaceutical Society of Kenya. However, the business is highly profitable and in a single day, the average profit of a single chemist in Nairobi ranges between Sh4,000 and Sh20,000. Sometimes the figure can go as high as Sh50,000, which means an individual can make Sh1 million per month, the society says.  Click here for the latest political
