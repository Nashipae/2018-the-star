Two DJs were arrested at Jikonis along Kiambu Road on Saturday for allegedly playing loud music. Speaking to the Star yesterday, director of operations at City Hall, Peter Mbaya, said the DJs were arrested for breaking the law. They were freed on Sunday after Senator Johnson Sakaja intervened. He condemned the arrests on his Twitter account. If there is a problem, arrest the owner not the DJ, he said. Jikoni’s management declined to comment. In a joint statement DJs accused askaris of demanding between Sh30,000 and Sh200,000. Speaking to the Star, DJ Creme criticised the arrests. “ Address the sound issue with managers,” he said.
