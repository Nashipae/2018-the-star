Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinett has hinted that more NASA leaders who participated in Raila Odinga’s swearing-in will be arrested. “Nobody is above law. They will not be spared,” he said. Boinett said the crackdown on Opposition politicians will continue, despite criticism and protests from human rights activists. He spoke at Kiganjo Police College, Nyeri, during the Kenya Police Service Open Day on Friday. “The police are working to protect the rights of every Kenyan, regardless of their political affiliation,” the police chief added. The IG said those who break the law should expect police action.
