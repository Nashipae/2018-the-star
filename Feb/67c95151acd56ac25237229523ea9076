Kisumu county has started the relocation of solid wastes from Kachok dumpsite to Kajulu in the county. The drive started on Monday, despite four residents of Kajulu, Kisumu East, moving to court in a second attempt to stopping the exercise. Kisumu City manager Doris Ombara said the National Environmental Management Authority has certified the relocation of the dumpsite. She said the moving will take two and half months to complete. Ombara said 100 lorries will transport the waste per day. The exercise is expected to cost the county Sh99 million. Speaking at the site on Monday, the city manager said the relocation site has already been zoned into four areas. “Two thirds of the quarry will handle inert waste, which has existed in the Kachok dumpsite for more than two decades. Another third will hold fresh waste,” she said. Ombara said the county will invite companies to transform the waste into energy. The electricity will be sold to the national grid. “We have laid pipes that will drain any liquid content should there be rain or any water,” she added. Ombara was accompanied by Senator Fred Outa and Environment executive Salmon Orimba.
