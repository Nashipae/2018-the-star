We are not together. It is done. I have not talked to Diamond either," Zari revealed in an interview with BBC. Asked if any emissaried had been sent to try and reconcile them, Zari said, "No comment."Adding, "I have decided to stay completely away from him to digest this whole thing and I need to be in a proper mental situation. I don't need to be in an emotional situation for me to start sayng anything. So i really don't want to speak so much about this issue." Zari publicly dumped Diamond on Valentine's day via an Instagram post that went viral. She explained wy. "I mean, we were trying to see how we can move from the scandal ya kuwacha amepata mtoto so we can move forward. But anakumbatiana huko na ma ex kwenye public. Vitu za kunizalilisha, vitu za kunifanya niwe very disrespected.Â Ukiamua kua na familia, na watoto na nishakubali wewe ni musician, sometimes you need to take a step back and see that hivi vitu, when it comes to my family havifai. Lakini wewe unaendelea tuu, like...I can't even explain it." She continued, "To be honest, his video with the ex ilitoka and I tried to ask. That was the morning before. Alafu, kila ukiuliza mtu anakua na story mingi, hapo hapo nikadecide kumblock kabisa from my contacts. He does things and thinks it is okay with him but he is not thinking about you or the outcome, hapo ndio nikasema you know what? We are done." Asked what his mother, Sandra, thinks about the break up, Zari said, "I respect her as my mother in law and grandmother to my children, so I cannot give a comment when it comes to her. I would rather keep her out of this."
