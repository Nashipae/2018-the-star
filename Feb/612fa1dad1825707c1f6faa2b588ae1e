The sale and smoking of Shisha has persisted in city social joints despite a ban by the government in December last year. Head of Nairobi Tobacco Control Unit Anthony Muthemba said clubs and hotel owners have devised ways of protecting customers and evading arrests. Muthemba, however, said most joints have complied but there are others who have relocated Shisha smoking points to kitchens to ensure they are not noticed.

On Monday, 14 people were arrested in various places in a sting operation in different places in Langata, Nairobi West and Eastleigh among others, for allowing consumption of shisha in their premises. Muthemba warned establishments selling shisha in the wee hours to observe the law. "The clubs know their clients and are allocating them space in kitchens to smoke shisha. We will catch up with them," Muthemba said. Those arrested included patrons who were found smoking the outlawed tobacco product. A number of those arrested denied the charges before City Magistrates court but others denied the charges on Tuesday. Principal Magistrate MW Njagi handed Sh 5, 000 fines to those that pleaded guilty and alternative three months imprisonment.  Click here for the latest political news
