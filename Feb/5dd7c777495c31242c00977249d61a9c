Could the ongoing shortage of drugs in Nairobi county be as a result of dirty tricks by some officials? Yesterday, it emerged some drugs found their way out of the main medical stores in Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital without proper tracing documentation. County health bosses were at pains to explain to MCAs how the drugs moved. Auditor General Edward Ouko had in his 2015-16 report indicated drugs worth Sh907,740 were transfered from the main stores but were not received at the intended pharmacies. “The stock control cards for the drugs had no matching entries to confirm receipt by the reported recipients,” reads the report. Appearing before the Public Accounts Committee, Health executive Hitan Majevda and acting chief officer Thomas Ogaro said documents were provided after the audit report was released. Assign officers Ogaro said some pharmacies did not have technical officers to prepare the documents on time. “We have now hired technical officers to streamline operations at the pharmacies,” he said. But the MCAs rubbished his argument and questioned why he did not instruct or assign officers to the pharmacies to prepare the documents on time. “If there were no entries to confirm receipts and you are there as the chief officer, then that is gross. It is serious and it points to a serious pilferage going on in our facilities,” Karen MCA David Mberia said. The county-owned 78 health facilities have been operating for more than eight months now without drugs and other essential medical supplies. The facilities’ main supplier – Kenya Medical Supplies Authority – has refused to restock the facilities over a Sh285 million debt. The authority also turned down the county’s Sh30 million offer to resume supplies. Late reimbursments Majevada said the county will introduce a digitised health management system to track the movement of drugs. The MCAs also questioned why the county has failed to remit Sh237,690,174 to Mama Lucy, Mbagathi and Pumwani Maternity hospitals it received from the Ministry of Health for free maternity since 2013. Pumwani, which has had 56,465 deliveries between June 2013 and June 2016, was to receive Sh306,935,271, but only got ShSh173,851,907. Mama Lucy was reimbursed Sh5,785,000 instead of Sh41,115, 000. Mbagathi, which registered 825 per cent growth in deliveries to 112,405 births in the 2015-16 financial year from 2014-15, was to be reimbursed Sh127,930,000, but only received Sh58,553,190. Ogaro cited late reimbursement by the Ministry of Health. He said the money has now reached the facilities.
