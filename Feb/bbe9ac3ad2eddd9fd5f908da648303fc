Kenya Hockey Union champions Telkom hit Mombasa Sports Club 10-0 to wrap their season in style at the City Park Stadium yesterday. The win saw Telkom win their 20th domestic title without tasting defeat across all the 20 matches they played. While it was a collective joy for the team, experienced forward Jackie Mwangi sealed the season’s golden hockey stick after finishing as the best goal scorer. Mwangi pipped teammate, Audrey Omaido to the title as both scored hattricks in the win over the coastal side to stand at 25 and 28 goals respectively. Telkom had their goals through Mwangi (9, 35, 36), Omaido (11, 15, 21), Georgina Lumumba (26), Helen Chemutai (29,45) and Lucy Wangeci(62) to finish the season with 60 points. Telkom head coach Jos Openda revealed his plan of taking a rest before embarking on a mission to reclaim the Africa Club Championship title. “We are going for a break for the next three weeks. We did not rest during the festive season and it’s good for the players to relax. Next season there is a lot to be done. We want to reclaim the African title and we have to work smart to rectify the mistakes we did during the previous edition,” said Openda. Meanwhile the hockey fraternity was thrown into mourning following the demise of Kenya Police head coach Kenneth Kaunda. The title- winning coach, who guided his side in reclaiming the title from Strathmore University Gladiators died on Saturday, a day to their coronation. “It’s a great loss to the hockey fraternity. Kaunda was talented and it’s sad after guiding Police to the title he could not witness the coronation. I had known him for long and I condole with the Police club and the hockey fraternity at large,” said Openda.
