The Bomet government has set aside funds to build a museum to preserve traditional artifacts, Governor Joyce Laboso has said. She said most of the traditional artifacts are being lost and the only way to ensure future generations learn about them is by preserving them in a museum. “Generations to come will not get an opportunity to learn the old ways of doing things and the tools our forefathers used if we fail to preserve history,” Laboso said on Wednesday. She spoke during International Mother Language Day at Bomet Stadium. Laboso said her government will work together with the national government to implement programmes that will promote culture and language in education and development. “This is particularly important for devolution because most of our public participation sessions are conducted in mother tongue.”
