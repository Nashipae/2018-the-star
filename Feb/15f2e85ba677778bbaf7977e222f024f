The spectacular display of Executive defiance of judicial authority exhibited in the Miguna Miguna case compels us to return to the subject of court orders. Regardless of what crimes Miguna is alleged to have committed, there is no excuse for the contempt of courts exhibited by State officials at very high levels. The erosion of judicial authority is the beginning of a very slippery road to lawlessness. It is even more disturbing when the culprits are those charged with law enforcement: the Inspector General of Police and Director of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. We join Chief Justice David Maraga in reiterating that no individual or entity is above the law. The Judiciary is the protector and arbiter of competing state and individual rights. It must be respected. The optics of the governmentâ€™s treatment of Miguna, from the beginning to the mischief of deporting him when a judge was waiting for him to be produced in court until 9pm is simply wrong. This not only sets the two arms of government on collision but sends a bad signal to the public. Its an invitation to anarchy the state must avoid by all means.
