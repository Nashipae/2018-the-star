Albert Njogu sailed to the third round of the ongoing Kenya International Junior Tennis Championships third leg following his 6-1,6-3 win over Umit Cankus of Turkey at Nairobi Club. On a day where his compatriots trio of Ryan Randiek, Derrick Ominde and Mwendwa Mutuku exited the tournament after succumbing to their opponents in the second leg, Njogu outclassed his opponents to emerge as the only Kenyan survivor in the tournament. The former Kenya Open Junior champion, who lost the second leg at the quarter final stage, bullied his opponent in either sets with his well timed and strong returns, to storm to the final preliminary stage. The home boy had a relatively easy opening set, where he conceded a single game en-route to a 6-1 win which boosted his confidence for the second set. The little resistance the Turkish offered in the second set earned him three games but were not enough to shake the Njogu, who hit back to win the set 6-3. Njogu said: “The match was not tough as I had anticipated but I remained focused in both sets and I am happy with the win. Last week, I fell at quarters and last weekend, coach Abala guided me in polishing my mistakes and so far it is working.” While it was sweet victory for Njogu, his counterparts Randiek, Mutuku and Ominde bowed out of the tournament after losing their second round matches. Randiek narrowly lost 7-6, 7-5 to Sanjith Devinenj of United States of America while Ominde succumbed 6-3,6-2 to France national Gillan Osmont 6-3,6-2. Mutuku fell in similar sets of 6-0 to the Turkish. The defeat dealt the Kenyan boys a blow as they had set the quarter-finals traget prior to their matches. Randiek said: “I lost the past two legs at the third round and I was hopeful of advancing to the quarters and beyond. Unfortunately, I lost the match at tie-breaks in either sets. I have learnt my lessons and I know what to do next.”
