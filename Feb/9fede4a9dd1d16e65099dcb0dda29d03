Northeastern regional commissioner Mohamud Saleh has threatened to disband the ID vetting and peace committees claiming they are fueling insecurity. He said they always want the problems being faced in the region to go on so that they continue earning allowances whenever called to seminars in big hotels by NGOs and the government. Saleh said they are after their selfish interest and not that of restoring peace, noting that some have been members to the committees for 30 years but have not added value. He accused the vetting committee members of colluding with some rogue chiefs, take bribes and issue ID cards to aliens who later become a nuisance. Saleh noted that most terror attacks in the region are led by local youth and directed chiefs to produce names of those suspected to have joined al Shabaab. “I want the names of all youth who have been missing from your locations for the past one year or more,” Saleh said. Saleh further revealed the names of 17 youths from Fafi and Ijara who have joined Al-Shabaab. This brings the number Saleh has so far named in public to 56. “We are going to arrest their relatives of suspects if they are not produced. This is a year of action. It will not be business as usual as has been the case before,” Saleh said.
