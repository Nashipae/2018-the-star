Skier Sabrina Wanjiku Simader will be carrying the hopes of millions Kenyans when the Winter Olympics starts today in South Korea. Wanjiku, who learnt her skiing skills at school in Austria after leaving Kenya at the age of 3 years to join her mother, Sarah Simader, is coached by Christian Reif and has already made a mark in the skiing arena. She qualified for the Pyeongchang Winter Games last year during the World skiing Championship in St. Moritz and also took part in World Cup Alpine skiing circuit same year, posting very impressive results. Wanjiku and chef de mission, Paul Boit, himself a former skier and first Kenyan Winter Games Olympian has already arrived in the winter-stricken, icy chilly South Korean city of Pyeongchang. Wanjiku is ready to make history as the first-ever Kenyan female to take part in the games and will be challenging in the giant-slolam and super giant-slolam alpine skiing categories from Monday. NOCK President Paul Tergat said they are delighted to see her participating. “To say we are over-excited despite the crazy conditions here over Sabrina’s determination is an understatement. Everybody here, including our Ambassador and Kenyans in Korea, indeed Asia are so thrilled over our real chances to advance through Sabrina. There is a momentous expectation all over the air here and everybody is asking for accreditation to watch her compete,” said Tergat as he welcomed the Kenyan delegation to Pyeongchang. Tergat had travelled in advance as a Member of the IOC and used the occasion to rally the support of Kenyans and well wishers for Kenya’s sole competitor in the unique but highly popular Olympic Games outside of Africa.
