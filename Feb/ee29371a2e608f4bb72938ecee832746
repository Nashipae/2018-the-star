The drafting of a bill seeking to provide legal protection of hawkers in Murang’a is underway. The Wa Iria Hawkers’ Bill 2018 intends to organise, structure and decriminalise hawking as a form of business. It will also help protect hawkers in the event they are arrested and ensure they are fairly prosecuted. According to the bill, the county government will give incentives to hawkers and create market linkages with corporate organistaions. The Hawkers’ Bill 2018, if passed, will bring an end to continued suffering of hawkers, who often clash with county askaris on issues such as time and space to place their wares.Governor Wa Iria said the bill will also help improve the relationship between traders who own supermarkets, shops and stalls and the hawkers. “Hawkers have no assigned places to sell their wares. As a result, they come and occupy the space outside the entrances of various shops and sell the items sold in these very premises. We will address this in the bill,” Wa Iria said. “We are also hoping to have legal protection by the law for the hawkers to trade because they also have rights, and should have a legal framework to work. In the long run, we will end the current problem of unemployment,” the governor said yesterday. Wa Iria said the bill will be tabled before the Assembly in a month for debate, and probably the other 46 counties will consider the idea and legislate “because we have hawkers and small traders across the nation.”
