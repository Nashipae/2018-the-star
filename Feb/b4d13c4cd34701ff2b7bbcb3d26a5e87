Slaughtering of donkeys in Kitui could wipe out the animals in the next six years if it is not reversed, a veterinary official has warned. Kitui-based veterinary officer Joseph Kamonzo said 15 donkeys had been slaughtered over the last 12 months while many other slaughtering cases were not reported. He said the rise in donkey slaughtering had left the animals endangered. “I am afraid that if no quick action is taken, the animal will be extinct in six years,” Kamonzo said. Speaking during a meeting with donkey owners in Mwingi on Saturday, Kamonzo urged the farmers to raise the price of donkeys from Sh6,000 to 15,000 to curb the sale of the animals. The donkeys are sold off for slaughter at the Kithyoko abattoir in Machakos. farjmers said their donkeys were being stolen to be sold for slaughtering.
