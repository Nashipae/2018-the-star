The national government on Wednesday availed six water trucks to supply clean water to drought residents of Baringo county who are experiencing acute water shortage. Water PS Professor Fred Segor launched the exercise a week after media expose. The water will be supplied by the Rift Valley Water Services Authority tracks Segor noted there is hunger in area due to prolonged drought, a situation that would see many schools closed unless the government moves with speed to supply relief food. He however disputed claims that some schools in the area had been closed down due to water scarcity. He said the government will sink 30 boreholes and open up pan dams as a lasting solution to water challenges in the lowland areas. More than 200 schools are facing closure as residents are forced to trek 30 kilometres in search for water both for their livestock and domestic use. On Friday last week, Tiaty residents stormed Riongo Primary School armed with clubs, sticks and pandas, and threatened to have the school closed down so as to migrate with their children in search for water and pasture. The school is among 11 schools about to be closed in Silale Ward alone whereas 118 schools face similar water challenge. Segor said the supply will go on until the rains start in April.
