Kenya Prisons women’s volleyball team have been boasted by the presence of Pamela Masaisai, Teresa Ekai and Meldine Sande ahead of the African Club Championship next month in Cairo, Egypt. The trio were forced to cut short their training at the Prisons Staff Training College to link up with the squad, currently in training at the Safaricom Indoor Arena, Kasarani. Masaisai, in particular, is expected to form a good combination with either Mercy Moim or team captain Evelyne Makuto in the left attacking department, thanks to her explosive spikes. She made a couple of appearances for the first team last season before joining PSTC. She, however, missed play-offs, where Prisons settled for second behind local nemesis Kenya Pipeline. At the same time, Moim believes Egypt is the team’s ‘good luck charm’ even as the outfit prepare to stage a repeat of their debut performance. Prisons debuted at the annual event in 2008 and went ahead to win the title. They currently boast of five titles. Moim, who was part of that title winning squad, is humbled to still be in the team 10 years down the line and hopes the North Africa country will once again bring good tidings. She said: “The players must raise to the occasion, savour and reproduce the memories of 2008. It was our time then ( 2008 ), and we excelled. I think it’s been long since we won the title and that time is ripe to hit the continental headlines again. The honours is upon us (players) to display title-winning performance,” Other players who were in the 2008 lineup and are still with the squad include liberos duo of Judith Tarus and Elizabeth Wanyama and middle blocker Diana Khisa. Team coach Josp Barasa, who was the brain behind the formation of the 2008 team, said most of the players in the team have not gotten continental and global exposure and he thinks his charges will start as the underdogs in the showpiece.
