Star newspaper journalist Joseph Jamenya is set to run 400km from Vihiga to Nairobi to raise Sh60 million to build a cardiac centre in the county. He hopes to raise awareness of the rising number of cases of heart conditions. Jamenya's father died of a heart attack last year and his mother soon afterwards developed a heart problem. ''These complications have become common and [they are] very expensive to manage for most common people," he said yesterday. Jamenya spoke at the Vihiga County General Hospital boardroom. The centre will be put up at the hospital. The run will begin on March 5 and it has been named #JJ heart run. The theme is 'Your heart your life'.
