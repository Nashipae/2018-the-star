Education CS Amina Mohamed yesterday urged the Commonwealth to increase scholarship opportunities and diversify areas of study. She emphasised the need for more slots for science and technology fields. “The Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan can be more impactful if it is scaled up,” Mohamed said in Nadi, Fiji, during the 20th Conference of 52 Commonwealth Education Ministers. The conference theme is ‘Sustainability and Resilience: Can Education Deliver?’ Kenya has benefited from Commonwealth scholarships, including about 52 yearly slots from India, two from New Zealand and 12 from Pakistan. Currently, 29 scholarships are available in the UK for 2017-18 against an annual average of 10. The CS said scholarships have contributed positively to Kenya’s development. They help build capacity in critical areas and leave a mark on individual beneficiaries. Mohamed urged the UK to increase scholarships for Kenyan students — both under the Commonwealth and under the Chevening programmes. She urged the UK to end its language proficiency requirements for Kenyan students because English is the medium of instruction in Kenyan schools. Kenyan students seeking to study in the UK have to sit the Test of English as a Foreign Language course before they can be accepted. The CS appealed to member countries to make timely payments to the Commonwealth Scholarship Endowment Fund, which supports the scholarships. Kenya will host the next conference in 2021.
