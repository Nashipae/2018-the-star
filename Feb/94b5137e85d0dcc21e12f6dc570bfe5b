Parliament has been urged create laws to bar senior civil servants from owning PSVs in a bid to instil sanity on the roads. Matatu Welfare Association chairman Dickson Mbugua yesterday told the Parliamentary Committee on Transport the traffic police department has been unable to crack down on rogue drivers who operate vehicles owned by influential government officials. “This idea of senior civil servants owning PSVs in this country sets a bad precedent because of the Big Man syndrome. The drivers harass other motorists, but traffic officers are unable to take disciplinary action against them because of fear of losing their jobs,” Mbugua said. He told the committee chaired by Pokot South MP David Pkosing traffic police officers who crack the whip on the rogue matatu operators are mostly transferred to hardship regions. “These public servants venture into the matatu industry as a way of cleaning the money earned through graft. They set high targets for the drivers and violate the law,” he said. The chairman called on Parliament to scrap the Ndegwa Commission report of the 1970s that allowed public officers to conduct business with the government. “This House is in a good position to revisit the Ndegwa Commission which has brought this impunity. Impunity has entrenched the transport sector,” Mbugua said. Pkosing said, “Let us all take that responsibility to ensure safety on our roads”.
