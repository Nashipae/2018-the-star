Kenya Pipeline and Kenya Prisons women’s teams have been kicked out of the Moi International Sports Complex Indoor Arena at Kasarani to pave way for the International Table Tennis Federation Championship which serves off this weekend. Prisons and Pipeline have been training at the facility for close to a month in preparation for the Africa Club Championships set for between March 5 and 18 in Cairo, Egypt. Prisons have now shifted their training to the Kenya College of Accountancy while their local nemesis, Pipeline, have opted for gym work at their Kenya Pipeline Company backyard. Pipeline captain Triza Atuka bemoaned the new development, saying the timing was wrong as they are gearing up to put final touches to their preparations ahead of their departure to the North African hosts this weekend. The middle-blocker noted that despite gym work being the only option at their disposal now, ball work is always key. “The championship is fast approaching and it is sad that our training has been cut short. There were noticeable efforts from the management to seek alternative indoor facility but their efforts were futile,” said Atuka, the reigning Kenya Volleyball Federation best attacker. “Gladly, we have picked as a team and all the departments are working in unison and we can only hope for the best ahead of the event. We are set to leave for Egypt on Saturday and I hope we will have acclimatised by the time the event serves off.” During last year’s event held in Tunisia, Pipeline finished fifth, surrendering the bronze medal they had won in 2016 at the same venue. However, Atuka said they are keen to improve on their group stage performances to have a better chance of challenging for the title. Prisons won bronze last year and team manager David Kilundo said they are going for nothing short of the overall title.
