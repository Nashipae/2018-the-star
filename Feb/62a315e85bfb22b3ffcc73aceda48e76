Sabis International School has opened a Sh2 billion state-of-the art educational facility in Runda. The school, built on a 20-acre piece of land near Kiambu Road and Northern Bypass junction will officially open its doors to students in September. The facility will not only focus on education but also on development of abilities and talent in sports, art, swimming and indoor games. Sabis president Carl Bistany on Friday said enrollment is ongoing and so far 35 students have shown interest. “We are planing an initiative to open up to Grade – 5 (equivalent of class 5 in the Kenyan system) initially but if we get more students, the physical facilities are there and we can add more classrooms,” Bistany said. Bistany said students will follow a globally recognised curriculum and sit international external exams such as the British IGCSE and A Levels or the American Advanced Placement. They will have access to latest technology and acquire important life skills, have an exchange programme to enable learners develop a sense of responsibility and dependence. Sabis operates in 20 countries spread across five continents with more than 70,000 students, 20,000 alumni and has been in existence for 130 years.
