Power producer KenGen posted a seven per cent drop in pretax profit for the first half of its financial year to Sh6.08 billion ($59.7 million) as depreciation expenses rose. In a statement published in newspapers on Saturday, Kenya Electricity Generating Company said its total revenue rose to Sh18.61 billion in the six months that ended December, from Sh17.74 billion in the same period a year earlier. That was largely driven by electricity sales, which rose two per cent to Sh14.92 billion, with just over a third coming from geothermal power generation. It said depreciation and amortisation expenses were up 15 per cent to Sh5.19 billion due to the capitalisation of its geothermal wells and wellheads towards the end of last year. Kenya has an installed generating capacity of 2,370 megawatts (MW) and peak demand of about 1,770 MW. Of this, KenGen, which is 70 per cent owned by the government, has an installed capacity of 1,631 MW, including 533 MW from geothermal sources. KenGen plans to add another 1,745 megawatts (MW) of electricity capacity from geothermal sources by 2025.
