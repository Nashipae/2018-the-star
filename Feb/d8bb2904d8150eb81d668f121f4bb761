President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday urged EAC leaders to work closely to ensure bureaucratic red tape does not impede development targets. He said government should facilitate the private sector instead of curtailing it. “I have a problem with some bureaucrats who frustrate investors by taking more time approving projects,” the President said. He spoke in Entebbe, Uganda, at the opening of the Joint Retreat of the East Africa Community Heads of State. The President underscored public-private partnership as a key component of regional development. Major progress has been made in infrastructure in Kenya through public-private partnership, Uhuru said. To achieve his Big Four agenda, Uhuru needs the private sector and encourages public-private partnerships. Treasury cannot do it alone. Kenyatta urged leaders to come up with innovative ways of financing projects with high social return and direct impact. “We have made a lot of reference to India. However, India succeeded because it sold itself as a market of more than one billion people,” the President said. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said he fully supports working with the private sector to implement projects improving the economy. “We don’t have to waste more time moving in circles,” he said. Tanzanian President John Magufuli said governments and the private sector should look for win-win situations to avoid exploitation of citizens after projects are complete. South Sudan President Salva Kiir said it is difficult to exploit resources due to conflicts. He said some donor countries impede growth of African countries. “I need the EAC to remain a bloc and not allow to be bullied by those who want to cow us and take our resources,” Kiir said.
