Lamu West politicians Rishad Amana and Stanley Muthama have promised a duel during the by-election. This follows the successful petition by Amana against Muthama’s August 8 win. Muthama, of the Maendeleo Chap Chap party, was declared winner after garnering 11,090 votes against Amana’s 10,950 a difference of 140 votes. But on Wednesday, the High Court in Malindi said the election was marred by irregularities. Amana warned his opponents against ferrying voters to Lamu West and said he will campaign vigorously. He said two candidates were ‘planted’ last year to divide his votes. “This time we will be extra vigilant so that the win by the people of Lamu West is not taken away from us again,” Amana said on the phone. Muthama said he will continue serving residents until the by-election date is set.
