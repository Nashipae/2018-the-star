Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko plans to raise more than Sh1.7 billion in revenue this month. Last month, for the first time in Nairobi county, Sonko raised Sh1.63 billion in revenue collection. By close of business on Saturday, the county had collected Sh903 million. The governor yesterday said he is confident he will pass the Sh1.7 billion mark. “We have sealed all corruption loopholes. All unscrupulous traders and rogue county staff who hoped to survive on corruption have been put on notice. We are here to serve Nairobians,” he said. When Sonko took over in September last year, Nairobi was collecting less than Sh10 million per day. The automation of billing services has improved revenue collection. Last September, Sonko ordered increased automation of cash collections. He said cash payments have facilitated corruption, leading to loss of revenue. Sonko contracted JamboPay to collect revenue on behalf of Nairobi county. So far, it has automated 134 billing services out of 136. JamboPay is the online payment system for revenue collection.
