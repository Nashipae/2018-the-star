Kitui Deputy
Governor Wathe Nzau yesterday praised World Bank for pumping Sh642.5 million into
health, sanitation, roads and security projects. He said through the Kenya Informal
Settlements Improvement Project Kitui town has been given a hospitable
new look, increased security and sanitation. Nzau spoke when
he received a World Bank delegation headed by KISIP national coordinator Peris Mang’ira. The World Bank spent Sh485.6 million on road construction, Sh45.4 million on street
lighting and Sh101.4 on drainage system. Nzau
conducted the delegation on a tour of KISIP projecs in Kunda Kindu, Mjini and
Mosquito estates. World Bank
urban specialist Abebaw Alemayehu urged the contractors to speed up. He said the bulk of undone work was massive. Nzau said the
World Bank projects are a boost to Governor Charity Ngilu’s five-pillar manifesto
for Kitui. It focuses on water and food security, quality healthcare, education
and youth empowerment; as well as women empowerment and wealth creation.
