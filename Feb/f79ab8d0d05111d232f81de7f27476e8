NCIC chairman Francis ole Kaparo has summoned Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu on allegations she incited youths to burn lorries transporting charcoal in the county. Kaparo said Ngilu should appear before the National Cohesion and Integration Commission for interrogation on February 20 at 10 am. "Following the utterances by Ngilu in regards to charcoal burning, the commission has summoned the Governor in a letter dated February 14," Kaparo said via Twitter on Thursday. Ngilu has denied claims that she incited the public. She also denied that certain communities are being targetted in the protests against charcoal burning and the sand harvesting business in Kitui. The county chief noted the ban on charcoal burning has been in force since 2014 and that the county is only enforcing the Kitui County Charcoal Management Act. On Wednesday, Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu criticised Ngilu over the utterances saying she should be arrested for inciting the public. “No person should order the destruction of people’s property. Ngilu should be arrested,” he told charcoal dealers in the county. Transporters in Limuru held protests demanding the arrest of Ngilu. They lit bonfires at Kwambira area along Nairobi-Nakuru Highway and blocked the road using logs, saying the Governor was propelling negative ethnicity.
