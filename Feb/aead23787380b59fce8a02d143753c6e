The Kisumu High court on Monday dismissed former Teso North MP Arthur Odera's petition challenging Oku Kaunya's win in last years election. Odera, who was slapped with a Sh2 million cost, wanted the MPs' win on August 8 nullified citing massive irregularities. Kaunya was declared the winner with 14,432 votes against the petitioner's 12,829, being a margin of 1,613 votes. The petition was grounded on allegations of intimidation, violence, widespread bribery before and during the elections. Odera also alleged that the IEBC and poll officials showed bias and colluded against him. The Jubilee Party candidate claimed his agents were denied the right to fully participate in the elections after they were ejected from a polling station. Odera also stated that his agents were denied opportunity to verify votes being counted, right to seek a recount of votes and right of access to form 35A. He alleged that those who could not read and write were coerced into being assisted to vote in the absence of his agents. Justice David Majanja dismissed the petition saying the evidence before the court did not meet the threshold for annulling an election. Majanja said the petitioner failed to prove that the elections were not free and fair despite being granted access to all electronic information. He also dismissed the allegations by Odera against Kanyua on matters of voterâ€™s bribery, violence and intimidations. Click here for the latest political news
