Interior Cabinet
Secretary Fred Matiang’i has dismissed assertions that the government is conducting a crackdown on
opposition leaders. "That is the language being used in the media and I have
no problem with it. We have no
plan of cracking down on anybody because we are neither a police state nor a military government," he said. "We are a democratically elected government and will
not compromise the rule of law at the altar of whims," the Cabinet
Secretary said. He spoke at Kebirichi secondary school in Nyamira on Friday. The CS, however, warned that
anyone breaking the law will be arrested and prosecuted in the best interest of
the country. "We will
continue to make bold decisions in the interest of the country in order to
ensure that we are secure and safe," he said. The government has been going after opposition leaders since Raila Odinga's swearing in on January 30. It started with the arrest of MP TJ Kajwang' before the same was escalated with the deportation of lawyer Miguna Miguna. But Matiang'i maintained that the government will apply the rule of law firmly and will not negotiate the stability of the country.

the people, we will be the most irresponsible government if we do," the
minister added. Matiangí was
accompanied by Kitutu Masaba MP Shadrack Mose, Ken Osinde - the chief of staff in
Deputy President William Ruto’s office, and Principal Secretary Susan Mochache. He said the
government respects the rule of law. "Everything we are doing is within the law
because we are a democratically elected government which respects the rule of
law if we did not respect the law we would do otherwise," Matiang'i said. He told
leaders to be responsible when they exercise their freedoms including freedom
of expression. Also read: I've never been served court orders, Matiang'i says on Miguna deportation Click here for the latest political news
