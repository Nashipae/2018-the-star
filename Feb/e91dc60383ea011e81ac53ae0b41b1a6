Telkom Orange goalkeeper Cynthia Onyango is targeting to go the whole of 2018 season without conceding. Onyango conceded just thrice in the Kenya Hockey Union Premier League and her shut outs was crucial as Telkom finished second to Ghana Revenue Authority at the Africa Club Championships.

Thank you StarTimes for being the sponsors and SJAK for considering me for this prize. This truly goes a long way to inspire and motivate me and my teammates to work hard,” she said. “I am keen not to concede a goal when the new season begins and as a team we are set to go all the way and reclaim the African title.” The national team first choice keeper was handed a StarTimes 42-inch digital television set, Sh100,000 and personalised plaque at the City Park Stadium yesterday. StarTimes Director of Marketing and Public Relations Japheth Akhulia said: “Telkom has been on top for many years and Cynthia’s prowess in goal has been key to their performances. She is an inspiration to many, especially girls who are eager to play for Telkom as well as the national team.” SJAK chairman, Chris Mbaisi: “We are happy that these awards are already inspiring players to work hard to accomplish their goals. I call on the union to spread the sport across the nation to unearth new talents and encourage youngsters to embrace the sport.”
