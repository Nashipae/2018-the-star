The British government will not withdraw its soldiers training unit in Kenya, High Commissioner Nick Hailey has said. Addressing the media yesterday in Nanyuki after a consultative meeting with Governor Ndiritu Muriithi and Deputy Governor John Mwaniki, Hailey said the UK was looking to boost its cooperation with Kenya. He said many investors had expressed interest in investing in the region. Hailey said Kenya and UK have had common interests which can only be expanded. “We are looking at how to expand UK support in Laikipia, especially in the Amaya Triangle Initiative,” Hailey said. More than 6,000 troops train in Laikipia under the British Army Training Unit in Kenya. The Amaya Triangle Initiative was meant to restore peace in the four counties of Laikipia, Baringo, Isiolo and Samburu. Hailey said the UK government was keen on supporting the Laikipia county government to create a conducive environment for private investors. Muriithi said their discussion centred around increasing investment in the area. He noted that the presence of BATUK in Laikipia had a positive contribution to the local economy. “As governors of this region, we want to modernse the value chain of our livestock and we appreciate any help coming to us,” Muriithi said. On swearing in of NASA principal Raila Odinga, the High Commissioner urged for dialogue saying he supported Constitution and law. He urged the two political divides to embrace dialogue to see how institutions of the country can be strengthened for the sake of the future of the country. He called on politicians and other players be in the forefront to ensure Kenans heal from divisions resulting from elections.
