The ruling on the petition against Olpusimoru MCA Wilfred Kuyo failed to take place on Thursday because the magistrate was unwell. Narok principal magistrate Titus Gesora was supposed to deliver the ruling in which Kuyo was accused of using witchcraft to defeat Wilson Masikonde. Kuyo’s and former Majority leader Masikonde’s supporters camped outside the court for the better part of the day before the message of postponement reached them. The case was pushed to next Wednesday. Kuyo urged his supporters to remain calm. The final submissions were made by the petitioner, first and second respondents. Masikonde named Independent and Electoral Boundaries Commission Narok North constituency returning officer Mark Lempaka as the second respondent. He said the commission failed to conduct the election in accordance with the law. Kuyo said the election was free and fair and no one was influenced through witchcraft or bribery to vote for him. He told the court the case was not brought to court in good faith.
