Ruth Kamande - on trial for murdering her boyfriend - yesterday confessed to stabbing him 22 times using a kitchen knife. The 2016 winner of the Miss Lang’ata Prison beauty pageant told Justice Jessie Lessit she stabbed Farid Mohammed on September 20, 2015 in self-defence. She told the court Mohammed tried to kill her after she discovered he was HIV-positive. “Farid told me that he would rather kill me and himself than have his status exposed. l stabbed him severally using a kitchen knife, which fell on my chest from his hands after I overpowered him after putting my two thumbs in his eyes to save my life,” Kamande said. She said she had a long argument with Mohammed that morning after she discovered a card for HIV treatment with his name under a mattress. “Your honour, it pained me to know that the person who l loved and trusted so much was to ruin my life by infecting me with HIV and Aids,” Kamande said. She gave a detailed account of her final moments with her boyfriend and said he wanted to kill her after she threatened to reveal his status to his family. Kamande said Mohammed snatched the treatment card from her and attacked her from behind as she packed her clothes inthe bedroom. She said investigating officers who rushed her to Metropolitan Hospital and later KNH, where she was given post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV infection - saved her. Kamanda said the night before the murder, Mohammed insisted on having sex with her without protection. She admitted to arguing with Mohammed over love letters she found in his bedside locker. Kamande said she stabbed Mohammed out of fear, “but tried to save him”. She denied stabbing herself to cover up.
