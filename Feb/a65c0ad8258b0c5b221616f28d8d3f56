Integrated IDPs from Nakuru yesterday welcomed the National Land Commission’s plan to investigate allegations of cartels allocating themselves land meant for their resettlement. Kenya National Internally Displaced Persons Network patron Peter Tena said brokers and government officials have infiltrated the resettlement programme. This “denies us our promised land” in Solio, Banita and Endebess, he said. Tena said the Grand Coalition government allocated them land, but “the cartels are grabbing it”. Tena said they suffer because the historical injustices meted out to them have not been fixed. “We lodged formal complaints with the NLC and the response was positive. The commission said more than 700 parcels of different acreage were purchased for resettling our members,” he said. “[NLC chairman Muhammad] Swazuri has promised to probe the matter fully.” Meanwhile, Tena warned IDPs who had been compensated against interfering with the programme. “The IDPs who got cash should not bother the government. Some of us insisted on having land — not money. The only compensation we were to receive according to the Resettlement Act 2012 was land,” he said.
