An estimated gang of 100 believed to be from neighbouring community raided the village at 5pm armed with Ak47 guns and made away with 100 cows. Resident Tiliot Lolem said the bandit killed was dressed in National Police Reservist uniform. Residents especially women and children are now spending nights in the bush fearing for their lives. “I wonder why the bandits were dressed in NPR uniform. What business do they have with rustlers from Marakwet yet they are supposed to keep peace and help to recover the stolen livestock?” Lolem asked. It is alleged Kerio valley attacks are retaliatory attacks amid pasture, water and boundary between the warring Marakwet and Pokot pastoral communities along the Kerio valley. Tiaty subcounty deputy commissioner Yusuf Buka said they are yet to confirm the number of animals stolen, and whether someone was killed.
