Kahiga said it is sad to see trees being
harvested during the dry season. "What we see is
really pathetic. Quite a lot of destruction of the forest is taking place. I'm
made to understand that we are talking about harvesting and I don't see why we
should harvest in a time and a season like this when clearly we do not have
enough rain," he said. The governor said whoever is authorising the felling of trees in the forest should stop. "It is
time forests are accorded better management," Kahiga said. He appealed to the
national government to intervene and ensure the massive felling of trees is stopped. Kahiga said the Gura River,
which was once big, has today shrunk to a stream. "This is being
replicated all over the county, where rivers are drying up and much of this is
because we are losing the forest cover. We would wish to encourage everyone to
work towards planting more trees," he said. The county government, Kahiga said, will spend close to Sh35 million this year on greening the region. He said tree seedlings will be distributed to increase the forest cover. They will include fruit and indigenous
trees. This, the governor said, will ensure
the lost forest cover is recovered. He spoke when the Kenya Tea Development Agency initiated the Gura Hydro Power Project
in Tetu subcounty. The project is worth Sh1.7 billion. It is expected to produce about six megawatts of power. The governor said the
project will cut production cost for the factories, which will translate to more
earnings to farmers. KTDA chairman Peter
Kanyago said the project currently generate 2.5MW of power. He said KTDA will also
work with the Kenya Forest Service to ensure tree cover is improved in the
area. Kanyago said farmers
will be issued with free tree seedlings to promote tree planting.
