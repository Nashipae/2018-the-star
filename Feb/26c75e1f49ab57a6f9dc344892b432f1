The Mombasa County government has rolled out plans to reconstruct Municipal Stadium to meet international standards days after opening the newly refurbished Bomu-mini Stadium. Mombasa Municipal Stadium is set to be demolished and reconstructed in a period of 11 months with a sitting capacity of 20,000 fans. Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho made the announcement when Football Kenya Federation officials inspected Bomu Stadium. Joho revealed that his administration had started plans to build a new stadium at Buxton, where the Municipal Stadium is located. “We have tried to refurbish the old Mombasa Municipal Stadium but it is like an old train. It can’t move. Now we have decided to demolish it and build a new ultra-modern one there. The new stadium will have a capacity of between 15,000-20,000 fans and will host some major matches. Already, designs are being worked on. We are on course,” said Joho. FKF president Nick Mwendwa said the newly refurbished Bomu Stadium will help to promote talent in Mombasa. “Last year, we took four players from the Underr-13 category from Mombasa to Southampton. This year, we want to see how many we would produce in both U-15 and U-13,” said Mwendwa. Meanwhile the refurbished Bomu mini-stadium will be used to host the FKF National Super League matches and serve as home ground for Modern Coast Rangers. In an announcement that excited football fans in the Coastal city, Mwendwa said the new Bomu mini-stadium, the first community project of its kind in the country, will also host some National Super League matches. “I came to see this stadium so that next month, the Kenya national team Under-20 play here with their Egypt counterparts. These Egyptians are used to us. Whenever we go there, they beat us. We must beat them this time,” said Mwendwa.
