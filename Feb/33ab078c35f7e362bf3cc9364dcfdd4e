Police in Ol Kalou are investigating whether the death of a 59-year-old woman was murder or suicide. Veronica Wangui’s body was found dangling from the roof of her chicken coop yesterday. “We got the information and moved to the scene, but there was alama ya dukuduku (gaps). The information we got is not enough,” Nyandarua Central OCPD Wilson Kosgei said. Wangui was the mother of senior county engineer David Wagaiyu, who says he saw his mother alive when he left for work. The only other adult at the home was Mercy Njambi, Wangui’s 21-year-old niece who found the body. Kosgei said although the bed was not made, there were signs of disturbance in the bedroom. The Star observed that unlike other suicide scenes where the noose is pulled taut around the neck, the rope had been tied twice around Wangui’s neck. Her head was nearly touching the overhead beam and there was barely six inches between the beam and the rope around her neck. Her feet were about one metre from the ground. Another rope tied to the beam touched the ground, three feet from the body. “I have visited very many suicide scenes, but this one leaves a lot of questions. This is a puzzle,” Kosgei said. “We can’t buy the idea that she had a mental problem. Somebody can take advantage of that and commit a crime. That question must be answered by the investigators,” Kosgei said.
