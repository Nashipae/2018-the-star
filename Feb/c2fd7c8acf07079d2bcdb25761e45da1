Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has defended the closure of Eden House Group rehabilitation centre saying it was occupying a grabbed public land. The governor, in a statement, said the organisation was issued a fake allotment letter by senior officials in Governor Evans Kidero's administration. The centre, situated at the City Park, was shut on Friday in an operation executed by city inspectorate officials. Sonko said the NGO was doing a great job in rehabilitating drug addicts but have to look for an alternative place to run their activities. "I'm offering Sh300,000 to Eden Rehab directors to look for an alternative place to hire so as to continue with their good work," he said. He said the officials who issued the fake allotment letter to the organisation to occupy part of City Park were sacked over graft allegations. In a February 10 letter, Eden rehabilitation director Boniface Ndirangu asked the county to allow them to continue using House No. 5 which they had renovated. "The house was instrumental in promoting our patients' recovery," Ndirangu said. However, the Governor said the Sh300,000 given to the directors will help them hire another place to continue with their work. He said they have also repossessed a borehole and a five-acre flower garden valued at Sh4.5 billion within City Park which had also been grabbed. The governor said cartels and businessmen were behind the fraudulent dealings. "Party of City Park market land had also been grabbed and a fake title deed processed," Sonko said adding that he is committed to protecting public land and property.
