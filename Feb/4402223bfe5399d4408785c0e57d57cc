A group of Italian women in Malindi campaigned against gender-based violence to mark the One Billion Rising movement on Valentine's Day. Rita Valentini, the founder of One Billion Rising Malindi Revolution, led the crusade. She launched the movement six years ago after finding her neighbour being assaulted by her husband. Since then, every Valentine's Day, Valentini invites members to join others worldwide in celebrations to raise awareness on the worldwide One Billion Rising movement. On Wednesday Valentini, her friend Triziana Beltrami of Karen Blixen and other Italian women in Malindi, engaged schools, cultural groups such as Malindi District Cultural Association and NGOs in championing against gender-based violence. They met at Karen Blixen Restaurant Malindi. They wore red and black ribbons and placards that read,"One in three women you love, is raped or beaten in her lifetime", Â "We are mothers, we are teachers, we are beautiful creatures", "every two minutes in the world, a woman is sexually assaulted", "I rise for the one million girls who entre the sex trade each year". Other placards read, "This is my body, my body is holy", "No more rape or incest or abuse, women are not a possession".
