A new team has been unveiled to advise the world on how to stop deaths from non-communicable diseases like cancer. It is the first World Health Organisation Independent Global High-level Commission on Non-communicable Diseases. WHO boss Dr Tedros Adhanom said the team will recommend action to accelerate progress in tackling the diseases - mainly cardiovascular, cancers, diabetes and respiratory ailments. The proposed co-chairs of the commission are presidents of Uruguay and Sri Lanka, and ministers from various countries in Africa. About 40,000 Kenyans are diagnosed with cancer annually and the disease kills at least15,000 people of them every year, according to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. The Kenya Network of Cancer Organisations estimates on average it costs one survivor Sh3 million to treat the disease over several years . However, most of that cost is nowadays borne by the NHIF. In 2015, world leaders committed to reduce premature deaths from non-commnicable diseases by one third by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Goals. A recent WHO reports indicate the world will struggle to meet that target. Some of the suggestions made in 2015 were to reduce salt, sugar and unhealthy fat intake by introducing new taxes and regulations. “Low and lower-middle income countries are particularly affected by the diseased with almost 50 per cent of premature deaths occurring in these countries,” said Dr Tedros. Nowhere is the global gap that affects the underprivileged more glaring than in access to radiotherapy. It’s a key cancer treatment recommended for 52 per cent of patients — but 90 per cent of them can’t access it.
