Raila Odinga has eulogised Zimbabwe Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai as a democrat and freedom fighter. Tsvangirai died on Wednesday aged 65, after 18 months of treatment in neighbouring South Africa where he battled colon cancer.

In a tweet on Thursday, the Nasa principal added that Tsvangirai remained a source of inspiration to a generation of leaders across the continent for his courage in the face of monumental odds. "His death leaves a gap in a country that still needs strong forces of change to return to the path of democracy," he said. "I pray that the party he founded, the MDC, will hold firm and pursue the ideals he lived for." At the peak of his career, the self-taught son of a brick-layer served as Prime Minister to Robert Mugabe's president, in a 2009-2013 unity government cobbled together after a disputed and violent election in which scores of his supporters were killed. His presence helped stabilise an economy in freefall but Mugabe reneged on pledges to overhaul the former British colony's partisan security forces and Tsvangirai was shunted back into his familiar role as opposition gadfly. A hefty electoral defeat in 2013, blamed in part on Tsvangirai's involvement in two sex scandals, put paid to his dreams of one day leading the southern African nation and three years later he revealed he was being treated for colon cancer.
