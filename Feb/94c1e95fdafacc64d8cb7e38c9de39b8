Many Kakamega residents are contracting HIV because they do not use condoms. The county has blamed increased infections on unprotected sex. Aids/STIs coordinator Joseph Muyale on Tuesday said educating the public about the benefits of using condoms has been a problem. “With over two million people in Kakamega, those infected with HIV/Aids are 50,884. This is still worrying,” he said during World Condom Day. In 2016-17, the county recorded 2,054 new infections. “The new infections are still worrying. Other counties are recording less,” Muyale said. A significant number of the new cases could have been avoided if the victims had used condoms, Muyale said. “If people knew using condoms reduces the chances of infection by 90 per cent, they would use them.” Residents got free condoms and were trained in how to use them.
