All 66 passengers and crew on an Iranian plane that crashed in a mountainous area of central Iran on Sunday are believed to be dead. State television quoted the airline's spokesman as saying: "Aseman Airlines public relations head said that all on board are unfortunately dead." The plane came down in the Zagros mountains near the city of Semirom in Isfahan province while flying between Tehran and the south-western city of Yasuj, reports say. "All emergency forces are on alert," an emergency services spokesman said. Bad weather prevented an emergency helicopter reaching the site. There is no official word yet on casualties. The plane, believed to be an ATR 72-500, was operated by Aseman Airlines. Reports say those on board were 60 passengers, two security guards, two flight attendants and the pilot and co-pilot.
