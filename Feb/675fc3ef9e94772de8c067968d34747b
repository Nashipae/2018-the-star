Early one fine morning, we drove into the Athi basin. Along the river drive, the top of the head of a lioness appeared, peeping over the long grass. We quickly noted that she was hunting, creeping stealthily towards a grazing herd of zebra with wildebeest. The wind and the sun were in favour of the lioness. Then we noticed a second lioness a little further up the hill. We sat watching the unsuspecting herds for at least 15 long minutes. The atmosphere was virtually electric with the expectation of what could happen! The second lioness gave up her cover when she was spotted by some Zebra. Suddenly, the other lioness exploded from her cover in a fast and fluid action, the herds scattered in all directions in absolute panic. The lioness chased for several hundred metres, until she stopped suddenly in the dust cloud! Yes, the lioness had missed, but WOW! It was so close. What an incredible action moment! No doubt the herds were relieved to be able to live another day. The lioness stood for a while as she recovered from her hunting effort, and then she regally walked up the hill to rest under an acacia tree with the other lioness. The lions of the Nairobi National Park live a very challenging life. In the wild, lions are not always successful when they are hunting. Research has revealed that they are on average successful in less than 20 per cent of attempted hunts. Their success also increases as the seasons change from wet to dry. It is always amazing to consider that somehow, year after year, the lions continue to survive in this tiny 117 sq km national park surrounded by an ever growing Nairobi mega-city.
