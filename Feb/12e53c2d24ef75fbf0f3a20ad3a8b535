Radio host Anita NderuÂ has often shown us how much she loves her boyfriend, DJ Sun Man, and this Valentine's, they had a great time. She posted such a sweet message explaining what she has been through when it comes to love. "I love love and I don't mind being corny AF where it is concerned. It's my most vulnerable state, I love like the world is coming to an end, I have done the strangest and most incredible things for love, I am those people who get stupid when in love, the feeling of being in love is unlike any other emotion though! It's the best emotion I have ever experienced. I hope you felt all the love that the world had to offer yesterday, today and every day of your life. I am grateful I got to be a part of spreading love."
