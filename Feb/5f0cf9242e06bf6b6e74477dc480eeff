Multimedia University deservedly earned promotion to the Kenya Hockey Union Premier League ahead of the new season, sports director Francis Karugu has said. The students finished top of the national league in Pool ‘A’ to book one of the four play-off slots alongside Kisumu Youngsters, Mvita and Wazalendo Masters. Multi Media and Wazalendo were the best two teams in the play-offs, earning automatic qualification to the top tier. However, Multi Media succumbed 2-1 to Wazalendo in the play-off final held at the City Park over the weekend. Karugu noted the side have been a work in progress and it didn’t come as a surprise when they qualified for the Premier League this year after six years in the national league. “Last year, we came close to promotion to the Premier League only to finish third in the play-offs. We went back to the drawing board and made amends here and there and the management are extremely delighted that their efforts have finally paid off,” said the Karugu. “We take pride in the team and we are going to give them all the support they require since we want them to perform well in the top league. We are aware life in top tier is a different ball game and very competitive altogether, but we have earned our position by hard work and commitment and we want our presence to be felt.” The official observed that they will be recruiting players from secondary schools to bolster the squad . “We hope the intake will come with students who can play hockey. But, generally, we have a competitive side going by the fact that they won the Kenya University Sports Association event,” he added. Meanwhile, Technical University of Kenya and Kenyatta University have been relegated to the national league.
