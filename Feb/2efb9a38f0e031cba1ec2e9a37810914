Governor
Joseph Lenku’s ban on subdivision of land into ¼ acre plots of agricultural land for purposes of sale last December appears to have fallen on deaf ears. Lenku
in a move to regulate land use stopped land buyers from acquiring
the properties and subdividing them for housing
development. But
the warning, which also stated that such activities would not be approved by
the county government, has not shown any impact as land buyers continue to do
the opposite. County lands executive Hamilton Parseina toured Olentoko area on Saturday was shocked that
rampant subdivision of plots was still going on. Shockingly
again, the Star took pictures of fresh subdivision of land property on
land neighbouring a senior county land surveyor’s house. Parseina saw fresh erection of posters by land developers in Oltinga, Ilnaroj and Saikeri areas indicating that sale of quarter acre plots for housing are on sale. Elders told him point-blank that poverty has forced the people to sell their property in small sizes because they cannot educate their children without money. He said no development project will be approved on land beyond areas zoned by the county government.
