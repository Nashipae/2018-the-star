Bidco coach Leonard Saleh has exuded confidence that his charges will surpass last year’s performances despite being held to a barren draw by debutants Kibera Black Stars at Thika Sub County Stadium over the weekend. However, Saleh observed that competition in the second tier league is high and that they will have to be at their best if they are to be among the contenders for promotion at the conclusion of the campaign. “The match was tough. A draw is a fair result but we will be working to better this performance in our next match,” Saleh told FKF official website. “In this league (NSL), no one is guaranteed promotion since the competition is very high, which is a positive thing for our players, coaches and the league at large. But we will definitely do better than (we did) last season.” Black Stars coach Godfrey Oduor said he would have fancied a win, but noted that a point away from home is welcome. “We didn’t get the result we anticipated, but a point away from home is welcome,” said Oduor. “We are working towards promotion just like any other team, and any point we collect is crucial in attaining our target.” In other matches, hosts Modern Coast Rangers upset favourites KCB courtesy of Nahashon Thiong’o’s solitary strike at the Mbaraki Sports Club in Mombasa.
