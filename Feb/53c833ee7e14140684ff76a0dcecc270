DJ Mo has been embroiled in a crazy back and forth with an upcoming gospel artiste called Nexxie over a Sh20,000 bribe that was supposed to buy him exposure as well as airplay on the Crossover show. DJ Mo says he returned the money and does not ask for money to play artistes' songs on air. Nexxie further provided screenshots incriminating the star in a recent Instagram post, showing DJ Mo had taken the money along with DK Kwenye Beat. Commenting on these claims, DJ Mo said, "That is just a story he has written. Me, I gave out evidence. His point is to bring me down. That is just a story he is giving. I am going the legal way because I am tired of the back and forth." Nexxie has since deleted the posts and appealed for a "peace treaty."
