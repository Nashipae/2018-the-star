A former Mombasa MCA has become a squatter. Nassir Rashid, who has been a county leader for 10 years, on Saturday said he will fight for his fellow squatters until they get their land back. He represented Ganjoni/Shimanzi since 2007, when he was elected councillor under the old Constitution and MCA in 2013. Rashid was ousted by Priscillah Mumba after he fell out with the Mombasa ODM leadership. On Saturday, he led squatters on a five-acre parcel in Jibana village, Utange, in protests against police officers from the Bamburi police station, whom they accuse of harassing them. They say there is a plot to evict them from the land, where at least 100 people live. “I have been living on this plot No 502 in Bamburi, where I have become a squatter,” Rashid said. Squatters secretary Jamal Kombo urged the government to stop the harassment.
