Former Football Federation of Kenya President Sam Nyamweya yesterday accused his successor of suspending him from all football activities without hearing his side of the story. The former football senior official told Justice Chacha Mwita that the federation led by President Nick Mwendwa contravened his rights to fair administrative action when it made a decision without hearing him. He said he had resigned from the position and wondered why they went on to suspend him yet he was not in office. He said he resigned from his position on February 9, 2016 and the purported suspension was therefore of no consequence. He faulted Mwendwa of failing to either summon him or give him notice of the intention to suspend him from all football activities. He told the Judge that the NEC meeting convened by Mwendwa and Robert Muthomi had no authority to suspend him from football activities. According to him, the suspension was done out of malice and was meant to ridicule him. Mwendwa and Muthomi, however, asked the court to dismiss the case, saying Nyamweya had failed to prove any of the allegation. The two saidNyamweyaâ€™s resignation was not valid because the former FKF President did not follow the laid down procedures when he tendered his resignation. Mwendwa said a member wishing to resign must fulfill his financial obligation and Nyamweya had not done so. And even after handing in the resignation letter, Mwendwa said his predecessor continued to engage in football activities. Further, the officials said Nyamweya should have resolved the matter internally because there are mechanisms to handle disputes. The court will rule on May 27.
