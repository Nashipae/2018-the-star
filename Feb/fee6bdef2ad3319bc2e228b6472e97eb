Award-winning gospel singer Ringtone is set to release yet another sizzling jam, featuring Nigerian international Ada. "We were to release the song a couple of days ago but Ada lost her relative and we had to postpone the date. Expect it in a few days time," he said. The Pamela hitmaker says his new song is about how this year is going to be "my year of blessings". "I have been in this industry for long and I think I've mastered what works. I have worked with Ada because I am trying to expand my boundaries, just like I did with Christina Shusho. We're satisfied with the local industry and that's why I chose Ada. As Kenyan artistes, we are trying to rectify the things we've been doing wrong in the past." Ringtone and Christina's song has been nominated for the upcoming Hi-People awards in Uganda alongside secular songs. The singer called upon Kenyans to support their own, just like they do for Nigerians and Tanzanians. "I urge Kenyans to support our local music. We've woken up from slumber and are working very hard now. My target is that my new song gets a million views in 48 hours." Ringtone caused a stir online after he asked for anyone with Zari's contacts after breaking up with Diamoond. He says "I didn't say I want to marry Zari. I'm the best man for any woman for I have great plans in life. I will appreciate if you help me with her number."
