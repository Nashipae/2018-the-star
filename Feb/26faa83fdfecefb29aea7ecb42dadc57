Water levels in Lake Naivasha have significantly dropped in the last two months because of drought and water abstraction. The Water Resources Users Association said water levels in all rivers have dropped sharply, with some streams drying up. Association chairman Enoch Kiminta said harsh weather conditions have played a part in the crisis. He on Saturday said the lakeâ€™s catchment area has also been affected by the drought. Kiminta said mining near River Karati has disrupted water flow. The river is one of the major tributaries of Lake Naivasha. He urged Nema to address the situation. Lake Naivasha Beach Management Unit chairman David Kilo said the drop in water levels has led to a decline in fish catch.
