A low key start to the National Super league season brought with it identical results for Western Stima and Nairobi Stima, who picked up 2-0 wins over Modern Coast Rangers and Nairobi City Stars respectively. Western Stima, who are hoping for return to the top flight league in quick time were helped by two goals from Johana Mwita and Maurice Dukully. Nairobi Stima also shrugged off a disappointing finish to their 2017 season to see off Nairobi City Stars. Stephen Owusu and Alex Luganji were on target for Stima. KCB’s match against Muhoroni Youth that had been scheduled for Sunday at Camp Toyoyo did not materialize as the latter failed to turn up. The bankers consequently took home all three points and two goals. Another promotion hopeful, Ushuru, meanwhile, got underway their quest for top-flight football with a win and so did Isibania and Kibera Black Stars. Police and Kisumu All-Stars were, however, held to identical barren draws by Talanta and St Joseph Youth respectively. Ushuru edged out Administration Police 2-0 at Camp Toyoyo grounds. Benson Amianda and Ekaliani Ndolo were on the scoresheet for the taxmen. Top spot, though, belongs to Isibania, who scored the highest tally of goals this season in a 3-1 win over Nakuru All Stars. A brace by Patrick Mvita and a goal by Abdalla Ismael were enough to render Jerome Baraka’s early opener for the guests a mere consolation. New boys Kangemi All-Stars kicked off their campaign on a sour note, losing 2-1 to Bidco United. A first-half goal by Martin Lemaiyan had got Kangemi All-Stars to a promising start. The new boys would, however, be pegged back by two goals by Bidco United’s Augustine Etemesi and Jacob Onyango.
