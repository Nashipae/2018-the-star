But local leaders intervened and implored on them to remain at the Olympic stage where they had camped since morning. The demonstrators teargassed themselves after police chose not to interrupt their protests. "Most are goons who want to cause chaos to loot as police chase after them. They thrive on stealing during commotions and that is why they are bored by police's absence," a resident told the told the Star at an informal school. "It would have been worse if police confronted them because they [goons] would have scored, getting an opportunity to loot." Most businesses including banks remained open with a little interruption on suspicion of police's arrival. The demonstrators on the by-pass had barricaded the section between Lang'ata and Ngong roads to loot from motorists but police arrived in haste and dispersed them, and opened up the road. But police remained vigil along the road and used teargas to disperse the goons attempting to regroup and return to the road.
