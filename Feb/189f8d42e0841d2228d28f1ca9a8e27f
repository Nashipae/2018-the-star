At least 50 Kenyan football fans are set to travel to Russia for the 2018 World Cup in June. Kenya Football Fans Association (KEFOFA) chairman Francis Liboyi made the promise after being elected the new association head during the Annual Genaral Meeting held yesterday in Nairobi. “Over the years, we have been having a registered association that was inactive. It is our belief that a better organised office can achieve much in our quest to have a proper running organisation to complement other stakeholders in the game of football,” said Liboyi. Liboyi also promised to bring on board all the stakeholders including players, coaches and team management. He said his office will focus on representing and campaigning on behalf of Kefofa members, increasing opportunities for fans and active support to the clubs, promoting and advancing views of Kefofa locally and abroad and uniting fans across the country. The newly-appointed Ceo of the organisation Shem Okota announced that they have reached out to Coalition of Supporters Unions of Africa (COSUA) founder and president Sario Abebrese who hosted them in Ethiopia last week and got the ticket allocation for the Russian finals. “My office will immediately reach out to the president of Cosua because Kefofa supports his noble vision of seeking to promote and achieve African unity through sports,” said Okota. During the AGM, the association’s patron former vice-president Kalonzo Musyoka pledged to continue supporting them. Other officie holders are secretary Wilson Opondo, treasurer Josephat Amugune and organising secretary Mark Ogada.
