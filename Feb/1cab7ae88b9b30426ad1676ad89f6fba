Chief Justice David Maraga yesterday said compliance with court orders is not an option for any individual or institution. He said obeying such orders is not a favour to the Judiciary, but a crucial matter of constitutional and civic obligation. Maraga said the recent disregard of such orders is not only injurious to the rule of law, but also at odds with the Constitution. It amounts to dereliction of public duty, he said. “If any party is aggrieved by a court order, there are legal mechanisms to have it reviewed, varied or set aside or even appealing against it,” he said in a statement. There have been worrying developments in the administration of justice, a move that has threatened the rule of law, Maraga added. His statement comes at a time the state has blatantly ignored three court orders. The first was for the reinstatement of CA chief executive Francis Wangusi, this was followed by the order to reopen TV stations — it was finally honoured, and the production in court of self-declared NRM General Miguna Miguna. Maraga said all state officers take an oath of office to protect and uphold the Constitution. “I wish to reiterate that every government officer, government institution or private citizen is obliged to comply with court orders. Failing to do so has consequences and judges and magistrates are at liberty to invoke the legal avenues available to enforce court orders,” he said. The apex court president said courts are temples of justice and places of refuge for those seeking protection, and must never be despoiled through acts of physical transgressions or blatant disregard of their pronouncements. “I want to assure the country that the Judiciary will continue to dispense its constitutional duty.” Read:All Kenyans must follow court orders, Maraga says after Miguna drama Click here for the latest political news
