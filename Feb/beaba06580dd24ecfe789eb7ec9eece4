West Pokot chief has been sacked for colluding with bandits as county commissioner Apollo Okello issued a shoot-to-kill order against people with illegal firearms. Okello on Thursday confiscated Muino chief Jacob Lotwalima’s uniform and ordered him to pick up his dismissal letter the following day. Lotwalima was sacked during a peace meeting in Kamalei, Pokot Central. Ten people have been killed in frequent bandit raids since January.
