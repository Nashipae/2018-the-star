Residents of Kimilili living in grass-thatched huts will have new houses in three weeks, area MP Didmus Barasa has said. The Jubilee MP began building iron sheet-roofed houses for residents in huts in December last year. “You voted for me and I became an MP, and I cannot live in a storied house while my voters live in dilapidated conditions,” he said. “We would rather use funds to ensure that God’s people are living in good conditions, and their prayers of living in an iron sheet-roofed house are answered.” He spoke on Monday at Khwiroro village in Kibingei ward, when he supervised the construction of a house. Barasa said 206 houses that were grass-thatched have been brought down and replaced with iron sheet-roofed houses. The MP said only 42 houses remain to be built in the project that has cost Sh2.6 million. “We must change our ways of doing politics to help the electorate,” he said.
