National Under-23 women’s volleyball team setter, Faith Imodia is among the 16 players recruited by the newly formed CID women’s volleyball team ahead of the next month’s Kenya Volleyball Federation national league. The first leg is set for March 23-25 at the Bungoma High School. Imodia was part of the team that participated at the World Championship last year in Slovenia while still attached to St. Paul’s University. The newly appointed coach Daniel Bor said 10 of the 16 players are drawn from the other clubs and promised to unveil the outfit soon. He said five other players including setter Jane Mumbua, left attackers duo of Winnie Nyamai and Naomi Masobo, middle blocker Marion Cheptoo and libero Veronica Makokha have been recruited from schools across the country. Bor, a former GSU player and assistant coach warned the opponents to underrate them at their own peril. “I have experience as a former player and we have the technical know how. A big part of my squad are players and that is a plus,” he said, adding: “We are a new outfit but very capable. Our objective is to make it to the top four and there after challenge for the title.” Team manger Neddy Kilimo echoed Bor sentiments saying: “The turn out during the trials held last week was good and we settled for the best players who I believe will be challenging for the trophy.”
