The NGO Coordination Board CEO Fazul Mahamed has resigned days to end of his term in office. "It is with deep regret that I submit my notice of resignation as chief executive officer effective May 1," Fazul said on Monday. He described his past three years of his tenure at the board as "nothing short of pure excitement and joy". "I wish to sincerely thank the board of directors for the invaluable opportunities extended and I commit to effective, expedient and smooth transition." Fazul, in his notice, wished the board the very best in its endeavours of creating an enabling environment for thriving of the charity sector. "...and for the continuous demand for greater accountability and transparency amongst NGOs. It has truly been a pleasure and honour to have been service," he said. Fazul's term ended in November last year after the Labour Court issued an order barring the state from renewing or extending his contract. In the orders, Justice Hellen Wasilwa directed Interior CS Fred Matiang'i against renewing Mahamed's term or reappointing him to the role. Last year, EACC, after fresh investigations, declared that Fazul was hired as NGOs Coordination Board CEO despite lacking qualifications. The EACC forwarded a report to the DPP on administrative action against the official over claims he was not qualified. DPP Keriako Tobiko returned the file to the commission recommending further investigations. The probe culminated into the latest findings. In a gazette notice dated March 31, the commission said it had finished its inquiry into allegations that Mahamed forged a certificate to secure the job.
