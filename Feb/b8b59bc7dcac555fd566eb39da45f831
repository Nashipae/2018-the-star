Sixteen unclaimed bodies many of them murder victims are lying at the Moi County Referral Hospital mortuary in Voi, Taita Taveta county, human rights activists say. Haki Africa executive director Hussein Khalid said the bodies include those of two foreigners. An unidentified severed head is also lying at the mortuary. The bodies were collected along the Mombasa-Nairobi highway on different occasions. They have several injuries, suggesting the people were assaulted and killed. The hospital’s medical superintendent Felix Kimotho said the bodies have been lying at the mortuary since October 2017 last year. They occupy 50 per cent of the mortuary’s capacity. “The injuries in their bodies suggest that they were strangled before being killed. That is a clear indication that they were brutally attacked for reasons that need to be investigated,” Kimotho said. Khalid said bodies were being dumped in the Tsavo National Park after extrajudicial executions. ”It is very worrying when body parts are thrown in the forest,” Khalid said.
