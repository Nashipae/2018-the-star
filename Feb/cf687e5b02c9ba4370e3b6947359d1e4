Environment and Forestry CS nominee Keriako Tobiko on Friday blamed poor leadership at the county level for the garbage menace. He said fixing the problem would be top of his priorities if he gets the job. Tobiko was the first to appear on the second day of vetting before the Appointments Committe. He said he would follow up on the drafting of the Waste Management Bill that seeks to impose on the counties the legal obligation to deal with waste. “The National Environment Management Authority took both Nairobi and Mombasa counties to court due to the garbage problem, but the judge urged them to work together, instead of going the court way,” he said. “I’ll engage the counties collectively and bilaterally to addresse waste management, which is having a huge effect on the environment. I’ll ensure the right to a clean and healthy environment is upheld.” Tobiko was responding to an issue that was raised by the National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale about the need for Kenyans to enjoy the right to a clean and healthy environment as envisioned in Article 70 of the Constitution.
