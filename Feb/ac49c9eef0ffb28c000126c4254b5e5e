Teachers in Wajir have threatened to close all public schools from today if the government will not deploy more staff. They said on Saturday in Wajir town that they are burdened and cannot meet the needs of all pupils. About 200 non-native teachers have fled over security concerns, following the killing of two colleagues by Shabaab militants. In Batalu Primary School, only the head teacher remains after eight non-natives left. Learning has been disrupted. Secretary Nur Bardat said the situation on the ground is “worse than earlier thought”. He accused the TSC of inciting teachers and transferring non-natives to their home counties. “We were very considerate, having sat down with the TSC and facilitated the transfer of 54 nonlocal teachers from areas along the border seen to be unsafe for the teachers. What could we have done more than that?” Bardat asked. “We are already discriminated against through historical injustices. We have no proper roads and hospitals. Let them not try this now. We want the President to intervene.” Chairman Abdi Aden blamed the TSC for the woes bedevelling the county’s education sector. He said non-native teachers were comfortable working in urban centres, but the Teachers’ Service Commission disregarded this and transferred them to other regions. Interior CS Fred Matiang’i is expected in the county tomorrow to address security concerns. Governor Mohamed Abdi urged residents to work with the government to improve security. “It’s unfortunate to see something planned by one or two people affect the whole county. It’s disheartening to see our schools get closed,” he said during a public participation forum.
