The killed ivory trade investigator Esmond Bradley died of excessive bleeding following a stub on the neck, a postmortem has revealed. Government Pathologist Johansen Odour conducted the examination on Thursday and noted that there was a single stub wound on Bradley’s neck. Yesterday, detectives from the Homicide Unit narrowed down their investigations to two theories. The officers suspect that Bradley’s murder was a normal robbery although nothing has been reported stolen so far. The officers will also probe a possibility that Bradley, 75 , could have been killed by ivory cartels for his work. Nairobi DCI chief Ireri Kamwende declined to comment on the status of their investigations. “We are doing fine and soon we hope to make an arrest,” the police chief said. Bradley was found dead at his house in Karen last Sunday afternoon. The conservationist, who was alone in the house at the time, was stubbed once in the neck. He has authored several investigative reports on rhino and ivory smuggling in Kenya and the trade in China, Vietnam and Laos in Asia. Bradley was working on his latest report on rhino and ivory trade by the time of his death. His wife Chryssee Martin, who reported the death, said she found her husband’s lifeless body after coming from a nature walk at around 4pm. Bradley, an American geographer, had been travelling all over the world with his wife, Chryssee, and colleagues Lucy Vigne and Dan Stiles. They were on a mission to identify ivory and rhino markets, the traffickers and the modern-day uses. He was once a UN special envoy for rhino conservation.
