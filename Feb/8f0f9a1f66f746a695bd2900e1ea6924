One person was killed and 17 injured at Delmonte Junction near Blue Post Hotel, Thika, on Tuesday morning. The crash involved a matatu and a lorry. “The lorry stopped right in the middle of the road and the speeding matatu rammed into from its side and landed in some nearby culverts,” witness Lawrence Kiiru said. The injured were rushed to Thika Level 5 Hospital. One died while receiving treatment. Medical superintendent Patrick Nyaga said the victim had head, chest and stomach injuries; he had also fractured his ribs and legs. “We received 18 victims of an accident at 7.30 am four of whom were in critical condition ... Seven will be admitted for close attendance by doctors but 10 have been treated and discharged,” Nyaga said. Thika OCPD Willy Simba said the lorry driver, who was also hospitalised, will be charged with careless driving once he’s discharged. “He failed to give way to the speeding matatu to pass leading to the accident," he said
