One of the highlights of this year’s
Grammys was when pop star Rihanna danced the Gwara Gwara as she sang “Wild Thoughts”. The two dancers are Stephen Ojo (Nigeria)
and Caleb Bonney (Ghana). Asked how they got the gig, Ojo said, “Well, Caleb got a call from one of our friends, who happens
to be a huge supporter and great help to the AVO boys, Tanisha Scott. She
asked him to gather a group to make a quick audition video to Rihanna’s ‘Wild
Thoughts’. She made it clear that we had a chance to perform at the Grammys, but
no one was guaranteed a spot.” They said sharing the stage with some of the world’s most respected
artistes was “a blessing”. “Having Rihanna do the Gwara Gwara with us was certainly an
accomplishment for us. Overall the experience was great.”
