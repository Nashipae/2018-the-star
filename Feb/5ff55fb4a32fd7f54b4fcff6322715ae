Makolanders striker Neddy Atieno believes they have the capability of bettering their performance in the Football Kenya Federation women’s Premier League this weekend. Atieno missed the better part of last season as she was away training with Kenya Defence Forces. Makolanders finished second in Zone ‘A’ behind former champions Thika Queens and later placed fourth in the play-offs behind Oserian, Thika and winners Vihiga Queens. Atieno, a national team striker, said the team begun on a low note last season but gained momentum in the second. She hopes the team will pick from where they left and go all the way and challenge for the title . “The team picked up well in the second leg, winning matches back to back and although we didn’t finish on the podium, we made good account of ourselves,” noted Atieno. She added: “I hope we will continue with the same spirit. The league is unified and that means we will play many matches which is good. I know with my work, commitment, I might not be able to feature in all the matches but whenever I will get the chance, I will work with the rest of team mates to ensure we have good results.” Makolanders take on Kayole Starlet this Saturday at Camp Toyoyo in their opening tie of the season.
