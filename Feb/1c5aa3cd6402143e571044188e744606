Kenya must first deal with the cancer of corruption before embarking on major economic development projects, US Ambassador Robert Godec has said. He urged leaders in the national and county governments to play a critical role in fighting corruption and stop it once and for all. “Corruption has become a severe cancer that has slowed economic growth in Kenya, so every person has got an obligation to fight it at every level, both in the counties and the national government,” Godec said. He denied claims the US is meddling with the political and leadership affairs of Kenya, saying “We are only keen in partnering to better the lives of thousands of people”. Godec said terrorism and cattle rustling are among the major challenges contributing to slow development. He said although it is hard to fight all these challenges, the government must pool resources and fight them anyway. Godec spoke at the signing of a partnership deal with Baringo Governor Stanley Kiptis o Wednesday. He toured Baringo and West Pokot counties.
