Former KTN Straight Up TV host Tero Mdee recently came back to the limelight as a musician but under a different stage name, Nancy Hebron. From the look of things, the Tanzanian gospel singer is now ready to open up about her mysterious disappearance from the entertainment industry in Kenya just when she was at her peak. The gospel singer is in the country for her first-ever media tour since she embarked on her gospel music journey. She has a gospel track titled Beautiful Jesus, released with the help of her sisters Vanessa Mdee and Marianne. Nancy is married to prophet Hebron from Tanzania, and the two have been carrying out evangelical work under their ministry. After she wedded a few years ago, her family was not happy, but she went ahead and denounced her family names and called herself Nancy Hebron. She talked about her marriagee during an interview on Kiss 100 morning show. "My husband was my brother's friend. My family was upset about my relationship with Hebron because I did not tell them on time, but later I spoke to them and I told them. They had to understand that a relation is between two people. There is no way one can decide for me who I should marry." Asked about whether dowry was paid for her, she said her mother does not believe in payment of dowry "because in a sense, it feels like for the man, you are buying her, which is not right". "After three years, we did another wedding, which we now think was good. We invited family and friends. The first wedding was a bit of a mess because there was too much drama. The one we did later is the one we would want to remember. Hebron had another woman who left him because she had run out of money," Nancy said.
