Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa has forgiven NASA co-principal Musalia Mudavadi over the December 26 humiliation at a Maragoli Cultural Festival. He was forced to leave the venue at Municipal Grounds in Mbale after an irate crowd shouted that he was not welcome. Addressing hundreds of mourners at his brother the late Vice President Michael Wamalwa’s home in Milimani, Kitale, during the burial of his widow, Yvonne, Eugene said, ” Wetang’ula [Moses] please tell Mudavadi I have forgiven him. I even thought he would attend this burial”. Mudavadi and others are free to come to Kitale and sell their agenda, he said. He, however, warned politicians from Western Kenya against being intolerant. He urged them to be respectful of opponents. Wamalwa thanked President Uhuru for appointing him as Cabinet Secretary for the second term. Deputy President William Ruto said the state will educate Wamalwa’s children in Australia. He said Yvonne’s sister Jacky will be appointed in the Kenyan High Commissioner’s office in Australia to help her take care of her children.
