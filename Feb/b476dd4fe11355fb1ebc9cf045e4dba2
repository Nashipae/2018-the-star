Media personality Lillian Muli and comedian Eric Omondi will join Texas Cancer Centre in celebrating their inaugural annual childhood cancer awareness on Thursday. The event will involve children living with cancer giving out Valentine's flowers and gifts to the public. The awareness campaign will highlight the fact that about five per cent of all cancers in children are caused by an inherited mutation — a genetic mutation that can be passed from parents to children. TCC oncologist Dr Catherine Nyongesa said International Childhood Cancer Day is a day when people come together to “advance cures and transform care”, and make childhood cancer a national child health priority. “As Kenyans, we hope to steadily improve cure rates from the current 20-30 per cent to survival rates seen in high-income countries, which reach an average of 80 per cent,” Nyongesa said. “The Texas Cancer Centre will join the rest of the world in marking this day. Texas will having a series of activities involving parents with children who have survived child hood cancer. Share the challenges and create awareness."
