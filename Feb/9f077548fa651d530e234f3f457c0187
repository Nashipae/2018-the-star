Two herders were shot dead and a police reservist seriously injured in an attack by bandits in Kerio Valley on Monday. Gregory Kipkemoi, 25, and Andrew Biwott, 28, died instantly in an assault which came barely three days after another in Marakwet highlands. Chief Abraham Yano said the over 40 attackers who raided the area are suspected to be from Tiaty, Baringo county.

The reservists, Luka Kimaiyo, was shot in the jaw and left arm. He was rushed to Kapsowar Mission Hospital and later referred to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. "They struck at around midday before they were repulsed by herders and police reservists. They fled towards Loiywat in Tiaty," Yano said, adding no livestock were stolen during the attack. He called on his counterparts in Tiaty to help identify the bandits to help police arrest them. Locals said the fighting caused a scare, paralysing learning in Chesongoch, Ng’enyirel and Kombases primary schools. Among the deceased is Kimoi Betaki, aunt to Senate Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen. Betaki, 63, was shot dead in Kaben, Marakwet East on Saturday, January 27, barely two days after Peter Komen, 50, a fisherman was killed in Arror, Marakwet West.
