Bungoma County teams return to the Kenya Volleyball Federation national league next month after sitting out of the just ended season. The first leg of the national leg is set for March 23-25 at the Bungoma High School grounds. Team manager Vitalis Kong’ani confirmed the new development saying the two teams (men and women) have been sponsored by Bungoma County through Governor Wycliffe Wangamati to rejoin the league and are ready to rumble. “We are happy that we will be playing in the league for the second time. We want to register our appreciation to the governor for his commitment to the teams and we want to return the favour by performing well throughout the season,” said Kong’ani. “I want to disagree and refute the rumours that the teams were being disbanded due to malpractices. Last year was an election year and the then governor and myself were seeking respective elective posts and we did not have the resources and time to keep the outfits in the league. But we are now back and ready for the season.” The official also confirmed the acquisition of Kenya Prisons’ quartet of Florence Bosire, Florida Juma, Caren Wekesa and Esther Simiyu as well as Nairobi Water’s Naomi Simiyu. “A big chunk of the players who are currently training at the Kanduyi Stadium have been drawn from secondary schools and I believe that, with the experience the five players are bringing on board and the urge by the upcoming players to do good in the league, the outfit will ruffle few feathers here and there,” . Moses Lukorito will be the head of the technical bench for both teams. Shaban Likhayo will coach the men’s team while Andrew Khaoya will be in charge of the ladies’ team.
