Wrangles at the Kenya International Freight and Warehousing Association have gotten worse after some members demanded fresh elections of officials. There are two competing factions. Some members on Tuesday afternoon accused the current secretariat of dictatorship after they said it failed to consult them on key decisions. The secretariat increased the annual subscription fee from Sh7,000 to Sh10,000 and plans to amend Kifwa 1999 constitution. William Ojonyo and Auni Bhaji both say they are bonafide chairpersons of the association. Each has his backers. In November last year, Bhaji’s side took Ojonyo to court, barring him from claiming to be the national chair-elect or making any comment on behalf of the association. Onjonyo stormed the Tuesday meeting, however, and demanded the association calls for fresh elections before any decisions are made. The elections are expected next month. “I was elected by members. I have no intention of bringing the association down, but if my actions to call for an election will mean to kill the association, then let it be,” Ojonyo said. He walked out immediately after his speech, with his supporters. Bhaji said Ojonyo’s unending court moves have hindered services since he took office. He was happy the case was dismissed by the Mililani law courts. Ojonyo said change in the association lies in the ballot and maintained he will rally his supporters to achieve that.
