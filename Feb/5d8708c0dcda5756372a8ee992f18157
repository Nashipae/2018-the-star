Technology advancement has complicated Kenya's war on terrorism, leaving security agents in the race to catch up with tech savvy terrorists. Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss George Kinoti yesterday said it is common to find those financing terror attacks in Kenya are in Tanzania, while while recruiters are in Uganda, "and by the time time we are asking who these guys are, you hear a bang". Kinoti said terrorism remains the most serious threat to Kenya's security. But the country's top detective said cooperation among all security agencies,including NIS and the DCI, in pooling resources and sharing intelligence and in analysing situations has helped thwart many terror attacks. "These terrorists are smart people. We want to be smarter than them but the advancement in technology has made it so complicated. We are, however, matching them and that is the reason we have foiled many attacks," Kinoti said. "You can see how our security agencies recently stopped an attack, the kind of a devastating massacre. They were stopped on their tracks." Kinoti spoke on sidelines of a forum on international and transnational organised crimes dubbed Networks of Accountability at Strathmore University, Nairobi. He said partnerships and cooperation between neighbouring countries is very important in securing East Africa and the world at large. "Terrorism remains the big menace among the organised crimes. Human trafficking and drug trafficking, although related to terrorism, are better manageable. In fact we can't say they have reached the level of terrorism," Kinoti said. "It [terrorism] is absolute terror, mass killings and devastation to the economy and the entire humanity and that is our main concern as law enforcers and it the main reason we have to cooperate with other partners, countries and law enforcing agencies."
