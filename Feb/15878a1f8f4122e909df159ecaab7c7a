A former Cabinet minister from Western Kenya, who is still hoping he could get a job in President Uhuru Kenyatta’s government, shocked his contemporaries at the weekend. The man, who was instrumental in Jubilee campaigns last year, told his friends he was considering crossing over to NASA if the government doesn’t give him a job in the next three months. “I can’t be reduced to a beggar when I did my part in pushing for the Jubilee agenda in the region,” he told his surprised audience. He complained that most of the people he worked with in Jubilee have already landed plum jobs save for very few. ******* A former governor aspirant from Western Kenya is a worried man. The politician who challenged the election of his rival has been spending sleepless nights ever since he lodged his petition in the High Court. With the ruling of his petition expected out soon, the politician is said to be worried because the courts have made a habit of slapping losers with huge legal expenses running into millions. The man, who almost ran broke after mounting an expensive and lavish campaign in the August 8 election, is now said to be reaching out to friends for financial support just in case his petition is dismissed with costs. ***** A lawmaker from Central Kenya and who is critical of Deputy President William Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid has made a hasty U-turn. The vocal MP, who is reportedly softening his stance, called one of Ruto’s key allies from the region at the weekend and extended an olive branch. He is understood to have indicated his willingness to work with Team Ruto, but apparently gave some conditions that must first be met. ****** Could 33 expelled University of Nairobi students be seeking legal representation from high-ranking NASA lawyers to help get back to college? Word has it that the students have begun to approach top opposition lawyers for their services against vice chancellor Peter Mbithi who has refused to have them back. The furious students, expelled in 2016 over the disputed Sonu elections, say the university has refused to honour last year's court ruling ordering their readmission. "We need your pro bono services to apply for contempt of court orders. We'll appreciate you quick services," one of the expelled students said to a NASA lawyer. ********** “This might be my last drink, going by the high fines against those who lose petitions,” complained a Nairobi politician to his friends at the weekend: “Courts might be reducing local politics to a rich man’s affair.”
