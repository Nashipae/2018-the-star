Despite denying it, Mombasa speaker Harub Khatri’s recent moves suggest he is being groomed for a major political job. The speaker has quickly emerged as one of Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho’s favourite politicians. The two often attend functions together. And in the clearest sign he is being groomed to take over from Joho, Khatri (pictured, Right) was on hand to receive NASA leader Raila Odinga on Wednesday at JKIA. Sources close to the speaker and Joho told the Star the governor was the one to receive ‘Baba’ but he sent Khatri. “It was to show him the ropes in the political world because Khatri is still green, though he has a lot of potential. That is what I saw in him,” the source said. Joho could slowly be introducing Khatri to Raila to earn his trust, he said.
