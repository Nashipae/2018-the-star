Police in Navakholo subcounty want a medical doctor at the Kakamega County General Hospital interdicted. Dr Benedict Wangwe was arrested and charged with attempted murder, rape and grievous bodily harm. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. His accuser is Eunice Muhindi, who worked as a bar maid at his Bushiri Complex bar. Letter In a February 1 letter to the chief of staff and copied to hospital medical superintendent Victor Zimbulu, Navakholo DCIO Leonard Kurgat called for action against the medic. Nothing was done and two weeks later, Wangwe is still on duty. Acting chief of staff Musa Chibole said his office had not received the letter. “We shall act as and when was see the letter because these are capital offences and somebody must be interdicted,” he said. Chibole said he will follow up on the matter from today. Wangwe is accused of trying to strangle Muhindi and throw her down from the second floor of Bushiri complex bar on January 21. Wangwe is out on bond and is set to appear in court for the second mention tomorrow.
