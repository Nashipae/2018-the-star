A Mombasa MCA has claimed an attempt was made on his life after he demanded ward development and bursary money. Fahad Kassim, who heads Mjambere, said he also questioned why MCAs had not been given car loans and mortgages. President Uhuru Kenyatta had, in March 2014, suggested that MCAs be given vehicle grants as is the case with MPs and senators. The president said this was because the more than 2,200 ward representatives serve the interests of Kenyans. Uhuru rooted for equality since just like the others, MCAs are elected leaders. Kassim said his resolve to have these issues prioritised and acted on put his life in danger. He claimed he was trailed by people in three vehicles on January 25. “The incident took place around Nyali. The passengers in the vehicles were determined to either scare or harm me,” he said. Kassim, a licensed gun holder, said he did not fire because he was not sure whether police were in the cars. According to him, MCAs had threatened to disapprove the county's executives if the three demands were not met. “But in my absence, they approved them,” he said, noting they are broke because loans and mortgages have not been approved. “These MCAs don’t have money. They borrow each other Sh200 for transport. That is the sorry state we are in,” he said. Kassim said only Mombasa, out of all counties, is yet to award ward development funds. He further claimed that to shut him down, he was briefly removed as the chair of the infrastructure committee. None of the MCAs The Star contacted wished to be on record. “He’s lying. Some of the issues he is raising will be dealt with by relevant committees and departments,” one said. Click here for the latest political news
