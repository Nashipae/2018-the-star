The European Union’s withdrawal of Sh3.6 billion for forest conservation — because of forced evictions — is likely to aggravate destruction of key water towers in the North Rift. They include Embobut, Kaptagat and Cherangany forests. Counties in the North Rift have urged the EU to reconsider its decision because more than 10,000 acres of forest are under threat. Trans Nzoia Deputy Governor Stanley Tarus said the EU decision could threaten efforts underway to protect water catchments areas. “It’s our counties in Western, North Rift and Nyanza that stand to suffer the most because most of the rivers in the counties originate from the forests,” he said. Tarus spoke to the Star on the phone on Monday after he met environmentalists. The EU suspended the project on January 17 following violent evictions of the Seng’wer community from Embobut Forest in Elgeyo Marakwet county. One person was killed. “We decided to suspend the project after the government defied our alert against the use of excessive force on members of the community,” EU Ambassador Stefano Dejak said. Environmentalists have warned that the alarming rate of degradation in the Mt Elgon and Cherangany water towers will have dire consequences. Tarus said the counties have written to the EU, requesting that it resume funding as they find common ground. Green Belt Movement’s senior programmes officer Teresa Maina said failure to rehabilitate the water towers would ruin the lives of more than one million people.
