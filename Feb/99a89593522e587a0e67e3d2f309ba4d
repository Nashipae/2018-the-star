Malindi tourism stakeholders have dismissed claims that terrorism is harming the sector in the resort town. They also denied reports by the Daily Nation on Monday that showed the town in a pathetic condition due to low business ‘caused by terror attacks’. Rejecting the Page One article were chairman of the Kenya Hotel Keepers and Caterers Association in North Coast Phillip Chai, hotelier Godfrey Karume, businessman Charles Muriungi, Rodgers Sylvester of Drift Wood Beach Club, businessman Shabir Kassamjee and Stephen Kanja of Kanja and Wolf Safaris. Addressing a press conference at Baobab Restaurant in Malindi on Tuesday , they said the information was untrue and hurt the image of the tourist town. They said pictures of the Old Sinbad Hotel and the article were misleading and sensational.
