The government yesterday extended the registration of learners on the National Education Management Information System to March 31. Yesterday was the initial deadline for school heads to complete the exercise. Speaking yesterday in Nairobi, Education PS Belio Kipsang said so far, only 3.8 million (35 per cent) out of 11 million students have registered. “The ministry has, however, noted that the process has been slowed down by the fact that most learners were yet to acquire birth certificates that were required for the registration,” he said. Kipsang said the ministry will work with the Interior ministry to speed up the issuance of birth certificates to students. Learners require birth certificates to generate Unique Personal Identifiers. “From the foregoing situation, and in consultation with other stakeholders, the ministry has resolved to extend the Nemis data collection exercise to March 31 to accommodate learners who have yet to acquire birth certificates,” Kipsang said. He urged school heads to take advantage of the extended period to capture details of all their students. The UPIs will replace admission numbers and will be used to track learners’ progress at all levels of education. Traditionally, students are issued with different index numbers as they progress from one level to the other. Nemis is an online portal developed by the ministry for collection of real-time and accurate data on schools and learners. It is meant to ease the management of schools in terms of distribution of text books, allocation of free education funds and deployment of teachers. Click here for the latest political news
