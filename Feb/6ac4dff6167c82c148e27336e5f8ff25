The seventh season of Nairobi D Reunion was notable for the absentees. The cast members present were asked why their friends were not present, but no one had an answer. When Noti Flow's name came up, Molly and Pendo said it was wise she did not come because she was up for a serious beating. She had an interview on K24 where she opened up, saying she did not attend the reunion because she actually quit Nairobi D for reasons that would best serve the growth of her career in the rap game. She now wants to grow a brand that does not make her seem like a slay queen or a ratchet girl who just wants fame, but rather a brand that is working on a serious career.
