Hundreds of people turned up to view Ken Wafula's body in Eldoret where he practiced human rights activism for about 20 years. The body was taken from the morgue at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital morgue to his home at Kapsoya estate on Thursday. It was also taken to his parents home at Soy in Likuyani constituency ahead of the burial on Friday. Wafula was director of the Center for Human Rights and Democracy in Eldoret until his death on January 16. He died of diabetes due to very high sugar levels and also had blood infections and kidney-related problems. But Wafula's death was reported as sudden because it occurred less than 24 hours after he was admitted at St Luke's hospital. Pathologists collected samples from his body for further tests amid investigations by police. Led by Dr Benson Macharia, the pathologists said police had to be involved because they are required to handle the samples taken to government chemists in Nairobi for toxicological tests. Officers also took photographs of the body during the examination at the hospital on Monday. "Such samples are usually handled by police who will open a file on the matter and forward it to government chemists," said Macharia.

The activist denied the allegations, saying he only participated in the protection of some of the witnesses through the CHRD. He was also involved in the fight for land rights and against female genital mutilation in the Rift Valley region. Wafula's colleagues, led by NIck Omito, have eulogised him as a human rights hero.
