Police are investigating assault claims by Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi's wife. Doreen Gatwiri, in her report at Hardy police station, accused her husband of battering her at their Karen home. She said on her Facebook page that she had to seek treatment at Avenue Hospital for injuries at the back of her head. "Guys my life is in danger...my husband Mulyungi assaulted me at our Karen Home over domestic quarrel," she said. "This resulted to my left ear going numb and serious headache and my right knee," she said. Gatwiri said she managed to report the matter to the police in fear for her life. "...he always threatened me that I really donâ€™t know who he is...this assault is not the first or second time," she said. The MP's wife said she kept quiet all this while to protect her home and his anger condition. "Enough is enough. His anger issue is always getting out of hand making me a target," she said. Gatwiri said before she was assaulted, Mulyungi beat their house girl at their Mwingi home. "He also slapped our chef - one old Kangangi, who took the matter to the police," she said. An officer privy to the case told the Star that they had opened investigations but noted they were waiting for Doreen to return her P3 form for action. "She reported the matter on Monday and was supposed to leave the hospital and come back to the station with her forms. We are waiting for to kick of the procedures," the officer said. The MP did not answer calls and text messages when sought for comment. Click here for the latest political news
