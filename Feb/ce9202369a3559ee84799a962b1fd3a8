Residents of Ng'enda ward, Gatundu South have called on the government to deal with cases of rampant cattle theft in the area. The lot, during a meeting on Sunday, said the situation has left some farmers totally impoverished. The villagers have formed vigilante groups which they will use to protect themselves and their livestock. They accused the local security officers of failing in their duties despite various pleas. Kimunyu location chief John Mutheki on Thursday last week held a baraza on the matter. This was after a farmer lost a heifer. Two other theft attempts were thwarted by members of the public in a span of two days. Gatundu county commissioner Stephen Kihara said his office does not have the exact number of livestock that have been stolen so far. "I have directed police to furnish the county security committee with the figures," he said. Click here for the latest political news
