The Nyeri county government will improve knowledge and experience sharing among cooperatives to improve trust in the industry. Governor Mutahi Kahiga has directed cooperatives to beef up sacco audits to improve transparency. “My government is committed to sustain the sector as a key economic driver to support growth in an improved environment,” he said. The move will harmonise governance of cooperatives since some are well run while others face challenges. The governor said saccos are essential to the county’s economic growth and progress. Kahiga attended the Newfortis Sacco AGM at Nyamachaki Primary School grounds in Nyeri town. The county has more than 120 active cooperatives with an estimated membership of about 300,000. Almost 40 per cent of the county’s population is enrolled in a sacco. The savings mobilised annually range between Sh6 billion and Sh8 billion. More than 50 per cent of the earnings are channeled through the saccos. Kahiga urged saacos to fight corruption, saying it is the only way to make saccos attract more members.
