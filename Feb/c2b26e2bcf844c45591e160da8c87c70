Samsung has launched the S9 and S9+ models which come with personalised augmented reality emojis. Users will be able to create 3D emojis that look, sound and act like them. The feature uses data-based algorithms to create characters that imitate expressions. The devices also have wireless charging. The smart phones have redesigned features of a new dual aperture lens that powers a low light camera to give high quality imagines and unique stories. They have also included super slow-mo video capabilities that enable automatic recording of a video from detection of movement in the frame. President and head of IT and mobile communications DJ Koh said, “Galaxy S9 and S9+ will enable consumers to shoot the best photos and videos anywhere. They are designed to help them connect to others and express themselves in a way that’s unique and personal to them.” The Galaxy S9 and S9+ come with an optical sensor to provide information on user’s health status and keep users’ heart load factor, a new measurement of the real-time demand placed on your heart. Following the global launch, pre-orders in Kenya for Galaxy S9 and S9+ will start from March 2 and end on March 22 and be available from March 23 in select markets.
