The Public Procurement Review and Administrative Board wants the court to dismiss a case filed by CBK. The PPRAB revoked the decision to award De La Rue printing of the new Kenyan currency. CBK wants this decision revoked. The board has defended its January 6 decision which annulled the CBK award of the tender to De La Rue. The review board says the tender document had no provision for a joint bid which means the successful bidder ought to have been considered on its own. The board further claims it revoked the tender upon finding that De La Rue International Ltd had admitted its intention to subcontract the tender, if successful, to an affiliate. “The board found that a successful bidder could not subcontract before getting a contract in the first place,” PPRAB said. The board says the printing firm failed to demonstrate the new currency will be manufactured through articles, materials and supplies that are produced and assembled in Kenya. CBK had been directed to reevaluate all tenders submitted by four companies within 14 days. De La Rue’s tender was revoked after Swedish firm Crane AB requested for a review from the board, alleging it was unlawful. Central Bank has said the move by PPRAB was wrong, accusing it of acting irrationally. Last year, activist Okiya Omtatah sued CBK, saying the current bank notes violate the law, which prohibits the use of individual’s images on the notes. De La Rue and Crane AB are among four firms who applied to CBK to be awarded the tender of printing the new design currencies. Early this year, Justice George Odunga issued temporary orders suspending the PPRAB decision to annul the awarding of the tender to De La Rue. The case will be heard on January 21.
