A Kuria woman whose hand was chopped off by her violent husband has refused to leave hospital for fear of more attacks by her in-laws. Maria Rioba lost her left hand but surgeons at St Joseph Mission Hospital, Migori town, saved the right one. Her husband Musa Matiko Gisiri from Tarang’anya village assaulted her the night of January 18, and fled towards Tanzania. Gisiri, who occasionally visits his home, has not been arrested, despite the mother of nine reporting the attack at Kehancha police station. “I can’t go back to my matrimonial home as my husband and in-laws have threatened to kill me for reporting the matter to the police,” Rioba said. She spoke to the Star at the hospital on Thursday. She said her in-laws, who accuse her of victimising their son, have taken away all her household items from her house. “My children have also run away from our home. I need them to be safe with me, but in a different place,” Rioba said. She urged rights activists to help her get justice. “I need to have him answer before a court why he chose to make me disabled,” Rioba said. Her daughter Elizabeth Ghati said her mother was the sole breadwinner.
