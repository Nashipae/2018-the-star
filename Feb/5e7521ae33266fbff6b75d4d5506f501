The police officer accused of maliciously killing a man in Githurai five years ago, has been found guilty. High Court Judge James Wakiaga yesterday said it had been proven beyond reasonable doubt that Titus Musila intentionally killed Kenneth Mwangi. Musila, a famous crime buster in Githurai, shot to limelight after hundred of residents took to the streets to protest his arrest. Wakiaga said Musila shot the deceased three times at close range, leading to his death. "After evaluating evidence laid before the court, I find that the accused had malice to murder the deceased," Wakiaga said. Musila was arrested after Mwangi’s family lodged a complaint with the Independent Police Oversight Authority, accusing him of extrajudicial killing. Wakiaga said the former policeman ought to have handcuffed Mwangi and taken him into custody instead of shooting him in the head. A postmortem report showed that Mwangi died from gunshot wounds on his head. Wakiaga dismissed claims that Musila was loved by residents for fighting crime, saying justice does not recognise popularity. He recommended Ipoa, saying their evidence prevented attempts to cover up the case. Wakiaga said an officer who testified in the case confirmed that three cartridges were spent. "I therefore find the accused guilty of the charge and convict him accordingly," Wakiaga said. Wakiaga directed a probation officer to hand in a report before February 27, when Musila will be sentenced. Musila asked the court to acquit him, saying he did nothing wrong. He defend his action saying, he gunned down Mwangi after the deceased snatched a phone from a woman. Musila said he was posted to Githurai at a time when "shoes were being sold while still on the owners’ feet". He had been in the area for 10 years when the murder occurred. Musila said he belonged to ‘SPIV’, a special squad that had been formed to fight crime in Githurai following complaints from residents.
