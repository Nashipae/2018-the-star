Murang’a Governor Mwangi wa Iria (pictured) yesterday supported the government’s crackdown on NASA leaders linked to Raila Odinga’s swearing- in as the People’s President. He said the Jubilee administration has played a cat-and-mouse game with NASA for so long that it was time the government asserted its authority. Wa Iria said the protests organised by NASA have caused the economy to slump for six months — “with little being accomplished in terms of development”. NASA must not be allowed to continue causing confusion among Kenyans, who only want to conduct business peacefully, the county chief said. He welcomed the deportation of NRM ‘General’ Miguna Miguna to Canada. Miguna says the expulsion was illegal.
