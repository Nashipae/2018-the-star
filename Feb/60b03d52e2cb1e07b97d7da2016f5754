Diamond Platnumz's sister Esma Dangote, alias Esma Platnumz, has broken her silence on her brother's failed relationship. Esma, who has previously hit the headlines for being a frenemy to Zarina Hassan, said she doesn't believe her brother and his baby mama have called it quits. Talking to Millard Ayo, the businesswoman said her brother hasn't informed her of the break-up. "Haiwezekani, mimi sijui kama wameachana, mimi nachojua ni kwamba wako pamoja....Hamna tatizo, hamna kitu ambacho kinachoendelea," she said. Esma added that her mum is yet to be officially informed of their break-up.
