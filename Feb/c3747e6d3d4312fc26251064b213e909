Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has given a three-day ultimatum to Mwingi East assistant county commissioner James Wanyoike over allegations of abetting charcoal burning. “Trust me, I’m giving Wanyoike three days to vacate the area, failing which, I will take him to court. And I am going to tell the Kitui county commissioner to transfer him since the residents are fed up of him. Let those who spot him tell him that I, Charity Ngilu, have said that he should go,” she said. Ngilu spoke on Thursday in Nuu during her anti-charcoal campaign across the county. He warned any officer tolerating charcoal burning will be taken to court. She said the time for extortion is over and the booming charcoal trade is not helpful. She ordered youths to attack any lorry they spot ferrying charcoal. Ngilu called upon the youth to help her initiative to ban charcoal completely. Click here for the latest political news
