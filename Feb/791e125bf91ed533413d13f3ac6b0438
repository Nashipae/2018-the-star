The government has recruited police reservists to boost fight against terrorists who have wreaked havoc in parts of northeastern and along Kenya Somalia border. The Star has established that armed locals who are mainly drawn from former police officers, have been deployed to guard key government installations, schools and social amenities along the border. Northeastern regional commissioner Mohamud Saleh confirmed that the deployment was to act as a reinforcement to other security agencies to tackle the menace that has so far claimed hundreds of lives in the region. The regional boss said it also covers areas near Boni Forest where al Shabab militants are believed to be hiding. "The recruitment has taken place in Wajir, Mandera and Garissa counties,” Saleh told the Star on phone yesterday. Area leaders and residents have in the past called on the government to recruit and deploy locals as National Police Reservists in affected areas. The leaders argued that locals are the only people who can engage and fight the militia since they have vast knowledge of the terrain and hideouts. â€‹A spot check by the Star in Ijara where deployment has been effected revealed the officials who are armed with AK47 rifles were manning schools and communication mast. Queries have however emerged over the capacity of the armed reservists to fight the terror group and their training level. â€‹Suspected al Shabab militants have in the recent past targeted security officials by planting Improvised Explosive Devices on roads. They burnt down Ijara Police Station and Safaricom mast last year December, cutting off communication in the area. The latest incidents being two teachers and a wife to one of them being killed in Wajir county. Click here for the latest political news
