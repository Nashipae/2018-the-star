A Meru gospel artiste who lost his right limb in an accident in 2013 wants to do a collabo with Solomon Mkubwa as he embarks on his music career. Mwiti J says he feels greatly inspired by Mkubwa, who also lost his limb. “When I first heard his music and bough it, I was normal, but I am now in a situation like his. I like his passion and enthusiasm,” he said. Mwiti J, who sings in Kiswahili and Kimeru, says he started music as a child but recorded his first song in 2014. “My first song was called Tunakuabudu in my debut album, which was received well by my fans in Meru. I have now recorded another album called Nkatho that has Kimeru and Swahili songs,” Mwiti said. He records his music at Inuka Studio in Meru. “It is challenging to be an upcoming artiste. You have to hustle for money to record, and it's also hectic to get airplay and be known,” he said. Mwiti said he has recorded songs with Dan M, a gospel artiste who has now turned international, as he does most of his career and concerts outside the country. He added that in future, he would aspire to work with Still Alive studios and Jacky B. Mwiti was travelling to Wajir when he was involved in an accident in Garissa. “It has not been easy, but I have accepted the situation and moved on, and I'm coping with it. I urge those in similar situations to accept and trust in God,” he said. The artiste says despite that, he still goes ahead with his chores and his music career.
