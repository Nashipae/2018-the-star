Parents have been advised to collect their children's birth certificate at the Registration of Persons offices three
months after their kids are born. Kenya National Parents Association Lari branch chairman Samuel
Wanjema yesterday said when children are born, hospitals issue parents with
birth notifications, which they are required to use to register for
certificates. But most parest, Wanjema said, keep the notification slips
at home and forget about registering their children. He said most parents only rush to register their children when the document is required by schools and other government institutions. Wanjema spoke in Limuru town where there were long
lines at the Registration of Personâ€™s offices.
