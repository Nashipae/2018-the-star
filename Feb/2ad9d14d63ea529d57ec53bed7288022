The High court has ordered the government to reinstate Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o and DG Mathews Owili's security detail. Justice Tripsisa Cherere grated the duo's prayer pending the hearing and determination of their case. They have sued the Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet, Interior CS Fred Matiangâ€™i and the Attorney General Githu Muigai. The county bosses filed the application through their lawyer Ibrahim Stanley after their four security officers were withdrawn on January 31. The orders were issued as the parties wait the mentioning of the case on February 28. Justice Cherere further ordered that the two file an application to be joined in a similar case filed by Homa Bay Town MP Opondo Kaluma. The legislators' case, which is pending in Nairobi, is involving a number of opposition leaders and is due for hearing on February 19. "The two are at liberty to be joined in the other case in Nairobi. This will also prevent any conflicting decisions which could embarrass the judiciary in the end," Cherere added.
