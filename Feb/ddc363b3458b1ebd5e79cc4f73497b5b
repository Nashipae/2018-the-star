Traders in Bungoma have decried rising insecurity in the region. Speaking to the press in Webuye town yesterday, Bungoma Chamber of Commerce and Industry chairman Herman Kasili asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to beef up security. Most traders in Mt Elgon and other parts of the county are living in fear of rampant attacks, the pastor said. “We are wondering why we have increased insecurity yet no one has been arrested,’ he said. Kasili asked the Bungoma county commissioner’s office to ensure police officers who have served for long in one station are transferred. He said prominent businessmen have been killed in Mt Elgon and their property stolen. Kasili said he was shocked last Sunday when thugs attacked his church in Webuye and stole equipment.
