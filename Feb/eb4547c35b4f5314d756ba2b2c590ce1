Human rights group Muhuri wants the state to pay it Sh2.1 million as compensation for branding it a terrorist organisation. It wants the Attorney General, the office of the IG, the Central Bank of Kenya and the Financial Reporting Centre to compensate it for defamation and freezing of its accounts in 2015. Mombasa High Court Judge Njoki Mwangi yesterday adjourned the hearing to March 3 because the IG and AG are yet to respond to the suit. In April 2015, the office of the IG in a Gazette notice listed Muhuri among organisations suspected to have terror links. It accused the lobby group of funding terror activities, leading to the freezing of the NGO’s accounts. Muhuri’s lawyer Achieng Orero told the court the move damaged its reputation. The lobby said it was cast in bad light in the eyes of the public.. Image tainted Muhuri director Khelef Khalifa, who is also a plaintiff, accused state agencies of defaming him. He said he suffered loss and damages to his reputation as a human rights defender, Khalifa said his image was tainted since he was made to look like someone who supports criminal activities, and funds terrorists. Orero said the allegations caused Muhuri officials to suffer disrepute, and the organisation could not carry out its functions. She said the temporary closure of the organisation’s accounts infringed on their rights to property as protected under the law. Orero said that was aimed at punishing Muhuri. She said state agencies acted negligently by publishing Muhuri’s name in the Gazette notice.
