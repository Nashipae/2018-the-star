The Siaya county assembly has invited the auditor general and the EACC to investigate corruption in the county government. The MCAs, including West Asembo’s Ambrose Akuno, said some of the projects budgeted for since 2013 either stalled or do not exist. Akuno on Tuesday said the projects that are complete have all been over-quoted, as compared to other counties. “Look at the prefabricated building at the county headquarters that cost Sh21.6 million and compare it with the new Alego-Usonga constituency permanent offices that cost almost the same amount,” he said. He was addressing the press at the assembly premises. Akuno added that Sh64.8 million of Sh100 million for the construction of county headquarters has already been spent, and yet there is no construction going on or commenced. This comes six months after Governor Cornel Rasanga was sworn into office for his second term. During his swearing-in ceremony, the governor warned all lazy and corrupt county workers that their days are numbered.
