Kenya Police moved to the top of the log in the Football Kenya Football (FKF) National Super League after a narrow 3-2 win over Modern Coast Rangers on Sunday at Karuturi grounds in Naivasha. The law enforcers have seven points from three matches including a walkover over Muhoroni Youth and a draw against Talanta FC. Western Stima beat Isibania FC 1-0 in a hard fought match at Sony Green Stadium in Awendo to remain second on seven points but with an inferior goal difference. Junior Mukisa headed home the lone goal in the second half of the game. “Hard luck. We live to fight another day,” said Isibania coach Dan Musta. Isibania dropped to the fifth place on the log. Kibera Black Stars climbed to the third position on the log with seven points after a 1-0 win over troubled Nakuru All Stars. The former Kenya Premier League side is yet to win a game so far. “I am happy that my boys kept focus until the final whistle. Our opponents were quite defensive but I’m glad we found a way past them,” an elated Black Stars coach, Godfrey Oduor told FKF’s official website. Simon Abuko scored the lone goal as KCB returned to winning ways, beating former KPL side Ushuru 1-0 at Camp Toyoyo. It was Ushuru’s first loss of the season. Kangemi All Stars recorded their second win in a row after beating struggling Administration Police 2-0. Nairobi City Stars were handed a walkover after Muhoroni Youth failed to show up for their third consecutive NSL encounter. Muhoroni now faces relegation to the third tier Division One League. On Saturday, Kisumu All Stars recorded their debut win in the league edging GFE 105 2-1 while Talanta handed Kakamega High School’s Green Commandos their first defeat winning 3-1 at Bukhungu Stadium.
