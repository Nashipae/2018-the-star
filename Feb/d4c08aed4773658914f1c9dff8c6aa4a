Saboti MP Caleb Amisi has committed to prioritise the upgrade of education standards in his constituency to ensure all needy students have an equal opportunity to achieve their academic goals. Amisi said he seeks to achieve this by ensuring there is adequate funding towards infrastructural development and fees for needy learners across all primary and secondary schools in the region. “I will ensure all schools are upgraded to required levels and offer financial aid to bright needy students,” Amisi told journalists in Kitale on Monday. Last week, the MP commissioned a Sh1 million tuition block at Chetoto Primary School. He said the CDF kitty will meet the secondary school education for 10 students who excelled in KCPE at the school. “I know what it means to lack funds when you are a student since I went through a similar experience during my school days. It’s my wish to ensure our students don’t experience similar scenarios,” he said. The MP said the Ministry of Education should consider input from all stakeholders when coming up with reforms. Matisi MCA Obed Mwale committed to support initiatives by several stakeholders in the region to upgrade the levels of education noting that quality education will be key to transforming the region. “We are grateful that our schools have shown a commitment to excel even with limited resources. We shall join hands to ensure they receive a boost for effective performance,” said Mwale.
