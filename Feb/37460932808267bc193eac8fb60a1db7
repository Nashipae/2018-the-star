The government and the Opposition have been urged by the Catholic Church to be guided by the Constitution in all activities. Nyeri Archbishop Anthony Muheria said the government should address issues constitutionally, including shutting down the media. Three TV stations were shut down over fears they would air the swearing-in of NASA leader Raila Odinga live on Tuesday last week at Uhuru Park. Two of the stations — NTV and KTN News — are back on air. Citizen TV, however, is still off. Muheria visited Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga in his office in Nyeri town on Wednesday. “We must not go backwards. We must communicate what we want but still respect citizens’ rights and freedoms,” Muheria said. “Whatever the Opposition leaders feel they must act upon should also be in line with the Constitution.” Both parties will be doing a disservice to the country if they violate the law. He urged the government and the Opposition to ensure people’s rights are not infringed upon. The decision by the government to withdraw the passports of a number of citizens has been termed a violation of the law and the Constitution. The Constitution specifically says every citizen has a right to a passport and other documents of identification. If that is a constitutional right, then it is not something that can be taken away at will. The second thing that the Constitution says is that every citizen has a right to freedom of movement, to leave and enter Kenya anytime they wish to do that. Kahiga said the government and the Opposition leaders should have a dialogue. Mutahi criticised the Opposition, saying Kenya is bigger than an individual or two who want to violate the law. “We walk around with pride,saying we fought for the new Constitution, yet we are walking away from what it dictates. That is hypocrisy,” the governor said.
