Matungu ODM supporters have scolded three NASA co-principals for skipping Raila Odinga’s swearing-in as the People’s President. During the oath taking on Tuesday, only Raila showed up at Uhuru Park. Co-principals Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper Party), Moses Wetang’ula (Ford Kenya) and Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) have since alleged that they were held back from accessing Uhuru Park by the police. Matungu ODM chairman John Ouma said it is importance for the coalition to remain united, but betrayal will not be entertained. “The other three co-principals are betrayers who have been lying to baba while they have been secretly going to State House. “We must get rid of anyone in the coalition trying to derail our efforts to achieve electoral justice,” he said. The ODM members meet on Thursday to thank Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya for nominating four people from the area in his new cabinet.
