Kwale leaders yesterday accused Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja of derailing efforts to amicably solve a long-standing boundary dispute between the two counties. The two neighbouring counties are fighting over the Miasenyi boundary. According to colonial and post-Independence maps, the boundary between the two is at Miasenyi. But the Taita Taveta administration says the boundary should pass in the middle of Mackinnon Road trading centre, at Mbele Primary School, near the Mackinnon Road Kenya Wildlife Camp. Mvurya, Senator Issa Juma Boy and Kinango MP Benjamin Tayari said they are committed to finding a lasting solution to avoid inciting and dividing border communities further. The leaders spoke at a joint press briefing at Mvurya's office. They said they were deeply concerned by media reports that officials from Taita Taveta on Monday mobilised residents to attend a public participation meeting on Tuesday. It was to take place at Mbele Primary School, Kwale. Mvurya accused Samboja of taking legal matters in his own hands instead of waiting for the guidance of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. In 2015, Mvurya and former Taita Taveta Governor John Mruttu formed a committee to tackle the issue but until to date, no amicable solution has been found. Mvurya faulted Samboja for saying he will not allow an inch of Taita Taveta land to be taken away by Kwale. Samboja allegedly made the statement during Mashujaa Day celebrations last December 12. Mvurya said such statements are uncalled for and threaten the peace and security of border communities. "Boundaries have existed over the years and border communities have lived peacefully with their neighbours so let's not incite our people to violence. Remember we are leaders," he said. Senator Boy said the dispute should not come between the two counties. "People from the Coast have for many years lived peacefully. Let's maintain the same spirit," he said.
