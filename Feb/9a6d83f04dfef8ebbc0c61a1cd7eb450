More than 300 youths from Nyandarua Central yesterday turned up at Ol Kalou Stadium for KDF recruitment. Officer in charge of recruitment Lt Col E. O.Â Onyango said the turnout is encouraging and shows young men and women are willing to join the Kenya Defence Forces. He said there were no major challenges during the drive, but a number of youths who turned up were too old. The maximum age is 26. Others who turned up did not meet the requisite academic qualifications, with most of them having scored D-(minus) and below in the KCSE exam.
