Gospel decks-master DJ Mo has been busy nurturing raw talents through his System Unit Academy, and he's looking forward to expanding it. Just like any other institutions, DJ Mo's academy has its rules and regulations. He says, "Deejaying is like learning how to drive. We give someone skills then when they finish the course, everyone decides what to do afterward. For two months, we charge Sh30,000, while for four months, school fees is Sh50,000." On Sunday, DJ Mo did not appear on Crossover show as usual, and Grace Ekirapa hosted the show alongside guest DJ Tabz. This left many speculating that he had been suspended or fired by Nation Media Group, but he has rubbished the claims, saying he was committed elsewhere.
