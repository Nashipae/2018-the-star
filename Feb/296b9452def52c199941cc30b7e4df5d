Prison services require at least Sh2.4 billion annually to cater for those held in remand cells. Congestion in the cells leads to a number of problems, including financial constraints, ill health, limited facilities and depleted resources. A preliminary report by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions says those held in remand spend an average of 12 months in custody as they await trial. Nairobi prisons commander Wanini Kireri yesterday said the daily cost of sustaining one remandee is about Sh240. Prisons statistics place the number of remandees in Nairobi at about 3,500 — an overload from its 1,200 capacity. There are about 27,000 remandees countrywide. The government spends about Sh6.4 million daily on them. “This money is from the Exchequer and we are not allowed to use the remandees for any purpose, or even teach them skills to help them, thus wasting a lot of resources on an issue that can be solved,” Kireri said. Because of congestion, the Office of the DPP will, in the next one week and in a pilot exercise, review 237 cases of remandees charged with petty offences. The offences include creating a disturbance and violation of traffic rules. In an arrangement with the Judiciary, the ODPP will constitute a court at the Nairobi remand prison in the Industrial Area to solve the cases. Public Prosecutions secretary Dorcas Oduor yesterday said the programme is part of a plan to fix loopholes.
