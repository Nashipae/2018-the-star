The Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Kitale has criticised the Teachers Service Commission for transferring without consulting stakeholders. “Education is not to be decided by the people of Nairobi. The people down here must have a say,” Maurice Crowley has said. Crowley is the caretaker Bishop for the Catholic Diocese in Eldoret following the death of Bishop Cornelius Korir on October 30 lasty ear. He said the recent transfer of secondary school heads was inhuman. The cleric said the massive transfer of head teachers by the TSC in December last year was conducted hurriedly and that the teachers were not given adequate time to move to their new stations. “I would ask the TSC to remember that these people are human beings and they must be treated in a humane way. If not, they will not deliver and the quality of education will be compromised,” Crowley said. He added that some head teachers were given two days to move to their new stations. The bishop spoke at a thanksgiving ceremony at Sing’ore Girls High School on Friday. He said the transfers were communicated during the Christmas holidays when head teachers were spending time with their families. “Giving teachers transfer letters during Christmas, and further giving them two or three days to leave their stations is unhuman,” he said. Crowley accused the TSC of transferring head teachers in Catholic-sponsored schools from Eldoret and Kitale without consulting the church. “They took away the best. I am not against the policy of transferring teachers, but it should be done in a different way,” he said. Click here for the latest political stories
