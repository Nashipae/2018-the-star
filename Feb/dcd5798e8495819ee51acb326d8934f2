The High court on Tuesday validated the declaration of Josphat Nanok as the winner of the Turkana governor election in August last year. Judge Stephen Riechi of Lodwar law court held that the petition filed Petroleum CS John Munyes lacked sufficient evidence to warrant nullification of Nanok's win. Munyes said the elections in Turkana were shambolic and characterised by violence, voter bribery, corruption, use of force, and intimidation. The former Senator further accused the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) of supporting his rival to win the election. "The elections in the county started a day after the official date, materials arrived at a polling station in the afternoon and people were allowed to vote a day later." Munyes claimed he lost many votes from his people who were denied their democratic right to elect him as the leader. But Riechi held that the August 2017 election was held in accordance with the Constitution. "The election were free and fair. The case lacked sufficient evidence to challenge the re-election of Nanok," he said. The judge directed that the petitioner to pay S4.5 million in costs. After the ruling, Nanok said he has a lot of development tasks to deliver to his people. "We will prioritise our activities towards dealing with the issue of water shortage and hunger," the governor said. Click here for the latest political news
