Thousands of acres of indigenous South Nandi forest face a serious threat as timber loggers continued to operate despite a government 90-day ban. The loggers are targeting rare tree species for timber and charcoal burning. The alarming state of Kimondi and Kobujoi forest poses a big threat to the future of Rivers Yala and Nyando whose sources are within the area. It is because of this that the county government decided to suspend all Community Forest Associations, and called on KFS to do the same. Environment executive Jacob Tanui on Wednesday accused CFA of turning into a cartel and forests under the cover of conservation. He toured the southern part of Kimondi forest and found loggers deep inside the forest illegally harvesting traditional trees. Trees targeted by loggers include the rear Prunes Africana which take 300 years to mature, Elgon-Teak, Nandi flame, Crotons and several traditional species that are rich in medicinal values. The loggers have alse cleared hundreds of acres of immature cypress plantation in the area that was expected to be harvested in 2022. Governor Stephen Sang during last year's Jamhuri celebrations accused KWS officers of colluding with loggers to destroy forests.
