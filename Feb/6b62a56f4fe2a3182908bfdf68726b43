 The East African  Legislative Assembly will create market centres across the border towns of Busia and Malaba to boost Kenya-Uganda trade. The proposal was reached on Saturday during a meeting between 18 EALA members and stakeholders from Malaba Kenya and Uganda at the Kenya Customs offices. EALA team leader for the Northern Corridor Mathias Kasamba said the centres will create jobs. “Goods from Uganda are brought to the border post. Kenyans are free to come and buy the commodities. Equally, Ugandans can cross to the Kenyan side. Commodities that are cheaper on the Kenyan side can be accessed by Ugandans and vice versa,” he said.
