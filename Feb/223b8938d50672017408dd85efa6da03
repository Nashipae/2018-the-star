Kisii Senator Sam Ongeri yesterday said he will embark on discharging his mandate after the court dismissed an election petition challenging his win. Ongeri said the petition, which was dismissed by the High Court on Monday, has been giving him sleepless nights. Voters Charles Orito and George Ogake filed the petition against Ongeri on grounds the election was not free, fair and transparent. Speaking to the press after Justice Winfridah Okwany dismissed the petition, Ongeri assured residents he will represent them well in the Senate, especially in raising issues that affect them. He said the judgment shows the Judiciary is not biased. The senator said he will work closely with Governor James Ongwae’s administration to improve residents’ lives. Ongeri said time for politics is long-gone and those interested in running for political offices should wait for 2022. The senator was announced winner in the August election after garnering 183,375 votes. His closest rival, former South Mugirango MP Omingo Magara, got 118,688 votes. Governor Ongwae and Deputy Governor Joash Maangi said they were happy with Justice Okwany’s ruling. Ongeri expressed optimism that a similar petition challenging the victory of Ongwae will be dismissed.
