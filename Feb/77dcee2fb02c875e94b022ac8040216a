The Public Service Commission will not employ expatriates unless no Kenyan can meet the needs of a public agency. Even then, appointees will only serve on contract and will not be eligible for promotion. According to the draft PSC Regulations 2018, the approval of the commission will be required before any public agency considers foreigners for any position. The regulations will replace the current PSC Regulations 2005 and give effect to the Public Service Commission Act, 2017. “A request for authority to recruit non-citizens shall be made by an authorised officer and be accompanied by confirmation that no citizen with the required qualification is available for appointment,” the draft regulations 2018 reads. The regulations further state those appointed on contract will serve for no more than three years, which will only be renewed once. Upon expiry of the contract, officers will be required to report to the commission. They will be required to seek renewal at least six months before the expiry of the contract. PSC chief counsel Jacqueline Manani said, “Contracts will only be renewed if the workload justifies further engagement, the performance of the public officer is justifiable, the public officer has expressed a desire to serve on a contract basis.” She said the aim is to ensure the public sector employs Kenyans. “Kenyans will always have first priority in the public sector,” Manani said.
