Tana River Governor Dhadho Godhana on Friday said the county has many potential entrepreneurs but lacks the platform to exploit their skills. He said 10 business centres will be set up along highways to create jobs and attract investors. The county is currently ranked the poorest, with an index of 76.9 per cent.
