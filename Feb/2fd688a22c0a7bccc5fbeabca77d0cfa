The Kiambaa subcounty security team has urged residents to provide information that would lead to the arrest of a gang that rapes and kills victims. The gang has more than six members who, police say, have so far killed six people and injured 20. They have escaped police raids and crackdowns. In the last four months, the gang has attacked residents in more than 50 incidents. The latest attack took place on Saturday. The gang attacked two women headed home from church, raping them and killing one. The woman who survived is admitted at Kiambu Level 5 Hospital. She had deep cuts on her head and the rest of her body. Kiambaa deputy county commissioner Peter Gicheha on Wednesday met security agents, including the police, assistant county commissioners, chiefs and assistant chiefs. No arrests have been made, but Gicheha said police are investigating. “We have enhanced security patrols in Kiambaa. We ask residents to volunteer information about gangs and stop accusing police of inaction. We are doing our best but we need the residents’ support,” Gicheha said. Earlier on, he said residents are spreading fake information and malicious information against the police, frustrating the investigation. Some residents accused the police of colluding with the gang. “There are several WhatsApp groups formed and police officers are members. We see what the malicious information is doing to the probe,” he said. MP Paul Koinange, who is also the chairman of the parliamentary Committee on Security, said residents should work with the security team and provide useful information. Kiambaa police chief Wilberforce Sicharani said crime has escalated and that several arrests have been made, though the gang members are still at large.
