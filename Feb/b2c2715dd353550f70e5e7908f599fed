The Mass and all burial functions of the late former Vice President Wamalwa Kijana’s widow Yvonne will be held at her home in Milimani, Kitale, not at the showground, the family has said. There has been speculation the Mass would be celebrated at the Kitale Showground , just like the funeral for the ex-VP. “There is enough space in the compound where she will be buried. Mourners will start arriving at 9am,” burial committee vice chairman John Makete told the Star. After visiting the family on Thursday Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba said there should be no political battles among leaders. “The family has asked me to inform leaders they don’t want politics during their sister’s burial. The function should be used to bring people together,” Khaemba said. The late Wamalwa, until his death, was the the Ford Kenya boss. His brother Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa formed New Ford Kenya, but later dissolved it to join Jubilee. Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula, who took over Ford Kenya from Musikari Kombo, is expected to appeal to residents to remain in the party, because the former VP belonged there. On Thursday, mourners eulogised Yvonne as hardworking, focused and intelligent.
