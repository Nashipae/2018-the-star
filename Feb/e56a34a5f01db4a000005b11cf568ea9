Businessman Benson Thuranira, the man who is persistently looking for justice after accusing Bahati of obtaining money from him under fraudulent means, is yet to get any recourse. Benson reported that "he had been defrauded off Sh200,000 by Kevin Bahati Kioko under false pretences that he would get a premises under which they would both operate a business". He previously complained of being frustrated. In the latest development, Benson's lawyers have written to the DPP's office, asking them to give an update on the case at Karuri police station. The letter, which was received by the DPP's office on February 5, read in part, "Kindly but urgently, let us know the position with regards to this file, as our clients feels neglected."
