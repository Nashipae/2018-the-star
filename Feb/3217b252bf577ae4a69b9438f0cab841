Self-confessed al Shabaab member Elgiva Bwire, who in 2011 threw two grenades at a bus station on Racecourse Road, Nairobi, has escaped serving a life sentence. This was after a successful appeal. Bwire will now serve 15 years. On October 28, 2011, he shocked the country after he pleaded guilty to nine charges, including being a member of al Shabaab. He told a magistrate court, “Yes it is true. I maintain a plea of guilty and the facts are correct.” This was after he was repeatedly asked to respond to the charge of being a member of the terror group. Bwire also admitted to the charges of being in possession of illegal firearms, including an AK-47 rifle, a submachine gun, two revolvers, 13 live hand grenades and 770 assorted bullets. The magistrate sentenced him to life for causing grievous harm to two people and 15 years for being a member of an outlawed group and engaging in criminal activities. He was also to serve a further seven years for being in possession of guns. He appealed against the sentencing. The High Court upheld the life sentence, but said he should serve the 15 years and seven years concurrently. Still not satisfied, he moved to the Court of Appeal, seeking to overturn his entire conviction. On Friday, judges Daniel Musinga, William Ouko and Gatembu Kairu upheld the 15-year jail term, but ruled that the prosecution failed to prove the count of causing grievous harm.
