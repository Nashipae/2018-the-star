Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said he will sue the state over the ownership of a controversial 200-acre land in Yatta. The NASA co-principal has built a precious retirement home on the property. The government says he grabbed the land from the National Youth Service. In a statement yesterday, Kalonzo dismissed the claims, saying he bought the land from from Petrako Company. “The land belonged to the defunct Machakos municipality and was later allocated to Petrako by Mwai Kibaki on the presidential decree," Kalonzo said. The former Vice President said NYS was also allocated their share by the former President. Kalonzo said he was ready to move to court to fight for the land. "The land has never been a property of NYS. Petrako sold it to me,” Kalonzo said. NYS has advertised orders for owners of specific parcels of the land to surrender them within 14 days. The order was made last week. Critics say the state's bid to repossess the land is a political witch-hunt against the Opposition politician. Last month, the Jubilee administration recalled Kalonzo's security moments after NASA leader Raila Odinga was sworn in. The High Court has since ordered the Inspector General of police to restore Kalonzo’s security. The order is yet to be honoured. Kalonzo says the witch-hunt has been on "for a while now." "This [land] is the only thing they are try to malign me with. They have been frustrated because they have failed to find any corrupt or shoddy deals to link me with," Kalonzo said. Yesterday, Kalonzo said he was strong enough to fight his political battles. He said state intimidation will not push him to recognise President Uhuru Kenyatta.
