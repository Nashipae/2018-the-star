Two Embu politicians have supported the state’s action against NASA leaders who participated in Raila Odinga’s swearing-in as the ‘People’s President’ on January 30. Speaking separately to the Star yesterday Jubilee Senator Njeru Ndwiga and Mbeere South MP Geoffrey Kingangi  said by arresting the NASA leaders, the state is doing its job of maintaining law and order. They said the security of the country was threatened by their dangerous and treasonable action. Ndwiga took a swipe at Judiciary, saying some of its rulings have been harmful to the country.
