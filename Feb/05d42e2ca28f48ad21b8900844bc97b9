A mob lynched two men accused of perpetrating cattle rustling in Kabondo Kasipul on Saturday. Residents accused the two of stealing cattle, motivated by low water levels in River Sondu that separates Homa Bay and Kericho Counties. Witnesses said they were spotted on a boda boda at Kodada village at about 9 am. "They were stopped and interrogated but the motorcycle rider escaped. The two men also wanted to escape by running, one said. “But some youths got hold of them and started stoning them. They pleaded with the locals not to kill them but their words fell on deaf ears." The mob also used crude weapons to kill the two before setting their bodies on fire. Wang’-chieng’ Chief Elisha Odiwuor said the victims were not identified immediately but that they were residents of Kericho. “It was suspected that they had been collaborating with locals to steal cattle. We’re discouraging locals from taking matters into their hands since they can cause the deaths of innocent people,” he said. Odiwuor regretted that cases of cattle rustling had been rampant. The administrator asked the people to report suspects to local security personnel. “We’re carrying out investigations. As security officers, we want people to be governed by the rule of law." The bodies were taken to Rachuonyo Sub-County Hospital Mortuary. Click here for the latest political news
