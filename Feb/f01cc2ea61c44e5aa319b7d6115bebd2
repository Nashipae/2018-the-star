The creation of the ANC disciplinary committee is meant to cover the shame of the party leader’s no-show at Raila Odinga’s swearing-in, embattled secretary general George Osotsi has said. ANC on Tuesday set up the nine-member committee to discipline rebel MPs it accuses of being used to destabilise the party and scuttle leader Musalia Mudavadi’s presidential run in 2022. But Osotsi said, “Those are empty threats. All they are now doing is trying to divert attention from the real issue, which is supporters are agitated by their decision to miss the swearing-in of Odinga on January 30.” Speaking to the Star, the nominated MP told Mudavadi to face the reality that he erred and has lost his popularity. Ososti said NASA supporters are not about to forget and have rejected all the fake explanations by NASA co-principals Moses Wetang’ula, Mudavadi and Kalonzo Musyoka. Osotsi and Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala are considered rebels within ANC ranks. Mudavadi chaired the party’s joint National Executive Council and Parliamentary Group meeting, where the committee, to be led by deputy party leader Kipruto Kirwa, was formed. The meeting was at party headquarters in Lavington, Nairobi. Ososti said the three NASA affiliate parties – Ford Kenya, ANC and Wiper – need to rebrand and bring in a young vibrant leadership. “For NASA to be redeemed, it needs to start from Square One, with new ideas, leadership, new markets and re-engineer itself,” he said. Ososti said Musalia cannot redeem himself. He urged the NASA parties to stop flip-flopping on issues and take a stand. Osotsi said they have to go back to the drawing board if they are to give Jubilee a run for its money.
