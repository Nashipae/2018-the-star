Comedian Njugush gave us an insight into the life of an expectant father.Â His wife, Celestine Ndinda, is heavily pregnant and could be welcoming their first child any day now. "I will name him after my father," Njugush said, "Opening an account for our child will not be one of our agendas because according to me, that is a personal decision they can make when they reach 18." So, will the new addition to the family also feature in his sketch videos that are so popular online? "I don't understand why we should do that. Wacha huyo tu akue private tumfiche, kwa sababu it's upto mtu ajue if they want to be involved in something."
