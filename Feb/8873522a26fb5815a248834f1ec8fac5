Nyeri leaders and the family of former freedom fighter, Dedan Kimathi, have renewed calls to the government to help trace his remains for a decent burial. Governor Mutahi Kahiga, Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu and speaker John Kaguchia demanded to know from the British government the grave Kimathi was buried in at Kamiti Maximum Prison. The leaders spoke on Sunday during the 61st anniversary of Dedan Kimathi’s execution at Kamukunji Stadium in Nyeri town. Wambugu said Kimathi was buried like a thief. The MP said he will table a motion in Parliament, which will ensure Kimathi’s remains are found, exhumed and buried in a decent manner. In 2016, Kimathi’s widow Eloise Kimathi and two of her children asked the state to trace the freedom fighter’s remains.. Eleven spots at Kamiti Prison were found to be potential graves where he may have been buried. Kimathi’s family said the identified spots could finally solve the puzzle of where the field marshal was buried after he was hanged. The British government, however, has remained mum on whereabout of Kimathi’s body. He was allegedly buried while in handcuffs. “The state should grant the family its wish. The British government should show us the grave,” Kahiga said. Over the years, the family has tried in vain to get the state to exhume the hero’s body for reburial. The government has been unable to locate Kimathi’s grave since the first serious attempts were started after Narc came to power in December 2003. Past efforts by people who claimed to know where the grave was bore no fruit. There is no record to show where the grave could be. Meanwhile, the leaders urged Mau Mau fighters to unite under one group so that they can benefit from the state. Kahiga said there are many groups claiming to be freedom fighters, but some have fake members. “I’m ready to help unite the group and secure an appointment with President Uhuru Kenyatta,” he said.
