Football Kenya Federation president Nick Mwendwa has denied claims that the immediate former Harambee Stars head coach Paul Put was pushed out. Mwenda further announced that they will unveil a new national team coach next week. The federation president said Put’s resignation had nothing to do with his demands for a fresh back room staff. The 61-year-old Belgian coach resigned on Monday, three months after signing a two-year deal with FKF and cited personal reasons, according to FKF. However, there has been increasing speculation that his demands to have the entire technical bench at Harambe Stars changed could have been the bone of contention for his exit. This was despite the FKF assuring him that they would yield to his demands. Reports also indicate that SportPesa’s move to withdraw sponsorship from football-related activities may have had something to do with the coach’s resignation. “SportPesa used to pay almost 70 per cent of his salary and when they withdrew due to the tax issues, the coach may have been affected. You know the country’s record when it comes to paying coaches,” said a source familiar with the on goings at FKF. However, speaking in Mombasa after inspecting the new Bomu Stadium in Changamwe on Wednesday evening, Mwenda insisted Put had his personal reasons to resign. “A coach came from outside and we gave him a job. He worked and then resigned for personal reasons. What do we do as a country? asked Mwenda. He said the federation is already working on hiring a new coach. “Next week, we will have a bigger and better coach. This is an easy matter to handle. If today you leave your work, another person will be hired,” he said. Put had led Gambia and Bukina Faso to Africa Cup of Nations tournament. He also led Jordan to the 2014 World Cup held in Brazil.
