Kenyan police should urgently produce lawyer Miguna Miguna, Human Rights Watch has said. In a statement on Tuesday, Otsieno Namwaya of the lobby group said the courts should obey the law and release the lawyer. "The flagrant flouting of court orders undermines the basic concept of the rule of law," Namwaya said. Miguna is among three people, including two MPs, arrested in a crackdown against those who participated in NASA leader Raila Odinga’s oath ceremony on January 30. Police have failed to produce Miguna in court in accordance with court orders issued on both February 2 and February 5. His location has been a cat-and-mouse game between lawyers and supporters on the one hand, and police on the other. On Friday, High court judge Chacha Mwita issued orders to the IG to release him so he could appear in court on Monday morning. The police ignored the order in a-hide and-seek with the lawyers, amidst reports Miguna had suffered asthma while in police custody over the weekend. Judge Luka Kimaru also issued orders requiring IG Joseph Boinnet and DCI boss George Kinoti to produce the accused in person.
