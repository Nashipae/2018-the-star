NASA has dropped Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga from the Parliamentary Service Commission list. The coalition has nominated Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa, Vihiga Senator George Khaniri and Borabu’s Ben Momanyi. NASA yesterday presented the names to National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi, ending the tough balancing act the opposition has faced over the nominations.

Jubilee had earlier vowed to vote out Wanga, claiming she had abused the President. Initially, the MPs were to vote by secret ballot, but they finally resorted to acclamation. Big brother Jubilee will be represented in the commission by Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruyiot, nominated Senator Beth Mugo, Eldas MP Adan Keynan and Taveta MP Naomi Shaban. Majority leader Aden Duale, who moved the motion on the nominees, told them to ensure they promote the welfare of the MPs, warning they should not use the positions for personal interest.

He called on the commissioners to serve the interests of MPs. “The one slot that ODM was entitled to, we decided as a big brother to give it out to ANC,” Mbadi said.
