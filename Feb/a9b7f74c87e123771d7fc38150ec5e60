Lunga Lunga MP Khattib Mwashetani on Tuesday said no exploration activities will be allowed in the subcounty by the Ministry of Mining.

He said Msambweni residents where Base Titanium is operating are living a hard life after being relocated and will not allow the same to happen to his constituents.
