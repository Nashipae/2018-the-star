Tana River county assembly on Wednesday evening cleared seven executive members, after a more than five months stalement. Governor Dhadho Godhana has been working without an executive committee after his list of nominees was rejected by the county assembly. Six took oath of office at 10.30pm the same night while one was sworn in yesterday morning. One of the nominees was rejected after
it emerged that his KCSE certificate was disowned by Knec. The swearing-in ceremony was presided over by Garsen
Principal Magistrate James Macharia, in the presence of Governor Godhana and other county officials. They include Abass
Kunyo Guyo, Education, Youth, Sports, Gender and Social Services, Khadija
Harufa Algi, Public Service Management, Administration and ICT, Mwanajuma
Habwoka Mabuke, Health, Sanitation and Medical Services, Yahya Barrow, Trade,
Cooperative Development, Tourism and Industrialization, Javan Bonaya, Lands, Physical Planning, Agriculture, Fisheries, Livestock and Veterinary
Services, Stephen Wachira Kariuki, Roads, Public Works, Housing and
Urbanization, and Matthew Babwoya Buya for Finance and Planning. Goghana put the new CEC members to deliver their mandate and address the challenges facing residents like cholera outbreak and drought or get dismissed before the five-year term ends. “The residents have high expectations from you, therefore do not disappoint them,’’ he said. It is believed the oath was administered at night for fear there could be a court injunction to bar the CECs from being sworn in.
