Keiyo North residents have decried massive destruction of Kapchemutwa Forest by “connected” sawmillers. They want Environment CS Keriako Tobiko to intervene. Residents have held protests in the forest daily since Monday. They accuse Kenya Forest Service of allowing unscrupulous sawmillers to cut trees. “We want logging to stop but the sawmillers are protected by some KFS officers,” a resident Fredrick Kemboi told teh Star yesterday. Another resident John Kimulwo said locals have lost hope in Elgeyo Marakwet county leadership.Kemboi said on Thursday that the sawmillers more trees than they are allocated by KFS. “We want the Tobiko to move with speed to rescue Kapchemutwa forest. Rivers in the area are already drying,” Kemboi said. He said wanton destruction is happening under the full glare of KFS officials and the county government. Another resident John Kimulwo said locals have lost hope in Elgeyo Marakwet county leadership led by Governor Alex Tolgos whom they accused of turning a blind eye as the unscrupulous loggers destroy the forest.
