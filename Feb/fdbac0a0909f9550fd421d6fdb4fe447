No one has died of hunger in Baringo, county commissioner Henry Wafula said yesterday. He said only two elderly women, who were on the cash transfer programme, have died. One of the women from Cheptaran died on Thursday last week. She is said to have complained of hunger. Wafula said together with Interior CS Fred Matiang’i they on Monday donated 200 bags of rice to hunger victims in Kolowa, Tiaty subcounty. He said the government is working on modalities to supply more food next week. “The government is always on its toes to ensure nobody dies of hunger,” Wafula said. He was reacting to a story carried by the Star yesterday, indicating that six people, including a five-year-old child, died of hunger-related illnesses in Cheptaran, Naudo, Cheptunoiyo and Natan villages in Tiaty subcounty.
