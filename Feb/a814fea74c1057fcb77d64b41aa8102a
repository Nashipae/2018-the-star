Thika residents on Monday protested against an alleged plot to grab a Sh80 million children’s playground in Thika town. Section Nine Estate residents accused two MCAs of trying to forge ownership documents of the one acre set aside for public use since 1969. “They came here two weeks ago with a contingent of Kiambu county government officials and they were taking photos and surveying the land,” resident David Muiru said. He said he is sure they want to grab the land to sell to unsuspecting investors or to construct high-rise buildings. OVER OUR DEAD BODIES “When we enquired what they were doing, one MCAs rudely replied they wanted to put the idle land to a more productive use, Muiru told the Star. It doesn’t matter who they are working for or who wants to take this land, he said. “They will only take it over our dead bodies,” another resident said. Muiru said the land has been a public utility since 1970 and has been preserved by all mayors in the old Municipal Council since then because it was a play ground. “The Lions Club of Thika was allowed to rehabilitate and improve the ground. They fenced the ground, planted trees and put up basic necessities,” Muiru said. LOCALS WILL UPGRADE IT “Grabbers want to turn the parcel into a market and later subdivide it amongst themselves. They are just daydreaming because we will not allow that to happen,” he said. Resident Monica Wanjiku said they regret to see people who are supposed to be safeguarding public properties running after them. The locals pledged to rehabilitate the playground, instal water and construct lavatories, saying that this will ward off grabbers. They called on the ministry of Lands and the National Land Commission to ensure that no land ownership documents are produced.
