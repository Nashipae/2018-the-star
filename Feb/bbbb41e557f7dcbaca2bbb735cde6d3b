The national and county governments, National Disaster Management Committee, Kenya Navy, Kenya Police, KWS and Lake Naivasha divers are among other teams that took part in the recovery operation. “It’s unfortunate that the body of our beloved son cannot be found. Our hopes of finding him have turned into frustration. But we are still praying for God to give us comfort during this dark period,” Gitau's aunt Elizabeth Njeri said in an earlier interview. "It's unfortunate that we will not see our friends again. It's been hard for us to come to terms. We pray that may God comfort the five families and pray for His strength," Senator Kihiga said. Only one boat is patrolling the expansive lake in search of the bodies. Also read: 40 divers intensify search for Nakuru chopper crash victims
