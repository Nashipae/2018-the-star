A row is emerging between two Mombasa-based CBOs over representation of Owino Uhuru residents who were poisoned by lead. The Centre for Justice, Governance and Environmental Action in 2015 went to court demanding Sh1.6 billion compensation for the victims. The group said the 3,000 locals had their lives and health ruined and need money for medication. But the Pamoja Trust is working on a report, which might alter some of the CJGEAâ€™s decisions. The move will likely influence the cash to be received or the direction the case will take. The state and protection agencies were accused of failing to monitor lead emissions and effluent from the defunct smelting plant, the Kenya Metal Refiner, leading to fatalities. Victims say there have been medical complications and deaths.
