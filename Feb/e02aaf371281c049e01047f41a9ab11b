Unseeded Kenyan players lost their round one matches in the third leg of the Kenya International Junior Tennis Championships staged at Nairobi Club yesterday. The players, who were seeking to join the internationally ranked counterparts in round two, lost their singles duels and subsequently crushed out of the tournament. The Kenyan boys’ duo of Brandon Sagala and Dhuruv Kavia lost to Taona Mwandagara of Zimbabwe 6-0, 6-1 and Enrico Wood of Great Britain 6-0,6-1 respectively. Alicia Owegi and Roselida Asumwa equally bade farewell to the tournament following their defeats to Frida Bostrand of Sweden 6-1, 6-2 and Hoziane Kitambala of Burundi 6-2, 6-1 in the girls’ category. Today, the seeded players will take their experience to the courts in round two matches, where the second leg quarter finalist Albert Njogu will lead his three counterparts Ryan Randiek, Derrick Ominde and Mwendwa Mutuku in gunning for glory. Beaten second leg finalist, Angela Okutoyi will represent the girls in the remaining bit of the tournament. Randiek said his goal is to advance past the third round mark after poor show in the opening two legs. He said: “I lost the first and the second legs in the third round and this time I want to surpass that record. I have learnt a lot from the opening legs and I want to correct my mistakes in the this leg and improve on the rankings.” His sentiments were echoed by Ominde, who lost the previous two legs in the second round. He said: “When I lost the second round, I had to change my tactics by playing the experienced Kenyan senior players. I have learnt from them in the few days we have trained together and I hope this time I will leave a mark in the tournament.”
