Directors of Kings Medical College in Nyeri have accused the government of harassing investors. Owner Moses Njue, a former chief government pathologist, said closure of the institution last week is malicious and in bad taste. The Kenya Medical Laboratory Technicians and Technologists Board officers stormed the institution on Monday and issued a notice to close the college. Speaking to journalists at the institution on Friday, Njue said the board had inspected the college and they acted on the recommendations. “Since year 2016, the board refused to renewal our licence, despite presenting a cheque of Sh 86,000. Why the malice? Instead of solving the matter in a humane way, they harassed students and lecturers and arrested,” Njue said. Millions invested The board ordered the closure of the institution that has been operating for over seven years after allegedly failing to meet basic standards for offering the programme. Njue who has moved to court clarified that only 92 students of Medical Laboratory who have been affected and not 200 students as reported by the media. Other students in the faculties of nursing and clinical medicine are continuing with their studies. “There seems to be a rift between KMLTTB and Knec. As the two bulls fight, students suffer. They should have given notice and time to for students to finish their studies. It is painful to close down an institution yet millions of shillings was invested in,” he said. KMLTTB chief executive officer Patrick Kisabey maintained the college was closed in 2016 after an inspection. “We inspected the institution in 2016, in November last year and today. The administration has not complied with the requirements,” he said. Kisabey said the college is not registered, and students are not indexed by the board as required in law.
