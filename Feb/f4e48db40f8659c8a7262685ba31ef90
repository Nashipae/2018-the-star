Some residents in Suyian, Samburu subcounty, are being monitored by community members after they threatened to kill their children out of desperation. This comes after 40 families lost more than 2,000 cows and goats to cattle rustlers at the weekend. Samburu Woman Representative Maison Leshoomo has said residents are hurting because of the incident and they see no future for their families. She said many families lost their entire livelihoods and some men are thinking of killing their children since they don’t have anything to feed them. “Many families have been left with nothing. That is why some men have threatened to kill their young children rather than see them starve,” Leshoomo said. She urged the government and well-wishers to donate food to the village. Leshoomo also urged security agencies to ensure they recover the stolen animals, which are believed to be in a neighbouring village. Chief Karoli Leraul said armed bandits from a neighbouring community have stolen more than 7,000 cattle since July last year. Area leaders are expected to hold a security meeting in Baragoi on Tuesday to discuss the way forward. Residents have also threatened to walk for more than 400km to Interior CS Fred Matiang’i’s office in Nairobi to report rampant cases of cattle rustling.
