Matayos deputy county commissioner Fredric Ayieko has urged Busia residents to provide an environment conducive to trade with Ugandans. He said on Monday at the Quill Hotel that Ugandans have been harassed in the past by police officers manning the One Stop Border post, yet they should be allowed to walk into the country freely within 10km away from the border. “Kenyans benefit more from Uganda. Let’s allow them to trade freely for us to benefit. Let us work as a Kenyan people and celebrate the commissioning of the One Stop Border post by President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday, February 24,” Ayieko said. EAC integration officer Juma Wakhungu said Busia is the second busiest border point after Malaba and having a border post will benefit residents. He said the post will ensure improved efficiency, transparency and better integration with EAC states.
