Makueni MCAs want the Wote Water and Sewerage Company board disbanded. The MCAs yesterday agreed with the Public Accounts and Investment Committee's recommendations to have the board of directors overhauled. “For the purpose of ensuring transparency and accountability on utilisation of public funds in the company, we have recommended the disbandment of the entire board of directors and have a new one instituted,” Public Accounts and Investment Committee chairperson Kelvin Mutuku said. The MCAs also recommended that the managing director and his team be investigated by the anti-corruption agency. During the committee hearings, the report says, the director was unable to provide the ownership document for Sh150,000 land purchased by the company to set up a water tank. It was 12 metres by 12 metres land. “No records, including stock sheet, stock-taking report, no board of survey report in respect to the stores records, no inventory to monitor movement of stock and the committee could not ascertain any physical store or store keeper for the company records,” the report seen by the Star shows. The committee also shows that managing director Justus Kuti appeared ignorant of the existing procurement laws, violated the Public Procurement regulations and is not conversant with his roles and responsibilities. The committee recommended that the company undertakes a competitive recruitment of the company's managing director and the management team and ensure the company adheres to Public Procurement and Assets Procurement Act 2015. Unsupported amount of Sh2.5 should also be recovered from the managing director in one month, says part of the report. The company has also been required to establish a procurement unit in 60 days. The MCAs unanimously adopted the report.
