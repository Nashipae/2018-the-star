The government has given Sh11 million for the Lapsset Presidential Scholarship in Lamu county. The programme was launched by former President Mwai Kibaki in 2012 but took effect in 2014. He pledged to ensure 1,000 youths from the county are sponsored and empowered through education and skills in port-related work. The beneficiaries would secure jobs at the Lamu Port once it begins to operate. The programme also aims to ensure the local community is actively involved in the Lapsset project. Lapsset director general and CEO Sylvestre Kasuku (pictured) on Thursday said the money had been received. It will be used for tuition fees and upkeep of Lamu students sponsored by Lapsset in universities and colleges, he said.
