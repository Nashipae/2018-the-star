Civil society organisations yesterday held protests in Nairobi to force President Uhuru Kenyatta to withdraw his list of Cabinet nominees, saying it does not meet the two-thirds gender rule. Last month, Uhuru named his 22-member Cabinet with five women included. The law requires that no gender occupy more than two-thirds in any appointment. “The list reeks of pungent discrimination on basis of age, disability, ethnicity and gender,” the activists said. The groups that included Fida, United Disabled Persons of Kenya and the Centre for Rights Education and Awareness held peaceful demonstrations and sent a petition to National Asembly Speaker Justin Muturi, asking him to send the list back to the President. ”The list should not be allowed to pass in a democratic state which values equality and non-discrimination. We condemn the President’s nominations which fall far outside the spirit of the Constitution,” UDPK chairman Joseph Rono said. The groups accused Uhuru of reneging on the oath he took to respect, uphold and defend the Constitution. Their petition was received by Clerk of the National Assembly Michael Sialai. They also faulted Uhuru for violating the Constitution by creating the positions of assistant minister through the ranks of Chief Administrative Secretaries. They said the move was to ensure political allies were rewarded. “We strongly condemn the President for manipulating the Constitution. The position of CAS is not envisioned in the Constitution,” the petition reads. Read:Women and the disabled demand Cabinet slots, say CASs a burden Click here for the latest political news
