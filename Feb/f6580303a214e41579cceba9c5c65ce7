Government has withdrawn security for Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho. Other NASA politicians have also had their bodyguards withdrawn this week, including ODM chairman John Mbadi and Senator James Orengo. Government seemingly wants to punish opposition leaders for supporting Raila Odinga on Tuesday when he was sworn in as the 'People's President'. However state responsibilities should not be abused for partisan political reasons. MPs, governments and senators are legally entitled to protection and bodyguards. Government is breaking the law by withdrawing their security. Some leaders seem to believe that there is a plot hatched by the media and the opposition to overthrow the government. In that case, police bodyguards should remain with these potentially dangerous politicians so that they can monitor them and report their movements to headquarters. And if something should now happen to these opposition politicians, the finger would now point at government. Withdrawing security for the opposition just makes government look petty. It serves no useful purpose. Police bodyguards should be restored to entitled politicians.
