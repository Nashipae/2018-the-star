Do you love fashion and travel? Well, Susan Kaittany has got you covered. The classy Posh Palace owner is about to launch the first-ever international travel show in Kenya. Susan has worked in the travel business for over 15 years, in her family business ATS Travel, and has travelled to over 70 countries over the years in the business. She has always loved her work in the travel industry, and she is now ready to share it with the public. Speaking to Word Is, she explained what the show will be about and the different segments she'll be showcasing. "It's a lifestyle show. It's combining my travel, where I'm going to all these exotic destinations and while going there, I'm basically looking for the perfect location to shoot. So I'll be doing all this adventure kinda related activities on the ground. On my last episode, I went kayaking, wind surfing and diving, and at the end of every episode, I'll be doing a photoshoot. So it's more like fashion meets travel. "This fashion part of the show comes from the fact that I have been a beauty queen and a model, and so my two worlds meet here. Some of my fashion shoot pictures will be featured in the True Love magazine for the February edition. It's like a really cool travel show that shows the lifestyle part as well. I'm travelling across the world and this week, I'm going to South Africa and after that, I'll be going to Dubai then Europe. I'm basically shooting all across the globe." When asked when it will air, she said, "I want to shoot the episodes first so as to have enough content, because I don't want to have pressure with the content. I'm currently on episode four." Susan is a lawyer and businesswoman who runs Posh Palace hair studio and spa. Some of the biggest celebrities have graced her salon and spa. She is looking forward to expanding her business and open branches across the country in 2018. You can check out her website at susankaittany.com
