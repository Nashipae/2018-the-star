In stark contrast to last season when they were making their debut in the top flight league, Kariobangi Sharks began the 2018 Kenya Premier League campaign with an important away victory at the Sudi Stadium, the often impregnable home of Nzoia United. Now skipper Geoffrey Shiveka maintains hard work starts now with an aim of surpassing the heights they set last year when they finished third in the league. “It was a good start and a morale boosting victory for the whole squad. Now we must do that week in, week out, to ensure we remain competitive in the league for the entire campaign,” said the former national team Under-20 captain. Though Sharks lost key players in the end of season transfer window including club top scorer Masoud Juma, play-makers Elly Asieche and Ibrahim Kitawi as well as promising forward Mathews Odongo, Shiveka has been impressed by the level of the youthful players who joined the side as replacements for their more experienced rivals. “They are playing at a high level in training and hopefully, they will do the same in our matches. It is us with more experience, who should take the pressure off them to ensure they succeed because they have the quality and talent to succeed at Sharks”added Shiveka. Inpsite of their better start to the campaign compared to last year, Shiveka remains coy about the teams prospects this year.” “We will take very match as it comes and see where we are at the end of the season. We can’t afford to look so far into the season,” he concluded. Sharks clash with Vihiga United in Machakos on Monday. Meanwhile, Wazito midfielder Stanley Ndung’u has undergone successful knee surgery at a Nairobi hospital. He was injured in 2016 against Oserian FC at Camp Toyoyo. While the efforts were to get him to India, that became difficult due to lack of adequate funding.
