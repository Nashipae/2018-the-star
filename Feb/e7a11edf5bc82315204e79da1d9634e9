St Mary’s School, Yala and Sawagongo High will host the Nyanza secondary schools term one games between March 19 and 24. Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association Nyanza region secretary Thomas Odhiambo said they were planning to host the event at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology but the institution will be having a graduation ceremony around the said dates. “Yala will host ball games while athletics will be staged at Sawagongo,” Odhiambo said. He said all counties are supposed to stage their championships by March 10. Kisumu Boys and East Africa champions Kisumu Day are expected to defend their basketball and hockey titles respectively. Ambira coach Patrick Mboya has vowed to reclaim the title going by their current form which saw them win the Biro Lich and Maseno Open tournaments. "We have had a good build up winning some tournaments. The boys are ready because we have qualified for regionals for five consecutive years and won once. We are targeting to regain our title this year," said Mboya. Ambira will, however, face stiff competition from fallen giants Maseno School and upcoming Agoro, who are expected to have smooth sailing to the regional finals. In rugby 15’s, champions and hosts Yala start as favourites but former champions Maseno School, St Joseph’s Rapogi, Homa Bay High and Cardinal Otunga High School, Mosocho will be lurking to dethrone them. In athletics, Kisii County is expected to continue with their dominance. Mogonga Secondary School coach Haron Onchong’a said his school is set to defend their titles lead by World Under 18 silver medalist Mary Moraa expected to star in 100m, 200m and 400m. "We are having our Sub County Championships on Friday at Nyachogochogo Secondary. We expect to dominate because we have been training for these championships," said Onchong’a.
