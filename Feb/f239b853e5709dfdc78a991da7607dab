Balala said the elephants must be taken care of because the exercise is “difficult, tricky and sensitive”. They are traced by light aircraft, then darted with a tranquiliser from a chopper. Then they are put carefully in a cage and transported in a truck by road. Balala warned poachers against killing wildlife and said those found will be jailed for life. “The law will be amended in such a way that those found guilty of poaching are jailed for life, instead of being released on bond,” he said. Elephants bring a lot of revenue to the country through tourists, he said. Balala was joined by Kieni MP Kanini Kega. The minister said the state has set aside Sh612 million to compensate victims of elephant invasions. Click here for the latest political news
