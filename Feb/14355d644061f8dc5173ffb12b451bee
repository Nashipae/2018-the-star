Twitter quietly introduced a re-design to embedded tweets so that they no longer show many times a post has been re-tweeted. Now, the posts say how many 'people are talking about this'. Stock image A Twitter spokesperson confirmed to Dailymail.com that the change was rolled out globally on Tuesday. The spokesperson added that the site is always looking for new ways to provide better social context around tweets. The new design caters to non-Twitter users who regularly interact with tweets. More than 1 billion people see embedded tweets every month, but not every one of them has a Twitter account. For example, if someone who doesn't use Twitter stumbles across a post that's gotten 10,000 retweets, they may not understand what a retweet is. Twitter just rolled out a new design for embedded tweets that could attract new users to the site, while deterring fake bot accounts at the same time. Embedded tweets on news stories and other sites no longer show how many times a post has been retweeted, according to Slate, which first spotted the change. Instead, embedded posts now show how many 'people are talking about' a tweet, using a metric that combines both replies and retweets. The tech giant hasn't publicly acknowledged the change, but Twitter users began noticing the update on Tuesday. Click here for the latest political news
