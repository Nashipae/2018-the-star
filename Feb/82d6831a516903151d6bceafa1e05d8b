Activist Okiya Omtatah has challenged Ken Ogeto's nomination as Solicitor General in court. Omtatah went to court on Friday, arguing it is unconstitutional since President Uhuru Kenyatta has not followed procedures and there was no public participation. He wants the court to stop Parliament from accepting Ogeto's name for vetting. Uhuru plucked a key ally and long-time aide, Solicitor General Njee Muturi, from the powerful State Law Office where he was the accounting officer. He appointed him the Deputy Chief of Staff and replaced him with Ogeto. Lawyer Ogeto is expected to bring discipline, professionalism, strategic thinking and coordination to the governmentâ€™s response to legal issues.
