Champions Vihiga Queens will launch their title defence with a clash against Eldoret Falcons in a unified Football Kenya Federation (FKF) women’s Premier League match at Mumias Sports Complex on February 24. Vihiga dethroned Thika Queens last season, thanks to 2-1 win during the league play-offs match at Camp Toyoyo grounds. The season was played on zonal format, where both teams emerged winners in their respective zones before clashing for the overall title. Vihiga coach Alex Alumira said he is aware of the task ahead and remained optimistic of retaining the title when the season ends on October 21 starts. “We are happy the league returns to a unified system having adopted a zonal format for the past two seasons. The format gives us a chance to play all the teams in the top tier unlike the zonal where you only play teams in your zone. The zonal show was not as competitive as we would have loved it to be,” observed Alumira. “With the unified league, the league will be tough and we are aware our competitors will be coming for us. We are equally prepared and we look forward to the season,” he added. According to fixtures released on Wednesday, Spedag welcome top tier returnee Gaspo Youth in another match. Gaspo and Trans Nzoia Falcon earned promotion to the top tier after finishing top in their respective zones in Division One last season while Soccer Sisters and Bulemia were relegated. Other ties on the card will see Mathare United take on Baringo Starlets and Kayole Starlets battle it out with Makolanders, who finished second in the Zone ‘A’ behind Thika Oueens.
