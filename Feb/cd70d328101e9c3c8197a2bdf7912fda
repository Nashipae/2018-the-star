The Busia government and East African Breweries Limited will partner to commercialise sorghum farming. This follows a meeting on Wednesday. Five thousand farmers will supply the EABL plant in Kisumu for the production of Senator Keg beer. EABL head of sustainability Jean Mugo said the company supports development. “Supporting county development is key to our overall strategy and hence the choice of a Kisumu plant through an investment of Sh15 billion to set up a whole new value chain,” she said. Most farmers currently grow sorghum for subsistence. “Senator Keg is one of our best innovations and we created it to help fight the problem of illicit brews. It is safe, healthy, of high quality and meets the consumer at a price that is pocket friendly.” This drink is purely made from sorghum and EABL is ready to contract farmers once they have formed and consolidated their farms for production of sorghum. EABL is using a Western Fit strategy targeting five counties - Kisumu, Busia, Siaya, Migori and Homa Bay - where farmers will grow Sila sorghum, a variety suitable for production of the brand.
