A court will on March 7 rule on the relocation of the Kachok dumpsite to Kajulu. The petitioners want the relocation stopped arguing it is a health risk to Kajulu residents. The county government had already started the relocation. One of the petitioners, Ibrahim Oloo, withdrew his name, saying he was shocked to hear on the radio he had filed a suit. Justice Stephen Kibunjia directed the name be struck off the list of petitioners as there was no evidence or sworn affidavits indicating he was one. Kibunjia further advised Oloo he was at liberty to report the matter to the police for investigations. The petitioners are Titus Achar, George Ondere and Rose Juma, while the respondents are the Kisumu government, City Manager Doris Ombara and Naya Holdings Ltd.
