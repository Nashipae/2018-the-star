The government yesterday was urged to pursue and arrest rustlers who last week stole more than 2,000 livestock and killed two herders in Suyian, Samburu North. Samburu residents and leaders have also asked the government to move with speed and recover the animals. They said some families are likely to face starvation after their herds were driven away by the rustlers. The leaders included Samburu Governor Moses Lenolkulal, Woman Representative Maison Leshoomo, Samburu North MP Alois Lentoimaga and several MCAs. They spoke at Mtaro Cemetery in Maralal town during the burial of the two herders. “Interior CS Fred Matiang’i must issue an order to pursue those criminals,” Lentoimaga said. The leaders accused the security team in the area of misusing state resources. They said the officers hire out police lorries to businesspeople. Lentoimaga said the vehicles are hired to transport goods to and from Maralal.
