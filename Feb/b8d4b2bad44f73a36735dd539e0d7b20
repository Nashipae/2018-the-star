Club DJs have accused City Hall askaris of harassment following the arrest of two of their colleagues at Jikonis, Kiambu Road on Saturday. The two were arrested amid claims they were playing loud music. Speaking to the Star on Monday, George Njuguna aka Dj Creme said the city askaris erred in their move to arrest DJ's at work. "If NEMA and county officials have a problem with the sound from the clubs, they should approach the management of the premises," Njuguna said. He called for talks between the askaris, NEMA officials and club owners to avert such occurrences in future. But Peter Mbaya, the director of operations at City Hall,Â  said the county will not hesitate to arrest people who do not comply with the laid down laws. Mbaya said inspectorate officers cannot arrest club owners since they are not the ones playing loud music. For his part, Senator Johnson Sakaja condemned the arrests saying it is the club owners who should be held responsible for such crimes. Click here for the latest political news
