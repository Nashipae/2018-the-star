Ten shooters are set to make their international debut during the 2018 Imperial Meeting slated for June 26 to July 21 in Bisley, United Kingdom . The 10 full-bore firers are among 24 who met and surpassed the qualification marks in the last 10 meetings. However, the chances of eight Kenya Defence Forces trigger pullers to make their debut hangs in the balance after a six-year ( 2012 to 2017) absence at the annual Imperial UK Bisley competitions. It is for the same reason that the country has not been able to field a squad in team event due to lack of quorum (16 shooters). The National Police Service only sends 12 marksmen to the event annually. “We have very good shooters in KDF and their new firers are forming up well. What remains is international exposure, where they get to experience different (and extreme) conditions and also exchange ideas with firers from other countries,” said Shoaib Vayani, the secretary general of Kenya Sports Shooting Federation. “If the best from the military team combined efforts with top police shooters, Kenya would form a really formidable team that would give outfits from UK, Australia, South Africa, Czech Republic and USA among others a hard time,” added Vayani. In addition to echoing Vayani’s sentiments, the Kenya full-bore shooting captain Sanford Otundo pleaded with the Defence Forces to re-barrel DFRA rifles to enhance the already good performances by soldier-firers.
