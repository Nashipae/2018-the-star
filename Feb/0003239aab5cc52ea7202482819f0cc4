Lawyers will elect new LSK officials today in a poll clouded by NASA-Jubilee rivalry as politicians seek to influence the powerful body. A number of lawyers yesterday told the Star candidates engaged in lavish campaigns and ethnicity is deeply entrenched.

Some of the campaigns were expensive,” lawyer Danstan Omari told Star on the phone. He said it is unfortunate that politicians are infiltrating a lawyers’ election to ‘fight’ their wars. “Will lawyers rise above negative ethnicity? We expect them to vote based on merit,” Omari said. Lawyer Assa Nyakundi urged lawyers not to vote along political lines. “It is unfortunate. I would expect by virtue of the unique mandate the LSK has, that lawyers should steer clear of the kind of politics we are seeing around,” he said.  Two eye top seat The LSK president’s seat has attracted two candidates. Kisumu-based lawyer and former East Africa Law Society chairman James Mwamu will face off with Allen Gichuhi.
