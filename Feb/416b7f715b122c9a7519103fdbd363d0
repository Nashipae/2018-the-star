I am blessed I got to share many moments with you, I am grateful for our amazing children. You have left a huge gap that NO ONE will ever fill. I love you Papa Asante forever and may God give me the strength and courage to raise our children to continue your legacy... Papa Asante we miss you and I see you every time I look into our babies’ eyes... Words are not enough to express how I feel in this moment. Please rest in perfect peace. I will be still and know that He is God...."
