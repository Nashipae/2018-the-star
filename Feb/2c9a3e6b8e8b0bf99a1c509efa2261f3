Wild fires
have consumed more than 500 acres of forests in Elgeyo Marakwet and Trans Nzoia
counties, Kenya Forest Service has reported. The two
counties boast of Embobut and Cherangay forests, which form the 65,000 hectare
Cherangany water tower. KFS on Sunday said the latest fires have destroyed at least 200 acres of Embobut
forest. The fire started in Tirap on Thursday and spread very fast to
different sections of the forest as KFS battled to put it off. This has been
attributed to strong winds experienced during the December-March dry season. KFS North
Rift head of conservancy Dedan Ndiritu said already sections in four forest
blocks in the two counties have been extensively destroyed by the fires
whose cause is still under investigation. “We are yet
to establish the exact extend of the damage but it has so far destroyed an
estimated 500 acres of forest cover," Ndiritu said. "We are currently trying to put off the fires at Chesoi forest
in Marakwet East which has extensively damaged the indigenous forest.” Ndiritu said
fires at Kipkabus in Elgeyo Marakwet and Saboti and Sosio forests in Trans Nzoia
counties have since been contained. Sections of
wetlands have also been destroyed threatening the existence of rivers. “We have recalled
all officers on leave and assembled firefighting equipment to enable us swiftly
respond incase of outbreaks,” he said. Ndiritu
appealed to the community especially honey harvesters to desist from starting fires haphazardly, warning this
could escalate the fire outbreaks. “We have
talked to communities especially those living around the forest to quickly alert our offices whenever in case of a fire outbreak to be contained before it
spreads further,” he appealed. “It is the
duty of each individual to take care of environment and anybody found igniting
fire in the forest will be dealt with accordingly,” he warned.
