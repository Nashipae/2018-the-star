High Court Judge Chacha Mwita on Friday made a ruling that automatically gave Auditor General Edward Ouko the go-ahead to audit the billions of shillings annually allocated to the military and other security agencies. In the landmark ruling, Mwita declared Section 40 of the Public Audit Act No 34 of 2015 and others as inconsistent with constitutional provisions. The judge’s decision will be praised by liberals and damned by conservatives. Coming so close to the Controller of Budget’s Quarter One report released last week that showed the military spent Sh24 billion in 90 days in an election year, it will be applauded by many. Militaries everywhere hide their use of resources and invoke state secrets. This happens even in the United States, which has the world’s biggest and most expensive military and national security agencies ever. Auditing the military and the deep state security agencies should expose, and therefore hopefully prevent huge spendings shrouded in mystery or other wrongdoing that goes on behind closed doors and the Official Secrets Act.
