A World Bank projects consultant Kithinji Kiragu has urged the Judiciary and Executive to stop their confrontations. Speaking to the Star at Viesnina Hotel in Embu yestedar, Kiragu who was an advisor of former President Mwai Kibaki’s government, said the Judiciary and the Executive are co-dependent. “When CJ David Maraga and Jubilee politicians lead their troops in a media showdown through decisions that provoke each other,” Kiragu said. He said it is absurd to order the IG to appear in court. Kiragu urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to deal with the lapses, in which his officers disobey the law.
