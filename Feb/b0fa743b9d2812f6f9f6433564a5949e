The police crackdown on hawkers and boda boda riders in Nairobi’s CBD started yesterday. It immediately ran into trouble after City Hall refused to pay Sh6.3 million for officers’ meals, allowances and fuel. Governor Mike Sonko declined a request by county commissioner Amos Mariba to facilitate officers to flush out the groups from downtown. It was not known how the refusal will affect the operation.

Some were charged at City Hall Court while others who could not pay the fines, spent the night at the Central Police Station. Police patrolled the downtownin two lorries. Hawkers operating along Kirinyaga Road, River Road and Tom Mboya Street were the most affected. The operation is scheduled to take 14 days. “We have arrested many [hawkers and boda bodas], but I cannot confirm the exact number,” Central police station OCPD Robison Thuku said. On Wednesday Mariba had written to the governor requesting Sh6,307,000 for the officers’ allowances, meals and fueling of five lorries and cruisers. “In order to make it successful and humane, it was agreed officers will arrive early morning. They will require transport and meals,” the letter reads. Click here for the latest political news
