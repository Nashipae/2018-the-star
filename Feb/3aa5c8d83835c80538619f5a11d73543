Olive Mugenda - jsc nominee Ignores petition against her nomination  Former Kenyatta University vice chancellor Olive Mugenda yesterday dismissed a petition challenging her suitability to sit in the Judicial Service Commission. Mugenda appeared before the National Assembly Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs and said the allegations contained in an affidavit by George Lukoye were untrue and pending in court. “I have never been charged in a court of law. The matter is pending in court that is all I can say for now,” Mugenda, who has been nominated by President Uhuru Kenyatta to represent nonlawyers in the JSC, told the committee. Makokha in his affidavit challenged the role of Mugenda in the acquisition of a campus in Kigali, Rwanda and her integrity. Mugenda told the committee she has a track record and exemplary leadership abilities and should the committee approve her nomination, she will help to transform the Judiciary. Mugenda said she is worth Sh60 million. She said there is need to digitise services in the Judiciary to reduce cases of corruption. “I am good at writing strategic plans. I will use my expertise to build the capacity of judicial officers,” she said.
