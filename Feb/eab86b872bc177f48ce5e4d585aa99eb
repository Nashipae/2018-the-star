The Senate Public Accounts Committee will mid-this month start questioning governors over county spending. Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang’ said once they resume sittings on February 13, the team will set dates when it will summon governors to answer queries raised by the Auditor General. “We will have to clear the backlog of 2014-15, before we embark on 2015-16,” he said. Kajwang’ said this will not be antagonistic or used to settle political scores. Unlike previous sittings, where the focus was mainly on county executives and accounting officers, he said. “We will strive to hold every county official individually responsible for every omission or commission. We will invite the accounting and chief executive officers in an attempt to try and audit gaps arising. Where they fail, we will direct relevant authorities to take action,” Kajwang’, who is also the committee chairman, said. He said they will ensure the consequences are not only felt by the chief executive officers, but individual officers like accountants, procurement officers and even lawyers. “We will reach out to professional bodies of respective officers who engage in malpractices so that sanctions can be placed on them too,” Kajwang’ said. Murang’a, Homa Bay, Nyamira, Machakos and Nairobi will be counties of interest once the committee starts its sittings. Murang’a county cannot account for Sh200 million of the Sh5 billion received from the Exchequer. There were also no reconciliation or explanations for conflicting balances. “No reconciliation was provided for variances. As a result, the accuracy and completeness of balances and other transfers received by the county executive in the year ending June 30, 2016 cannot be confirmed,” the Auditor General said about Murang’a.
