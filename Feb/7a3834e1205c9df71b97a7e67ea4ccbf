The county government is facing a challenge relocating street families from the CBD as it was found out majority of beggars on the streets have been identified to be foreign nationals. Over 1, 000 streets children have been rescued and others taken to court in the ongoing CBD raids. Speaking to the Star on Friday, the director of operations at city inspectorate department Peter Mbaya said they will house them until they figure out the kind of action to take. "It is difficult to handle them considering they are not Kenyans," Mbaya said. Sports executive Janet Ouko said that the city is a commercial-hub and the removal of street kids from streets is part of ongoing cleaning and beautificaction programme. Some beggars are using children to elicit money from passersby. Atleast 200 street children were taken to Rehabilitation Center in Makadara and Kayole by the city county government. She said the Nairobi Inspectorate Department, working in conjuction with the National Police Services detectives, is working round the clock to ascertain the origin of these beggars.
