A church watchman, 47, allegedly burned his sheep shed and his house on Monday as he tried to destroy evidence of theft. William Emou had been caught stealing three sheep belonging to butcher James Ng’ang’a of the Kirinyaga Butchery. He is employed as a watchman by the Deliverance Church, Ol Kalou. Every week, Kirinyaga buy scores of sheep from livestock markets in Lailkipia and farmers in Nyandarua, which he slaughters and sells in Ol Kalou town. Ng’ang’a said he has been losing many sheep once he brings them to his home before they are slaughtered. Some residents accused Ng’ang’a of burning the house. He denied the accusation. On Monday, his employee said he saw Emou take three sheep from the field and drive them home, just 20m from the church. He alerted Ng’ang’a. Together with others, they rushed to the scene. Ng’ang’a identified his sheep by the paint marks he said were applied at the market. But one sheep was missing. He was informed the suspect’s sons had been spotted carrying something in a bag. Ng’ang’a asked Emou about the other sheep, but he told him to take the two available — if they were his, or call the police and let the matter be settled in court. “In the ensuing exchange, he ducked into the house and reemerged with a sword, threatening to die with one of us. We were about 10. We ran for safety. He lit a fire at the sheepshed, jumped over the church fence and locked himself inside the church from where police arrested him,” Ng’ang’a said. The fast fire consumed the sheepshed and spread to the main house. It burned two sheep and a puppy and destroyed property on more than 10 acres. Nyandarua firefighters later put it out. Nyandarua Central police boos Wilson Kosgei said they are investigating.
