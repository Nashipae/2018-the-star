The East African Safari Rally Limited will host a ‘mini classic’ rally on August 16-19 in honour of former director the late Jaideep Singh Vohra. Safaricom Limited has paired up with East African Safari Rally to run the event, which will start at Sarova Panafric Hotel in Nairobi and conclude at Sarova Woodlands Hotel in Nakuru. Safaricom has donated Sh4million towards event. East Africa Safari Rally Limited director Raju Kishinani said the entry fee is Sh21,000 per car and all the proceeds will be presented to the family of JS Vohra to donate to a charity organization of their choice. Safaricom consumer business director, Sylvia Mulinge said: “Safaricom co-sponsored the 8th edition of the East Africa Safari Classic Rally, which ended on December 1 after nine days.” “The success of the 8th edition was, however, blighted by the sad news that one of East Africa’s Safari Classic rally’s greatest icons, JS Vohra had passed away on his way to watch the marathon rally. “Losing an iconic rally director was heartbreaking. The team thought of how he would have liked to be remembered and to him, the success of the eighth edition of East Africa Safari Classic rally was important. It is through the spirit of greatness and toughness that he led the team and the organisers were able to resume the race in his honour,” she said. Mulinge continued: “This year, the team continues to celebrate him and will organise a mini classic rally in memory of the late JS Vohra. We are happy to be part of the team and glad that the rally fraternity invited us to be part of the mini classic rally. We are counting on everyone in this room to make it a success. JS was passionate about Kenyan drivers and the fact that the mini classic is affordable to local drivers is a great way to celebrate the milestones he made to ensure the East Africa Safari Classic rally is what it is today.”
