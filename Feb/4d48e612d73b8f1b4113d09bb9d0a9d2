Transport was paralysed on Garissa-Nairobi road on Thursday as a crowd protested the killing of two watchmen by unknown people. The two were murdered at dawn by people who stole a safe from the hardware store they had been guarding. Madogo area residents said one of them was beheaded and the other strangled. The demonstrators blocked the road for the better part of the morning, lit bonfires and engaged anti-riot police in running battles for about five hours. They suspected foul play as a similar crime was committed on the same date in 2014. While demanding answers, the protesters set a vehicle at the hardware store's premises on fire. The two firefighters sent from Garissa town did not manage to put out the fire so the lorry was completely damaged. “We are demanding that police get to the bottom of these killings because things are not adding up. We need to be told the truth. This is not the first time such killings have happened,” said Abdi Hassan. Madogo police officers sought reinforcement from their Garissa colleagues as they were overwhelmed in containing the protesters. They were forced to fire in the air and hurl tear gas canisters to disperse the demonstrators as they intended to burn the business. Garissa OCPD Aaron Moriasi oversaw the operations since the police boss in charge of the area is stationed in Bura which is 100 kilometres away. Garissa governor Ali Korane got caught up in the confrontation and was forced to park his vehicle at a petrol station and await clearance. He was on his way to Nairobi. Police took the bodies to Garissa hospital mortuary. Click here for the latest political news
