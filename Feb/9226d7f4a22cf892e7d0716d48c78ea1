MPs Alfred Keter, (Nandi Hills) Kangogo Bowen (Marakwet East) and Trans Nzoia Senator Henry Ndiema will this week know the outcome of petitions challenging their victories. Eldoret High Court Judge George Kimondo today will rule on the Bowen petition before ruling on the Ndiema case tomorrow. The ruling on the Keter petition will be delivered on Thursday. Kimondo set the dates after hearings on submissions were concluded last week. Bowen’s election was challenged by voter Sammy Kemboi after he beat former MP Linah Kilimo by less than 1,000 votes. “I’m hopeful the petition will be determined in my favour because the polls were free and fair,” Bowen said after the hearings. Mbito’s win was challenged by former Senator Henry Ndiema. Ndiema said Mbito rigged the election.
