Kericho county and the World Bank have partnered to build decent houses in the Swahili and Talai slums. Streetlights will also be erected under the Informal Settlements Improvement Programme. Governor Paul Chepkwony said the project will cost Sh494 million and will be completed in May. He spoke when he met representative of the World Bank and Ministry of Planning and Housing last week. “Swahili Village and Talai have been marginalised for a long time and with the coming of the support [the residents] are, no doubt, a happy lot,” Chepkwony said. Some Sh456 million will go towards building the houses, while the rest will be spent on street lighting. Chepkwony thanked the World Bank and the national government for initiating the programme. KISIP national coordinator Peris Mang’ira praised the cooperation received from the national and county governments. She said the World Bank will continue to partner with the counties to improve living standards.
