The
government has finally complied with a court order on reopening TV stations that were shut over Nasa leader Raila Oidnga's swearing-in. The
move on Monday came just hours after activist Okiya Omtata filed contempt of court proceedings
against Interior CS Fred Matiang’i, his ICT counterpart Joe Mucheru and the Communication Authority board.

Citizen TV's transmission had not been restored by press time and the reason wasn't immediately clear. Several local and international leaders had condemned the shutdown, citing the people's right of access to information. But the government continued ignoring a court order issued on Thursday last week for the shutdown to be suspended. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i insisted investigations needed to be completed as the coalition allegedly planned a massacre during the inauguration. He claimed some media houses were aware. Earlier on Monday, human rights activists held protests on the streets of Nairobi to protest media muzzling and what they said was a return to dictatorship. They were dispersed by anti-riot police who hurled tear gas canisters at them.
