The High Court in Kiambu has been informed that police have arrested two more suspects in connection to the torture-murder of Susan Njambi, the wife of former Riruta MCA Samuel Ndung’u (pictured). Ndung’u was charged with killing the wife. Hearing of the case was to commence yesterday and three witnesses, said to be vulnerable, were to testify. The prosecution cited possible interference by the accused if released on bond. Kiambu DCI officer Paul Wambugu applied for seven more days to interrogate the two suspects conduct investigations on two suspects. “We need more time so we can apprehend the rest of the culprits who are still at large,” Wambugu told Justice Joel Ngugi. Ngugi rescheduled the hearing for Thursday.
