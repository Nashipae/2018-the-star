NEMA has ordered for immediate closure of the popular Burma Market after what it termed as “high level of violation of the plastic ban”. The Environmental Authority said on Thursday that inspection done by its officials found that traders in the market continued to use plastic carriers despite a legal notice of their ban. "The authority is concerned that the offences are taking place in presence of your (county) staff despite your letter of cooperation," Nema director general Geoffrey Wahungu said in a statement.

The letter dated February 22 was copied to the Principal secretary in the ministry of environment, the superintendent in-charge of Burma market, Nairobi county commissioner, all county commanders and the county environment director. On February 9, ten traders in the market were arrested and charged with violating the Legal notice. A ban on plastic carrier bags came into force in August last year. But manufacturers of the bags opposed the ban saying it will lead to loss of 80,000 jobs.  Also read: High Court upholds plastic bags ban  Click here for the latest political news
