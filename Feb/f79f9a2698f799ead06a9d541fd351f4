Meru county has announced plans to arrest people smoking in public. Health executive Eunice Kobia yesterday said the move is part of the county's resolve to regulate tobacco use. "At least one in every five men use tobacco. It is sad that smoking is part of the lifestyle of most of our youths," Kobia said. She said smokers had ignored designated zones and were enjoying their puffs in public places including matatus, social gatherings and enclosed markets. Meru county is one of the four counties that grow tobacco alongside Bungoma, Migori and Busia. "Residents are not aware of the effects of tobacco," Kobia said when she flagged off a lorry with a public address system to campaign against tobacco use in Meru town. She said the county will rehabilitate cigarette smokers. "They should not fear coming forward. We will help them to change," she said. Kobia urged farmers to abandon tobacco and adopt other crops like green grams. Kenya Tobacco Control Board director Mary Muthoni praised Meru for its awareness campaign against tobacco use. Muthoni urged the county to allocate more funds to fight tobacco use. She also urged for the creation of youth friendly centres to encourage people to seek rehabilitation. "They should rehabilitate more people because we want our youth to actively participate in building the nation and not wasting their time smoking," Muthoni said. She said her board will train more officers to effect the total ban on tobacco advertisement and promotion.
