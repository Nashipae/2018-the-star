Fishermen from Homa Bay say they are harassed by Ugandan authorities who force them to eat raw fish for allegedly trespassing on Lake Victoria. They said they are arrested and forced to pay heavy penalties to gaintheir release. Speaking to journalists at Sindo trading centre in Suba South constituency on Wednesday, fishermen Enock Otieno and Samuel Magube said they are suffering at the hands of the security officials. “They force us to feed on raw fish as punishment when they find us in the lake,” Otieno said.  Forgotten by the state He said fishermen are being impoverished because of the punitive penalties. “Nowadays, they arrest fishermen and confiscate boats and fishing gear, regardless of the lake boundary. You are only freed after giving them Sh100, 000,” Otieno said. Magube said the officials have restricted their fishing in Kiwa, Remba Island and Mfang’ano. “They demand between Sh40,000 and Sh80,000 if they find you in the lake as early as 3am,” he said. The fishermen called on the Homa Bay county government to engage the national government to protect them against ill treatment. Fishermen said the national government has neglected them. “Fishing is our only source of livelihood. We ask our government to save us from the cruelty we suffer,” Magube said. Homa Bay County Beach Management Unit chairman Edward Oremo said some fishermen are contemplating quitting the trade because of constant harassment. “The fishermen are Kenyans. We want the State to act swiftly since we pay taxes,” Oremo said. Fishermen say they have been detained several times by Ugandan police for allegedly fishing in foreign waters. The row between Kenyan fishermen and Ugandan security officials has triggered accusations against the Jubilee government of laxity in protecting its territory. In December last year, 17 Kenyan fishermen were arrested in Lake Victoria and detained on Ugandan islands by security personnel. The fishermen, who were in six boats, were taken to two different islands.
