Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has told the police to arrest Somali pastoralists invading farms and homes in Mutha ward or she will tell owners to defend themselves using arms. “Enough is enough. It is time we sorted out this menace once and for all. I speak without fear. We shall deal firmly with this problem of insecurity and Somali invasions,” she said on Thursday at Mutha trading centre. Security chiefs, Assembly Majority leader Peter Kilonzo, Mutha MCA Anthony John and Environment and Natural Resources executive John Makau were present. Ngilu said the Constitution gives citizens the right to protect their lives and property. Herders’ livestock has destroyed crops. Ngilu faulted the police for ‘allowing’ pastoralists to invade Kitui, yet local herders do not intrude into other counties. Stray camels “Why do they then invade and attack us? Do they think we cannot defend ourselves?” she posed. Ngilu said it is wrong for the police to force farmers whose land has been encroached on by herders to be forced to look after the stray camels and pay for any loss or injury to the animals. She said the invasion by herders and charcoal traders is making residents poor. Ngilu also said the indiscriminate cutting of trees for charcoal use and trade has damaged the environment. Within county She urged residents to plant trees and find alternative methods to earn a living and refrain from charcoal burning. Ngilu said her government will only allow charcoal production for trade and consumption within the county. Charcoal production and sand harvesting was banned in Kitui. The Charcoal Production Network said the ban was unfair.
