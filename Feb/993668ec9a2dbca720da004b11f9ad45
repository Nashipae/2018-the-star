The construction of Accra Ngara Link road by Kura will not affect Nyayo Market traders. Kura's director engineer Silas Kinoti and Starehe Mp Charles Njagua had consultative talks with the traders on Friday. Kinoti said that the construction of the road had been delayed because of the traders who has occupied the road. Njagua urged the traders to cooperate with Kura and said they will receive a notification on the date construction will commence. Speaking to the Star on Friday, Nyayo market traders chairman, Francis Kiboro said it was suggested traders located near the road should move a few metres to allow construction to go on. They agreed that the wall which was erected to be pulled down instead of demolishing the whole market. KiboroÂ said the land was allocated to them by former Starehe Mp Charles Rubia and former Nairobi Provincial Commissioner Fred Waiganjo in 1983. There have been cases of grabbers who have attempted to snatch the land from them. The traders called on Njagua to construct stalls for them once the road is completed. The Accra Ngara Link Road is suppose to start from Ngara passing through Nyayo market and linking to Accra Road in the city center.
