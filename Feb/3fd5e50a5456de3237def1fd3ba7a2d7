Kenya power has posted a 30.3 per cent drop in its net profit to Sh2.97 billion compared to sh4.2 billion recorded during the same period in 2016. In a notice to the press, the power distributor attributed the fall in profits to the general slowdown of the economy and an increase in financing cost. Electricity sales grew by 2.3 per cent from 3,805 gigawatts in 2016 to 3,893 gigawatts as at December 31,2017.This saw its sales revenue move up to Sh46.93 billion from Sh45.79 billion in 2016. Its total operating expenditure went up by 17.37 per cent having spent Sh8.78 billion more last year than the Sh50.54 billion spent in 2016. This increase saw transmission and distribution cost also rise by 5 per cent from Sh15.1 billion to Sh15.82 billion. The drop in profits comes at a time when Kenyans are complaining of exorbitant power prices as they currently pay Sh4.51 per unit of electricity consumed, up from Sh4.30 in January. This is as a result of increased usage of thermal generation due to a decline in power generation from the cheap hydro sources. The units generated from thermal plants increased by 47 per cent to 1301 gigawatts hence raising the cost of fuel by 97.4 per to Sh12.29 billion.  MORE DISTRIBUTORS If approved in its current form, a new bill presented in Parliament last week will see the cost of power reduce due to an increase number of distributors. The bill seeks to end Kenya Power's monopoly in electricity distribution and sales in the country. It will see other distributors and retailers licensed hence promising homes and businesses a choice and better quality of service. To see increased revenue growth, the power distributor is now banking on commercial and industrial customers through the recently introduced Time of User tariff. “We are seeking to leverage on the need to spur a 24 hour economy that will increase revenue from electricity sales,” Kenya Power managing director Kenneth Tarus said.  METER MAPPING Other than the Time of User tariff which seeks to increase production during off peak hours, Tarus said the newly adopted feeder-based approach which involves mapping and grouping of power meters will help enhance service delivery. “Once mapped out, the meters will be assigned to feeder clusters for maintenance, connectivity and customer care operations,” he added. The company did not recommend payment of interim dividend for the period.
