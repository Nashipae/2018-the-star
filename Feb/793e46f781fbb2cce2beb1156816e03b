Garissa Water and Sewerage Company has given a 14-day ultimatum to all non-registered consumers and those with illegal water connections to register or be arrested. Speaking when he officially opened 4 zonal offices in Bula Iftin, Waberi, Galbet and Township yesterday, Water executive Issa Dubow also warned those siphoning water from the service lines using pumps to immediately remove them. The company last week claimed to be losing more than Sh18 million monthly due to illegal connections. Dubow also warned staff colluding with customers whose water had been disconnected due to unpaid bills and reconnecting after being bribed. “The company cannot survive without revenue. I am calling on our customers to pay their bills. All our customers have been receiving steady water supply for the past two months. They is no excuse not to pay for the water they are consuming,” he said. Accompanied by local leaders including MCAs from the four wards, he said the main reason of opening the offices was to ease congestion at the Head Office. “The management is using most of their time solving problems meant for technical staff instead of idealing with the policy issues and ways to improve critical services,” the executive said. GWSC director Yussuf Mohamed said tampering with water metres, staff colluding with customers to evade paying their bills, unbilled connections and vandalism in the past four years are some of the challenges the company is addressing to boost revenue collection. “This is an issue we are following very closely. Any staff found guilty will be dealt with accordingly,” he said.
