The US government has officially shut down for the second time this year because Congress failed to meet a deadline to vote on a new budget. Senators, however, debated all night, and may still agree the bill sometime before the working day starts. The 600-page plan proposes an increase in spending, by about $300bn (Â£215bn), on defence and domestic services. But lawmakers struggled to overcome last-minute objections from Republican Senator Rand Paul. Federal funding expired at midnight (05:00 GMT). Talks are continuing, with the hope that the shutdown can be rescinded before work begins Friday. The shutdown was essentially guaranteed an hour before the deadline, when the Senate voted for a recess until 00:01. Despite the delays, the Senate is due to vote on the budgetary measure after 01:00. The House will not vote on the deal until the Senate approves it. It is not yet clear how Congress will proceed and how public services may be affected on Friday. The federal Office of Personnel Management said government operations would "vary by agency" and employees should "refer to their home agency for guidance on reporting for duty". CNN is reporting that if the shutdown is not averted, government agencies will still be able to call their employees in for a half day's work to make the shutdown go smoothly. While the spending bill's funding for the Pentagon has delighted the national security wing of the party, fiscal conservatives are up in arms about ramifications for the nation's debt. In a doom-laden speech, Senator Paul angrily charged his fellow Republicans with fiscal profligacy. "I ran for office because I was very critical of President Obama's trillion-dollar deficits," he said.
