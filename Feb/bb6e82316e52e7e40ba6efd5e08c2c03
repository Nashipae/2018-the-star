USAID yesterday donated 26 vehicles to the Kenya Wildlife Service to help in the war on poaching. “I know the challenges facing KWS and it is my responsibility and that of the board members to address them. I’m proud of the work KWS is doing and I will do everything to support their work,” Tourism CS Najib Balala said. The KWS budget was trimmed, but Balala said the country has to invest in safeguarding its heritage. Poaching of iconic species has reduced by more than 80 per cent, a momentum that must be maintained. “The biggest challenge had been poaching, but the numbers have reduced as nine rhinos and 60 elephants were killed last year. This has never happened before,” he said. Shrinking wildlife habitat s the elephant in the room that needs to be addressed. “There has to be a balance between conservation and development.” Earlier, KWS Board of Trustees Chairman Richard Leakey denied KWS was broke, but said it is facing financial problems. “My request to the new CS is to impress upon the government to allocate more resources to KWS to meet its wide mandate in the expensive wildlife conservation field where self-generated revenue is simply not enough to meet operation costs and staff welfare,” he said. US Ambassador Robert Godec said if corruption is not dealt with, wildlife could soon be wiped out. “Corruption has been a cancer that needs to be addressed as it undermines service delivery and the future,” he said.
