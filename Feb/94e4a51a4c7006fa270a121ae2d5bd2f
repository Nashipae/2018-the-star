Lands CS Faridah Karoney has said she owns the disputed 16-acre parcel in Nandi county. Riot police on Friday lobbed tear gas canisters at villagers who had blocked its survey and fencing following court orders. Karoney said in court papers she legally bought the land from a seller who produced a genuine land title deed. “I followed due procedure to acquire the land and all evidence is available,” she said. Thirty police officers were deployed to the land to chase away villagers and ensure the court order is implemented. The area was calm yesterday, but some policemen were still guarding the land in Sironoi village. The family of former area MCA Amos Korir claims to own part of the land. Lived for 50 years rveyors ferried on a lorry quickly fenced off the land. “We have orders to ensure the court order is implemented and that is why we are here,” Mosorot OCS Nelson Pera, who led the deployed officers, said. The land row emerged hours after Karoney was sworn-in to office on Friday. A court in Kapsabet had issued orders for the land to be surveyed and fenced, but the family of Korir resisted the move. Villagers opposed the survey, saying the dispute must be sorted out in court first. Karoney has produced documents indicating she bought the land from Linus Kogo last year. The farm was originally owned by the late Maria Chelagat who had allegedly sold part of it to Korir’s family in 1968. Korir’s family said it has lived on the land for more than 50 years without any dispute. “Karoney may have been duped onto buying it without getting proper facts,” Korir said. Karoney sued brothers Amos, Barnabas and William Korir seeking to take over the land. Senior resident magistrate Kesse Cherono issued orders for the survey of the land. The Korir family argued the orders did not include fencing the land. Click here for the latest political news
