A student at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University has been stabbed to death after a DJ competition at Dala-wa club turned chaotic. The third-year student, Steve Owino Otombo was pronounced dead on arrival at Bondo Sub County hospital. Bondo deputy county commissioner Richard Ojwang said the competition turned chaotic when the losing party felt aggrieved. Ojwang said the group walked out in protest and immediately started throwing stones at the winning team who also retaliated. The commissioner said the 2 pm incident turned ugly when a physical fight among students and residents erupted leading to the death of Otombo. Otombo was stabbed in the chest by the yet to be established culprit who is still at large. Angry students went on a rampage later in the evening protesting the killing. They set ablaze the bar paralyzing operations and disrupting business. Tension remains high at the university as the police are still engaging in running battles with the students. The police have been forced to lobby tear gas canisters in the air and gunshots all over the institution. In 2015, a 23-year-old student at the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology in Nyeri county was also stabbed to death following a dispute over a beer bottle. Denis Kiplangat succumbed to injuries when he was stabbed in the shoulder, neck and head repeatedly by Kevin Kibet, 24 after the two returned to their rooms from a drinking spree.
