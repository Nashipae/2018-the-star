Homeboyz women’s rugby team bagged their second title in a row after beating Impala Saracens 19-7 in the Kenya Rugby Union women’s festival on Sunday at KCB Sports Club. Janet Owino scored and converted Homeboyz’ first try for a 7-0 lead, which they took into the breather. Linet Moraa struck a second half brace with Owino managing a solitary conversion to give Homeboyz a healthy 19-0 lead. Judith Auma then crossed the white-wash for a late consolation try for Impala. Her efforts were, however, too little, too late as Homeboyz followed up on the victory at the opening round at USIU a fortnight ago with another cup title victory. The deejays finished second in Pool ‘A’ preliminaries, behind the Northern Suburbs after bagging two wins and a loss to set up a semifinal date with Pool ‘B’ winners Mwamba. They then sealed the match 17-0 to set up a final date with Impala, who edged out hosts Northern Suburbs 7-0 in the other semifinal. Mwamba, beaten finalists at USIU, finished third at Ruaraka with a 14-5 victory over Northern Suburbs 14-5 as Comras beat Kenyatta University Ladies 26-0 in the fifth place ranking final. Top Fry Nakuru registered a similar 26-0 score over Shamas to finish seventh overall. Elsewhere, Quins II and Kisii RFC II bagged wins in the Eric Shirley Shield matches over the weekend. Quins II defeated Blak Blad 17-3 to climb to fourth in the standings. The Ngong Road outfit leapfrogged Kabras to fifth with 28. Blad Blad is 10th with eight points. David Ahawo crossed the line twice with Dennis Otieno scoring one try as Kevin Njugi added one conversion. Quins II take on Kisii II and Nondies II in their remaining fixtures as Blad II head to Mwamba II and host Kabras II. Homeboyz II lead the standings with 42 point, a point ahead of KCB II on 41 points with champions Impala II third on 34 points.
