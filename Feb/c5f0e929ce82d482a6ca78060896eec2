Hawkers and boda boda riders have been engaging police and county askaris in sporadic skirmishes. This follows a crackdown aimed at clearing out vendors and restoring order in the city streets. The county resolved to drive hawkers and boda boda operators out of the CBD amid complaints about obstruction, noise and crime. Police were seen dragging a breastfeeding woman to waiting vans before whisking them off to police stations. The vendors say they will stay put. Most sell their wares along Tom Mboya Street, River Road and Kirinyaga Road. Since the crackdown began, more than 1,000 hawkers and boda boda riders have been arrested. “We have to survive. We have families who depend on us,” a hawker, only identified as Ndegwa, said yesterday. Last November, Governor Mike Sonko said hawkers would be moved to Mwaririro Market. This is yet to happen. Central police boss Robinson Thuku said those arrested have been charged with various offenses. They include creating a public nuisance, hawking at unauthorised places, illegal dumping and traffic obstruction. Regional commissioner Kang’ethe Thuku said officers will only leave once the hawkers and boda bodas are off the streets. Sonko has released Sh6.3 million for police meals, allowances and fuel to facilitate the operation.
