Garissa Governor Ali Korane has appealed to the international community to help poor residents to get alternative sources of income so they don’t rely on relief food. He said 90 per cent of residents depend on livestock farming, which has been devastated by persistent droughts. More than 50 villages rely on relief food, which is not sustainable, he said.“Because of varying weather patterns, climate change and environmental degradation, nomadic pastoralism, as a way of life, is disappearing very fast,” Korane said. “We used to have drought every 10 years. Now there is drought every year. This has made it difficult for our people to have livestock-keeping as their source of livelihood.” Garissa is one of the least developed counties and needs international focus, the county chief told envoys in Garissa town on Wednesday. He said that in the absence of alternative income sources, people settle for poverty. Most villages lack water, roads, schools and other facilities. Most residents have moved with their livestock to neighbouring Lamu, Tana River, Isiolo, Wajir, Tharaka Nithi, Kitui and Meru counties because of the current drought, Korane said. Some pastoralists have moved to Somalia, he said. Korane said the presence of refugees is a source of environmental degradation, as the UN agencies responsible have not been giving them alternative sources of energy, forcing them to cut trees. He hosted head of UN mission Siddharth Chatterjee, the British High Commissioner, Swiss, Norwegian and Swedish ambassadors, and county and national government officials, including those from the Frontier Counties’ Development Council. The envoys were on a familiarisation tour to assess gaps in livestock farming, which contributes more than 80 per cent of the county’s economy. They also visited Wajir and Lamu. The envoys expressed satisfaction at the smallholders’ hard work as a classic example of resilience to climate change.
