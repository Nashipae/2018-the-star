Police in Homa Bay are investigating the murder of two men whose bodies were found dumped in Kengamuga, Karachuonyo constituency. County police boss Marius Tum said they suspect Bernard Kimutai Kirui and Dominic Rotich Kipkorir are employees of the Bomet county government. "We found their work identification cards and other documents near them," Tum said on Tuesday. The bodies were wrapped in plastic carrier bags. "They had marks on the wrists and ankles which indicated they were tied before being dumped there," Tum added. The police commander said the two had deposited cash to a bank account for an ongoing case at the court. "The slips indicated the two men might have made some transactions with a bank. We’re investigating what prompted their death since they had their valuable possessions with them," he said. "Since the beginning of this year, we’ve had about four cases related to the murder. We find bodies dump away from places where the incidents occur," he added. The bodies of the two men were taken to Rachuonyo South Sub County Hospital Mortuary for postmortem.
