The High Court in Nyamira yesterday upheld Kitutu Masaba MP Shadrack Mose’s win. Voter Justus Omiti had moved to court to challenge the MP’s victory in the August 8 General Election. Mose garnered 33,386 votes, beating former MP Timothy Bosire, who managed 19,262 votes. The petitioner, through his lawyers Jackson Awelle and Stephen Ligunya, questioned the credibility of the poll. In his ruling, Justice James Makau said there was no sufficient evidence to show the election was marred by irregularities. He said the allegations lacked proof. “The petitioner failed to offer himself for cross-examination to prove his claims,” the judge said. Makau also dismissed claims of failure of transmission of results electronically and false entries. Omiti was ordered to pay Sh2.5 million to the first respondent and a similar amount to the second respondent. Addressing the media after the judgement Mose said he is delighted. “The petitioner is a troublesome man.”
