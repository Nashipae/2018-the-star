Two people narrowly escaped death on Tuesday after Mwingi residents blocked them as they transported charcoal in a Toyota Probox. They escaped but the vehicle went up in flames in what is believed to have been a warning to those in the illegal charcoal trade. Residents denied setting the car on fire saying it burst into flames, attracting people who tried to help. Some said it seemed the occupants had been evading police. The incident came about a month after a lorry ferrying charcoal was burnt by residents of Charity Ngilu's Kitui County. Kitui Environment CEC John Makau and Ngilu's advisor David Mbisi were arrested over the incident and detained at Kitui police station.
