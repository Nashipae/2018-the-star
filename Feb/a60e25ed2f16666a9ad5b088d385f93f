The fire that destroyed Gatitu Primary School in Ol Joro Orok administration block last week on Monday razed the birth certificates of 180 pupils. The schools has a total of 180 pupils. The fire is said to have destroyed property worth Sh2.5 million. Teachers are now using one classroom as their office. The administration block that the head teacher’s office, deputy head teacher’s office, and the staff was destroyed at 9.30 pm last Monday in a suspected arson attack. “We have tried to quantify and we have realised that whatever went up in flame could have been worth Sh2.5 million. The only items that survived the fire were a bell and a hammer,” head teacher Johnson Munene said yesterday. On Monday the school’s 110 parents agreed to contribute Sh500 each to buy books for teachers and other materials, including chalks. They have raised Sh30,000 and books and other teaching materials worth Sh31,000 purchased. A fundraiser will be held on March 24 so they can reconstruct the administration block.
