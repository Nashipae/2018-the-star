Kenyans should expect depressed rainfall in most parts of the country, especially the eastern region, during the March-May long rains season. The Meteorological Department said this on Monday, noting traditional rainfall start dates have completely changed. Department head Peter Ambenje said most parts of Kenya will receive the rains beginning the fourth week of March. "We are having unpredictable weather so farmers shoud take official weather forecasts more seriously rather than relying on traditional knowledge." Traditionally, farmers plant from March 15. Ambenje said most parts of Western, Central Rift Valley and parts of Central Kenya and Nairobi will receive adequate rains. Northeastern will be last to receive it in the first two weeks of April. "The configuration in the Indian Ocean is currently not favourable for good seasonal rainfall in the country, especially over the eastern sector," the official explained. Eastern region comprises Embu, Tharaka-Nithi, Meru, Isiolo, and eastern parts of Marsabit county. He issued the remarks when he presented the three-month forecast at a meeting that all regional meteorological officers attended. Ayub Shaka, a senior assistant director at the department, said they now give the seasonal forecast at least one month before rains begin to help in planning. The forecast shows food basket counties are likely to receive near-normal rainfall which might improve as time goes. "This means although the rest of the country will have less than average rainfall, there is likely to be enough food." Click here for the latest political news
