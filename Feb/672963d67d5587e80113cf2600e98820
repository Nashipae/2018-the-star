Makadara MP George Aladwa has been arrested amid the government's heightened efforts to suppress NRM. He was apprehended at his Buruburu home in Nairobi on Friday night and reportedly taken to the DCI headquarters for grilling. The government has been taking action against Nasa following Raila's self-inauguration as the people's president on January 30. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i claims the opposition coalition had planned a massacre on that day and that some media houses were aware. Aladwa said he did not know what he was arrested for. This comes after lawyer Miguna Miguna was forced to spend another night in police cells despite a court order for his release. Miguna was arrested on Friday morning after police raided his Runda house. He administered Raila's oath at Uhuru Park alongside Ruaraka MP TJ Kajwang and Siaya senator James Orengo. Miguna, who stamped the document, is the self-declared 'general' of the outlawed National Resistance Movement. The controversial lawyer had earlier reported that an "assassination squad" went to find him at his home.
