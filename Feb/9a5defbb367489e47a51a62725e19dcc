Kiambu county is prone to an increase of communicable diseases such as cholera, typhoid, dysentery and bilharzia due to shortage of water. This is because residents can no longer access safe and clean drinking water. Counsellor Gladys Chania on Wednesday said logging, population pressure caused by poor planning, and increased demand for resources has put pressure on Kenyaâ€™s largest water towers. Resident Catherine Wanjiru said she recycles water used to clean clothes and utensils because a 20-litre jerrycan costs Sh50-100. Landlords also release raw sewage into the drainage, she said. Wanjirucalled on residents to observe proper hygiene and asked the government to help.
