You are more likely to survive cancer if you live in urban areas than in the countryside, a major review of studies on the topic shows. The review shows cancer survival rates vary geographically within and between countries, but generally people in rural areas die faster. Sharon Mokua, a researcher at the Kenya Medical Research Institute, said the trend is uniform across developing countries such as Kenya and the developed countries. “Rural cancer patients are at a higher risk of earlier death compared to urban patients. In some cases, the disparity between rural areas is narrowing down, while, in other areas, the gap is widening,” she said. Mokua reviewed a total of 3,784 studies from across the world and narrowed down on 23 that helped her arrive at the conclusion. She attributed the differing outcomes to distance and transportation to health facilities, inadequate healthcare financing and coverage. “Others are poor access and availability of essential services, lack of health workers and poor infrastructure, low education and literacy levels, rural environmental factors and referral delays,” she said. Mokua presented her findings at the 8th Kemri Annual Scientific Conference in Nairobi. She said although the findings apply to Kenya as well, she experienced difficulties finding Kenya-specific data to support the findings because the country does not have a proper cancer registry. “For countries like Kenya, we recommend that the country should invest in developing a resilient population, disease registries and other vital information on its population,” she said She advised policymakers to come up with specific strategies and policies to ensure universal health coverage includes management of non-communicable diseases. About 40,000 Kenyans are diagnosed with cancer annually, and the disease kills about 15,000 people every year, according to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. Last year, cancer survivors complained the Sh700 million budget is inadequate and would only treat 2,000 patients. Local cancer control activists also complained the government had failed to fund the National Cancer Institute.
