Half a million condoms will be distributed to mark International Condoms Day in Embu after 1,231 new infections were reported. The National Aids Control Council said the new infections occurred among those with more than one sex partner. The council said the victims either failed to use condoms or used them improperly. NACC regional coordinator for Meru, Embu and Tharaka Nithi counties Marion Massawe said they will distribute free condoms in the region and create awareness on the importance of using protection to prevent the spread of HIV-Aids. They will give the condoms on February 13, when the International Condoms Day is celebrated. The event will take place at the Talent Academy in Embu Town. Massawe told the Star that 42 per cent of women and 50 per cent of men in Embu had reported having two or more sexual partners. They confessed to not using protection during their last sexual intercourse. “Consistency and proper use of condoms can reduce the risk of HIV-Aids and other sexually transmitted infections by more than 90 per cent,” Massawe said. An estimated 11,141 Embu residents are living with HIV-Aids, according to statistics at the council.
