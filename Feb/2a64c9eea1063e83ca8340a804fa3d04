A report presented by Governor Stephen Sang on Sh1.3 billion debts incurred by the Nandi county government has been rejected by the MCAs. The county assembly says the audit report done by a task force appointed by Sang is defective. It has loopholes which make it incomplete to be debated by MCAs. Speaker Joshua Kiptoo said they ordered a fresh audit by experts. The report by the task force shows the team was not qualified to do the work. “The report does not have the input from parties like the contractors who are demanding to be paid millions of shillings by the county government,” Kiptoo said. On Saturday external auditors will conduct a fresh audit. Sang released the audit on expenditures by former Governor Cleophas Lagat’s administration, showing attempts by contractors to fleece the county of more than Sh670 million in fictitious claims. In the report, which was forwarded to the county assembly by the governor, the contractors are demanding payment for 656 projects undertaken between 2013-17. “Most of the claims are fictitious and the county cannot pay for such using public money,” Sang said. By the time he took over the county had Sh759 million in its accounts, which could not pay the debt. The construction of the governor’s office and Kipchoge Keino Stadium are some of the county’s pending projects. A Sh103 million cost for a two-storey building was recommended, but an additional floor was later approved at a cost of Sh21 million. The county has, however, paid a Sh300 million debt owed to the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency. Click here for the latest political news
