Kenya Sevens will embark on a 15-day training camp in Nanyuki next month ahead of the Commonwealth Games slated for April in Gold Coast. Head coach Innocent Simiyu said the Nanyuki offers similar conditions to the ones they expect in Gold Coast in April. “It will be good for us to go to Nanyuki and get away from the hustle and bustle of city as this will get the players in the right frame of mind for the games,” added Simiyu. The Club Games will be tough test for all competing teams with the prestigious Hong Kong Sevens coming a week before the rugby programme starts. “There are challenges but we have no option but to finish the tournament in Hong Kong before we fly to Gold Coast. This is why our recovery protocols, strength and conditioning must be good and I think the boys will be in position to be competitive,” he added . Simiyu said those selected for the Hong Kong leg are the same players who will don Kenya jerseys in Gold Coast, owing to the short turn-around time. Kenya face powerhouse New Zealand, Canada and Zambia in Pool ‘C’ and Simiyu is confident that the country stands a good chance of finishing in the medal bracket during the Club Games for the first time. “Our current form is good and can match the top teams on the circuit. We believe we can be in the medal bracket with the players at our disposal,” he added. Simiyu, however, expects a tough test from the teams in the pool. “Zambia are an upcoming team, Canada and us have had some close contests and New Zealand, the silver medallists from the last games are the team to beat. So we must we be well prepared for the three teams with only one team going through to the semi-finals” added Simiyu. Kenya best performance at the Commonwealth Games came in 2010 in New Delhi, India, when they beat Samoa 12-10, Papua New Guinea 17-12, and Malaysia 40-0 to romp to the quarters. Kenya were, however, knocked out in the by Australia 27-5 in the quarters.
