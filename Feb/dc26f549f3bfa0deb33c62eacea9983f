There is an increase in the numbers of donkeys suffering from rectal prolapse in Lamu, a lobby has said. It is a painful condition where one or more layers of a donkey’s rectum protrudes through the anus, making it difficult for the animal to pass waste. Donkey Sanctuary Lamu is concerned about the welfare of the animals . Speaking in his office yesterday, a veterinary officer at the sanctuary, Felix Rachuonyo, said the condition is caused by parasites, malnutrition and overloading. Donkeys are the major mode of transport in Lamu town, because of its narrowness streets. Nearly every household has a donkey in Lamu owns a donkey. The Donkey Sanctuary was established to cater for the welfare of donkeys. It treats sicks animals for free. Rachuonyo said the sanctuary admits more than four donkeys with rectal prolapse daily. He said this is unusual and alarming. He said many donkey handlers overload the beast of burden. Rachuonyo warned the condition weakens donkeys and makes it difficult for the animals to function well. “Donkeys should carry the recommended weight, be dewormed and fed properly,” Rachuonyo said.
