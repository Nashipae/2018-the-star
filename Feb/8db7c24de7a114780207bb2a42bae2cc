Teachers in Wajir County have threatened to shutdown all learning institutions as only a few of them are left. They issued the threat on Saturday, noting the few available teachers cannot meet the demand. Close to 200 non-local teachers have left the county due to security concerns following al Shabaab's attack on Qarsa Primary School.

Area Secretary Nur Bardat told the press that the situation was worse than they thought. He lashed out at the Teachers Service Commission for transferring teachers from the region to their home counties, and accused it of inciting them. “We were very considerate, having sat with TSC and facilitating the transfer of 54 non-local teachers from areas along the border seen as unsafe. "What more could we have done? We are already discriminated against through injustice. We have no proper roads and hospitals ... let them not try this ... we want the head of state to intervene." Abdi Aden, the area's union chair, blamed the commission for all the woes in the sector, claiming teachers transferred from schools in the town had been comfortable. Mohamed Abdi, whose Governor election has been nullified, urged locals to work with government to improve teachers' security. “It's unfortunate to see something planned by one or two people affect the whole county. It's disheartening to see our schools being closed,” he said. He addressed residents during a public participation forum on the integrated county development plan. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i is expected to tour the county on Tuesday to address security concerns.
