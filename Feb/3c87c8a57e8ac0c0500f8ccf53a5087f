Migori tobacco farmers have been urged not to sell their produce to Mastermind Tobacco until it clears the Sh100 million it owes them. Agriculture CEC member Valentine Ogongo yesterday said they have received complaints from farmers about outstanding payments. He said the firm has not committed to paying the debt. Ogongo said the debt includes prices and bonuses. “We’ve tried to have a meeting with the firm, to no avail. We encourage farmers not to sell their produce to the firm,” he told reporters in his Migori town office. Ogongo spoke after meeting representatives of BAT Kenya and Estobuc Tobacco. Mastermind Tobacco skipped the meeting and sent apologies. Migori produces more than 70 per cent of the national yield. BAT Kenya and Estobuc Tobacco agreed to review their grading of leaves after farmers complained they also lose Sh30 per kilogramme over variation of grades. “Estobuc Tobacco agreed to start paying farmers all their dues this week. BAT has been paying farmers three days after delivery — which is commendable,” Ogongo said.
