The weatherman in Lamu has warned against using some routes and channels because of high tide in the Indian Ocean. The county director for Meteorological Services David Mwaruma said Lamu has been experiencing strong winds that have been contributing to the high tide since last month. Speaking in his office on Friday, Mwaruma said the situation will continue until the end of April when the ocean is expected to be calmer. Residents have been cautioned to be careful in the Mkanda, Manda Bruno and Mlango wa Tanu channels. They are also the most frequently used by travelers and fishermen, but they are dangerous . Many people have lost their lives. Mwaruma urged fishermen and travelers to desist from venturing into the sea very early in the mornings when the tide is very extremely high and dangerous. The weatherman also warned boat operators against using the channels when the tide is high at 4am in the mornings and at 3pm in the afternoon. He urged everyone to take precautions and keep safe.
