Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn has resigned unexpectedly, saying he hoped to end years of unrest and political upheaval. In a televised address, he said his resignation was "vital in the bid to carry out reforms that would lead to sustainable peace and democracy". Hailemariam, who has led the country since 2012, also stepped down as chairman of the ruling coalition. Hundreds of people have died in three years of anti-government protests.

Most of the unrest has centred on Ethiopia's two largest regions, Oromia and Amhara. A 10-month national state of emergency ended last year. "Unrest and a political crisis have led to the loss of lives and displacement of many," Mr Hailemariam said. "I see my resignation as vital in the bid to carry out reforms that would lead to sustainable peace and democracy." Since coming to power, Mr Hailemariam has been seen by the political elite as weak and lacking in leadership. His resignation could be a move by the coalition to find a stronger leader, or it could signal divisions among the constituent parties along ethnic lines.

Replacing Mr Hailemariam might also be one way to meet the demands of Oromo protesters who have accused the authorities of marginalisation. The coalition has repeatedly promised reforms over the past three years. Two of its member parties have already changed their leaders while the remaining two are expected to follow suit.
