Police in Kiambu are hunting for a man believed to have killed his 76-year-old employer at her home in Kongothiria village, Kirenga, on Monday. Lari police boss Isaiah Odhiambo said the store, where the body was found, was in disarray, indicating Rachel Wanjiku had put up a fight. “The killer overpowered the old woman. He pulled her to the floor while covering her face and mouth so she could not scream before placing a nylon cord around her neck and pulling it until she died,” he said. Before she was killed Wanjiku had taken her workers, Nancy Wangu and Phillip Njenga, to her farm, assigned them duties and left for home. Wangu said Njenga cut nappier grass and took it to the homestead to feed the cows. “I was digging while Njenga was feeding the cows. He took one trip with nappier grass to the home and came back. He told me he had come for another trip, and he cut the grass and left with it. He never came back. It was about 11am,” she said. Wangu finished her work at 1pm and went home, where all was quiet. “I called Njenga several times but [he did not] answer. Then I called Wanjiku many times and [she did not] answer,” she said. The doors to the main house and the kitchen, where the store is located, were unlocked. So Wangu went into the store to put away her jembe, and that’s when she found Wanjiku’s body. Odhiambo said they have launched a manhunt for Njenga for questioning. “We are following close leads that will help us arrest him very soon,” he said. Lari Krenga MCA Joseph Karichu condoled with the family. “She was generous, strong and full of wisdom. Let us pray for the family since they have lost a worthy person,” he said.
