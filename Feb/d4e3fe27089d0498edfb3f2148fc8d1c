The Bungoma government is holding a series of meetings in the county to get residents views and feedback about devolution. The meetings started on Monday and will run up to Friday March 2. They will be held across the county’s 10 subcounties. Public Administration executive Richard Sabwami said, “The devolution dialogues across the county is being spearheaded by CECs, chief officers and MCAs. We want to get feedback on whether residents understand what devolution is all about.” They are targetting five key areas this year – urban planning, agriculture, business, health and roads. “We want to see the strength and challenges of devolution. We also want to know what people feel about it and what needs to be changed to spur growth,” Sabwami said. They need proper information that will help steer the county forward. “On Friday, Governor Wycliffe Wangamati will be the guest of honour at the Kenya Industrial Estates hall to listen to opinions from residents,” Sabwami said. “ We hope to meet many residents because it will be an open session”
