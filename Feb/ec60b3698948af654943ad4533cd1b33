Starring: Cress Williams, China Anne McClain, Nafessa Williams, Christine Adams, Marvin “Krondon” Jones III, Damon Gupton, James Remar GENRE: Superhero/Drama BASED ON: Black Lightning, by Tony Isabella and Trevor Von Eeden PREMIERE DATE:  January 16  F inally! It looks like the dawn of the black superhero era is here. Black superhero shows and films include the charismatic Luke Cage and the anxiously awaited Black Panther. The newest addition to the black superhero community is the one and only Black Lightning. Black Lightning retired from his superhero persona nine years ago after seeing the effects it had on his family. He lives a simple life as high school principal Jefferson Pierce. Jefferson works hard to keep his students on a straight path, despite living in a crime-infested town. The town’s residents are terrorised by a local gang who call themselves The 100. When Jefferson’s daughters Jennifer and Anissa are taken captive by members of The 100, Jefferson is forced to come out of his superhero retirement to save his daughters. Jefferson soon realises that the it’s not just his daughters, but the entire town that is in desperate need of help from Black Lightning. The show creates a parallel between the superhero action world and the increasing racial and social tensions. The show is a wonderfully written story and brilliantly executed. In a television world filled with mainly white superheroes, it a relief to have a black man wearing the suit for once. With a majority cast of black actors, Black Lightning is probably the blackest superhero show of all time.  Star Rating: 4/5
