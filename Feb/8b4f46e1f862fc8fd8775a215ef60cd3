A votes recount has found Babu Owino won the Embakasi East parliamentary race. A report showed on Monday that Owino got 46,817 votes against the 42,501 his closest competitor Francis Mureithi garnered. The report, signed by High Court Deputy Registrars Esther Mburu and MbayaKi Wafula, says the scrutiny and recount was a success, except for an incident where one of the deputy registrar’s phones was stolen. “The registrars are positive that the data collected and the report presented before the trial court will be helpful in the determination of the election petition." Parties in the case are expected to file or make their oral submissions on February 28 for a verdict to be delivered on Friday. After the August 8, 2017 general election, Owino was declared winner with 46,587 votes against Mureithi's 42,253. Mureithi challenged the outcome and judge Joseph Sergon ordered the repeat count saying his reasons were sufficient. The judge pointed out that Embakasi East Returning Officer Nicholas Butuk admitted in court that the results he announced did not tally with the ones in Form 35A. He also acknowledged many errors in the forms. The case will come up for judgement on March 2.
