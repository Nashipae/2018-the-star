Yesterday
National Super Alliance supporters went to demonstrate outside the US Embassy
in Gigiri, Nairobi. They were angry that diplomats are 'interfering' in Kenyan
politics. Last
Saturday EU and US diplomats issued a joint statement condemning both the
government and the opposition and calling for dialogue. The
diplomats criticised the government for its heavy-handed crackdown after the
mock swearing-in of Raila Odinga as ‘People’s President’ on January 30. And
they criticised the opposition for not accepting the rule of law by recognising
Uhuru Kenyatta as president after the Supreme Court endorsed the election
re-run on October 26, which Nasa boycotted. The
demonstrators are cherry picking. They are happy with criticism of government
but don't accept criticism of the opposition. Moreover
the opposition have historically welcomed ambassadors like Edward Clay or
William Bellamy who criticised the governments of the day. The
demonstrators are entitled to their opinions, but they should not attack the
diplomats for 'interfering' when sometimes they like their interventions and
sometimes they don't. That is hypocrisy.
