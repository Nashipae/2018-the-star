The body of the mother of a senior Nyandarua county engineer was found hanging from her chicken coop on Monday. Veronica Wangui, 59, was the mother of David Kigoro and the aunt of 21-year-old Mercy Njambi. The two were with her that morning at their home in Rurii, Ol kalou. Nyandarua Central OCPD Wilson Kosgei said Kigoro last saw his mother when he left for work and that at about 7am, Njambi took a child to the road to wait for a school bus. "When she returned she went to give the goats water. It was while passing by the chicken coop that she noticed her aunt's body hanging from the roof. She raised the alarm and called Kigoro," he said. Kosgei said they found Wangui's bed had not been spread when they checked the house. He said this and other signs caused suspicion so the bedroom was also secured as a possible crime scene. “We went to the scene but the information we got was not enough," the OCPD said.  “I have visited very many scenes of suicides ... this one leaves a lot of questions unanswered. This is a puzzle."

Somebody can take advantage of that and commit a crime," he said. "Investigators and a pathologist will answer all questions. I’m not an expert but from the looks of things, someone did something. I cannot call it murder for now because there is a lot we do not know." The police boss added that the body did not have physical injuries and that there wasn't a suicide note. "Police will choose the pathologist," he said, adding Kigoro and Njambi will be questioned as they were with the deceased. Click here for the latest political stories
