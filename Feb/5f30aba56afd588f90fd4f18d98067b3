Meru county has started its free milk programme for all pupils in Early Childhood Development Centres. The Meru Dairy Union won the Sh55 million tender after competing with 17 other milk processing companies in the country. "The factory has the capacity and ability. It is very competitive and was the cheapest supplier at Sh53 million," deputy governor Titus Ntuchiu noted on Monday. "The milk is free and has the county logo so if anyone is found selling it, he or she will be arrested and taken to court." Last year, the Meru assembly approved a Sh80 million budget for supply of milk to more than 5,000 nursery school pupils in the county's public primary schools. Speaking in Meru town when he flagged off several trucks with cartons of the milk, Ntuchiu said supply will be extended to every day and other classes depending on the availability of resources. "We had teething challenges but I am happy we are officially launching it. This was one of governor Kiraitu Murungi's election pledges," he said. "We will fulfill others too." The DG and the union's CEO Kenneth Gitonga urged livestock farmers to rear dairy cattle to improve their earnings and create job opportunities. Ntuchiu further urged the factory to help meet farmers' needs through training programmes that will enable them to rely on themselves. Gitonga said all logistics had been handled and that the company will deliver 15, 000 litres of milk per day. The chief executive noted the plant processes 220,000 litres per day, which is enough to serve all nursery and primary school children as well as other customers. He expressed optimism that neighbouring counties will follow suit and help improve enrolment in schools. "Only five counties have rolled out such a programme. I wish Isiolo, Tharaka-Nithi, Embu and Nyeri also took it up." Education executive Lina Nkirote emphasised quality of the milk that will be supplied on Tuesdays and Thursdays every week.
