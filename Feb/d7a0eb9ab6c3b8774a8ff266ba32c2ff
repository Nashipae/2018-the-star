West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo has defended foreign envoys against opposition claims of meddling in Kenyan politics. This comes after ambassadors of foreign countries working in Kenya asked the opposition to recognise President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto. The ambassadors have roles to play in Kenyan politics and their advice is timely, he said in Sebit yesterday. “They represent the interests of their countries in Kenya and they should be respected,”he said. Lonyangapuo hit out at the opposition, saying the recent swearing in of NASA leader Raila Odinga is illegal. The opposition must respect the Constitution, he said. “The opposition is mixed up and it is doing things that are not right. Raila should   wait until  2022   to vie for presidency,” he said. Lonyangapuo said the economy has deteriorated following the long electioneering period. He told NASA to support the government.
