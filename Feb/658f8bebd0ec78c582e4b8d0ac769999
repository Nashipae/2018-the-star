A Colombian university has faced a backlash after advising female students not to wear miniskirts to avoid "distracting classmates and teachers". Branding the advice sexist, students mounted a campaign to encourage everyone, male and female, to wear short skirts on campus on Thursday. Medell√≠n's Pontifical Bolivarian University, known as UPB, had posted the advice on its website. After an outcry, it said the tips were only meant as general suggestions. "The UPB respects the right to express personalities, and has never imposed a dress code on students," said its statement, adding that the article had been mostly aimed at new students. The original post, now deleted, appeared under a heading, "How should you dress to go to university?". Some of the advice was presented as unisex, but there were plenty of tips directed at women. Dress discreetly, it advised. "There is nothing more uncomfortable than distracting your classmates or teachers. For this reason, we suggest you don't wear low necklines, short skirts or tight-fitting clothes." It was posted on 30 January and spread through students' social media accounts, prompting an online campaign under the hashtag #UPBEnFalda (meaning UPB in miniskirts). On Thursday, students shared pictures of themselves and classmates in shorts and skirts around the university.
