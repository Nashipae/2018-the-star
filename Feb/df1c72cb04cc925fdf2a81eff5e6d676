Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong on Friday said pressure from residents made the county government to tarmac roads which were supposed to be built by the Kenya Urban Roads Authority. He said said the money the county has spent to tarmac urban roads was supposed to be used on devolved functions. Ojaamong spoke to the press after inspecting the tarmacking of Agolot-Ojaamii and Comfort Hotel-Ojaamii roads in Ang'oromo ward. He said his government will, however, continue tarmacking more urban roads so residents can access urban centres with ease. "We shall liaise with the national government to seek financial support to facilitate the tarmacking of more roads in the county," he said. Residents have praised the governor and his administration for changing the face of the county by tarmacking roads. "I'm happy with the work the governor has done on roads," resident Caroline Okoth said. Resident Titus Echakara appealed to the governor to instal security lights along the tarmacked roads.
