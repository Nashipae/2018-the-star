ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru was yesterday accused of undermining Parliament after failing to appear before the Senate ICT Committee to explain the shutdown of local TV stations. The committee wanted Mucheru to explain why NTV, KTN, Citizen and Inooro stations were turned off during and after the swearing-in of NASA leader Raila Odinga as the People’s President. Mucheru wrote a letter to Senate clerk Jeremiah Nyegenye saying he was scheduled to attend a Cabinet meeting and would not be able to appear.  Through PS Henry Mungasia, Mucheru said he is to jet out of the country on Monday next week and return on February 26.

He is asking the committee to postpone the meeting to a later date,” he said. But members, led by Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang’, said they had written to the CS a week ago and he did not excuse himself in advance. “This shows the CS is undermining the oversight role of Parliament. He is in contempt of this Parliament,” Kajwang’ said. The lawmaker said Mucheru should have sent a PS or the Communications Authority director general to address the issues. “Kenyans are eager to know what the government was investigating and who was conducting the investigations during the shutdown. This is a serious issue that can threaten the cohesion and fabric of this nation,” he said.
