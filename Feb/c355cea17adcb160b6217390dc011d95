A Sh50 million renal unit at Lamu's King Fahad county hospital is lying idle following a water shortage at the facility. A renal unit requires adequate and consistent supply of fresh water for it to operate effectively, which Lamu does not have. The county's water is too saline to be used for kidney dialysis. The equipment was installed two months ago but cannot be used until the hospital gets fresh water. David Mulewa, director for Health Services, said the county government has installed a mini desalination plant. This will be used purify saline water for use at the facility. "We are confident that the renal unit will commence operations before the end of next March this year," Mulewa said. Mulewa said Lamu said they have been forced to refer renal patients to other counties like Mombasa and Nairobi due to the water problem. "The unit also lacks trained specialists to operate it. We have, however, sent some of the health workers to be trained on the same," Mulewa added. A selected number of health officers from the county have been to the Kenyatta National Hospital for the basic training on how to operate dialysis machines. "We have three dialysis machines ready to start work. We have a number of machines undergoing checks but generally we are good to go." Health CEC Raphael Munyua said the renal unit will be a step ahead in matters of the county's health once it will be put to good use. "For over 50 years, renal patients have been referred from here to Mombasa and Nairobi." "That means people wonâ€™t have to strain and travel for attention. We will do it right here," Munyua said.
