Four Nyandarua MCAs have lost their seats after a Nyahururu court nullified their nomination on Tuesday. Chief magistrate Judith Wanjala said the nomination of Margaret Ireri, Geofrey Ngaruiya, Esther Muhoho and Joseph Waithira was illegal. The four were nominated by Jubilee Party under the ethnic minority category. Wanjala said the party and the IEBC went against the law and failed to give priority to the youth and people living with disability. "The court finds that the gazettement of the MCAs to represent the marginalised was wrong and does not conform with the law,‚Äù Wanjala said. The nomination of the MCAs was challenged by Solomon Kuria (youth) and Monicah Githae (disabled). They both said they were overlooked in favour of the MCAs. Wanjala said the petitioners were recognised by the Constitution. The magistrate said the MCAs had a right to be considered for nomination. "The problem is the way they were gazetted," Wanjala said. IEBC had told the court that there occurred a mere error during the nominations. "What error is that," Wanjala said as she ordered the commission to come up with a correct list of nominees that represent all recognised categories in the Constitution.
