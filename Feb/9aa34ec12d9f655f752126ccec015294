Investigations into the rape of five girls in Embu College have revealed negligence by the hostel owners in providing security. Embu West police boss Esther Muhoro yesterday said the hostel did not have a watchman and is poorly lit, making students vulnerable to attacks.She urged owners of hostels used by college students to set up efficient security measures. Muhoro said guards, security lights, gates and perimeter walls are vital. She further advised landlords to put in place strict regulations for students living in the hostels, including hosting male visitors at night. The police chief asked landlords to ensure non-students who visit hostels are screened.
