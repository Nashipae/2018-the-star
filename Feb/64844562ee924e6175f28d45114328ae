A meeting between squatters living on the disputed Sir Ramson Farm in Njukini, Taita Taveta, and county leaders nearly aborted after a disagreement arose about the subdivision of the land. The meeting, convened by county commissioner Kula Hache on Friday, Governor Granton Samboja and surveyors sought to formulate a way of settling closeto 10,000 squatters. It took the intervention of Challa MCA Omar Nguzo to calmed down the residents. He said the problem would only be solved if squatters are given a chance to give their opinion. Two weeks ago, a 15-year-old boy was shot dead by police while scores we injured in the same farm after a confrontation between police and residents. The residents were opposed the expansion of a 20km Njukini –Ziwani road that is set to pass through the sprawling farm on claims their crops would be destroyed. The over 2,000-acre farm was donated by the Kenyatta family in January 2016 to settle squatters in Taveta. But squatters have been resisting subdivision, saying they will lose part of their parcels. According to locals, the title deeds were not issued in a free and fair manner because there was no public participation during the start of the settlement process. Kenya Director of Surveyor’s Ceasar Mbaria assured they won’t lose their land. The subdivision only aims at allocating each squatter a permanent plot before title deeds are handed out.
