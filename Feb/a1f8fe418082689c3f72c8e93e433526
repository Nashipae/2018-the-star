The Murang’a government has given farmers 300 free monkey traps to rid their farms of the primates that have been destroying their crops. For years farmers have been complaining that the monkeys have been eating their crops, resulting in no or minimal harvest. The captured monkeys were returned to the Aberdare Forest. “They feast on our maize, vegetables, avocados, mangoes and any other food crop they find. They even get into our houses and steal our food,” Paul Ndung’u said. Farmer Anastasia Muure said women have been living in fear due to constant attacks by the monkeys. They are forced to get men to accompany them when they go out to protect them from monkeys. The drive has generated heated debate and some residents criticise the trapping. Others defend the campaign, saying it will save the county from perennial food shortage. On Monday and Tuesday this week, farmers in Gatanga caught more than 100 monkeys and transported them to the Aberdares. Bitten The primates roam freely in many areas and sometimes harass women and children, especially in Murang’a town. Three years ago, a resident of Murang’a town was hospitalised for days after she was bitten by a monkey as she was walking from Kiharu estate to Murang’a town. Governor Mwangi wa Iria had early in the year pledged to help farmers deal with the monkey menace. “These monkeys have reduced us to beggars, asking for relief food, yet we are hardworking,” Ndung’u said. He said most farmers were tempted not to till their farms because they fear it will be pointless and they will lose their crops. Gatanga subcounty administrator George Murimi said the traps are being distributed in all subcounties where monkeys are feasting. Murimi said the county has been issuing free seeds and manure to farmers and the primates cannot be allowed to continue destroying crops. Residents also accused the Kenya Wildlife Service of failing to control the monkeys and allowing them to continue destroying their farms.
