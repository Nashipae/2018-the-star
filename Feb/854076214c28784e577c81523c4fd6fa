ECDE children based at Kamagambo Primary School, one of the oldest in Migori county, learn under a tree. Last October, wind blew off the roof of the ECDE classroom built in 1912. Since then, the 60 children have been learning under a tree. Head teacher John Owuor on Thursday said, “We wrote several letters to the county government and constituency development kitties and requested for emergency funds to no avail.” Before the incident, there were about 100 children. The walls and roofs of other structures in the school are weak. The block which accommodates close to 200 pupils in standard two, three and four could collapse at any moment. “The block is a disaster; a time bomb. During a storm, students move to other classes for fear of accidents,” Owuor said. He said the situation has been deteriorating. Rongo MP Paul Abuor pledged to build classrooms.
