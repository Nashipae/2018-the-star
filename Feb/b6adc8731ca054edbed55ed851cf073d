Transport was yesterday disrupted on the Garissa-Nairobi road after angry residents from Madogo took to the streets to protest the killing of two watchmen. The two guards, whose identity could not be immediately established, were killed by people who stole a safe from a hardware shop. Residents said one of the victims was beheaded. The other was strangled. Residents barricaded the road, lit bonfires and engaged police in running battles for hours. They said a similar incident happened on the same date in 2014. They demanded answers and set a lorry on fire. Firefighters in two engines were sent in from Garissa town, but failed to put out the blaze. Police fired in the air and lobbed teargas canisters to disperse the surging crowd, which was determined to set the entire hardware shop ablaze. “We are demanding the police get to the bottom of these killings. Something is not adding up and we need to be told the truth. This is not the first time such killings have happened,” protester Abdi Hassan said. Police officers in Madogo sought reinforcement from their Garissa colleagues as they were overwhelmed by the protesters. Garissa Governor Ali Korane was caught up in the confrontation between the angry youth and the police. He was forced to park his vehicle at a petrol station and wait for the road to be cleared. Korane was heading to Nairobi. The bodies of the two guards were taken to the Garissa Hospital mortuary.
