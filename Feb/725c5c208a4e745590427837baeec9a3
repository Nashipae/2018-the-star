"Having considered all material evidence, l find the accused guilty and convict him of abuse of office charge." "I order him to pay a fine of Sh1 million or in default to serve 12 months imprisonment," the magistrate ruled. Kombo at the same time, for lack of evidence, acquitted the accused of another two counts. Mwangala was accused of failing to comply with the law relating to management of public funds and engaging in a project without prior planning. He was charged in 2015 with commissioning a contract of over Sh208 million without the board's approval. During the hearing, former YEDF director Gor Semelango said the accused procured the contract without the approval of the board. The accused was suspended pending investigation after which he was charged. Click here for the latest political news
