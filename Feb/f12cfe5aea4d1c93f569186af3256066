A Kiambu-based charcoal transporter yesterday demanded compensation for his truck
that was set ablaze in Kitui after it was impounded by police. The truck driver was arrested for illegal transportation
of charcoal and possession of forged transport business documents. It was torched because he was suspected to be violating a ban on charcoal trade and sand
harvesting imposed in neigboring Kitui county. The ban may have been inspired by the plastics ban imposed by the
national government, which has been hailed around Africa and
beyond. Environmental conservation is a devolved function and the assembly is within its mandate to ban calamitous activities that contribute to climate change. Irresponsible sand
harvesting results in the destruction of aquatic and riparian habitat, while in-stream sand harvesting can cause entire stream beds to sink to the depth of
the excavation. Governor Charity Ngilu has vowed that she will enforce the
ban imposed by the Kitui County Assembly. She has urged the people of Kitui to help. But enforcement of the ban must follow the law. Perhaps Ngilu should clarify that the "help" she requires is not people taking the law into their own hands.The torched truck was travelling from Garissa and had nothing to do with Kitui charcoal or sand.
