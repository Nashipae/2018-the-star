AFC Leopards interest in the Caf Confederation Cup ended tamely as they were knocked out by unheralded Madagascar side, Fosa, yesterday. The away goal they conceded in the first leg came back to haunt them as Fosa held their own in a goal-less draw to proceed to the first round of the continent’s domestic cup winners competition. Already without the experience of Collins Okoth, Leopards’ coach Robert Matano rung several changes in his starting line up with first leg goal scorer, Yusuf Mainge alongside goalkeeper Gabriel Andika, consigned to the bench in favour of Jaffery Owiti and shot stopper Jairus Adira. If those changes were meant to spark a goal scoring spree from Ingwe, there was no evidence of that in the first 45 minutes as the two sides cancelled each other out in a goal-less first half. The onus was on Leopards to go on the offensive from the first whistle, leaving them vulnerable to counter attacks from the hosts. It was a delicate balancing act that a Leopards side lacking the continental onus could not muster in the opening period of their clash in Antananarivo. The continued presence of Harambee Stars Cecafa winning forwards Whyvone Isuza and Vincent Oburu on the bench when goals were required on the pitch only served to further exasperate fans monitoring the game online. Though Matano sent on the attacking cavalry in a desperate bid to salvage their continental sojourn, it was too little, too late as Fosa did what Leopards, inspite of their superior comparative experience at this level, could not do—keep a clean sheet and thus return to Kenya to vie for domestic honours with Ulinzi Stars—their next opponent in the Kenyan premier League this weekend. With only one match to their name in the league, the draw against Posta Rangers in their season opener, Leopards will be keen for a win to stay in touch with table leaders Mathare United, who have seven points from their three matches and Gor Mahia who boast of the only maximum points tally with two wins out of two.
