Narok Governor Samuel Tunai has said corruption by defunct county council is the reason why the town has been experiencing persistent flash floods. Speaking after inspecting a multi-million bridge under expansion to solve the problem, Tunai said some individuals sold parcels of land along the waterway to unsuspecting buyers.“We will ensure businessmen and residents are free from flash floods. We will bring those who bought land and built along the waterways down,” Tunai said. He said more check dams upstream will be set up to reduce the impact of the floods which previously led to deaths and destruction of property. In April 2015, 11 people were swept away and property worth millions of shillings destroyed. “We want to make this town conducive for investors. We are going to use the original map to reclaim all public land grabbed by former officials,” he said. The county government in the last two months embarked on a demolition of kiosks illegally constructed on road reserves after a three months’ notice elapsed.
