Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka yesterday sued the national government for withdrawing his security and revoking his firearm license. In a petition filed at the Milimani law courts, Kalonzo is seeking orders to prohibit the state from cancelling his firearms license. He also wants the state compelled to reinstate security. Kalonzo, NASA’s deputy presidential candidate, is one of a number of opposition leaders targetted by the Jubilee government. Some have been arrested, personal security has been withdrawn, firearms certificates revoked and passports suspended. Kalonzo said security was withdrawn from his homes without notice. He called it a blatant breach of the Retirement Benefits (Deputy President and Designated Officers) Act of 2015. Kalonzo was Vice President from 2008-2013. The Act says a former PM and VP are entitled to armed security guards to be provided on request.

No hearing was held. Kalonzo said he has not done anything or committed any offence that justified withdrawal his security. The unilateral action without explanation has exposed him and his family to “revenge attacks”, the petition reads. Kalonzo said on January 31, a day after Raila Odinga’s swearing-in as the ‘People’s President’, gunmen hurled explosives and shot at his Karen home. Investigations are underway. The previous day the state had withdrawn security at his homes in Karen, Nairobi, Tseikuru in Kitui and his other home in Yatta, Machakos. He said the the government acted in bad faith, with improper motive and without fairness. Kalonzo said he was given the firearm certificate in 1998 and owns a Beretta pistol.
