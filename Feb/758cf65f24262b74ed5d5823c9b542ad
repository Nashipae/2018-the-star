A budding singer-cum-pastor in Kitui, who died while ministering in church, has been buried. Daniel Kitheka, alias Tetemeshe, collapsed in the middle of a church service he was leading on February 4 at the IDCC church in Kyuluni. He died on the spot. His right leg was deformed since birth, but he was otherwise healthy. However, doctors found out during an autopsy that he had a compound liver, heart and lungs condition. Hundreds of Christian faithful and lovers of his gospel lyrics gathered at his Syumiku village home on February 10 to bid him farewell. Mourners lamented that he died at the prime of his life. He was 26 years old and left behind not only a young bride but hundreds of fans. Tetemeshe died only six months into his marriage with Purity Mutheu. They had exchanged their wedding vows at the IDCC Church in Chuluniward in Kitui East subcounty, where he ministered in last August 5. He had been the church minister since 2016. In his eulogy, Pastor Stephen Mumo said Kitheka was praising the Lord with the song "Kumba and Kuvumbua, Yesu atarudi (In the twinkling of an eye, Jesus will return)" shortly before he untimely demise. “And after praising, he knelt down, his microphone fell down and behold, he met his death,” Mumo said.
