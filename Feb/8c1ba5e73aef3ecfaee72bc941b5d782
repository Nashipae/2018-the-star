President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga have been urged to hold talks and end post-election standoff. Kisumu Catholic Diocese Archbishop Zacchaeus Okoth yesterday said the dialogue should be held in a respectful manner to find lasting peace. Okoth said the country can only be salvaged through meaningful dialogue. “The burden is on the faith leaders to stand in the gap for Kenyans, just as biblical prophets did in the Old Testament,” he said. The bishop said the dialogue should be all-inclusive to ensure all Kenyans are represented. “We ask Uhuru and Raila to give dialogue a chance to amicably solve the challenges facing the nation,” Okoth said. The cleric also asked politicians to avoid hate speech. “Nobody wants a recurrence of the 2007-8 post-election violence,” he said.
