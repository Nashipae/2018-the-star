A bishop of the AIPCA church who has filed a case against Archbishop Fredrick Wangâ€™ombe has withdrawn it to allow dialogue between the factions. Bishop Stanley Muthomi withdrew the case on Monday, further strengthening the reconciliation process amongst the warring leaders. The withdrawal of the case is meant to provide a level ground for talks between all groups and help end the conflict that has rocked the church for years. Speaking at Mugumoini AIPCA church on Wednesday, the national leader of the church Archbishop Julius Njoroge said this is one of the steps being taken to invite the other factions for dialogue.
