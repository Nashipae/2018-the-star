Kenya Hockey Union is considering splitting the men’s Premiere League teams into two categories ahead of the new season. This will see the establishment of a Super League, in between the already existing Premier and National leagues. The Premier League currently has 15 teams and KHU secretary general Wycliffe Ongori said they will split the teams into two based on their performance last season and the regions they come from. Ongori noted: “It’s what the union will be proposing when they hold a meeting this Saturday with team managers. All this is meant to make the league competitive and for the betterment of the sport in Kenya. When you look at the log standing at the end of the just concluded season, you can see the gap between the top and bottom teams.” “Unlike in previous seasons where teams where top teams the national league were promoted to the Premier League and replaced by the last two in the top tier, top teams in the National League will move to the Super League.” Ongori said the women’s competition remains unchanged but was quick to note they are looking for ways to make it more competitive. “There is no much competition in the women’s league like we would loved to see. For example, Telkom have won the league a record 20 times unchallenged and we are looking at ways to make it competitive to allow the other teams challenge for the title,” said Ongori.
