A brave Albert Njogu bade farewell to the Nairobi International Junior tennis championships after falling 7-5,6-3 to Burundi’s Abdoul Shakur Kabura in the quarter-finals yesterday at Nairobi Club. Njogu, who was the sole Kenyan survivor in the second leg of the tourney, succumbed to the fourth seeded Kabura to end his dream of advancing to the semis as well as carrying the country’s hopes. The Kenyan boy was on Kabura’s case in the first set, pushing him to a tie-breaker after ten games. However, Kabura prevailed to go a set up. The experienced Kabura, continued with his good show in the second set, where he broke Njogu’s serve twice and took a 3-0 lead. Njogu then pulled one back from his opponent’s serve but during his turn, lost to trail 4-2. His win in the seventh game cut Kabura’s lead to a game but the Burundian upped his ante in the remaining games top win the set 6-3. Njogu said he will be aiming for an improved show in the third leg. He said: “My opponent today was good and remained calm throughout the match. I will be training hard in my sessions as a way of improving my backhands and volleys in preparations for the third leg,” added Njogu. On his part, Kabura said: “Njogu was equally strong. I was aware of his contribution in the Pre Davis cup and I also saw him play in the Karen Open. I lost the first leg final and I desperately wanted to avenge,” he added.
