A petition challenging the election of Nyansiongo MCA Dennis Kebaso (pictured) has been dismissed by the Keroka law courts. The case was thrown out for lack of enough evidence to back allegations of electoral malpractice during the August 8 polls. Anna Nyamusi filed a petition challenging Kebaso. A judgment was delivered on Tuesday by resident magistrate BM Kimutai. He cited lack of sufficient evidence. The case was dismissed with costs. Speaking outside the Keroka law courts after the petition was dismissed, Kebaso said he will rest from the pressure of the petition and get to serve the people of Nyansiongo ward. “It is good the petition has been dismissed. I hope I will be able to deliver services to the people of Nyansiongo ward who turned up in large numbers to vote for me as their leader,” he said. Kebaso was declared winner with 2,496 votes against Nyamusi who got 2,446 votes.
