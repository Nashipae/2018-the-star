A Nairobi court yesterday ordered a Sh1.6 billion NYS money laundering case against eight former senior Family Bank managers to be heard on March 15 without further delay. Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi fixed the hearing after the court was informed that a previous move by the bank to settle the matter out of court has failed. Earlier, the court had been told the bank had approached the DPP to settle the case against the ex-managers relating to alleged money laundering involving the prime suspect, Josephine Kabura. But when the matter came up for mention yesterday, senior state counsel Solomon Naulikha informed the court the case should proceed to full hearing. Defence lawyers led by Cecil Miller, who represents the bank, had earlier told the court they had officially written a proposal for an out-of-court settlement to the DPP. “We have initiated talks with the DPP to explore an out-of-court settlement which may bring the matter to an end,” Miller said. But the prosecution informed the court they had not received the alleged letter, although they were ready for hearing.
