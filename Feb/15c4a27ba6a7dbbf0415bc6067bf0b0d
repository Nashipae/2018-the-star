Members of the outlawed Wakali Kwanza youth gang are ready to surrender, but fear reprisals from security agents, Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo has said. Mbogo yesterday asked security personnel in Mombasa to give amnesty to those who are willing to reform. “These are young boys who lacked the opportunity to continue with education. That is why we have been saying we want to promote ‘Elimu Kwanza’ and not ‘Wakali Kwanza’,” the MP said. Mbogo donated shoes to Bedzimba Primary School. The gang is among some 90 notorious groups listed by former Interior CS Joseph Nkaiserry in December 2016. The gang was the bane of former Kisauni MP Rashid Bedzimba’s political career after incumbent Mbogo used it to campaign against him. Bedzimba failed to deal with the gang, which was most active under his reign as MP between 2013 and 2017. He was accused of financing it by security apparatus bosses like Nelson Marwa while he was Mombasa county commissioner. Bedzimba denied any links with the gang. Mbogo on Sunday said members of the gang have reached out to his office seeking assistance. “I received information that some members of Wakali Kwanza have sent messages that they want to reform,” Mbogo said. The MP, who rode on the campaign pledge to eradicate the gang and promote education instead, has won over parents against the gang. On Saturday, some members of the criminal gang told the Star many of them, especially the new recruits, are willing to reform. Many of their friends have been gunned down by the police. “They [some of the members] met last week and are now trying to reach out to leaders. They want to quit but they fear the repercussions,” said a member of the outlawed gang, who requested anonymity.
