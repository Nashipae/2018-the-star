The State will launch a ‘Marshall Plan’ in two weeks to end perennial banditry attacks in the Kerio Valley, Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has said. Leaders from Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo and West Pokot counties met with Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i and agreed to establish multimillion-shiling projects to reduce reliance on livestock, he said. Murkomen, who spoke at Sing’ore Girls’ High in Keyio, on Friday, during a thanksgiving for the school’s sterling performance in last year’s KCSE exam, did not disclose the nature of projects. Matiang’i is expected to visit Chesegon and Kolowa Bridge in Kerio Valley today. He will meet leaders.
