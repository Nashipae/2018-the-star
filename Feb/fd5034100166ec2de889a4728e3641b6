After a week of political confusion, it is salutary to be reminded that Kenyans are capable of great things. On Thursday, surgeons at the Kenyatta National Hospital released details of how they had reattached the hand of a 17-year-old boy from Kiambu who had completely severed it with a chaff cutter on January 26. Amazingly the boy can now move his fingers and surgeons are confident that in a few months the hand will recover full mobility. Hongera sana for the surgeons. All Kenyans should feel extremely proud of them. The surgeons have proved that Kenyans can be world class ( as have our athletes). But the surgeons have also demonstrated that Kenya should be doing so much better with the great human capital that it possesses. Kenya is a sleeping giant that is dragged down by ethnic politics, pervasive corruption, and state bodies that are mere vehicles for political patronage. We can do so much more, we can be so much better. That's what the KNH surgeons have shown us.
