Football Kenya Federation (FKF) president Nick Mwendwa asked players plying their trade in the Kenyan Premier League to exercise patience as the league body works towards bringing a sponsor on board. Mwendwa said it has been tough for clubs, who were dependent on grants from the SportPesa sponsorships before the betting firm withdrew, leaving them with nothing to offer. Mwendwa said: “I call upon all players to be patient with KPL. As you are aware, they (KPL) don’t have a sponsor and grants are not guaranteed. If your salaries are delayed, be patient I am sure they are working hard to bring a new sponsor on board and soon we will have the issue sorted.” Menwhile, thousands of school going youngsters are set to benefit from training sets that have been provided by sports apparel manufacturers Adidas in partnership with world soccer governing body Fifa. Mwendwa revealed that Nairobi County will launch the pilot project that will see training gear, balls and equipments given to the schools. “This initiative will help the more than two thousand coaches we have trained over the last couple of years to impart their skills on the next generation of players. We know that resources will be required to meet the logistics for the coaches but that not withstanding we appeal to all the coaches to be ready to put their skills to good use regardless of the prevailing circumstances,” said Mwendwa. He further revealed that Fifa funds for training more level ‘C’ coaches had already been disbursed and the next phase of training will be unveiled soon. With over 1700 matches played in the Nairobi branch alone, Nairobi County CEC in charge of sports, Janet Ouko assured that they will renovate five grassroot pitches in Jacaranda, Kihumbu-ini, Dandora, Woodley and Ziwani. She promised to explore avenues of reducing the  burden of paying match referees, currently shouldered by clubs.
