They might have blown hot and cold this season but Ulinzi Stars coach Dunstan Nyaudo will be seeking a more consistent performance from the soldiers starting with their Kenyan Premier League clash against AFC Leopards at Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos on Sunday. The team resumed training on Monday after playing to a barren draw with Mathare United two days earlier— a result the coach took with mixed feelings as he had obviously hoped for a win. However, heading to the game against Ingwe, he will be seeking the second win of the season. Leopards, who were knocked out of the Caf Confederations Cup, have also had a shaky start to the campaign and are yet to win any of their four competitive matches that included the Super Cup defeat to Gor Mahia, the league draw against Posta Rangers and the two stalemates against Fosa that knocked them out of the continental cup competition. Nyaudo will, however, not be looking at Ingwe’s woes but rather his team’s strength as he seeks to add to. However, we do not want to focus on their issues, rather to our strength and what we need to improve on,” Nyaudo said on the club’s official portal. “We want to play it on the pitch and of course we will go there to give all for a win,” the coach said in regards to the clash set for Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos. An aspect that Nyaudo will have to deal with, will be the opponents’ preference for aerial play. “AFC Leopards are a big team and they play more to the wave of their crowd; that is what pushes them more and of course they are an attacking team but tend to overstep their midfield with a lot of long balls. This is one area we have to really deal with when we get to play them and we will work on it,” he added. After three rounds of matches, Ulinzi Stars are placed sixth on the log with four points.
