Kenya still ranks among top 50 most-corrupt countries in the world, a report in the Global Corruption Perception Index (CPI 2017 ) shows. Kenya is number 143 out of 180 countries in the report, published by Transparency International. In 2016, the country was ranked position 145 out of 175 countries. There is a slight improvement on the CPI, as the country increased its score by two points from 26 in 2016 to 28 points in 2017. However, Kenya’s score of 28 out of 100 placed it below the global average of 43. The score is on a scale of zero (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). TI recommended that Kenya must do more to encourage free speech, independent media, political dissent and an open and engaged civil society. In the report, Rwanda ranks 48 out of the 180 countries. It scored 55 points from 54 in 2016. Namibia ranked 53 with 51 points. Cote d’Ivoire made a significant improvement on the CPI, as it increased its score by nine points from 2013 to 2017. It moved from 27 to 36 on the index. The Transparency International report indicates that transformations in Rwanda and Cabo Verde shows corruption is manageable. Long-term anti-corruption investments in countries like Cote d’Ivoire and Senegal are also steadily paying-off. Somalia, South Sudan and Syria ranked lowest, with scores of nine, 12 and 14, respectively. South Africa was ranked position 71, with a score of 43 points, from 45 in 2016. This year’s CPI highlights that the majority of countries are making little or no progress in ending corruption. Further analysis show journalists and activists in corrupt nations risk their lives every day in an effort to speak up. Countries with the least protection for press and NGOs also tend to have the worst rates of corruption.
