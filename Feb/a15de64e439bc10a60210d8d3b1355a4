Coca-Cola has announced that global music superstar Jason Derulo will be creating the soundtrack to its 2018 FIFA World Cup campaign. The two have teamed up to create the anthem “Colours”. The song celebrates all of the vibrancy and excitement that comes with the arrival of the world’s biggest football tournament. Coca-Cola has also invited the top artistes from South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, Mozambique and Uganda to create uniquely African versions of the anthem for each country to celebrate people’s passion for football through music. “I was honoured to work with Coca-Cola to create an anthem celebrating every team and their fans. ‘Colours’ represents the different flags and cultures from around the world,” Jason Derulo said.
