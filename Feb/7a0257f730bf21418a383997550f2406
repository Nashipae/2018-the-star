Police in Gatia-ini village in Murang’a county have arrested a 40-year-old man alleged to have murdered his wife and her lover after finding them in his matrimonial bed. Simon Ekare was arrested hours after committing the offense as he attempted to flee. Ekare, a guard at Kanderendu shopping centre, is suspected to have murdered the two after returning home at unusual time only to find his wife Esther Ayenee in bed with another man. According to witnesses, the man became furious after failing to get an explanation from his wife on why she was sleeping with another man. They said Ekare angrily started clobbering the two with a wooden bar and a dagger, forcing his 12-year-old son to flee through the window. The boy sought help from neighbours who arrived too late as the two were already dead and their bodies dumped under the bed. Kigumo OCPD Ibrahim Mchumwa said police launched a manhunt immediately after realizing the man had fled, and arrested him before he had gone too far. Mchumwa Ayenee worked in a tea farm and lived in her employer’s servant quarters with her family. He said the two are from Turkana county but the deceased man’s identity is yet to be established. The police boss said also confirmed that the two were murdered using a blunt object. Nominated MCA Jane Muigai who is a neighbor, said she was woken up by the screams of the boy only to find the two clobbered to death. She appealed to residents to find alternative ways of solving marital disputes while remaining faithful to their spouses. Muigai noted that infidelity was the major cause of murders saying it is better to separate than resort to killing. She asked well-wishers to assist the boy who she said has nowhere to go and does not have relatives in the area saying he also needs counseling after witnessing the ordeal. This comes only days after a 19-year-old woman killed her 30-year-old husband before torching their house at night in Maragua.
