Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua’s Maendeleo Chap Chap party has filed a lawsuit challenging the creation of the People’s Assembly. Machakos county assembly is one of 16 that has passed a motion for the creation of the People’s Assembly. Lawyer Alfred Nyamu said the creation of the People’s Assembly has no legal basis and violates the Constitution. “The purported establishment of People’s Assemblies is contrary to Article 2 of the Constitution,” the petition reads. Party secretary general Stephen Kilonzo, in an affidavit, said the 16 county assemblies exceeded their mandate. Kilonzo says the respondents failed and neglected to facilitate public participation as provided for under Articles 10 and 196 in such a sensitive matter. He said the People’s Assemblies cannot exist hand in hand with the county assemblies. Court order ignored Kilonzo said any MCA who voted in support of the motion should be declared to have forfeited their elected or nominated status and mandate to represent voters. He wants Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to call for fresh elections in the affected wards. “They proceeded to establish the People’s Assembly yet the High Court in Kitui had issued orders halting county assemblies from doing so,” Kilonzo says. Case before CJ The Attorney General, who is also a respondent in the suit, last month filed a petition seeking the same orders and on the same grounds. Justice John Mativo in his ruling on January 31, issued directions that the petition be placed before the Chief Justice for constitution of a bench. MCC wants the matter placed before the CJ and to be consolidated with the AG’s petition. The county assemblies that have passed the People’s Assembly motion include Kilifi, Busia, Siaya, Kakamega, Vihiga, Kisumu, Homa Bay, Migori and Makueni, Kwale, Mandera, Busia, Machakos and Mombasa.
