At least 200 KPA workers who were dismissed in 2009 have demanded reinstatement, claiming the action was taken without notice. Through Joseph Ayoro, who is Mombasa white card workers spokesperson, they explained that they were sacked that year after their last three-month contracts expired. Ayoro noted they had served KPA on renewable terms for more than five years. “After three months, we would renew the contracts. That is how we worked for more than five years until we were dismissed," he said on Saturday. The spokesperson said they were not dismissed on grounds of non-performance or misconduct, therefore it is only right for them to return to work. He said they they have been languishing in poverty and that Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir tried in vain to intervene. Ayoro reported that the Transport ministry promised to engage Kenya Ports Authority's management but that nine years down the line, 247 former employees had not yet been recalled. The spokesperson further accused Dock Workers Union of taking them for a ride with the promise of assisting them. He said their numerous trips to the union's office were met with lies and false hope. "The union continues to say the matter is in the courts but a visit to the Labour court shows the matter was dismissed for lack of grounds," he told a press briefing at Mama Ngina Grounds. “KPA continues to recruit workers. Why is it hard for them to recall us?" KPA's recruitment process turned problematic in July last year when Muslim clerics in Mombasa wanted it stopped and a fresh one done. The Kenya Muslims Advisory Council said the exercise was biased against Coast natives. Before then, Emma Mbura claimed employment at the authority was skewed and that is favoured only those with godfathers in system. KKPA was not immediately available for comment on the allegations raised by Ayoro.
