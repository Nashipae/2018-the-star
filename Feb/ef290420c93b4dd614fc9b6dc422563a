Pushed by the rising crime involving tuk tuks, operators of the three-wheeler taxis in Mombasa have devised a new way to end insecurity. The crew members have designed a new security sticker with features that enable each tuk tuk to be easily identified, tracked and monitored. Mombasa Tuk Tuk Association and Mombasa County Tuk Tuk Operators members said they don’t want their vehicles to be associated with crime. “With these new stickers, whenever clients forget their luggage or documents in a tuk tuk, they can easily trace the tuk tuk through the unique security numbers,” said Mocotuo secretary general John Gatimu on Sunday. Tuk Tuk Association secretary general Mohamed Musa yesterday said they are working with the county government in the stickers project.
