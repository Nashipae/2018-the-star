More than 271,000 houses are set to be sprayed with insecticide to cushion residents against malaria infection in Homa Bay county from today at a cost of Sh400 million. Some 271,233 houses in all the 40 wards will be sprayed in the 36-day exercise. The aim is to kill the female Anopheles mosquito, which spreads malaria The project is conducted by the county government in partnership with the American Indoor Residual Spraying. Speaking when he launched the programme on Friday, Governor Cyprian Awiti said records from the county Health department indicate a high infection rate in the area, the worst-affected persons being expectant women and children below five years. According to the county boss, 91 people died and more than 259,000 pregnant women and 110,000 children below the age of five were infected with malaria last year. “The exercise will kill the insects which transmit the disease so we do not expect similar infections to reoccur this year,” Awiti said. “We have recruited and trained 1,579 mobilisers and 836 residents to provide labour in the project. This will help them earn wages and improve their standards of living from the project,” he added. Awiti said his government will work closely with the national government and other partners to ensure adequate funding to curb diseases. AIRS’ Bradley Longman called on residents to welcome and support the project to transform their lives and urged them to sleep under treated mosquito nets to reduce prevalence.
