At least 10 people are admitted to the Kericho Level Four Hospital with serious injuries after being attacked by a stray leopard in Cheribo village in Kericho West subcounty on Friday. Two days earlier, the leopard killed 11 goats in the village. At round 5pm an elder saw the leopard trying to kill a calf and raised the alarm. Villagers armed with bows and arrows killed the beast. Officials from Kericho Kenya Wildlife Service arrived later and took away the carcass. Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony visited the victims.
