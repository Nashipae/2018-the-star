Kakamega Kanu chairman Chacha Weche has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to unite the country. He said harassment of opposition leaders would only further divide the nation. “We are urging the president to engage in dialogue with NASA leader Raila Odinga to resolve the political crisis and fix the electoral system,” he said in Kakamega yesterday. Weche said Kanu supporters from Western believe in a united country. Weche said the manner in which the state was handling the NASA leaders in the aftermath of Raila’s oath-taking  was creating unnecessary tensions in the country instead of focusing on development.
