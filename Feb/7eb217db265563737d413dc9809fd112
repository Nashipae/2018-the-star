Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati on Monday flagged off a consignment of drugs for distribution in the county's 133 health facilities. The Sh47 million medicine will be used in Level II and Level III health facilities while another consignment worth Sh20 million will be dispatched to 10 sub-county hospitals next week. The drugs wee sourced in an arrangement between the county government and Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA). KEMSA, in the deal, agreed to supply drugs as directed by the county within the shortest time possible to stem shortages in the county. Wangamati said the new disposition was a milestone towards the fourth pillar of his government's goal of universal access to health care. "Through our partnership with KEMSA, we are solving the perennial problem of drug stock-outs in our health facilities, especially following delays in release of funds from the National Treasury." The governor called on health officials to guard against any losses and ensure the
drugs reach hospitals. "At the core of my manifesto was a promise to
stock up all hospitals and dispensaries," he said. Health CEC Anthony Walela, who was present during the official flag
off, said his ministry had put in place measures to curb drug theft from
the health facilities. Among other features, the drugs come already labelled as per precise destination facility, right from KEMSA. KEMSA acting CEO Fred Wanyonyi said to make sure there are no delays in delivery. The health facilities will now be ordering their stocks online and receive the drugs within a time period of three weeks. Click here for the latest political news
