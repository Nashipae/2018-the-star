Look at the political wave to make sound and wise political decisions, Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka has told opposition leaders. "If you want to urinate you look which direction the wind is blowing from and where it’s headed lest you pee on yourself," he said. The former Bungoma governor spoke at Milo Secondary School, Webuye West, on Saturday. Lusaka was elected governor on the New Ford Kenya party ticket in 2013. In 2016 New Ford-K folded and merged with others to form Jubilee Party. Lusaka ran for reelection on the JP ticket in the August 8 election but lost to Ford Kenya’s Wycliffe Wangamati. Lusaka said political leaders have to make wise and sober decisions to benefit voters. "When you asked me to dissolve New Ford Kenya and build a party that has the face of Kenya, at first I thought it was suicidal little did I know it was the best move for this country," he told Deputy President William Ruto, who was present. "I went and read John 14:4, which says 'let your hearts not be troubled in my father's house there are many rooms' and I knew I was very wise to heed the DP's advice to close my small shop and join hands with Jubilee and other leaders to build a supermarket." Lusaka thanked Ruto and Jubilee for the position of Senate Speaker and said it is a blessing to Western. "We have [three arms of government]. One is headed by President Uhuru, the other is [Chief Justice David] Maraga and the other is me and Muturi. That is to say Bungoma we are very much inside the government," he said. Other leaders present were Webuye West MP Dan Wanyama, Starehe MP Charles Njagua, Kitutu Masaba MP Shadrack Mose, Deputy Head of Public Service Musiambo Wanyama and Nzoia Sugar chairman Joash Wamangoli. Bumula MP Mwambu Mabonga (independent) and Alfred Sambu of Webuye East (ANC) support the ruling party. This has left NASA, through Ford Kenya, with only three MP seats in Bungoma—Tongaren, Kanduyi and Kabuchai.
