ODM national treasurer Timothy Bosire has told NASA principals to stick together after three of them skipped Raila Odinga’s swearing-in on Tuesday. “Going separate ways will kill the Kenyan dream for change,” Bosire said on Wednesday. The former Kitutu Masaba MP said NASA leaders should not be distracted from what happened on Tuesday. He defended the swearing-in as an important step in realising electoral reform. Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Wiper’s Kalonzo Musyoka, who was Raila’s running mate, did not show up at Uhuru Park for the ceremony. “We shall ensure Raila becomes the President of the Republic of Kenya because he won the August 8 election. We don’t recognise the October 26 polls in which less than 30 per cent of voters participated,” Bosire said. He congratulated Raila on the swearing-in, adding that it was a bold move. The former MP praised NASA supporters for their peaceful conduct on Tuesday. “Our supporters demonstrated that NASA supporters are organised and peaceful. It confirmed that the people who were causing chaos were the police and Mungiki,” Bosire said.
