When Marvel wanted someone to create exclusive concept art for the now popular flick, Black Panther, which stars Kenya's Lupta Nyong'o, it turned to Kenyan photographer Osborne Macharia. US media outlet Complex did a feature on Macharia, revealing how the project came about. "Prior to the launch of Black Panther in London, Macharia was commissioned by Marvel to create an 'exclusive art piece' in conjunction with the film. Macharia created a project titled Ilgelunot, which translated in the Maasai language means "The Chosen One."' The feature also delved into the idea behind the creation. "The project tells the story of three elders who were saved by T'Chaka during World War II after attempting to seek shelter while venturing across North Africa. The two men and one woman were exposed to Vibranium, which gave them supernatural powers, but left them blind. The elders eventually became the Black Panther's most trusted advisers."
