A family in Kangema, Murang’a county wants a deputy OCPD arrested for the killing of a 19-year-old youth in Mukarara village. They accused Jattani Wako of killing Harrison Irungu in Kangema town last Saturday. Monicah Mwihaki, Irungu’s mother, said she received information from friends that her son was shot under unclear circumstances. She said the police have not given her any information on how and why her son had been shot. The woman said the police officer in question was spotted taking beer in a bar at Kangema town before the shooting. Mwihaki lamented that even after her numerous visits to the station, the police have remained mum on the death of her son. "The police officer should have arrested him if he thought he had committed any crime. Instead, he shot him dead," the distressed mother said. She wants the officer to be arrested and charged with murder saying he (Wako) must have misused his gun because he was drunk. "I am appealing to National Police Service and the Independent Police Oversight Authority to intervene so that I can get justice for my son." She described her son as a humble, hard-working, and disciplined person. Mwihaki added that police officers should not be allowed to possess guns or be on duty while drunk. Kangema OCPD Cosmas Wachang’oka defended his deputy saying Irungu pelted the officer with a stone which injured the latter on the face. He said the officer is undergoing treatment for the deep cuts that he sustained saying the actions of the youth caused him use his gun. "He did not intend to kill him, he was only defending himself," the OCPD said on Tuesday. Click here for the latest political news
