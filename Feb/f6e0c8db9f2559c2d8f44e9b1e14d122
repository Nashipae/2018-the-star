A Nairobi county staff member yesterday said he is being harassed by police and a private developer who is plotting to grab Pumwani Maternity Hospital’s land. Barnabas Asembo - a technician at City Hall - said the developer sent officers from Pangani police station to arrest him on Wednesday morning. He said he was arrested at his home, a county house built on the targetted land, and booked under OB Number 27/12/2/2018, which was used for a different case. “I was arrested like a wanted terrorist. My rights were infringed, and today being a Valentine’s Day I feel very bad,” Asembo said. He said he been harassed by the police many times on the orders of the developer, whom he only identified as Rashid. ”If Governor Sonko had not intervened, this piece of land would have been grabbed long time ago. I pay rent to the county government every month,” Asembo said. Pumwani DCI Zachary Mbaya said they are investigating and will arrest the culprits.
