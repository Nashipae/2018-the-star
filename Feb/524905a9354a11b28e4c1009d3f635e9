Reigning Kenya Premier League champions Gor Mahia will have to be content with their normal training sessions in preparation of their Saturday’s clash against Equatorial Guinea side, Leones Vegetarianos in the Caf Champions League. Gor were set to play Sudan side, Al Hilal this afternoon in a high profile friendly but the 26-time Sudan champions cancelled the duel yesterday evening citing injuries incurred by some of their stars. Gor had won all their pre-season friendly matches and carried their good run into the premier league over the weekend, whipping Nakumatt 4-0 in their opening match to launch their title defence campaign on a positive note. The indomitable K’ogalo were set to face the Sudan side just days before hosting the West African side on Saturday in what would have been their final build-up test. Gor assistant secretary general, Ronald Ngala, confirmed the cancellation of the friendly which their opponent said was engineered by the injuries sustained over the weekend. “The match will not go as planned since Al Hilal have opted out. They claim most of their regular stars picked injuries against Leopards on Sunday and could not risk any more.” Meanwhile, Gor Mahia chairman Ambrose Rachier has asked the government to intervene and support them secure air tickets and accommodation for their away match in Equatorial Guinea. The administrator said: “We are yet to hear from the government concerning funding our activities and I call upon the minister in charge to come to our rescue. We forwarded our budget to the government but so far we are yet to get feedback in terms of funding. Our journey to West Africa hangs in the balance and we may cancel it if we fail to get funds on time. We have been left with the option of gate collections yet matches are poorly attended.”
