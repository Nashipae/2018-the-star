Adelle Onyango is making money moves in the fashion industry. She's a stylish lady with unique style and now she has launched her clothing line, Anyango Capsule Collection. "My tribute collection is to honour the most important person in my life, whom I’ve always wanted to immortalise and share with the world in my way — my late mum!" she said. "This is because I’m finally strong enough to. I’ve wanted to do it for two years! I took some of her characteristics that I aspire to and together with super talented creatives, brought those characteristics to LIFE!" Adelle was pretty close to her mother, and she was inspired to start this line because "I want people to know just how amazing my mum was and to have a piece that reminds them of how strong, powerful and limitless they are!" So how did she come about bringing this concept to life? "I teamed up with four creatives and made one piece with each of them that reflects a characteristic that my mum had. Each week in February, we unveil one piece and one creative! This week, I teamed up with Nairobi Apparel District and came up with a bomb denim jacket that is oozing so much life and represents power, because my mum was a powerful woman." She continued, "I want you to feel POWERFUL when you wear this jacket; when you're going through something tough — I want it to serve as a reminder for you."
