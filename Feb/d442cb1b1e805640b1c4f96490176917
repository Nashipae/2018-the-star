Hundreds of potential recruits in Garissa were disappointed after they were turned away yesterday during the KDF recruitment drive for being underweight, or their certificates or ID cards having anomalies. Senior recruiting officer Lt. Col. Zacharia Burundi expressed regret that a number of candidates had to be turned way because of mismatch between the names on their ID cards and those on their academic certificates. He spoke on the sidelines of the exercise held at Garissa Primary School. They were left with only 60 candidates. “We’ve had a few challenges. We expected more ladies but only managed to have four, with one being from Mwingi that we had to eliminate,” he said. When pressed to state the exact number of recruits they were expected to take, Burundi said they were more interested in the quality of candidates. “The numbers are secondary,” he said.
