Teachers are bracing for battle with the government over five big issues, including appraisals and transfers, which they oppose. The five were among resolutions passed in their Annual Delegates’ Conference in December last year. Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion (pictured) yesterday said they will not compromise on issues they want withdrawn or implemented urgently. They oppose teacher transfers and demand withdrawal of performance appraisals. Other issues are delayed promotions they want implemented. They also insiste onemployment of more teachers and stakeholder involvement in the curriculum review process. “We are listing these things now so that we are not blamed when we cause problems in a few days’ time,” Sossion tolda press conference in Nairobi. The fived are among the 45 resolutions passed during the ADC.They will be discussed during the branch Annual General Meeting from tomorrow. Sossion said teachers agreed to have appraisals scrapped, as they were hurting their performance. He said the appraisal system introduced in 2016 is biased, not standardised, and encourages corruption. Sossion said more than 30,000 promotion cases have been pending since 2014. He said public schools face a deficit of over 100,000 teachers because of an influx of students in the Free Education Programme. He wants curriculum review monitored by internal and external evaluators before full implementation next year.
