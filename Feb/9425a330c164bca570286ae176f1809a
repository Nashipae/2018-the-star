Kanu secretary general Nick Salat has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to consider the party in the remaining Cabinet slots. The Constitution allows the President to name up to 22 Cabinet Secretaries. The President last month named 15 CSs. That means he can still name seven more CSs. Salat said the party will continue to support the Jubilee administration to fulfil the pre-election pledges it made to Kenyans. “Tulisema tuko ndani ndani ndani ya Jubilee, lakini sasa karibu inakuwa nje kidogo (We said we were fully supporting Jubilee, but it now seems like we are outside),” he said.

Ng’eno said he does not understand why other parties were rewarded with Cabinet positions, while Kanu, which played a key role in the reelection of Uhuru, was left out. The MP, who was elected on the Kanu ticket, said Jubilee betrayed him by sponsoring a petition challenging his election. The court declared Ng’eno validly elected and dismissed the case filed by David Keter of Jubilee Party. Ng’eno, however, said the President was not part of the leaders who wanted him to go home. “The same leaders coached witnesses to testify against me, saying I was responsible for the burning of houses, killing of people and intimidation. I thank God I won the case despite the lies,” he said. Nge’no declared political war on his opponents who sponsored the petition, adding that it is “payback time”.
