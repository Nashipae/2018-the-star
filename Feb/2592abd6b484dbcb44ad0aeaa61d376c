Most youths in Mombasa are frustrated during KDF recruitment because their ID cards indicate that they come from upcountry. The youths are now asking President Uhuru Kenyatta and Defence CS Rachael Omamo to ensure no one is left out because of such technicalities. Speaking on their behalf, politicians Waithaka Macharia and Daniel Muange said the KDF recruitment rules should be changed.

The Defence ministry on Thursday announced the commencement dates for the recruitment exercise of servicemen and women, constables and tradesmen and women scheduled to take place between February 12 to March 13. The recruitment rules require that one carries their national ID card. “Some of our children born in Mombasa, which is cosmopolitan, have lived here all their lives. They are better known here than in their home counties. Why would they be asked to travel upcountry for the recruitment exercise?” posed Muange. The exercise will be conducted in Mombasa next Friday, February 16 in Likoni, February 26 in Kisauni, February 27 in Nyali, March 2 in Changamwe, March 5 in Jomvu and March 6 in Mombasa Island.
