The delay in the release of funds to the counties is hurting development, Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has said. He appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta to help speedup the process. Wangamati spoke at Mitua Girl’s High School in Tongaren constituency on Friday. He said the delay in the release of funds has put governors in a precarious situation as they cannot do much to deliver on the promises they made to the electorate. Bungoma is number three in population after Nairobi and Kakamega. “Bungoma county received the last disbursement from the Treasury in October last year. I'm appealing to the President and the Treasury to release the money to the counties,” Wangamati said. Wangamati promised to set aside funds in next financial year to ensure they improve infrastructure in primary and secondary schools. He said he will work with the Water ministry to ensure schools get sufficient clean water. Wangamati also promised to employ one teacher per school who will be paid by the county government.
