Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli has urge the government to restore security in Mt Elgon. He said residents suffer and only swift action against the killer gang will help. Residents are attacked, raped and killed, and their houses torched. Atwoli said on Saturday in Khwisero, Kakamega, that this must stop. He told Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to fix the problem before it gets out of hand. “The Sabaot Land Defence Force is back. They are killing innocent people and raping women. We ask Matiang’i to address the issue,” the unionist said. He said the regrouping of the militia is dangerous and will ruin the stability of the region. He said development can only be achieved if security is guaranteed and citizens feel safe. Police have denied reports that the SLDF militia group has been involved in the attacks.
