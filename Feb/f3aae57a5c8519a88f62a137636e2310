A motorcyclist who allegedly demanded a Sh20,000 ransom from the parents of a 2-year-old kidnapped boy was arrested on Friday in Kikuyu town. James Kigaa allegedly sent short message texts to Mark Gichuru’s parents Francis Kimani and Mary Wairimu, demanding the money before releasing their son. The boy was kidnapped from his mother’s salon in Kimende town, Lari constituency. Wairimu said the suspect used to visit her employee, Josphat Hugo, at work. The boy was kidnapped on Wednesday. “The suspect used to visit Hugo. On Wednesday, my son went missing. I looked for him in town, but he was nowhere to be found,” she said. Mary and her husband reported the matter at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations office. “I was so scared. I had to send him Sh4,000 on M-pesa, and persuaded him to bring the boy and collect the balance, but he switched off the phone,” she said. “On Friday when he was arrested, I had sent him Sh 5,000. He was caught while withdrawing the money,” she said. DCI boss Mugo Mithamo said Kigaa was arrested together Hugo and a woman suspect. OCPD Isaiah Odhiambo said suspect was seized at an M-Pesa shop in Kikuyu with the boy.
