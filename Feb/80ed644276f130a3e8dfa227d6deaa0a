Uchumi Supermarket posted losses of sh 895.12 million in the half year ending December 31, 2017, a 63.55 per cent increase from a loss of Sh547.3 million made by the cash strapped retailer within the same period in 2016. According to its half year unaudited financial results announced yesterday, the firm's total expenses dropped 15.52 per cent to Sh1.04 billion. Uchumi's total expense stood at Sh1.23 billion at a similar period in 2016. The directors did not recommend the payment of an interim dividend to its shareholders for the audited period. “We are looking at relocating and opening stores which are more financially viable to appeal to our customer base,” Mohamed said. Last year, the company received a Sh1.2 billion injection from the government to restock its shelves and boost its liquidity status. The troubled retailer is expecting a further Sh600 million this year. In December 2017, Uchumi restocked 19 out of its 20 branches across the country with hopes to leverage on the festive season to register profits. It also banked on an unnamed investor to pump in Sh3.5 billion through equity. However, the investor pulled out before the 120 days lapsed of the announced 120 days in which the investment was supposed to materialise. While it is not clear why Kuramo dropped its investment bid in Uchumi, it is believed that the decision was made due to governments plan to pull out its shareholding once the retailer stabilizes. This was revealed by Trade principal secretary Chris kiptoo in July 2017. In January this year, it emerged that after Kuramo disappointed, the retailer turned her hope to an equity investor from Asia. If successful, the funding from the Asian investor is expected to revive the firm’s competitiveness and stir activities in Kenya’s shaky retail sector which has suffered a major slowdown in the recent past. Uchumi managed to cut losses by a margin of 39 per cent in the year to June 2017. Julius Kipng'etich, its immediate former CEO, was expected to resurrect the retailer when he joined Uchumi in 2015, but left early this year for Jubilee Insurance, leaving the retailer high and dry.
