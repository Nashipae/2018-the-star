Devolution CS Eugine Wamalwa on Saturday said devolution will be critical in achieving President Uhuru Kenyatta’s big four agenda. During last year’s Jamhuri Day celebrations, Uhuru outlined manufacturing, universal healthcare, affordable housing, and food security as his four- point agenda. Wamalwa urged governors to work closely with the national government to help achieve the projects, which will see Jubilee government pumping in billions of shillings to implement them. Under the housing pillar, the government has proposed to build 200,000 social housing units and 800,000 affordable units by 2023. This is a Sh2.6 trillion project, which will see many counties benefit from the low-cost housing.
