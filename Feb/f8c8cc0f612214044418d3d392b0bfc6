The national government has denied claims that Lamu youth are sidelined and denied employment in the construction of Lapsset at Kililana. Last week Lamu MCAs said the county leadership is not involved as much as it should in the project. They accused the national government of sidelining Lamu youth, despite pledging to give them jobs. The MCAs threatened to hold major demos to voice their concerns. But Transport PS Paul Maringa said the government’s objective is to ensure the people of Lamu benefit from Lapsset. He said no capable youth will be sidelined during construction and operationalization of Lapsset. Maringa was on a tour of the Lapsset site on Friday. He urged youths to enrol in TVET institutions and colleges. The PS said the project has the capacity to employ thousands but only those with the right skills and knowledge will be considered. “No one has sidelined anyone. We are doing the much we can to ensure inclusivity, especially of the youth of Lamu. We however encourage people to get trained and get the necessary skills so they get employed when the port starts functioning,” Maringa said.
