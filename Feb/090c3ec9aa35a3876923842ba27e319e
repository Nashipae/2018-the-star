Nakuru woman accused of killing her tycoon husband will remain in custody for two weeks, pending a ruling by the High Court on her bond application. Justice Roselyn Korir ordered that Gladys Wambui be remanded, as the court considers whether to free her on bond. “The court will be required to go through the proceedings and the arguments by the state, victims’ lawyers and the defence before delivering a ruling on bond application by the accused,” she said. This was after Wambui demanded a review of the ruling remanding her until three key witnesses testify.
