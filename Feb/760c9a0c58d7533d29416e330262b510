The Kitui county assembly yesterday defended Wiper leader leader Kalonzo Musyoka against accusations he snubbed Tuesday swearing-in. They said they are fully behind Raila Odinga's oath. The assembly blamed forces in Jubilee for derailing Kalonzo's plans to be sworn in as the "Deputy People's President" to create a false narrative that NASA is disintegrating. Led by speaker George Ndoto, they told Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to urgently restore Kalonzo's security, saying he is vulnerable. "Our supporters should not succumb to Jubilee tricks of trying to break NASA," Ndoto said. They said it was clear the withdrawal of Kalonzo's security contributed to his skipping of the swearing in fete, "as he feared for his life". Ndoto absolved Musyoka of social media and FM stations criticisms. He said circumstances beyond Kalonzo's control prevented the NASA co-principal from attending the Uhuru Park event. ''Here is a man whose security guards are recalled at the eleventh hour when he was preparing to attend an important event where his security is highly needed. What was he expected to do apart from skipping the occasion?'' Ndoto said. He said those castigating the former VP are ignorant and acting out of malice and hatred.
