The
commission disclosed that Baringo and Kajiado counties will be joining 14 others currently receiving the Equalisation Fund. They are Turkana and Mandera, Wajir, Marsabit, Samburu, West Pokot, Tana River,
Narok, Kwale, Garissa, Kilifi, Taita Taveta, Isiolo and Lamu. CRA
commissioner Kishanto ole Suuji on Monday said the commission is using sublocation as
the basis for determining whether a county will qualify for the fund. Suuji said
the commission has concluded a poverty index survey in 700 selected
sublocations in all the 47 counties, leading to the inclusion of Baringo and
Kajiado in the country’s poorest counties. He said several locations in the two counties counties meet the threshold to qualify for the fund. “Fortunately,
the number of counties that qualify for the Equalisation Fund have increased,” Suuji
said. He said the
commission used four parametres existing in the Kenya national Bureau of Statistics
economic survey data to determine the
worse-off areas. The parametres include health, education and water. Suuji said
the first Equalisation Fund policy that listed 14 counties as the poorest
counties has expired. The previous
policy considered
electricity, roads, water and health to determine allocation of the fund.
