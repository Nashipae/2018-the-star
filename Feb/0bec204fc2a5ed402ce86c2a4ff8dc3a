The Nuts and Oil Directorate in the Agriculture and Food Authority has denied involvement in the price wars behind the sale of macadamia nuts as alleged by farmers during their protests last week. Raymond Kahindi, the interim director, said the directorate’s intention is to regulate the sale and harvesting of immature nuts. The current situation affecting the farmers can easily be solved by leaders through dialogue that brings on board top government offices, he said. “There are things done according to the law and the law is two-way, like a saw. There are things I can solve and there those I must consult on. I will talk to Tigania West MP John Mutunga and top government officers to solve the current standoff,” Kahindi told farmers in Miathene during a meeting to educate them about the crop. The farmers had accused the AFA and Thika Town MP Patrick Wainaina of orchestrating the arrests of a Chinese “because he owns a company but is unable to compete with the Chinese”. Mutunga urged the government to intervene swiftly and “have the Chinese released or bring other investors who will buy the commodity at higher prices”.
