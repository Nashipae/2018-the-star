Vihiga Senator George Khaniri yesterday said Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang’ula owe Kenyans an explanation for skipping the swearing-in of NASA leader Raila Odinga. He was sworn in as the ‘Peoples’ President’ at Uhuru Park on Tuesday. Wiper boss Kalonzo Musyoka also did not attend the controversial event, to the chagrin of opposition supporters. The no-show by ANC’s Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Wetang’ula opened the door for ODM to reestablish itself in Western region, Khaniri said. ANC made gains in the August 8 General Election. The two leaders got a backlash from NASA backers on social media who called them cowards. Khaniri dismissed as a white lie Kalonzo’s claims that he was missing because it’s a strategy. “I talked to Raila in Uhuru Park on Tuesday. He told Kalonzo the ground is full and they should come immediately,” he said. Generals deserted soldiers “He asked me to talk to Mudavadi and convince him to attend, but I could not reach him. If it was a strategy then Raila would have known,” he said. Khaniri said the opposition is fighting for a just cause and Mudavadi and Wetang’ula’s action casts aspersions on their leadership abilities. Questions abound on whether they are really committed to the cause of freeing Kenyans from the resurgence of dictatorial tendencies that thrived during the Kanu era. “Leaders must lead from the front. These are generals who abandoned their soldiers in the field,” Khaniri told the Star on the phone. Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli on Thursday described Mudavadi and Wetang’ula as irredeemable cowards. Atwoli installed Mudavadi as the Luhya spokesman on December 31 2016. But on Friday, Atwoli said he had dropped him after Mudavadi skipped the swearing-in. He apologised to mourners at a funeral in Likuyani for naming Mudavadi as their spokesman. Atwoli vowed never to support Mudavadi because he abandoned Raila in his hour of need.
