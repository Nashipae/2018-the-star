Betty Kyallo and Susan Kaittany were inseparable after they launched their classic salon, Posh Palace Hair Studio & Spa, late in 2016. But our highly placed source has revealed that "the two no longer hang out together". Rumours have been going round that Betty was not a partner at the company, but we have an official document showing that indeed, she was a partner. We reached out to Betty and she set the record straight. "I'm no longer at Posh Palace," she said, adding that she's not been there for a month "because I'm no longer a partner". She said she is busy working on new projects, which will be unveiled soon. "I'm looking forward to working with big brands, make money and see what this world has for Betty Kyallo."
