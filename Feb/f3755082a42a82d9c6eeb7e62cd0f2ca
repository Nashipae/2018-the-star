Kericho Gold, the leading tea buyers at the Mombasa Auction, will represent Kenya at the ‘Foodex Japan 2018’ show to be held next week. The three-day exhibition will run from March 6 to 9 and is expected to attract at least 77,000 professionals in the food and beverage industry from across the globe. ‘’Kericho Gold has consistently stirred the imagination of consumers with its range of exquisite, functional, funky even sophisticated teas touching every target market in Kenya, finally grabbing the attention of key stakeholders in the international food and beverage arena,” Gold Crown Beverages managing director Fahim Ahmed said. A special invite was sent to Kericho Gold. “We take the Japanese market very seriously. There is great potential for high quality teas in Japan, particularly for pyramid bags with leaf teas, and we need to show what Kenya has to offer to the Japanese consumer.” Mixed blend Kericho Gold will partner with the Japan External Trade Organisation to become the first Kenyan tea company to participate in the expo. The brand is expected to showcase its mixed brand of teas including green, black and attitude teas which are blended and packaged at its Mombasa-based factory from fine teas in Kenya and carefully selected by expert tea tasters for the richness of their taste, flavour and aroma. The brand’s mother firm Global Tea & Commodities overtook Unilever to top Africa’s tea purchases at Mombasa auction last year, purchasing more than 16 per cent of the continent’s production Global Tea purchased 59.89 million kilogrammes of tea during 2017, an increase from 51.6 million in 2016. Unilever came second with 59.1 million kg in 2017, a drop from 62.3 million in the previous year. LAB International was third with 31.8 million kilogrammes and Chai Trading, an arm of Kenya Tea Development Agency, came in the fourth position with 31.4 million kg.
