The Office of Director of Public Prosecutions is reviewing remandees’ cases nationwide to ease congestion at correctional facilities. Deputy DPP Jacob Ondari yesterday said the Kenya Prisons Service facilities are overstretched because of the high number of remandees. He was speaking during the launch of the review at Kodiaga Prison. Ondari said the current prison population is approximately 54,000, 48 per cent of which are remandees and the rest sentenced prisoners. He said the numbers far exceed the current capacity of prisons nationwide. Kodiaga Prison has 1,500 inmates, 567 of whom are on remand. “We want to determine when these cases are going to be heard or consider dropping some petty offences to help decongest these facilities,” Ondari said. “The office of the DPP has obtained data of all remandees and identified 237 cases of petty offenses whose files have been requested for review.” He attributed the high number of remandees to inadequate legal representation and under-utilisation of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.
