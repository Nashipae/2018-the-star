Suspended Communications Authority director general Francis Wangusi will resume office on Tuesday. Speaking exclusively to The Star on Monday, Wangusi said that he had a "fruitful engagement" with his employer on Monday. ''There were some discussions today. I will be resuming duty tomorrow. The board will resolve other issues later,'' he said. On January 12, the CA board resolved to send Wangusi on compulsory leave to facilitate an audit. This concerned investigations into what is said to be malpractice in staff training and promotions at the regulator. On Thursday last week, the director was denied access at the authority's gate by two men in suits, perceived to be officers implementing 'orders from above'. This occurred despite a court order that lifted the suspension pending the hearing and determination of a petition he filed through lawyer Tom Ojienda. The lawyer told the court that the action by CA’s board was not only illegal but also in bad faith.
