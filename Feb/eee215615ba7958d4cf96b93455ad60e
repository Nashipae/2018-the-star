Tourism CS Najib Balala has neither denied nor confirmed reports he is interested in the 2022 Mombasa governor race. He says he is focused on serving as CS and refuses to reveal his future plans. His close allies Ibrahim ‘Babangida’ Khamis and Ben Furaha told the Star the CS has been working hard in his ministerial duties and does not engage much in political talk. “He has not mentioned it to me ... that topic never came up,” Babangida said. Furaha, who was at one time Balala’s personal assistant, said he is more mature in politics and leadership and knows what to say and when to say it. Residents have accused Governor Hassan Joho of doing little to clean the county. Mombasa has in the past been listed as the cleanest town in the country. At the time, Balala was the mayor. On Friday, the CS told the Star he will “come up with a big plan”. It is unclear if the plan has anything to do with running for governor. “We will build the nation until 2021. We will not talk about 2022 politics. We cannot be politicking throughout. These positions mean nothing if the nation does not develop,” he said. So far, three people have shown interest in succeeding Joho. They are Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir, his Kisauni counterpart Ali Mbogo and former Nyali MP Hezron Awiti. There is wide speculation Joho is grooming county speaker Aharub Khatri to take over from him. The Speaker has denied he is eyeing the seat, saying he is focused on serving the people of Mombasa in his current capacity. In December last year, the Sultan said he has no time for cabinet secretaries, governors, MPs or senators who hurriedly assemble press conferences to answer him every time he speaks. Joho’s statement was seen to be directed at Balala, his Mining counterpart Dan Kazungu, former Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar and other Jubilee politicians at the Coast. The governor said the Coast region will one day produce a President.
