Four cases of cholera have been reported in Katilu, Turkana South, raising concerns about an outbreak. Health and Sanitation executive Jane Ajele said the four residents of Lopur village were admitted at Katilu Hospital. "They are in stable condition. They are taking fluids in isolation," she told reporters at her Lodwar office on Tuesday. A team of first responders was sent to the area to prevent an outbreak. "We are setting up a cholera treatment centre at Katilu Hospital and also distributing emergency kits and aquatabs for water treatment," Ajele said. She noted the Health ministry has been on high alert since January when cases were confirmed and those infected treated. Health and Sanitation Chief Officer Moses Natome said the department will educate residents on the disease and increase surveillance to prevent large scale infections.
