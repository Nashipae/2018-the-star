Love is in the air. Gospel singer Mr Seed proposed to long-term girlfriend Nimo Gachuiri at a Valentine's dinner organised by Bountiful Safaris for gospel artistes and their significant others. "Before proposing, I sought the counsel of my friends who are already married. DJ Mo was one of them, and even on the day before I went on one knee, he showed me what to do. This is a big step I have made, and with God, everything is possible." The celebrity-studded dinner was graced by the who is who in the gospel entertainment circles, but the highlight of the night was the surprise proposal by Mr Seed. In attendance were Size 8, DJ Mo, comedian Njugush, Abel Mutua, Guardian Angel and Betty Kyallo. "The dinner was at Azure Resort in Westlands, I planned the proposal on the day. I was so nervous and tense, my stomach had butterflies. She was so surprised. Alilia," Mr Seed said. Mr Seed, who is currently dominating the airwaves with the hit song "Oyoyo", went on one knee after a romantic dinner with Gachuiri and asked, "Will you marry me?" She said, "Yes!" The emotional Gachuiri broke down in tears as the singer serenaded her with lyrics from "Oyoyo". "We have not yet set the date for the wedding, but when I do, you will know," Mr Seed said. "She is so happy right now, her parents are also so happy." The event took place the same day fellow gospel singer Bahati welcomed his child Heaven Bahati with Diana Marua. From Word Is, we wish the couple all the best in their impending nuptials.
