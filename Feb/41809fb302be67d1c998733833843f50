Governor Mike Sonko on Friday said despite the county’s many problems, it collected Sh1.63 billion revenue last month. He told reporters the county gradually has been able to increase revenue collection since he took office last September. “By close of business on January 31, we collected and took Sh1,630,000,000 as revenue collected in January and took the cash to the Central Bank of Kenya Revenue Account,” Sonko said. The governor said they requested and submitted a statuary expenditure and work plan to the Controller of Budget. “The National Treasury released funds sourced from our local revenue as salary payment to the over 13,000 City Hall staff as well as the National Assembly staff amounting to more than Sh850 million,” he said. He said the county government has also paid for seven new bus terminuses for PSVs operators outside the CBD. “We are in the process of releasing down payment of Sh280 million to 18 road contractors who are currently on site,” Sonko said.
