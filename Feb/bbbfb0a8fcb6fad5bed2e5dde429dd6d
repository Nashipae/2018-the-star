The national government has announced plans to rehabilitate two key jetties in Lamu at a cost of Sh420 million. The Mokowe Customs and the Manda Jetty have been in a dilapidated state for years, posing a serious security risk to travellers. The two jetties serve over 30,000 locals and visitors coming to Lamu via road and air respectively. Speaking in Lamu  yesterday, chief structural engineer in the State Department of Public Works Hillary Nyaanga said the government had allocated Sh400 million for the  construction of the Mokowe Jetty and another Sh20 million for the rehabilitation of the Manda Airport Jetty. The Mokowe Customs Jetty, which is the only connection to Lamu and other islands in the county, has been terrible, as travellers are forced to use one side after the other part completely collapsed into the Indian Ocean. Anyone coming to Lamu via road has to go through the Mokowe Customs Jetty. The Manda Jetty serves those coming to Lamu town from Manda Airport and Manda Island respectively. The two jetties are, therefore, vital connections of Lamu town to the mainland and other islands. Kenya Ports Authority engineers, who spoke in Lamu town yesterday, said, normally, the jetties are supposed to be serviced every five years but that hasn’t been the case: They have never been serviced since they were built. The Mokowe Jetty was established more than 15 years ago, while the Manda one has been in place for over seven years. Nyaanga said rehabilitating the Mokowe Customs would be unrealistic and dangerous, considering its current state. The jetties are a crucial component in the county’s transport system, considering that at least 99 per cent movement to and from Lamu town is by water.
