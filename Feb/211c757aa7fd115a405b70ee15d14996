Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka on Monday backed Raila Odinga in dismissing calls by foreign envoys to recognise Uhuru Kenyatta's presidency. Kalonzo said NASA and NRM are a people-driven movements whose ideologies are embedded in the hearts of their supporters. He said "forcing them to recognise an illegitimate regime will be futile" since the leaders cannot dictate to their supporters on what to do or not. "NASA and NRM is an idea which is in the minds and hearts of our people. Even if you force Raila and me to recognise Uhuru, you can’t force the supporters.” Kalonzo made the remarks while addressing Wiper supporters from Mavoko Constituency who paid him a courtesy call at Wiper offices in Lavington. He said the envoys cannot force leaders to recognise a regime whose leadership was gotten through blatant electoral injustices. On Sunday, US Ambassador Robert Godec led ten other envoys to Kenya in asking Raila to recognise Uhuru as the legitimate head of state. They said this would form a basis for initiating dialogue which many Kenyans are yearning for. The diplomats condemned government’s recent shutdown of TV stations and the crackdown on opposition leaders and urged President Kenyatta to respect the rule of law. They also warned NASA against stoking violence or trying to seize power through illegitimate means following Raila's swearing in.
