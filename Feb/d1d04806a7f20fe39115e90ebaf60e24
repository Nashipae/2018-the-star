The government has
purchased 100,000 metric tonnes of subsidized fertilizer to be sold
to farmers at Sh1,200 per 50kg bag from Sh1,800. Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe said that the CAN or planting
fertilizer is currently being transported from the port of Mombasa to
the National Cereals and Produce Board stores in readinesses for the
planting season. “Last season,
the government was selling subsidized fertiliser to farmers at
Sh1,800 but this season, the price has been reduced by 33.3 per cent
to sell at Sh1,200. This is in line with the Presidential directive
to reduce the price so that more farmers would afford to buy
fertiliser and hence increase productivity,” he said. Lesiyampe said the
assorted
fertiliser
will be distributed to the
more than two million registered farmers
for the coming long rains season expected to start mid next month,
though
farmers in parts of Narok County have already started planting. He advised farmers
to ensure they have fertiliser on time so that it can have an impact
on production. The
PS noted that farmers
consume about 600,000 metric tonnes of
fertiliser annually
and the
government only provides between 25-30 per cent of this. “The
government subsidy is below one third while the privates sector
provides two
thirds which is about 450,000 metric
tonnes,” said Lesiyampe. NCPB managing
director Newton Terer had said the amount of fertilizer purchased
would not be sufficient for all farmers nationwide saying about 10-12
million bags are required annually. Farmers especially
in the North Rift have been calling upon the national government to
make adequate subsidized fertilizer available in time and at
affordable prices. Kenya Farmers’
Association Uasin Gishu branch director Kipkorir Menjo early last
week said having the input in time and at the affordable prices would
help them to plant early.
