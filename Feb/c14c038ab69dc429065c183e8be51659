Today is the International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM and Kenya has made considerable progress — yet the barbaric practice is creeping back. It has gone underground and is carried out without celebration, often at night and even in clinics with complicit medical personnel. Children as young as four years old have been mutilated. Some unmutilated girls and their families are stigmatised. This pressure forces girls to seek the cut rather than be ostracised. Some married women beg to be mutilated because ignorant husbands reject them. Craven politicians are silent because they fear they will lose the FGM vote. FGM is a violation of human rights, it carries great health risks and has no moral benefit. About 78 percent of Maasai women and 86 percent of Samburu women between 15 and 49 years have been mutilated. In Kenya 21 per cent of women have been violated. The situation is intolerable and must end. Pressure must be maintained. More resources and personnel must be availed. Any medical practitioner or midwife who mutilates a girl must be jailed. Parents who torture their children belong in jail. Quote of the Day: “None but ourselves can free our minds.” — Bob Marley, Jamaican reggae musician and singer-songwriter, was born on February 6, 1945.
