Newly appointed Lands CAS Gideon Mung’aro on Thursday told a parliamentary committee that the National Land Commission should be dissolved and the commissioners employed part time once the term of the current team expires. The former Kilifi North MP told the committee chaired by Kitui West MP Rachel Nyamai the number of commissioners should be reduced to five and the secretariat scaled down to save on costs. “This is will solve a lot of issues,” Mung’aro said. The NLC’s six-year non-renewable term ends in February next year.
