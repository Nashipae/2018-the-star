The Land and Environment Court yesterday ordered Prime Bank to hand over three accounts registered under St Mary’s Hospital (pictured) management to the Assumption Sisters of Nairobi. This came as the row over the ownership of St Mary’s hospitals continues. It pits an American priest against the sisters. The Catholic sisters accused missionary William Frdya of shortchanging them by trying to change ownership of the property to his name. “Prime Bank is hereby ordered to retain the two accounts owned by Dr William Fryda,” Justice Sila Munyao said. He also directed the bank to ensure Fryda surrenders and changes his signatory on the accounts and ceases to operate them. The sisters, through lawyer Winnie Wambugu, sued and instituted court contempt charges against the bank, accusing it of failing to give out St Mary’s Hospital accounts to them as ordered on November 26 last year. Munyao had ordered that the hospitals in Lang’ata, Nairobi, and Elementaita, Nakuru, be placed under charitable trust of ASN and the bank.
