The National Land Commission plans to revoke title deeds of all riparian lands in Malindi. Chairman Muhammad Swazuri on Sunday said the lands were allegedly acquired illegally after the Indian Ocean receded. Top among the lands set to have its title deed revoked is a property in front of the Malindi Muslim Cemetery, which has ownership dispute. The land reportedly belonged to the Waqfu Commission of Kenya, but a private developer allegedly obtained a title deed for riparian land in front of the cemetery when the sea receded. Malindi Muslims held a demonstration two weeks ago to protest against the acquisition of the land. On Sunday, Swazuri met members of the Waqfu Commission and a section of Malindi Muslim leaders over the issue. He has directed his staff to write a notice of revocation of the title deed and others on riparian land. “All those who invaded riparian lands and obtained title deeds are going to lose them,” he said. In Malindi, he said, the ocean had receded more than 1.1 kilometre and that’s why people are scrambling to own the land.
