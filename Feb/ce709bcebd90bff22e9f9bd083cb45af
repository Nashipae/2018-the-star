The Kenya Bureau of Standards has warned hotels and event organisers against procuring packaged drinking water that has not been certified. Managing Director Charles Ongwae said some have been distributing this water to their clients. This, he noted, exposes them to health hazards so Kebs will be seize and destroy the products, and take legal action against the business people. "Hoteliers, event organisers and members of the public are advised to confirm the validity of the standardization mark by sending a text message containing the permit number to 20023 in this format - SM#12345," he said. Ongwae noted it is illegal to manufacture or offer any product for sale if it does not conform to Kebs' standards as the law requires. "Water is a high risk product so there is urgent need to regulate it and weed out fraudulent players who bottle substandard water and selling it to unsuspecting consumers," he said. “Water is listed as a high risk commodity so slight contamination can lead to sickness and loss of lives."
