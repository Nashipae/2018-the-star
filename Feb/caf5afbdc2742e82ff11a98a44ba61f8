Cases of chikungunya virus have been reported in Lamu county. Four people who tested positive for the Chikungunya virus are all from Tchundwa village, Lamu East. Acting Health chief officer David Mulewa said blood samples from residents who had shown symptoms of chikungunya were sent to the Kenya Medical Research Institute early this month. Four tested positive. The symptoms included joint pain and high fever. “Samples were from more than 10 individuals, but only four tested positive for the virus. We are doing the much we can to ensure the situation doesn’t escalate,” Mulewa said. He said the Health department has launched massive awareness campaigns across the county to educate residents on how to avoid contracting the virus. Residents in areas notorious for harbouring mosquitoes like Tchundwa and Witu have also been urged to clear stagnant water near their residences. Standing water provides a breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Health executive Raphael Munyua said the county has spraying insecticides in all villages in the county.
