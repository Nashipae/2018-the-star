A group of Homa Bay leaders have accused Jubilee of frustrating NASA politicians after their leader Raila Odinga was sworn-in last Tuesday. Rangwe MP Lilian Gogo, Homa Bay Bunge la Wenye Nchi chairman Walter Opiyo and coordinator Okano Nyasanga have expressed concern over the arrest and intimidation of NASA leaders. Ruaraka MP Tom Kajwang’, his Makadara counterpart George Aladwa and National Resistance Movement ‘General’ Miguna Miguna have been arrested in connection with Raila’s oath. Speaking when she flagged off a new ambulance at Rangwe subcounty hospital on Saturday, Gogo said it was wrong for the Jubilee administration to keep frustrating opposition leaders. “The frustration the opposition politicians experience at the hands of the Jubilee administration will not help this country. It is just aggravating the situation,” Gogo said. She urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to ensure peace prevails. Gogo said chaos will hamper the implementation of projects. She said Uhuru should focus on leaving a legacy instead of frustrating his foes. “This calls for creating peaceful coexistence which creates an enabling environment for development,” Gogo said. She said Jubilee should not look at opposition MPs as their enemies.
