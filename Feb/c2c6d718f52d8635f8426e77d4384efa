The court yesterday issued summons for an investigating officer to appear in court in a case in which blogger Cyprian Nyakundi is charged with publishing defamatory information on his twitter handle. Nyakundi (pictured) is said to have published the information against Interior CS Fred Matiang’i. The case had been scheduled for hearing before Milimani resident magistrate Charity Ngagi, but it could not proceed since the investigating officer had not supplied copies of witness statements to the defence. This prompted the court to issue summons for the investigating officer to appear in court next Monday to explain why he has not supplied all copies of witness statements to the defence. The prosecution says on January 23, 2018, Nyakundi published defamatory information against the CS Matiang’i. When Nyakundi first appeared in court for plea taking, he was granted Sh500,000 bond or Sh100,000 bail. This was after the magistrate dismissed his request to remain on High Court anticipatory bail of Sh100,000. The court concurred with the prosecution that Nyakundi’s personal bond granted by the High Court was an interim order, pending charges since by then he was a suspect. Earlier, chief magistrate Francis Andayi had issued a warrant of arrest against Nyakundi. Nyakundi was arrested by the DCI officers.
