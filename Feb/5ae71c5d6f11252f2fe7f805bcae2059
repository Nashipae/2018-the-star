The fight between Otile brown and Timmy T Dat raised a lot of eyebrows. This two have been good friends, and when the video of their fight went viral, everyone wanted to know what really happened. Speaking exclusively to Word Is, they cleared the air. Otile and TImmy came for the interview together, and from their chemistry, it was clear their beef was over. They were asked if that was a real fight or a public stunt to capture fans' attention for their new song, Tam Tam. Timmy said where they are now is at the peak of their careers, and so they do not need cheap publicity stunts to capture the public's attention. So the fight was very real and they confessed it brought them down at that point in their career, life and even in terms of their friendship. Timmy said: "Our fight made us lose a lot of money, especially form the corporate world and events, because when they call either of us, it was evident hatukutaka kupiga show pamoja." Rumour had it they fought because of a video vixen in their hit song, Wembe. Asked about this, Otile Brown said, "Naamini kwamba kitu kinaweza tufanye tukosane ni hela wala si mwanamke becasuse sio kwamba I am braging but DM zetu zimejaa wasichana wengi sana. Ilkuwa tu misunderstanding kidogo." Timmy T Dat interjected and said their fight was because of a misunderstanding that involved money, and they also blamed it on the alcohol that clearly impaired their judgment. Otile Brown said their public fist-throwing cost them not only money but fans, too. They received numerous calls and texts asking them to reconcile. Timmy even said his niece called him crying for reconciliation, as she considers Otile Brown her uncle. They apologised to their fans, asking them to understand that man is to err, and what matters is that they will pick up the pieces and move on to be the best they can be. So we can be sure there is more in store from the duo.
