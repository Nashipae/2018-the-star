Uhuru is said to have also warned that he and his deputy William Ruto, who also attended the meeting, will not tolerate wrangles within the party. This warning comes at a time when there are reports that some MPs were preparing to reject some of Uhuru's nominees to Cabinet on Wednesday. It also comes weeks after some of the party's MPs were kicked out of Parliamentary committees' leadership positions following orders from Uhuru. Last month Uhuru summoned MPs from four committees after some of them defied the party's directive to resign from the committees they were elected to head. These were Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter, Moiben’s Silas Tiren, Marakwet MP David Bowen and Emgwen's Alex Kosgey. The four were accused of defying the party's directive on equitable sharing of Parliamentary positions to accommodate all regions.

According to Uhuru's press team, the President called for rapid implementation of legislation that will secure delivery of the Big Four Agenda. Uhuru said that both the party and the executive were focused on a legislative agenda that will ensure swift execution of the Big Four. The Big Four Plan includes the provision of affordable housing, universal healthcare, food security and enhanced manufacturing. Uhuru cited the Energy Bill, Land Index Bill, Roads Bill and Cyber Crime Bill as some of the legislation that should be given priority. “We need to pass laws that will enable us to achieve the agenda that will transform the lives of Kenyans. There is no time. We have to maximise the resources at our disposal,” the President said. The President also said names of members of the Judicial Service Commission have been forwarded to Parliament for further action. The PG meeting agreed to work closely to support the Big Four Agenda through legislation and approval of the budget provisions. Ruto said supporting the Big Four Agenda will help in securing the President’s legacy and ensure that the Jubilee manifesto achieves its targets. The Deputy President asked members to work towards ensuring that Jubilee remains a vibrant party that unites the country. “We formed Jubilee as a party of all regions that will remove the politics that breeds division, hatred and ethnicity. We will continue to share with you the vision that makes Jubilee a party that is focused on bringing together all Kenyans,” Ruto said. National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale and Jubilee Party Secretary-General Raphael Tuju also addressed the meeting.
