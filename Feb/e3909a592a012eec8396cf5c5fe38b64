Most parts of the country will remain dry throughout this month, the weatherman has said. Meteorological services director Peter Ambenje said February is normally a dry month. He advised farmers to prepare their land for the planting season expected to begin in March during the long rains. They last through May. A few areas within the Lake Victoria Basin, Central Rift Valley and Western Highlands will receive some rainfall during February. “The rainfall will occasionally spread to the Central region including Nairobi,” Ambenje said. He told those in areas with dry vegetation and strong winds to be alert, saying the dry season is associated with wild fires. “Formation of dust devils will be common in various parts of the country where the temperatures are high. This could reduce visibility,” Ambenje said. “Last month, there was significant rainfall in the Lake Victoria Basin, highlands west of the Rift Valley, the Central Rift Valley and Central highlands including Nairobi. We expect the same to happen this month.” Crops in Central and Eastern regions have failed because of drought, heightening the likelihood of food scarcity in the coming days. Outgoing Agriculture CS Willy Bett said the government will in March allow importation of maize from Uganda and Tanzania in to lower Maize flour prices. “We are closely monitoring the situation to ensure a 2kg packet of maize flour does not increase beyond the Sh115 that the government agreed with millers. By February, we are expecting that the supply of maize will start declining and importation will help stabilise the prices,” Bett said. The government is currently buying maize from farmers to stock the Strategic Grain Reserve amid hoarding fears.
