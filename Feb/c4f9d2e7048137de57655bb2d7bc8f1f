National champions Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) are in the capital for a clash against Strathmore University’s Blades. Coach Sammy Kiki said his team is ready to take on the Blades in the Premier League play off finals at the Africa Nazarene University (ANU) indoor courts this afternoon. His main worry remains the unavailability of forward Arou Ramadhan. “He is one of my key players but he has not been able to train. I am just hopeful that he will show up. If he misses, I have other options. I had a session with my players who are based outside Mombasa for once. We also trained well in Nairobi. We are ready,” said Kiki. He said that veteran Tobias Odumbe, Victor Odendo and Victor Bosire had sessions together with their Mombasa-based teammates and this has given him confidence heading into the encounter. His target is to win at least one of the two games in Nairobi. He said he has great respect for his opponents for having made it to the finals. “They have worked hard to get here. We will play like we are meeting any other big team. Their strength lies at the back court.” The women’s finals will pit reigning champions Equity Bank against unbeaten KPA. The lower division finals are already on going with KDF Morans against Emyba and World Hope taking on Lakeside. Footprints also meet  Masaku Sparks in the ladies finals.
