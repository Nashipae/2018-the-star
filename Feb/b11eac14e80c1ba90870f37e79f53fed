Mwingi professionals and the business community yesterday condemned the attack on Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka’s home on Tuesday night. Coordinator Campel Munyambu said the act was cowardly and the attackers should be ashamed. He said Kalonzo is God-fearing and that could explain why the attack did not succeed. “For heavens sake, they know very well Kalonzo’s wife Pauline is sick and they hurl a grenade at his home and spray bullets. Where is their humanity? Why couldn’t they pity his wife. It’s disturbing to see the government reduce a leader to nothing. Where is their respect for our leaders?” he said. He expressed fears at “what the government is up to since Tuesday, when it withdrew Kalonzo’s security so he couldn’t attend the NASA event”. Munyambu said Kalonzo, Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang’ula were blocked from attending the oath. He said it was good NASA leader Raila Odinga defended the trio in public, saying Kalonzo will be sworn in later. Munyambu urged the Kamba community to emulate the Luo community, which stands strongly behind its leaders. “Had Raila’s security been withdrawn, he could have had more than 100 volunteer private guards. But see what happened, only a few Kambas stood for Kalonzo. I’m sure if Raila is arrested, his people can even go for him without fear of a bullet,” he said, adding Kambas are solidly in NASA and will not quit, however much JP might try to divide the alliance.
