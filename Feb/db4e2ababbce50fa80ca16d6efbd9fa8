Armed police officers have teamed up with Nairobi County inspectorate officers to flush hawkers out of the city centre. The officers have made several arrests on Tom Mboya, Ronald Ngala and Mfangamano Streets and on River Road. A spot check by the Star on Sunday found that hawkers near Bus Station and along Ronald Ngala street were not spared. Cries filled the air as some begged police and officers not to arrest them. The operation began last Thursday and is to last 14 days.

Most traders have condemned the operation noting they do not have other sources of income. Several of the police officers said they were following orders. "We were clearly instructed to arrest any hawker found conducting business within the city centre," one who did not wish to be named said today. Residents complained as the hawkers have taken over many streets. It is easy to woo customers as they walk by but the county wants them at designated locations. In November last year, Governor Mike Sonko announced plans to relocate the hawkers to Mwaririro Market in Kariokor ward. This is yet to happen. Peter Mbaya, Nairobi County Director for Operations, earlier said the askaris and officers will carry on with the crackdown until the CBD regains its lost glory. "Law and order must be followed by everyone in this city. Hawkers and boda boda operators are not exempt," he said last week.
