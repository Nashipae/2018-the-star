Residents of PH village in Kinangop have decried runaway insecurity in the area. This is after six donkeys and cow were stolen and slaughtered in a land believed to belong to President Uhuru Kenyatta’s family on Wednesday night. The forested land is on the Kwa haraka-Keracha road. The donkeys were stolen from different farmers while the cow belonged to Gichungu Kioi, a teacher at Rwa Nyambo Primary School. Kioi yesterday said he realised his cow was missing 2am, after another cow started moving around home compound and mooing. He said the thieves had cut the fence. He raised the alarm and neighbours came out to assist him to look for the cow. At 4am the search party discovered saw a fence on the land said to belong to the Kenyatta family had also been cut. “When we went to the farm, we found the carcasses of the six donkeys and my cow. The donkeys had been skinned, while my cow's head had been cut off,” Kioi said Residents said the thieves are daring to slaughter stolen animals in a land that is secured. Resident Solomon Njenga accused police of laxity, saying they don’t respond in time when a distress call is made. Resident Peninah Mwangi said their patience is running out. “This land belongs to our leader, President Uhuru Kenyatta. We must be given security. We won’t tolerate crime anymore,” she said Kinangop police boss Eliud Monari could not be reached for comment. His phone was picked by someone who said he was not near, and when the Star called after sometime the call went unanswered.
