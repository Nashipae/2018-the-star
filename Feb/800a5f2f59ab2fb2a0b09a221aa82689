It’s hard not to feel sorry for financially struggling Nakumatt as they prepare to face off with Thika United in their second Kenyan Premier League match this afternoon at Ruaraka. The fortunes of the club, once touted as the money bags in the Kenyan football circles, have taken a nosedive as their sponsors battle to stay afloat in the supermarket business. But football is a ruthless game and as Gor Mahia showed when they thrashed them 4-0 in the opener last weekend, no team will go into a duel feeling sorry for Nakumatt. Thika are also feeling the pinch as the KPL title sponsors, SportPesa, disembarked. Their one-time benefactors — Brookside — are also unclear in the relationship with the club that was once their pride. However, Nicholas Muyoti’s side will be hoping to soothe that ache with their first points of the campaign against a side that is largely uninspired off the pitch. Sofapaka will be in Mumias looking to atone for the embarrassing 3-0 thrashing they endured on the opening day of the season when they visit Kakamega Homeboyz. The hosts, with an opportunity to hit the summit early, will not give them any reprieve as they seek their second successive win and Sam Ssibwa and his charges will need to be at their best to get anything out of this tie. “We lost to our opening match because the team had not gelled but prepare to see a vastly improved Sofapaka against Homeboyz,” said Batoto Ba Mungu Ssimbwa. “We have good players and from the way I see, they are gradually gelling and you should expect a descent score-line. Mistakes are always there but the worst one can do is to repeat them as this is unforgivable,” said Ssimbwa. Tomorrow, Mathare United will hope to build up on their away victory last weekend when they host Nzoia Sugar who will be out in search of their first points of the campaign.
