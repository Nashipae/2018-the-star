Gaspae Kwedho, 30, was accused of defrauding Njoka of Sh850,000 by pretending he was in a position to sell him a car. He appeared before senior principal magistrate Kenneth Cheruyiot. According to court documents, Kwedho, jointly with others not before court, had intent to defraud the amount from Njoka on December, 30 last year, at DSM place, where Mediamax is located along Kijabe street.

The matter will be mentioned on February 26 and heard on March 12.
