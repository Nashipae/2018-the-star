TSC has transferred non-local teachers from Wajir after three of their colleagues were killed by al Shabaab militants last week. "You should make arrangements to report to the new station immediately," read part of the letter from TSC. The commission said the affected teachers have 14 days to notify the education director of the county they are transferring to. "The county directors of those counties that you have been transferred to are requested to inform the headquarters of the date you report for duty so that your salary can be paid through the new station," the TSC letter said. Teachers unions Knut and Kuppet have been calling on the government to withdraw all teachers from terror-prone counties in North Eastern following the killing on Friday. The three teachers were killed by suspected al Shabaab militants who raided Qarsa Primary School at dawn. One teacher sustained serious injuries. Police said the terrorists targeted non-local teachers in the school compound.

Misori asked the Teachers Service Commission to withdraw the teachers until the region is safe. "TSC only issued a feeble statement on the issue -  a very sad affair. Up to now, the Interior Cabinet Secretary has not offered any explanation on the issue of attacks on teachers." One suspect has been arrested following the killing. North Eastern Regional Coordinator Mohamud Saleh said a team of multi-agency security agents found the suspect and are pursuing two others on the run.
