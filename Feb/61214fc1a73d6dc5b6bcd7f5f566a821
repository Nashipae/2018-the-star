The ceremony to install Dagoretti North MP Simba Arati as the Kisii spokesman which was to take place at the Gusii Stadium yesterday did not take place. By 11am, there was no activity at the stadium. Speaking at Mwalimu Hotel on Saturday, some of the leaders and the youths drawn from Kisii and Nyamira counties said plans for the ceremony were at an advanced stage. Zablon Mosara and Bishop Boniface Mosoti said they will not be intimidated into calling off the ceremony. “Arati has the ability to articulate the issues affecting us,” Mosara said. Mosoti said the community needs eloquent leaders like the Dagoretti North MP. It is unclear why organisers postponed the event. On Friday, Kisii Council of Elders chairman Araka Matundura said the ceremony is misplaced. He said those behind it are provoking the elders’ council. Matundura said there are senior leaders in the community who are more deserving of the position. The chairman singled out Governor James Ongwae, his Nyamira counterpart John Nyagarama, Senator Sam Ongeri and Chief Administrative Secretary Chris Obure as leaders fit for the position. Matundura said former Minister Simon Nyachae was the last spokesman. He said he deserved the post because of his experience.
