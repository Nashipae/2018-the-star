Bungoma Maendelo Chap Chap chairman Kennedy Wanjala has praised President Uhuru Kenyatta for nominating a Cabinet that reflects the face of Kenya. Wanjala said the list of CS nominees has a regional and gender balance. Speaking to the Star in Webuye town on Tuesday, Wanjala said Uhuru has honoured his promise by incorporating Luhyas in his government. “ Luhyas overwhelmingly voted for Jubilee in ast year’s polls and we have received our rightful share,” he said. He asked Uhuru to appoint more Luhyas from Western Kenya counties to key government positions. “Even as we get our sons employed by the Jubilee regime, we want them to live up to the resident’s expectations by serving wananchi honestly and diligently,” he said. The President named his Cabinet that included three Luhyas, Eugene Wamalwa, Rashid Aches and Ababu Namwamba. Wanjala asked residents not to support NASA’s swearing-in of Raila Odinga as the People’s President.
