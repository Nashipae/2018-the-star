Eighty-six schools in Nyeri have received titles, as the government moves in to secure all public institutions and utilities. The titles were processed by the National Land Commission on Friday and handed over to head teachers at Kihuti Secondary School in Mukurwe-ini, Nyeri. Kagumo High School and ishop Gatimu Ngandu Girls were among the beneficiaries. Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga lauded the move, saying it would go a long way in ending cases of land grabbing that have become synonymous with public parcels.Kahiga said they were working closely with the NLC to fast tract the issuance of titles to the remaining schools. “Besides cushioning schools spaces against grabbing, the title deeds will give them a sense of ownership, as well as act as collateral to secure loans for development,” he said. County land registrar Jonah Mwabia said some other 155 titles are being processed and would be issued once complete. Some of the schools that received land ownership documents include Kagumo High School and Bishop Gatimu Ngandu Girls.
