South Africa’s Parliament will elect Cyril Ramaphosa as new president at 2pm local time (1200 GMT) on Thursday and have him take the oath of office. “The office of the chief justice has made itself available today to officiate in the business of electing a new president,” African National Congress chief whip, Jackson Mthembu, told a parliamentary committee meeting. At the same meeting, the speaker of Parliament said a letter of resignation from President Jacob Zuma, who stepped down late on Wednesday rather than face a no-confidence vote from his own party, was “still on its way”. The United States earlier said it was closely monitoring events in SA following Zuma's announcement. "This is an internal matter that reflects the will of South Africa's elected leadership," a State Department official said in a statement.
