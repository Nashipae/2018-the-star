More than 200 pupils of Etono Boarding School in Bomwagamo, Nyamira spent the night in the cold after a huge fire gutted down their two dormitories. Nothing was salvaged as everything went up in flames. Efforts by the Nyamira County fire department to put out the fire did not succeed as the fire engine arrived too late. Read; No one was injured during the incident. "We were having a consultative meeting between teachers, pupils and some parents when the alarm was raised by one of the school workers. We responded immediately but we could not do much as we did not have enough extinguishing equipment at our disposal," the head teacher Evans Ombati told the Star. Area OCPD Maurice Asila said the cause of the fire is yet to be established. The County Education team led by Director of Education Nelson Sifuna said a detailed report on the incident will be given after investigations. Area MCA Charles Barongo said the county government emergency response team needs to be quick in responding to such disasters. "We have an emergency team but in most case,  it responds late when damage has already occurred and we urge the county government to make sure it responds as fast as possible during such incidents,” Barongo said.
