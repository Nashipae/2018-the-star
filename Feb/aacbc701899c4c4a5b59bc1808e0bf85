NASA leaders yesterday told off the US government, the African Union and European Union after they criticised opposition leader Raila Odinga for taking an oath of office as the People’s President. They are ODM chairman John Mbadi, Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala and Nyando MP Jared Okelo. They said the remarks were uncalled for. Okelo said the European Election Observation Mission in the August 2017 General Election released a “scathing and harsh indictment” of the conduct of the polls.

The AU is always known for its penchant for the status quo,” he told the Star on the phone on Friday. “They, firstly, should push Uhuru Kenyatta and the Jubilee honchos to release seized transmission gadgets to media houses to allow them to resume broadcasting before they talk about any legitimacy or legality of anything.” Malala said the organisations turned a blind eye on them when they needed them the most. He said the push for reforms is unstoppable. “We gave them time to address this matter, but they put on wooden glasses pretending everything is well.Time has lapsed. Let them ask Uhuru to recognise Raila as the People’s President,” he said. On Friday, the US government, EU and AU criticised Raila for taking an oath. In a statement, the US government said it was “gravely concerned” about Raila’s swearing-in that took place at Uhuru Park, Nairobi, on Tuesday. “We reject actions that undermine Kenya’s Constitution and the rule of law. Uhuru Kenyatta was elected as President of the Republic of Kenya on October 26, 2017 in a poll that was upheld by Kenya’s Supreme Court,” stated the statement by Department of State spokesperson Heather Nauert.
