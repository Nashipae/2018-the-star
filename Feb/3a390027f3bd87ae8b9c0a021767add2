Jubilee legislators in Embu yesterday expressed mixed reactions on the swearing-in of NASA leader Raila Odinga. Some want him arrested, while others say his arrest would be a bad idea. Senator Njeru Ndwiga and MPs John Muchiri of Manyatta, Erick Muchangi of Runyenjes, and Geoffrey King'ang'i of Mbeere South described Raila's swearing-in as the People's President on Tuesday as a big political comedy. They spoke to the Star on the phone. Ndwiga, Muchiri and Muchangi, however, urged the government not to arrest Raila. They said his swearing-in was of no consequence and it should be ignored. “There is nothing treasonous about what he did. It was an ODM affair. Raila was telling his ODM supporters he will serve them. I don’t see why we should dramatise this thing. That thing should be left to die the way it is. It’s a dead thing,” Muchiri said Ndwiga said Raila had ruined his political image nationally and internationally. He praised Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula and ANC's Musalia Mudavadi for not attending the swearing-in event. Ndwiga urged the opposition to play its rightful role and those in the government to serve the citizens as they pledged. Muchiri said there is nothing like swearing-in that took place. “If I were President Uhuru Kenyatta, I would just assume nothing has happened,” he said. Muchangi asked the authority to assess whether what Raila did was unlawful or not. He, however, described the swearing-in as inconsequential. Kingangi urged Kenyans to concentrate on development instead of sideshows. He said nobody is above the law, whether he is supported by millions of people. The MP said Raila broke the law and he should be arrested and charged. “We should not have some people allowed to go home after breaking the laws while others are acted upon,” he said.
