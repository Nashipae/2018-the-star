Mathare United coach Francis Kimanzi was left purring after the boys produced an away win over debutantes Vihiga United in their opening Kenyan Premier League match. New boy Clifford Alwanga lived up to his pre-season promise of banging in the goals for the slum boys after sealing a move from Tusker as he netted a brace in the come from behind win that bodes well for Mathare. Reflecting on the overall team performance on the club’s official portal, Kimanzi expressed his delight at the maturity exhibited by his charges after falling behind early in the first half. “You always don’t want to concede first because it can be very difficult to come back especially when playing away. They have done it in pre-season and they repeated it. We have a belief that even if they score, we still can do it. It is a very good mental attribute,” assessed Kimanzi. “We are happy and lucky that we got the three points because the first game of the season is always very tricky. It was a good display and I know we can play even better. With three points and two goals, the journey starts and the urge to win more games sets in,” he added. Mathare next host Nzoia United in Machakos on Sunday in search of their first win on the spin in the opening couple of games in over three years.
