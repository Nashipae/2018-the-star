Makueni is generating increased donor interest, Governor Kivutha Kibwana said yesterday. He attributed this to good governance and prudent spending of public funds. “We’re happy our government is receiving increased donor attention. This is important to us because we’re likely to get more resources to fund sectors inadequately funded by the devolved resources,” Kibwana said at a public participation conference on the county’s 2018-22 integrated development plan at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre, Nairobi. “Many donors are interested in engaging the county because many of the successful projects and programmes we rolled out were implemented in my first term,” he said. The county will continue to welcome development partners willing to engage and help it to achieve its plans, Kibwana said. The county has also rolled out a successful universal healthcare programme targetting more than 150,000 residents. “During my first term, the county set up a fruit-processing plant in Kalamba and a dairy milk processing plant in Kikima. They’ve become development models for the devolved governments,” he said. Construction of the multi-million shilling Thwake Bridge is under way. It’s partly funded by the national government. Other projects being implemented include roads in Wote town, a bus stage in Makindu and major investment in the health sector, including improved equipment in hospitals. “We’re working on major improvements in the water sector to ensure clean water in urban and rural areas,” Kibwana said. The region is known for dry spells that lead to water shortages. Residents struggle to get water because of unreliable rains. Kibwana said public participation forums held with the Makueni diaspora in Mombasa would involve leaders and locals.
