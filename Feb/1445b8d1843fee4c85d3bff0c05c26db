The National Lands Commission has identified 14 “landlords”
who had illegally angled for a double compensation to pave way for expansion of Mombasa
– Mariakani road. Chairman Mohamed Swazuri said the 14 plots had been paid
for by the state between 1954-76. He said surveyors then failed to place beacons, despite having a letter of purchase, thus allowing repossession. Swazuri said only 25-30 per cent of plots on road reserves
have beacons. “The law prohibits the government from buying land
twice,” he said. Swazuri said lack of beacons has created perfect ground for
rogue landlords and encroachers to thrive. “They find this as perfect opportunity to get
compensation for land when roads are expanded,” he said. “They will claim to have bought the land and even produce
title deeds - which we don’t know how they got them – to prove ownership.” Swazuri spoke on Monday in Mombasa at Kenya School of Government. Swazuri said compensation will only be made to owners of structures
constructed on road reserves. Beside the 14, six other plots are also in dispute and the commission
is yet to determine whether they had been purchased by the government. Swazuri noted subdivision and amalgamation is a trick
used by fraudsters to “eliminate” record history of plots. This has encouraged absentee landlords who Swazuri said
have refused to come out despite a notice. “Such plots will now become public land as stated by the
law,” he said. Ends…
