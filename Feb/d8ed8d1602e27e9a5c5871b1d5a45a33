Kenya and Uganda have agreed to end harassment of Kenyan fishermen on Lake Victoria by introducing radars to monitor boats instead of security personnel. President Uhuru Kenyatta and Uganda's Yoweri Museveni made the announcement on Saturday. They spoke at the opening of the Busia One Stop border post built with the help of the British and Canadian governments. Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong told Museveni his soldiers harass Kenyan fishermen for fishing on "imaginary Ugandan waters" on Lake Victoria. "Getting a Kenyan to eat raw fish by a Ugandan is not a good thing. We have lived peacefully for ages and this culture of mistreating others should be discarded in the spirit of East African Cooperation," he said. Museveni admitted he has been using guerilla warfare to prevent the harvesting of premature fish. He said this has paid off and the lake is now stocked with mature fish. "I am in talks with President Uhuru and Dr John Magufuli of Tanzania to introduce surface radar to monitor boats plying the lake instead of soldiers. There will be need to agree on standard size of boats to operate since some sizes may not be detected by the radar," he said. Uhuru said Kenyan fishermen can now go about with their work without fear. Uhuru and Museveni said boundaries should be abolished as they are an invention of colonialists. "We want to see East Africans coming together and competing with [the Asian] tigers and crisscrossing to member states without restrictions." Museveni said there is need for truck scanners to prevent smuggling of deadly weapons across the borders. "I used to smuggle machines guns through the border during liberation struggle but they could not be detected," he said.
