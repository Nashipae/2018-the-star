My swearing in is illegal but I am ready for the consequences, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said. Kalonzo, speaking in Athi River on Tuesday, said the 'oathing' plan will be against the law is done without proper legal consultation. "Raila Odinga and I know that swearing in is against the Constitution. So, if we say that we shall take the illegal oath and we agree on the consequences, then I am ready." The former Vice President added that he will have to consult the other NASA principals before he is sworn in adding that Raila's case was different "since police are afraid of arresting him." "They were afraid of arresting Raila because they know that would lead to massive chaos," Kalonzo said. Raila swore himself in on January 30. Kalonzo, Musalia Mudavadi (Amani National Congress) and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya) skipped the event.

The NASA principal termed the claims "propaganda and Jubilee traps" and said the announcement will be made "later". It was reported that Kalonzo will take his oath on this date at Uhuru Park in Nairobi. On this, the Wiper boss said: "I could have not taken the oath on the day Raila took the oath. We had a strategy for him to start and for me to be sworn-in later."
