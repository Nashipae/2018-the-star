K24 news anchor Ian Wafula is not a happy man after he lost a lot of money and his car to hardcore conmen. He has opened up about the experience, saying that it has been depressing. "Very often, social pressure and expectations force us to hide behind our jobs; that our lives are perfect, free of baggage. NO. It has been a depressing couple of months after a car I owned for a whole year became the subject of investigations," Ian Wafula said. The silver screen stud narrated how he was conned. "I traded in my Toyota Axio for a VW Jetta at a Car Bazaar on Ngong Road owned by Collins Bootsy Muraya, and instead, he did not remit the money to the original Jetta owner. The owner in turn claims that after Collins vanished, he sold the car to his lawyer who had eyed it, and the two managed to change its ownership; all this while I was in possession of the car." Due to this legal glitch, the police were involved and things went south really fast. Ian said: "Police suspect foul play but until investigations are done, all I have are many unanswered questions. Thousands of innocent buyers fall into the hands of such individuals, especially we young people. Don’t be caught up in excitement while purchasing an asset. Be keen to check the car history with KRA before checking with NTSA’s portal, which I have since learnt is highly temperable. As it stands, I might have just lost two cars in essence. Stay woke!" Ian told Word Is Muraya has reached out to him, asking that they settle the matter away from the police, but he doesn't like that idea. "He has been summoned several times to the police station and he has never come. He has been ignoring summons," he said.
