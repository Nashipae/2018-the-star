A section of clearing agents now support ferrying of cargo destined for Nairobi and beyond via the standard gauge railway so they are cleared in Embakasi. The government, through the Kenya Ports Authority, Kenya Railways and the Kenya Maritime Authority, wrote to shipping agents on February 17, saying all cargo destined for Nairobi and beyond would be cleared at the Inland Container Depot in Embakasi, Nairobi. The directive was met with resistance by clearing agents, who said they were never consulted. On Thursday, however, some members of the Kenya International Freight and Warehousing Association said the directive “makes some business sense”. There are two splinter groups at Kifwa one led by Auni Bhaji and another led by William Ojonyo. Bhanji and Ojonyo are tussling over the chairperson position.
