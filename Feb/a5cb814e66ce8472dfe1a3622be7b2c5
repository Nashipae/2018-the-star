A Kenyan woman in South Africa has been missing since January 23 when she presumably left for her salon in Kraaifontein, Cape Town. Faith Manyara owned the salon for 10 years and generally left home for work at around 9.30 am each day. The eldest of her three children, 23-year-old Ebrahim Ongori, said she got ready for work on that day but did not get there. “My mother has never done this type of thing. She only goes to work and spends time with us,” Ongori told IOL news. Police are investigating the disappearance of the 43-year-old. The single mom rented a room in a house on Plein Street, Parow, and lived there with her children. On the fateful day, her two teenagers left for school while her oldest son went to work. She had still been preparing for work when they left. “At around 7pm, a lady who works with my mom came home without her and said she had been trying to reach her all day," the boy said. “We immediately knew something was not right because she always comes straight home after work.” Ongori said they searched for her in vain and that it was difficult since she was single and did not have many friends. “We are with family now but it is not easy. We just have to stay strong. “Our biggest hope is that my mom is still alive and that we will find her. We miss her very much. Se did everything for us. She played the role of a mother and father. Anybody with any information must please contact me.” Ongori can be reached on 073 374 2389 and police through Crime Stop on 08600 10111.” Click here for the latest political news
