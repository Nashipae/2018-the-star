Cherangany MP Joshua Kuttuny is preparing a Bill to reduce the age of people benefiting from the government’s cash transfer programme. Kuttuny wants those who receive the monthly stipend of Sh2,500 to be at least 60 years old, not 70. He also wants the amount increased Sh4,500 per individual as the cost of living has skyrocketed. “After doing research for long, I realised that once people reach age 60, they start to suffer if they have no stable income. That is why I
will have to introduce this Bill," he told journalists on Monday. If the Bill goes through, people who qualify will strictly use their NHIF cards to pay for treatment at government hospitals. Three weeks ago, more than 2,000 elderly persons in Cherangany Sub-County got registered for the cash transfer programme. Kuttuny led the exercise during which the group also signed up for the National Hospital Insurance Fund. The MP encouraged them to pay their premiums. The legislator said about 1,000 people in the area have joined the programme since it was launched in July last year. He announced a target of 10,000 people in the next two months. “Those who registered earlier will start receiving their stipends from March
this year,” he said. Related: 6,000 families put on cash transfer programme in Uasin Gishu Click here for the latest political news
