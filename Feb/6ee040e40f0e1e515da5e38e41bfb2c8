Is Kenya’s annual food crisis about lack of food or equal access to it? It has been said for years that the Government needs to develop a drought and food deficit early warning system and act decisively on intelligence. It should not take the deaths of humans or livestock, or both, to spur the authorities and the humanitarian agencies into corrective action. That is why the current food crisis raises serious questions about our disaster preparedness as a nation. It is an abiding national shame that life must be lost first before the government reluctantly acknowledges, then swings into action. The worsening drought and other climate change disasters are almost predictable by today’s science. The State has administrative machinery to the smallest unit. It cannot continue to be taken by surprise, or caught on the wrong foot, every year. While we laud the fact that food security is part of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four priorities, the government needs to demonstrate in response to the current crisis that it is not just about grand multi-million projects that provide opportunities for tenderpreneurs. It must be actually coordinated administrative actions that will tame the recurrent scourge of hunger in our midst now and forever.
