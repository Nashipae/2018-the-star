The new Sh50 million kidney dialysis unit has never been switched on due to lack of clean water at the Lamu King Fahad County Hospital. Three machines were purchased by and installed at the hospital more than two months ago. Speaking at the facility yesterday, Lamu county Health directors David Mulewa and Health executive Raphael Munyua said a renal unit requires sufficient and consisten water supply. Lamu lacks enough fresh purified water to run the equipment. The water it does have is saline. Lamu has many dialysis patients and now they must to to hospitals in Mombasa and Nairobi for life-saving treatment. Staff trained in Nairobi Mulewa said the county government has installed a mini desalination plant. Health officers were sent to KNH for training on how to operate the machines. Mulewa said the unit has all the equipment, supplies and staff, but the problem is lack of lwater. “We already have three dialysis machines ready to work. We have a number of machines undergoing checks but generally we are good to go. The water in the county has an unacceptable level of salinity. The new desalinisation plant will make it possible to begin dialysis treatment by March, Muewa said. Travel long distances Munyua said the renal unit is a major step forward in healthcare in the county and a great relief for patients with kidney disease. “For over 50 years, renal patients have been referred to Mombasa and Nairobi, but we are now glad that our unit will begin functioning in a short time. “People won’t have to strain and travel for long distances to seek treatment, ”Munyua said.
