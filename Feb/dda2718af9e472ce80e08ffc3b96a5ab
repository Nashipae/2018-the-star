Some Siaya MCAs have accused the executive of trying to bend the law and illegally recruit five CECs who had been rejected by the assembly. Three MCAs Ambrose Akuno (West Asembo), Susan Okwiri
(West Gem) and David Audi (South Gem) have claimed that Governor Cornel
Rasanga want the list of executive nominees who had been rejected passed. They have threatened to sue if the list of those found culpable would be passed through intimidation and
threats by a section of the executives. The trio claimed that a section of MCAs have been compromised by the executive to pass the list of the
CECs, saying it is against the Standing Orders and the County Governments Act. They spoke to the press at a hotel in Siaya
town on Wednesday. Akuno said assembly speaker George
Okode has received a backlash from some MPs for his firm stand on the illegal recruitment. Last year in September, the county assembly rejected
a list of nine executive nominees. The MCAs said the nominees did not meet the required qualifications. Rasanga later submitted a list of four new nominees, who were approved by the assembly. During a recent function, Alego/Usonga MP Sam Atandi accused Okode of sabotaging Rasanga’s government by rallying MCAs to
reject his list of CEC nominees. Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo also faulted the MCAs, saying they are engaging the
nominees in unnecessary sideshows yet the nominees were far much educated than
them. “How do they [MCAs] want to interview people with
high education background than them?”
Odhiambo asked.
