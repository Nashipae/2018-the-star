Two people died while more than 15 were hospitalised after reportedly drinking contaminated water in Gatanga Sub-County, Murang’a. Health Executive Joseph Mbai said they exhibited symptoms similar to those of cholera patients on Saturday night. The county set up a crisis centre at Kiunyu Dispensary in Kiunyu village, where tens of locals went for treatment. "Fifteen people were referred to the nearby Thika Level Five Hospital as medics rushed to ensure
no other lives were lost," he said on Sunday. “We sent the patients to Thika before setting up our own treatment centre at Kiunyu Dispensary to separate them from other
patients." He added that a team of medics from several local hospitals was sent to the centre to help. Ambulances were dispatched to fetch patients unable to go to the facility. The Executive said they were yet to find out the cause of the disease but believe it is waterborne. He appealed to residents experiencing diarrhea, vomiting, stiffness, headaches and general weakness to
rush to the dispensary for treatment. Click here for the latest political news
