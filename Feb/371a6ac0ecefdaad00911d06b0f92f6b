Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria will today go to court to seek declaration that the oath NASA leader Raila Odinga took last month was illegal. Kuria on Monday said he will file a case to press Chief Justice David Maraga to make a declaration the oath be declared treasonable. Raila took the oath at the People’s President in Uhuru Park on January 30. “The court, though Chief Justice, should declare it treasonable and unconstitutional for Raila to make such a move. We already have a sitting President,” he said. Kuria said after the declaration, other steps should follow, including arresting and charging Raila. He spoke at Wagura Primary School in Nyeri during the burial of Esther Nyaruai, a sister of Nyeri Woman Representative Rahab Mukami. Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri, Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga and more than 12 MPs were present.
