When it all started, the only artiste who perhaps was popular for leaving viewers hollering in laughter with his music parodies was Kajairo. As soon as his light gradually began to fade, we saw the entry of new acts like Propesa, MC Njagi, Eric Omondi and Padi Wubonn, who gave a fresh breath of air to comedy. Now, with focus on Padi’s path, you may have thought you’ve seen enough, but he’s among the new names that seem to be dominating. There’s a very high likelihood you’ve listened and giggled at a Padi Wubbon spoof. Well, he is the genius behind the “Ugali” and his recent release “Man’s Hot Spot” parodies. He is one of the creatives who’ve dedicated their lives to making people’s lives more enjoyable. Once in a while, if you are fortunate, you’ll stumble upon his hilarious take-offs of some of the popular tracks dominating the airwaves. Padi has been creating comedic content for a while now, with the ambition of making a name for himself. He throws in a couple of regular actors in his videos and comes up with some of the silliest thematic concerns. He gets into character, adopting a local accent that he uses to narrate his ordeals full of hilarity. His spoofs are a representation of the present-day situations, done with a touch of comedy that reflects the Kenyan way of life. And with every new YouTube post, he has been winning himself new fans. He has worked with stars like Kajairo, but one thing he has had going for himself is his will to want to be his own man. It’s quite obvious that Padi has no intention of writing anything serious anytime soon. After all, there are enough people doing humourless tunes with a vision of making masterpieces, and his existence could be considered a blessing. The boisterous merriment is all we want from him.
