Bungoma County Government will pump Sh200 million into the upgrade of the Masinde Muliro Stadium, Kanduyi, according to governor Wycliffe Wangamati. Speaking during the Safaricom-sponsored Chapa Dimba tournament, the governor said the vision of his government was to ensure the stadium gets international standards by the year 2020. Wangamati said his team will commit between Sh100-200 millions towards the project and other sub-county stadia in the coming financial year. “This county is known to produce some of the finest sports talent in East Africa across all sports and our commitment as government is to help nature them,” he said. He added that his government will come up with a system to tap talents from the ward level. “Ours is a desire to change and transform Bungoma into a leading county and this can only happen with commitment towards zero tolerance to corruption. I have said it before and I will repeat again today that my government will not entertain any form of corruption. We are committed to work towards bettering the lives of our people and we hope every member of this county will support us to achieve our goal,” he added. Chapa Dimba tournament director, Chris Amimo, who is also the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) vice president, lauded the governor for showing commitment towards upgrading Kanduyi stadium and also for being the first governor in Kenya to attend the regional finals. During the regional Chapa Dimba finals, Mukumu Boys and Arch-Bishop Njenga Girls qualified to represent Western region during the national finals next month at Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega.
