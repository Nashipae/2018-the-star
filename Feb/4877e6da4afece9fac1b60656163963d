Most clubs have obeyed the government directive to stop selling Shisha, Head of Nairobi Tobacco Control Unit Anthony Muthemba has said. Speaking to the Star yesterday, they contacted a major patrol around the city and became contented the ban has been effected. Muthemba said places like Nairobi West Shopping Centre, Lavington, Kiambu Road, Thika Road that used to sell Shisha were found without any. Muthemba however acknowledged that ome clubs have continued with the illegal illegal business especially early in the evening and stop at around 8pm because they know the crackdown takes place from as 9 pm. This has made them to stop carrying out daily crackdowns and are now relying on informants. He said some along Mombasa Road are not selling shisha but have the bongs and the hooker staff still working in the clubs. "A popular club along Lang'ata Road had been reported to be selling shisha but the management dismissed it as mere allegations. In such a scenario, we cannot carry out arrests without evidence," Muthemba said. He urged residents to report any entertainment joint still contravening the law. Last year December former Health CS Cleopa Mailu banned the importation, manufacture, advertising and sale of shisha in the country.
