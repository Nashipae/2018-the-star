We awoke very early on a weekend morning and went on a game drive in the Nairobi National Park. After a while, we saw many cars parked as we approached junction no21, as we looked over the plains towards the Langata forest. As we approached, a lioness appeared and was walking towards us with a tiny cub in its mouth, closely followed by another tiny cub. Then suddenly there they were, right next to us, as we watched them. What a fascinating sight to see such very small cubs, indeed a rare sight in any national park. The lioness seemed to be a bit concerned with vehicles, and took the two cubs down towards thick reed cover at a nearby stream. As we drove slightly forward, someone mentioned that there was a “lost cub” somewhere near where many cars were parked. I decided to wait and parked away from the cars. After a short while, the lioness returned and began to look for the “lost cub”. Suddenly the lioness appeared in the road with the tiny lost cub in her mouth, and walked directly towards us to go to the stream where she hid the other cubs. It is known the lionesses instinctively hide their cubs especially when exposed to any potential dangers. Lionesses can move their tiny cubs on several occasions if they feel threatened. Known species that are a threat to tiny lion cubs include: other mature male lions, hyenas, buffalo, etc. Statistically about 50 per cent of wild lion cubs survive their first year. Males tend to have the toughest life, with only one in eight surviving as mature adults, while females do better mainly because of the pride support structure. We hope all the cubs survive in the wild.  The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00. For more information on the park you can
