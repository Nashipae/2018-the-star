DP William Ruto is under pressure from human rights groups to intervene in the ongoing insecurity problem in Kerio Valley. Hundreds of families in parts of West Pokot, Baringo and Elgeyo Marakwet have been affected and more than 10,000 children forced to abandon school. Twenty schools have been shut down, 120 people have died and property worth Sh1 billion destroyed in a year. More than 30 teachers want transfers, citing security threats. The groups and church leaders have accused government officials of laxity and urged the DP as a key leader from the region to take charge as soon as possible on behalf of the national government. Tension remains high and many families are still fleeing from villages along the border between West Pokot and Marakwet where 300 houses were razed by bandits in revenge attacks.
