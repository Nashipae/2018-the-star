The Kenya Universities Staff Union has demanded a counter proposal for the 2017-2021 Collective Bargaining Agreement by February 28, failing which, it will call a nationwide strike. “We will call a strike in all 31 public universities should the Inter Public Universities Council Consultative Forum fail to give a counter proposal,”Kusu secretary general Charles Mukhwaya said. The Kusu National Governing Council said the government is procrastinating negotiations. The council met in Nakuru on Saturday. “We call on the government to move with speed to facilitate and fast track completion of negotiations in order to meet budgetary deadlines,” Mukhwaya said. He said most universities are unable to run smoothly because the government has reduced funding. “At Nairobi and Egerton universities, capitalisation has been reduced by over Sh1.7 billion and Sh700 million respectively,” Mukhwaya said. He said three negotiation meetings have been unfruitful and the IPUCCF has shown a lack of commitment. Negotiations were expected to be completed by February 28 and Mukhwaya expressed fear this might not be achieved because the government keeps postponing meetings with “lame excuses of a change of guard in the Ministry of Education”. “We will have our members take to the streets if the government does not bring a counter proposal on the negotiation table during our final meeting slated for February 23,” he said.
