IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati says he is satisfied with how courts have handled petitions filed by election losers. He said the petitions exceeded the number they anticipated. A record 277 suits challenging the election of governors, senators, MPs, woman reps and MCAs were filed nationwide. “I am very happy that most of these petitions were dismissed due to lack of evidence and other anomalies,” Chebukati said. The dismissal of most of the petitions could easily be interpreted that the IEBC conducted a credible election.

Chebukati said the commission is ready to conduct by-elections. The commission had prepared in advance for any eventualities. “We already had a budget for the by-elections as we had seen how candidates moved to court to challenge the election,” he said. The IEBC is preparing for five by-elections, but the number might increase as some petitions are still pending. Click here for the latest political news
