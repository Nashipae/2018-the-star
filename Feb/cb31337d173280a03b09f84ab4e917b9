Siaya nurses are on strike because of Sh420 million unpaid salaries for two months. On Tuesday, county secretary David Anyona’s efforts to to stop the strike failed. His meeting with the nurses ended prematurely. The nurses said their pay is frequently delayed. They said they will only resume work after getting what is due to them. Anyona said only the January salaries have not been remitted. Nurses’ union secretary Sylvester Ng’ada expressed regret that their talks with the county government failed. He accused the Cornel Rasanga administration of “making empty promises”.
