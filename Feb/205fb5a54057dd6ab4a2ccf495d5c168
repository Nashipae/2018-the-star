President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni will open the Busia One-Stop Border Post on Saturday despite opposition by residents who want some issues addressed. During an information meeting on Monday at the Quill Hotel along the Kisumu-Busia highway, leaders and residents criticised the national government for its failure to honour a “gentleman’s agreement”. Chief officer in the goveror’s office Robert Papa and MCAs David Luyemba, Moses Ochieng and Bernard Papa said the state should fulfil its pledges on trade. “When I worked with the defunct local authorities we had an agreement with the state that any investor who put up a OSBP will build a trailer and bus parks,” Luyemba said. “KRA is chasing away our people from collecting revenue within OSBP jurisdiction. We need assurance parks will be built and the county will collect trailer fees in Busia and Malaba.” Deputy county commissioner Fredrick Ayieko promised to forward the leaders concerns to Interior CS Fred Matiang’i
