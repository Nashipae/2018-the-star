Munyes made the announcement yesterday after he made a courtesy call to the NOCK offices in Nairobi. The new CS met the corporation’s board of directors before making note of national oil’s development of expertise and technology, which he said are necessary for the growth of oil and gas exploration in the country. “I am pleased with the current progress made by National Oil. Amidst challenges facing the industry, the board and management has turned around the company into a profit making company and the future outlook of the company is bright,” Munyes said. The CS praised the technical skills and capacity present in the company expressing confidence in the corporation’s ability to undertake national projects. “The company has the necessary technical skills and expertise to conduct oil and gas exploration in the country,” he said.
