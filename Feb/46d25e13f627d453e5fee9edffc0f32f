ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru has denied claims he deliberately ignored the summon to appear before a Parliamentary committee. He skipped the meeting with members of the Senate ICT committee to answer questions over the state's 10-day TV shutdown. Senators accused him of
undermining Parliament after failing to appear to explain the shutdown of Citizen, Inooro, KTN News, and NTV.

The committee wanted Mucheru to explain why the four stations were turned off during and after the
swearing-in of NASA leader Raila Odinga as the peopleâ€™s president. In the letter to Senate clerk Jeremiah Nyegenye, he said: "This office regrets the misapprehension that the communication of my unavailability elicited within the committee." "This is a fact that was inadvertently overlooked in our earlier communication," he said adding that his office will adhere to the set practice. The ICT boss asked the committee panel to reschedule his grilling from February 26 onwards. "The same ought not to be construed as contemptuous of the role of Parliament in the management of public affairs," he said. Mucheru asked the committee to provide detailed list of questions within each issue that the committee seeks to engage with and a proposed date for purposes of synchrony. "This will allow for clarity as to the scope of information and knowledge within our purview and to the preparation and submission of requisite responses in advance of the meeting date," he added.
