If President Uhuru wants Nyandarua to vote for Jubilee, the government must bail out Njabini-based Midlands Limited, the only factory in the county, county leader shave said. Speaking on Saturday, they said the county supports President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda, especially manufacturing and industrialisation. They said, however, Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto must support agro-processor Midlands, which they said belongs to farmers. The leaders include Nyandarua speaker Wahome Ndegwa, Njabini-Kiburu MCA Kiiru Gachomba, former Deputy Governor Waithaka Mwangi and businessman Simon Kanyingi. They said the company has been at the centre of court battles and risks being grabbed by three individuals, through a company registered in West Indies. They and called on Uhuru and Ruto to bail it out to maintain their loyalty to Jubilee. Ndegwa said a petition was brought to the assembly by farmers in 2015, and it was resolved that farmers take control of the factory. The assembly also resolved all court cases related to the factory be withdrawn, as they were “malicious and politically motivated”. They said shareholders who started the company agreed to release all the shares to residents when they are ready, and called on the President to pay them the shares taken by private individuals. He said some individuals are eager to take Midlands after an American firm offered to buy products worth Sh8billion annually from the factory. Gachomba said Uhuru and Ruto should bail out the company just as they did with Mumias Sugar, Miraa, coffee and tea farmers. Mwangi said the company will employ more than 1,000 when it becomes fully operational. “We scratch their back, they scratch ours. Our youth cannot be jobless while we have a factory to employ them but nobody seems bothered,” he said.
