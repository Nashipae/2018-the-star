Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has hailed the resignation of former South African president Jacob Zuma saying it is a sign of change coming to Kenya. Kalonzo on Saturday said the current political events where long-serving leaders have had to exit is a clear indication that NASA's quest for electoral justice is on the right path. He spoke during the burial of Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana's brother in-law Prof Lenno Mbaga in Kikambala, Kilifi county. The NASA principal also cited the fall of Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe and the recent resignation Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemarian Desalegn. "Mugabe left office after clinging to power for far too long. No life was lost during his exit because the people of Zimbabwe felt it was time
for change," Kalonzo said. "Zuma tried to resist but he was forced to. In this country, the people shall also decide and push some people out of office." He said the developments in the African nations "should serve as an eye opener for Kenyan politicians who think they will rule the country forever." Kalonzo has been on the spot after skipping the swearing in of Raila Odinga as the people’s president on January 30. But on this, he asked NASA supporters not to be distracted from the fight for electoral justice. He has maintained that his absence at the fete, which was also skipped by Musalia Mudavadi (Amani National Congress) and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula, was a strategy. Dismissing claims that the coalition is on the verge of collapse, Kalonzo said the NASA team is united and focused to propel its agenda forward. He said the coalition will hold its national summit to address on the pending issues before embarking on his swearing in as the deputy people's president.
