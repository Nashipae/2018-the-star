The Law Society of Kenya holds its elections today to put in office a new president and council. The term of outgoing president Isaac Okero and VP Faith Waigwa will be remembered as one that saw the once bipartisan and united society succumb to political division along the national political cleavage. At its best and most iconic, the LSK was a voice of reason and of the voiceless. It was on the frontline of Kenya’s long and sometimes lonely struggle against authoritarianism. Now it is so fractured that today’s vote is being seen as a NASA versus Jubilee proxy fight. The LSK needs to rediscover it glorious past and elect a leadership that can restore honour to the legal fraternity. At a time when the Judiciary is under attack from partisan interests desirous of having their bidding, the LSK should be at its staunchest as a defender of the rule of law and our Constitution. A weak LSK means a weak Judiciary. It is our modest expectation that the discordance witnessed in the Society recently will be a thing of the past after today's poll.

Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it.” — German writer, statesman and social philosopher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (Faust) died on February 22, 1832.
