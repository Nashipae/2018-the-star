Lawyer Miguna Miguna has said he will fight the grievous violation of his rights by the Jubilee government. This was after he was deported to Canada on Tuesday night. "The despots have put me in a flight to Amsterdam enroute to Toronto, departure time right now." "Instead of taking me to court as ordered repeatedly by the courts, they seized my passports and drove me to the runaway at the JKIA from 6pm up to now," Miguna said in a tweet moments before he left JKIA. The self-proclaimed NRM general said he will fight to return to Kenya as soon as possible.

His lawyer Nelson Havi termed the government's efforts against his client as exercises in futility. Miguna's troubles began when he stamped documents used for Nasa leader Raila Odinga's self-inauguration as the people's president at Uhuru Park in Nairobi on January 30. He was there with leaders including Ruaraka MP TJ Kajwang, who administered the oath, and Siaya senator and lawyer James Orengo, who has represented many of the coalition's politicians in legal matters.

He added Raila's oath-taking did not amount to treason as his people's president role is "imaginary" and only aimed at appeasing his supporters. Click here for the latest political news
