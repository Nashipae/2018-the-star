Russian Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov has dismissed as "blather" the charges levelled by FBI special
counsel against 13 Russians for election meddling. Speaking at a major security conference in Germany, Lavrov said he would not comment further until he saw "facts". The
charges brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller are seen as a major
development in his continuing probe into the 2016 election. President Trump has said the indictment shows his campaign did "nothing wrong". The Russian foreign minister was being questioned by participants at the Munich Security Conference. Asked
about the charges he kept it brief, saying that even Vice-President
Mike Pence had called the investigation into question. "So until we see the facts, everything else is just blather." In a tweet on Friday evening, Trump repeated that there had been "no collusion" between his campaign and Russia. However,
he did appear to concede that Russia had sought to influence the
election. The president has previously disputed US intelligence agency
assessments suggesting this. More on this: Russians charged over US 2016 election tampering Click here for the latest political news
