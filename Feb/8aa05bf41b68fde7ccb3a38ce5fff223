Eight northern Kenya counties are to receive UN donor aid to improve health, energy, roads and other infrastructure. The arid and semi-arid counties will get funds under the umbrella of the Frontier Counties Development Council. The programme is being implemented by a consortium of UN agencies with the World Bank and the national government. They will support infrastructure projects, including healthcare and energy. The eight counties are Garissa, Isiolo, Lamu, Mandera, Marsabit, Tana River, Turkana and Wajir. This was announced by a team of 12 envoys who visited Mandera county on Thursday. United Nations resident coordinator Siddharth Chatterjee said the development partners are keen on providing infrastructure. Mandera Governor Ali Roba said they want to change the narrative that the county is insecure and unproductive, scaring away investors. “We are pleased to welcome the biggest delegation of envoys in Mandera since independence. It is an endorsement of changing times and the need to work with development partners to improve lives and infrastructure,” he said. The governor said Mandera is peaceful, citing security fencing along the Kenya-Somalia border as a milestone. “Security fencing of the border has allowed normalcy to return. It helped reduce terror attacks,” he said. Swedish Ambassador Anna Jard said development partners are keen to help solve health problems in ASAL areas.
