Kenyan farmers must adopt modern technologies to reverse losses. The country incurs Sh50 billion post-harvest losses every year, 60 per cent of the produce. “It is time all of us adopted temperature management practices, especially for horticultural produce, to curb the post-harvest loss,” Nigerian scholar Prof Umezuruike Linus Opara said. He made the remarks at a Nairobi hotel during the annual yield conference. Present was Makueni Deputy Governor Adelina Mwau. Opara said low temperatures reduce the rates of decomposition of most agricultural products. “Poor storage facilities and substandard storage pesticides have aggravated the attack and losses,” he said. “As part of transformation in agriculture we need to leverage all sectors. If we make good roads, equip villages with electricity, educate our children then we contribute to the growth of agriculture,” he said. Opara urged agricultural institutions to help government implement policies.
