City Hall workers have threatened to go on strike following the county’s failure to implement a Collective Bargaining Agreement. The employees also cited what they term “constant” harassment, threats and intimidation by senior county officials. Through the Kenya County Government Workers’ Union, the more than 13,000 employees said the county has been reluctant to implement the CBA which was signed on May 5 last year. “It is imperative that we bring to your attention the building pressure from the workers demanding the implementation of the subject CBA,” secretary general Roba Duba said in a letter to Governor Mike Sonko. Duba said the union has written many letters to the governor’s office but it has not received any response. Sonko and acting county secretary Leboo Morintant were unavailable for comment. The CBA, signed during former Governor Evans Kidero’s term, increased the workers’ pay by 15 per cent. The county’s wage bill currently stands at Sh1.2 billion per month. Addressing a press conference at the union’s office last Thursday after a meeting with branch officials, Duba said workers have been intimidated and threatened with sacking. “We are appalled by the name-calling and intimidation. We are important members of this society and contribute to the activities that build the county,” he said. Duba said at least 20 employees have been sent on compulsory leave since August last year, and demanded the matter be addressed before operations are paralysed. “Before laying off someone, you must negotiate terms of exit with the party. It’s wrong to push workers into compulsory leave,” he said.
