Jubilee supporters from Garissa and Mandera yesterday took to the streets to celebrate the decision by the court to uphold the election of Aden Duale as Garissa township MP and Mohamud Mohamed as Mandera Senator. Hassan Osman garnered 62,769 votes against Muhamud’s 71890 while Duale got 22,000 while Farah Maalim garnered 14,000. Resident Halima Mohamed said that with the victory, Duale can now embark on his development agenda for the people. “Even if the election was to be held again, he would still have won,” she said. The court dismissed the petitions on grounds that the evidence adduced by the petitioner was merely hearsay and not sufficient enough to nullify the election. The petitioner had argued that the deployment of Presiding Officers (POs) and their deputies was done unconstitutionally and that there were high number of votes in some polling stations which could not tally with the registered voters.
