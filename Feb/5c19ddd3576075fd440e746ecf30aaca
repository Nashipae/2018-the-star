Some 1,000 people in Bungoma will be employed by Rai Paper, formerly Webuye Pan Paper, following the opening of its second production line, management has said. The first production line was launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta last December. Rai Paper management said the plant produces 3,000 tonnes of paper, most of which is consumed locally. “There has also been a huge demand for our paper in Uganda. We are expanding our production capacity gradually so we can expand our exports to the neighbouring country,” manager Naga Shankar said. The opening of the second line was attended by Industrialisation CS Adan Mohamed, Water CS Eugene Wamalwa, Agriculture CS Willy Bett, Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka, Webuye West MP Dan Wanyama, Sirisia MP John Waluke and MCAs, among others. “Our goal is to see every Kenyan have a decent life. By reviving these factories, the government aims at creating more jobs for Kenyans, particularly the youth,” Mohamed said. The Cabinet Secretary said it is unfortunate some leaders have politicised the revival of what was once East Africa’s largest paper factory. “It is not true that the factory was sold at a throwaway price. As a matter of fact, the plant had already been taken over by commercial banks (PTA and KCB). It was therefore at their discretion to sell the paper factory at whatever price that they thought was right,” Mohamed said. Lusaka said the progress of the revival has been impressive so far. “In a span of six months, we have managed to achieve what the factory used to produce at full capacity in the past,” he said. "No doubt in two years’ time, Rai Paper will be operating at full capacity, double its capacity and employ close to 4,000 people.”
