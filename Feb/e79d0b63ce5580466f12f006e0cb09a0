An Israeli fighter jet has crashed amid Syrian anti-aircraft fire after an offensive against Iranian targets in Syria, the Israeli military says. The two pilots ejected and parachuted to safety in Israel. They were later taken to hospital. Israel said its aircraft, an F-16 jet, was carrying out strikes in response to the launch of a drone into Israeli territory. The drone was intercepted. Red alert sirens sounded in areas of northern Israel and the Golan Heights. Residents reported hearing a number of explosions and heavy aerial activity in the area near Israel's borders with Jordan and Syria. "A combat helicopter successfully intercepted an Iranian UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] that was launched from Syria and infiltrated Israel," the military said in a statement. The statement added that the drone was identified quickly and was "under surveillance until the interception". "In response, the IDF [Israel Defence Forces] targeted Iranian targets in Syria," the military said.
