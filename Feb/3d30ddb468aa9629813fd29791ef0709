Mutindwa open air market in Umoja One ward is being refurbished. Embakasi West MP George Theuri said stalls will have roofs, they will be painted and electricity will be connected. Speaking to the Star on Monday, Theuri said upgrading the market will ensure traders have a decent working environment. Some of the traders told the Star they were forced to do their business on pavements after being asked to move a KURA upgrades Outering Road. “There is lot of dust on our wares [groceries and clothes], its affecting our health,” trader Louise Waithera said. Phase One of the project started on Sunday. Stalls built along pedestrian footpaths were pulled down. Umoja One ward MCA Mark Mugambi said traders complain about insecurity. ”They are forced to close their businesses early because of lack of electricity,” he said.
