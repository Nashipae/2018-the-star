Chiefs and Nyumba Kumi elders in Garissa county are notorious for abetting female genital mutilation. This came up during International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation celebrations on Tuesday at Garissa Primary School. Speaker after speaker blamed the administrators and the elders for failing to use the available laws to prosecute FGM perpetrators. FGM is outlawed in Kenya. The Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act of 2011 spells a punishment of between three years in prison and life imprisonment for guilty persons. One can also be fined Sh200,000. Children’s officer Benjamin Kinyua said the fight against FGM should form part of the chiefs and assistant chiefs' performance contracts. He said each administrator should be assessed by the number of arrests and cases they prosecute annually. “This is the only way the chiefs and assistant chiefs can be held personally accountable,” he said. The speakers said the administrators do not report incidences of FGM because those practicing it could be their immediate family. The chiefs also fear being victimised by the community, Kinyua said. Activist Zainab Ali said since the enactment of the FGM laws in 2011 "no one has ever been arrested and charged in a Garissa court". “The laws should be made more punitive and tightened in such a manner that the offenders found culpable cannot escape prosecution. Those hellbent on holding onto the harmful cultural practice will feel the heat and keep off,” she said. According to Unicef statistics, 97 per cent of Somali girls undergo the cut with the majority of them developing complication during childbirth and menstruation. The anti-FGM activist groups proposed that the county government establish a revolving fund for women circumcisers willing to abandon the practice and venture into another line of work.
