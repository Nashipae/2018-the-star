If we could, we’d turn you into stars in the sky to light our way and always watch over us. That was the sentiment of mourners who yesterday euologised brilliant Yvonne Wamalwa, widow of the late VP Kijana Wamalwa. They remembered her as hardworking, focused, intelligent, caring and very giving. “She was a friend and a servant of the people,” former Prime Minister Raila Odinga said. A requiem mass was held at the Consolata Shrine and attended by government officials, politicians, the clergy, civil society representatives, diplomats and other Kenyans. They described the diplomat as an aunt, a friend, a mother, a sister, a colleague and a daughter. “If we could, Yvonne, we would turn cut you into stars so you may join former VP Wamalwa as one of the stars to shine upon the beautiful family, upon us and the world as you watch upon us,” Water CS Eugene Wamalwa, her brother-in-law, said. Call me His Excellency Yvonne remained a widow after her husband’s death on August 23, 2003. “She died a young widow. He died leaving her behind but she didn’t remarry. I can say Mr and Mrs Wamalwa’s love was timeless,” Eugene said. Raila provided a light moment and left the mourners in stitches when he told Eugene, “I remind Eugene Wamalwa to call me ‘His Excellency’ since I took an oath the other day. I will give my maiden speech very soon.” Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohamed said, “Her passing is a great loss and no doubt our lives will be empty in the areas she touched. She gave. She gave us her expertise, her love, her company and she gave her skills,” Mohamed said. The body was taken to the family home in Karen for an overnight stay according to Luhya traditions. It will be airlifted to Kitale on Friday for the burial on Saturday. Click here for the latest political news
