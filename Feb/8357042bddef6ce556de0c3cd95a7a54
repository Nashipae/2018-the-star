Elgeyo Marakwet MCAs have accused the executive of poor revenue collection and underutilisation of funds.The county has collected Sh160 million since 2013. The budget and appropriations committee said the executive failed to utilise Sh600 million in the 2016/17 financial year, leading to a rollover. Committee chairman John Yator Wednesday said the county collected just Sh103 million during the last financial year. Nominated MCA Lawi Kibire claimed employees could be diverting revenue to their own pockets. “We are concerned about the low revenue collection. It is something that should worry all members,” Yator said.
