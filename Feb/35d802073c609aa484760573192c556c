Muhoroni Youth face demotion to the National Division One league after they failed to turn up for a third National Super League match over the weekend. The forfeiture triggers a rule governing matches that recommends the relegation of a team that skips three matches in the course of a campaign. Football Kenya Federation CEO Robert Muthomi acknowledged that the former Premier League side’s fall from grace may go down another notch should the referees report confirm that they did not turn up for their weekend fixture. “We are waiting for the match report from the match officials. If they failed to turn up, that will be three matches missed hence they will be relegated,” Muthomi said in a text message. Muhoroni were bogged by financial issues in the last campaign amidst alleged fallouts between club chairman Moses Adagala and the playing unit. Understandably, Muhoroni players were demoralised and the results on the pitch confirmed as much with the club finishing bottom of the 18-team league and were demoted to the NSL. Not one to take such a setback on the chin whether deserved or not, Adagala sought reprieve from relegation in the corridors of justice but even there, no relief was forthcoming. Now, should the rules be applied to the letter, Muhoroni must contend with playing in the National Division One but many observers aver that it might be the beginning of the end for a club that announced themselves in the national stage with a draw against Gor Mahia and victory over AFC Leopards in their debut topflight campaign seven years ago. Tomorrow, the latest beneficiary of Muhoroni’s no show, Nairobi City Stars have the chance to go top of the second division standings should they get victory away at Modern COast.
