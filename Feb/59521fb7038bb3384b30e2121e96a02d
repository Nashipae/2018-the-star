A fragile calm has returned to many parts of Kerio Valley following Monday’s visit by Interior CS Fred Matiang’i. Guns have fallen silent in most parts of the banditry ravaged region and 50 closed schools have reopened. “We hope all schools will resume operations by next week and we also believe that resolutions reached at our meetings with the CS will be fully implemented,” Governor Alex Tolgos said on the phone yesterday. Matiang’i directed that an armed police officer be deployed in each school and security chiefs be held responsible for crime in their areas. “People cannot just cause problems and go away. They must be arrested and brought to book,” the Cabinet Secretary said. Matiang’i toured Marakwet and Pokot. Yesterday police officers had been deployed in schools, whose closure had affected learning for 10,000 children. Many teachers have fled from the region. Tolgos said leaders will work together to restore normalcy “The situation in Kerio Valley has been pathetic. Children and parents, especially women, are suffering because of insecurity,” Parents Association chairman Nicholas Maiyo said in Eldoret town.
