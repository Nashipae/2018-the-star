The High court on Monday dismissed the petition challenging Cornel Rasanga's election as Siaya Governor . Lady Justice Esther Maina, in her ruling, slapped former Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo - the petitioner, with a Sh3 million cost. Gumbo contested Rasanga's victory claiming the August 8 election was not free and fair. Rasanga was declared the winner with 198,889 votes beating Gumbo who came in second with 179,368 votes. Gumbo claimed the results were skewed in favour of the incumbent hence the case filed on September 7. Judge Maina, based on the court’s findings, upheld Rasanga's win saying the IEBC followed the Constitution. She said the irregularities that were witnessed were not deliberate but were due to human error. "They didn’t affect the outcome of the entire Siaya governor elections," the judge said in her judgement. The Judge noted that there was no single concrete evidence produced in the court showing that the election was not free and fair. "We hoped that the petitioner could prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt," judged Maina said. Addressing the press shortly after the ruling, Gumbo said he doesn’t agree with the decision but he will respect it.
