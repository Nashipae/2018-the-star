A fire has completely destroyed the Tourist Office Complex where the Kitui County offices were located. The fire began late on Saturday night and smouldered until Sunday morning. The complex was razed to the ground, leaving office equipment and vital county documents in ashes. Affected departments include Tourism and Culture, Human Resources and Payroll, Education and ICT as well as Minerals and Natural resources. County workers and residents of the neighbouring Site and Service estate watched helplessly as the building went up in flames. There was no help from fire fighters as the county engine stationed at the headquarters had reportedly broken down. The value of the property that was damaged was not established immediately.
