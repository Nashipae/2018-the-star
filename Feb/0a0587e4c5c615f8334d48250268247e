Foreign Affairs PS nominee Macharia Kamau has pledged to end conflicts between Kenya and its neighbouring countries. Macharia told the Foreign Affairs committee chaired by Kajiado South MP Katoo ole Metito that many Kenyans have been tortured in South Sudan, despite Kenya investing heavily in the country. “We host tens of thousands of refugees here. We feed and clothe them, yet they treat us inhumanly in their country. This is unacceptable and I won’t stand for it, at least when I am the PS,” Macharia said. “If you do something bad to a Kenyan again, there will be consequences.” Macharia said if approved, he will focus on ensuring that more skilled labour is exported abroad, saying most Kenyans who seek jobs abroad lack proper training and go for menial jobs. “We need to upscale the kind of people we send to the world. We should send people with technical expertise,” he said. He promised to create an international jobs office in the ministry to allow Kenyans to easily access jobs abroad. “There are many jobs out there but people should attach the required qualifications for them to take the assignments,” Machaira said.
