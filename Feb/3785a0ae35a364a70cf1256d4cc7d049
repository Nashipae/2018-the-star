Parents have flooded the Registrar of Persons office in Kisii for the past one week to apply for birth certificates for their children to beat next week’s ministry of Education deadline. Some of the parents said they did not take the document in time because chiefs and assistant chiefs failed to certify application forms. But principal registrar Mathews Khayota dismissed the claim, saying the ministry issued clear guidelines on how to easily obtain birth certificates. Parents were instructed to apply for birth certificates through school principals and head teachers, but some ignored the advice. Khayota said those who gave the teachers their children’s information have received the birth certificates. “Parents are funny because they wait for the last hour to start raising complaints,” he said. The office has been receiving 500 applications per day and more than 20,000 certificates are yet to be processed. “Due to the high number of certificates which have since not been typed, we decided that the parents will be given the code of the certificate to take to the ministry to enable their children to put in the system as they wait for the originals,” Khayota told the Star in his office. He said the department has eliminated brokers who extorted money from parents on the pretext of helping them to process the documents.
