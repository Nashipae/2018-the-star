Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli has told the government to honour court orders. “I ask President Uhuru Kenyatta to tell his people to leave the Judiciary, the only organ that has power to bring about justice for the weak,” Atwoli said on Saturday in Khwisero, Kakamega county. The government defied orders to reopen three TV stations shut down over the swearing-in of NASA leader Raila Odinga. It also overlooked an order to produce lawyer Miguna Miguna in court. Atwoli said the executive should respect other arms of government and let them work independently. The Cotu secretary general said not every ruling will please all parties, but orders from the Judiciary should be respected or appealed.“If you cannot respect the courts, who else will you fear? The nation will turn into a dictatorship if such actions continue,” Atwoli said. The unionist warned that the executive is setting a bad precedent to its citizens. “If the trend goes on from Jubilee, eventually no one will respect the courts,” he said.
