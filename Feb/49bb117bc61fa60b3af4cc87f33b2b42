The Nairobi government has started to clear street families from the city centre. City Inspectorate Department director of operations Peter Mbaya yesterday said the drive will help reduce crime and decongest the CBD. "The drive started on Tuesday night and at least 200 street families have been relocated from the CBD. It was conducted at night since they come out in large numbers when it is dark," Mbaya said. Those aged above 18 were taken to Central, Kamkunji and Makongeni police stations. Those aged below 18 were taken to YMCA in Makadara and different homes in Kayole. Mbaya said there are two categories of street children â€“ those who ran away from home due to indiscipline and those out in the streets because of poverty. Mbaya told the Star indisciplined street children are mainly the ones involved in drug abuse and criminal activities. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko said additional CCTV cameras and soon-to-be launched street lighting programme will help fight crime. There have been rising cases of daring street children, especially the boys, who attack residents, snatch bags and sexually harass them. The Globe Roundabout, Tom Mboya street, around Kenya Cinema (Moi Avenue) and at Sunken Park are some of the identified hideouts of the street boys. "Some of these so-called street families are actually gangs of under aged bandits. Relocating them from the streets will reduce crime in CBD," Mbaya said. The operation is said to continue up to the end of the week.
