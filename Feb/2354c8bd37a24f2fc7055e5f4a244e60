The Machakos High Court has upheld the election of Victor Munyaka as area MP. The court dismissed allegations of voter bribery, use of public resources to campaign and violence from the MP’s supporters during the election. Petitioner Albanus Mutisya accused Munyaka of ineligibility to run saying he had been declared bankrupt. Justice David Kemei dismissed the claim. “The respondent had not received an official order declaring him bankrupt. Allegations of bankrupcy should have been raised with the IEBC, “ Kemei ruled. He ordered the petitioner to pay Sh2 million to IEBC and a similar amount to Munyaka. Mutisya through lawyer Andrew Makundi, lined up several witnesses. He dismissed claims of violence, saying he only had a slogan which was given to him by elders in 2002 as rallying call for development. Kemei witnessed accounts on the bribery and intimidation claims could not be relied upon.
