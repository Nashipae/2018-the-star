NASA leaders in the National Assembly have asked Speaker Justin Muturi to intervene and get their security personnel and vehicles reinstated. Minority leader John Mbadi and Minority Whip Junet Mohamed yesterday told the House they were stripped of their privileges unprocedurally and unconstitutionally. The duo called on Muturi to protect the independence of Parliament, alleging that it had been subjected to control by the Presidency.
