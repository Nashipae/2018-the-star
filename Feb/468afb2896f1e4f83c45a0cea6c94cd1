Octopizzo is one honest fella, who speaks his mind and never sugarcoats anything, either you take it or leave, plain and simple. In an interview with Adelle Onyango and Shaffie Weru, Octopizzo talked about his album, attending the Grammys and his kids. Shaffie named some of the best collabos so far, including Khaligraph and Petra. When Octopizzo was asked if he likes the song, he said, "I don't understand what they are rapping about, that's my only problem. I don't hate it. Like I want to hear the lines, maybe I'm part of the slow crowd. I'm particular about my stuff. But I'm hearing tirititrirititiritiri."
