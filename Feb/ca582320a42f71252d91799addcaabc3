Kwale Health executive Francis Gwama yesterday denied claims that three patients, including a woman in labour, died at Msambweni Referral Hospital due to negligence. He said the three deaths are being investigated. Gwama said preliminary findings show the claims are unfounded and aimed at tarnishing the hospital’s name and its staff’s reputaton. Relatives told the Star on Monday that three people, including an expectant woman and a man with severe burns, died at the hospital. “Claims that they were not attended to are untrue. Doctors tried their best. Such claims are demoralising,” he said. Gwama said the expectant mother didn’t die as a result of a botched delivery. She was taken to the hospital late, when she was already bleeding. “The baby survived, but we lost the mother due to birth complications,” he said. “Efforts by doctors to save the fire victim who suffered 80 per cent burns failed.” A former councillor of the defunct Kwale County Council accused hospital staff of laxity. “They take too long to attend to patients. Action must be taken to stop this habit,” he said. Residents have complained of poor services. Medical equipment leased to the hospital by the state is underutilised, they say. The dialysis machine, the renal and intensive care units are not fully operational, they add. Nursing officer at the renal unit Omar Mafimbo said there is a staff shortage.
