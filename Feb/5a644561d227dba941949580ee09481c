Posh Palace owner Susan Kaittany was arrested on Monday for allegedly retaining KTN anchor Betty Kyalo's passport. Betty, accompanied by two officers, walked into the spa accompanied by two officers who asked to see Susan before her arrest. The anchor had left Posh Palace having severed their partnership in the business in what is turning out to be an acrimonious 'break up'. Sources, who were at the salon at the time, told The Star that a male and female officer left the premises with Susan. "It looked like they were trying to intimidate Susan asking her why she is holding on to Betty Kyalo’s passport," one of them said. Apparently, Betty’s passport was left at Susan’s home after the two went on an exotic trip to Thailand some time back. And now that the former BFFs are experiencing a communication breakdown, Betty saw it fit to call cops on her to get her documents. "How do you come with cops to someone’s place of work if you don’t want to intimidate them?" a witness asked. When called for comment, Susan said that her lawyer is handling the matter and therefore, could not comment further. Kaittany was taken to Kilimani police station. No OB was recorded. "This is the only way we can talk," Betty was heard saying while stating her reasons for calling cops. Betty is yet to comment on the matter. Calls and text message to the KTN news anchor went unanswered. Click here for the latest political news
