Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has praised the people of Kitutu Masaba for voting out former MP Timothy Bosire. He urged the clergy to pray for the ODM national treasurer. “You did the right thing when you voted him out. He had become an irritant who blew whistles in Parliament and insulted everyone,” the CS said. Matiang’i spoke at Kebirichi Secondary School on Friday. He was with PS Susan Mochache, MP Shadrack Mose, Ken Osinde the chief of staff in DP William Ruto’s office and businessman John Simba. Matiang’i added, “You couldn’t sit down with Bosire and have a meaningful discussion. That’s why I didn’t visit the constituency before. You made the right decision to vote him out. Pray for him to stop insulting other leaders and if he is not baptised, Let us ensure he gets baptised,” said the CS. Bosire could not be reached for comment. He did not respond to text messages either. The former MP is one of Jubilee’s outspoken critics. He lost to Jubilee’s Mose in the August 8 elections. Voter Justus Omiti is challenging Mose’s election. Osinde criticised Bosire for blowing whistles in Parliament last year. He said everyone should respect elected leaders. On the construction of Bonyunyu Dam in the area, the CS said the construction will go on despite protests from residents. “The construction of the dam will go on. Period. We are not going back,” he said. Matiangí added, “Let us keep politics and propaganda out of this project, which once completed will supply water to Nyamira and Kisii towns.” He allayed fears of mass displacements, saying a feasibility study revealed only three families will be affected. The implementing agencies will compensate them accordingly, Matiang’i said. “Someone is alleging that when completed, the dam will have crocodiles. That is utter nonsense,” the CS said. He urged Nyamira county commissioner Isaiah Nakoru to arrest those inciting residents against the project.
