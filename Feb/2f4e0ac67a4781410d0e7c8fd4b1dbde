Understaffing and the shortage of equipment and fuel have been blamed for the filth piling up in the city. Only 22 trucks out of 60 are used to collect waste. A report tabled by Environment committee chairman John Kamau says 38 trucks have broken down. The department has 565 employees, including about 400 manual workers. Of the total staff, about 60 per cent are at least 55 years old. The Komarock MCA said the ageing group cannot provide optimal service, further hurting the exercise, which was devolved to the subcounty level under the stewarsship of subcounty administrators. MCAs have complained about the waste piling up in their wards. They want collection points increased. The county is soon expected to distribute at least 40 garbage skips to the wards, as waste collection is devolved further in a bid to improve efficiency. Currently, only 22 trucks out of 60 are operational within the county.
