The Kitui county assembly should be commended for its vigorous defence of Governor Charity Ngilu in enforcing the ban on the charcoal trade. The assembly outlawed the trade nearly four years ago through the Kitui County Charcoal Management Act. On Tuesday it cautioned Kitui charcoal dealers to stay out of trouble by keeping charcoal out of the county and said it would impose more stringent rules to enforce the ban. Commercial charcoal production and transportation has caused massive tree felling and deforestation in many parts of Kenya. In Kitui, charcoal producers, dealers and consumers have depleted the forests, leaving the county bare and without water. Farther afield in Nyeri county, Governor Mutahi Kahiga yesterday expressed concern over the high rate of deforestation in the Aberdare Forest (see P29). Kahiga called the situation “pathetic”. Destroying trees on private land, as in Kitui, is bad enough, but felling trees in a gazetted forest, as in Nyeri, is worse. With Kenya’s forest cover below the United Nations requirement of 10 per cent, one wonders why the National Environmental Management Authority has left the menace to the counties alone. This calls for a nationwide action plan.
