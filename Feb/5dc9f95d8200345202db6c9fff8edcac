Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa has pledged a crackdown on land grabbers frustrating the people in her constituency. Jumwa condemned the demolition of a four-story rental building at Ngalla estate in Malindi town and promised to protect the victims. The MP wondered how police demolished property worth millions of shillings at night without issuing a notice. She declared: “Land grabbers will not be entertained under my watch. I will stand with the people to the end. I will fight in court and politically until justice prevails." Security personnel and hired graders tore down the buildings on a disputed piece of land said to belong to the National Housing Corporation. Reports indicate police executed court orders but residents claimed a local tycoon was behind the move and had used the government institution to hide.

The MP flew from Nairobi to Mombasa and drove to Malindi after receiving news of the demolitions early Monday morning. She told property owners not to leave their premises and assured them nobody would grab their land. Jumwa noted some of the victims had genuine title deeds as they bought land from the corporation in 1993. “I will not allow people to be evicted in such a way. I have engaged my lawyer who will follow up the matter at my costs. I will not allow my people to be intimidated," she said. "Any grabber who wants to take over the land is dreaming." She later visited palm wine sellers in Maweni area within the town as their structures were demolished. She gave them Sh100,000 for new ventures. Click here for the latest political news
