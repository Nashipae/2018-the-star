Technical University of Mombasa has entered into collaboration with the Catholic University of Milan to offer Masters in Business Administration programme in the country. The partnership entered on Monday will target business innovators, business people and the working class and will focus on Impact Entrepreneurship programme. Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore’s senior management official, Prof Mario Molten and TUM’s acting vice chancellor Prof Laila Abubakar signed the MoU. The agreement will enhance and facilitate capacity building through staff and students’ exchange programmes. TUM becomes the first public university to offer the course in Kenya, joining Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Ghana, Uganda and Italy.“This unique programme is practical and involves a business coach on one- on-one consultancy. It’s offered in a blended formula, whereas half of the session is class work. The other one is distance learning.” Molten said. “The programme has to meet the requirements by Commission for University Education before commencement. This initiative will broaden our global TVET network as an institution," Abubakar said. The practical model of the course corresponds with the TVET programmes offered in TUM, which have seen the university nominated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) as a UNEVOC-TVET Centre of excellence in the region. Youth and Skills development is one of three core thematic areas of UNESCO, which is entirely responsible for entrepreneurship.
