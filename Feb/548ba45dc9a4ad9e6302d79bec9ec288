Tanzanian actress Jacqueline Wolper was in the country for a club appearance. Wolper, who doubles up as a fashion icon, is set to open one of the biggest clothing lines in Nairobi. "Kenya is my second home," she said. "Very soon, I'm opening a store in Nairobi. I have a couple of people who've asked for my designs here and I'm going to do them justice." Wolper, who hit the headlines for the better part of last year, says her relationship with Harmonize is over. "I know he still loves me, and the most interesting part is that the woman he is dating right now also knows Harmonize still loves me. A lot has been said in the past, most of which is not true, but the truth is Harmonize and I are done." She added: "I've moved on and I'm focusing on my career and life." And so, what kind of a man is ideal for her? "A man who is caring, clean, mature, understanding, a God-fearing one, among many more qualities." I couldn't help but ask her about Diamond Platnumz's baby mama drama, since the two are close friends. "What I can tell Diamond is that on social media, there is no love. You don't love someone on social media, but I believe my boss is clever; he knows to differentiate social media and real life." To her Kenyan fans, she said, "I love you so much, I'll make you proud very soon."
