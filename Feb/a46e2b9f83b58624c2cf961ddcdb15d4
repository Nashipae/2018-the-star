Kakamega Homeboyz coach Mike Mururi believes lack of cohesion in his new-look team was to blame for their 0-1 defeat to Sofapaka in the Kenyan Premier League on Saturday. Elli Asieche scored the all-important goal in stoppage time at the Mumias Sugar Complex in a match where the home side looked out of sorts for the better part of the encounter. Mururi said it is still too early to be written off and observed that the outfit will come good once the players gel. Homeboyz, who beat Thika United 1-0 in their previous encounter, courtesy of veteran striker Allan Wanga’s club debut goal. The Kakamega based club brought in 18 new faces including Wanga and defender, James Situma among others making them the busiest of the 18 KPL clubs during the end of year transfer window. “The defence was not well off with the new centrebacks having a little problem in communication,” said Mururi. Homeboyz’s defence led by Situma had hard times containing the Batoto Ba Mungu attacks. However, Mururi took positives from the encounter and hailed the attacking department led by Wanga, who created numerous chances alongside playmaker Moses Mudavadi. “Wanga had a good game and he has picked up well even though he could not score today,” said Mururi. On the other side Sofapaka new signing Asieche felt delighted in the midst of his new teammates. “I feel at home here and the spirit is just amazing. I am happy to be in this team,” said Asieche, who came off the bench. Asieche was acquired from Kariobangi Sharks during the just concluded transfer window and was elated to help Sofapaka forget their opening day blues where they fell 0-3 to Bandari in their season opener.
