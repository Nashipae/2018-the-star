Kiosks and other structures on road reserves will soon be demolished, Nyeri Transport executive Muthui Kariuki has warned. He said yesterday that some towns have been congested due to illegal kiosks on roadsides. They are Nyeri, Karatina, Chaka, Mweiga, Mukurweini and Naromoru. “We have started marking the illegal structures,” Kariuki said. “The congestion has hampered rehabilitation of pavements and expansion of roads. We shall reclaim them and give them back to pedestrians.” He said only temporary licenses had been issued. Illegal kiosks have mushroomed along the road leading to the Nyeri Referral Hospital and pedestrians are forced to walk on the road. This is dangerous because of ambulances entering and leaving the facility. He said traders will be given enough time to remove their wares before demolition. “We are also unclogging the drainages and covering manholes, mostly in Nyeri town, before moving to smaller townships.” The government has also started a programme of clearing and improving drainage systems ahead of the long rains in March or April. “Once the roads are cleared, they will be re-carpeted so we can regain the lost glory of the town,” he said. Roads in slums will also be repaired to facilitate rescue in case of fires and other emergenies, Kariuki said. In 2013, traders from Narumoru town stormed the Nyeri county assembly demanding explanation for demolition of their kiosks. The traders disrupted the assembly, forcing the county representatives to storm out of the house and restrain them. The traders accused their county assembly members of being behind their woes for allegedly selling some kiosks to influential businessmen and allowing their wares to be destroyed.
