About 350 police officers from the Flying Squad and the Special Crime Prevention Unit have been transferred. The revamp of the elite police squads became clearer yesterday, as DCI chief George Kinoti announced the transfers. They will be replaced by officers from other units. The two units lost about 100 officers in the changes released yesterday, while another 250 officers were moved on Monday night. Read: Why Kinoti is revamping fearsome Flying Squad The restructuring came after reports some officers were colluding with criminals and hiring out guns. The idea was mooted at a meeting of senior police commanders at the Kenya School of Government last week. President Uhuru Kenyatta attended part of the meeting. A section of senior officers opposed the changes, citing the current political climate. But some complained that Flying Squad officers attached to divisional police headquarters had become rogue, hence the need for changes. It was, therefore, resolved that all officers serving in the units be transferred and replaced with new officers from other units. Flying Squad chief Said Kiprotich and Special Crime Unit boss Noah Katumo were, however, retained. The transfers are aimed at trimming the numbers in the two units to improve efficieny. Kinoti, in an interview with the Star, said the units will be rebuilt and will have a maximum of 100 officers each. The changes are aimed at building a single command for the specialised teams. The Flying Squad will now fall under one commander, as opposed to the previous structure where officers reported to divisional police commanders. Focus now shifts to the Criminal Intelligence Unit, which Kinoti said would also undergo major changes. Kinoti took over from Ndegwa Muhoro in January. He is expected to conduct more changes within the departments. Related: I did my best as DCI, Muhoro says as Kinoti takes over  Click here for the latest political news
