COTU boss Francis Atwoli has hit out at majority leader Aden Duale and Labour CS nominee Ukur Yuttani for their plan to eject him from the NSSF board. Atwoli said Duale's remarks on NSSF are erroneous and misleading. During cabinet vetting on Friday, Duale asked Yattani to confirm if he will drop FKE boss Jacqueline Mugo and Atwoli from the board for serving more than two terms of three years.

In a statement on Saturday, Atwoli said the union takes great exception to the uninformed statement made by Duale. "The unfortunate statement clearly attests to the usual obsession by certain forces in positions of power with the operations of the NSSF," he said. In 2013, then Labour CS Kazungu Kambi fired Mugo and Atwoli from the board. But activist Charles Omanga moved to court to have the two reinstated.

Atwoli added: "It is even more dangerous that he is the person charged with the responsibility to answer questions in Parliament." According to the new NSSF Act No. 45 of 2013, Atwoli and Mugo are serving their first term in office as members of the NSSF Board of Trustees and remain eligible for re-appointment for a second term in order to serve their two full terms.
