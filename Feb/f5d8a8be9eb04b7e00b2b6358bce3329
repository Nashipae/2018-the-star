Gordon Ogada — a mystery man aged between 20 and 40 — is Kenya’s newest millionaire, winning the Sh230 million SportPesa mega jackpot. It’s the biggest pot of gold in SportPesa history. Little is known about the man, but sources say he is from Migori and said to be an orphan. Ogada correctly predicted the outcome of 17 football matches last week. He takes home Sh230,742,881. This is the third time a Kenyan has won. In May last year, Samuel Abisai won Sh221 million. A month later, three winners shared Sh115 million.

Ogada won after a public draw on Tuesday to predict the outcome of the Troyes vs Dijon match. Ogada will meet the public today. Four other winners will walk away with Sh6 million, Sh265,250, Sh40,136 and Sh11,157 for correctly predicting 15, 14, 13 and 12 scores, respectively. The mega jackpot runs every weekend. The amount increases weekly until there is a winner. Following the win, the betting starts again with a basic Sh100 million. The Consumers Federation of Kenya says SportPesa should prepare and counsel vulnerable winners on impending cultural shocks. “Opening them up too soon, especially to media, destroys them almost irreparably as victims of instant success,” Cofek tweeted.
