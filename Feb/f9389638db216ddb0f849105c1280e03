Garissa Knut branch and school heads have appealed to the state to move the ongoing issuance of birth certificates to the six subcounties. Area Knut secretary Abdirizak Hussein said it is difficult for parents from far subcounties such as Hulugho which is about 400km away to come and register their children. Addressing the press in Garissa town yesterday, Hussein said the current arrangement was inconveniencing hence making it impossible to beat the March 31 deadline. “The department concerned should post staff to the subcounties and ensure each child at village level is issued with a birth certificate. Let the offices reach the people and not the other way round,” he said. He said it is practically impossible and difficult for a whole village to travel all the way from Holugho and Liboi which are the farthest points from Garissa,” he said. Speaking separately, Garissa Primary School head teacher Ahmed Abdi said the school has managed to get certificates from 254 pupils yet it has a population of 1,332. “This is an urban school. Look at the numbers we have managed so far. That is way below 20 per cent. This is a big challenge. It is my appeal that the offices be decentralised,” Abdi said. A spot check by the Star at the Huduma centres has shown that parents from across the county have flocked into the facilities trying to secure the important document for their children ahead of the deadline. Mohamed Abdulllahi, a Holugho resident was there to try and secure the document for his class seven son. “I traveled from Hulugho two days ago but I am yet to get the document. It is a long and tedious process. It would have been better if the government brought this important services to our areas instead of subjecting us to this suffering,” he said.
