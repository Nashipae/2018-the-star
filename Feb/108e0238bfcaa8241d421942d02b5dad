Mathew Lesiyampe, 50, is a former athlete and ex-army officer in Samburu Central
Sub-county. Early last year, he gave up on livestock, sold off his cattle and began to grow cabbages, kale, garlic, tomatoes
and capsicum on his three out of 18 acres. He has earned more than Sh5 million since. Here is a good example of the fact that if the people of Samburu engaged in irrigated agriculture, they can become food-secure and
prosperous. Large herds of cattle put pressure on the land in the arid
and semi-arid lands and contribute to the annual cycle of drought and massive
cattle rustling. Concentrating on only his three acres of irrigated
horticulture, Lesiyampe paid off a Sh2.8 million loan with his first crop. He
will earn even more with his second crop, given that he has no loan to clear
now. The belief that pastoralists are incapable of
agriculture could soon become a thing of the past. Lesiyampe has set a good and demonstrable example and the Samburu
county government should seize the day and lead the way. It may start with masterminding a change of the pastoralist mindset, which is easier said than done.
