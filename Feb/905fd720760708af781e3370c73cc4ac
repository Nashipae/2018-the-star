The Kilifi government has no policy or laws to guide the management of forests, conservation organisations have said. Theyhave said the county has not gazetted any forest for lack of a legal framework. Some of the forests in the county are on the verge of extinction due to the continuous destruction, charcoal burning, logging and farming activities. Conservation groups have started pushing for formulation of policies and laws for management of forests. They have drafted a Bill, and a policy that could soon be tabled in the county assembly. Nature Kenya engaged other conservation groups and drafted the Kilifi County Forest Bill and the Kilifi County Forest Policy and said the process started in 2016 and is now in the final stage. Some of the forests under threat are the Mwangea Hills, the Dakacha Woodland Forest and the Madunguni Forest. Nature Kenya’s Francis Kagema said one key important thing with the Kilifi Forest Policy is the structure of governance. “We have put together a structure that involves a forest committee at the county level, which will be the key decision-making organ on forest issues,” he said. He spoke on Saturday. Kagema said forest management should be under a unit in the Executive. “Even now we are in the process of educating people about the content of the document. We believe the document is good and ready to be presented to the Kilifi assembly,” he said. Arabuko-Sokoke Forest Adjacent Dwellers’ Association chairman Abas Athman said they are pushing the county to formulate laws that will help to protect the forests.
