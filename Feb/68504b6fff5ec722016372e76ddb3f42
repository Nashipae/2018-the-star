Lamu residents do not have the skills required for employment in the multi-billion shilling projects to be commissioned in the county, a leading scholar has said. Technical University of Mombasa acting Vice Chancellor Laila Abubakar on Wednesday said the government will be forced to outsource labour. Among the key projects coming up in Lamu is the Lapsset. The government has already enrolled 400 youths in various colleges to equip them with skills in readiness for employment when the project starts. A port, an international port, crude oil pipeline and three resort cities are among facilities to be built under the Lapsset project. The government is planning to set up a coal energy plant in Lamu. Abubakar urged the government to train more people. She asked local leaders to take the lead in training residents. Speaking at the university’s Lamu Campus, Abubakar decried the unwillingness of students to take up scholarships on offer. “Leaders and scholars must continue to encourage our people to change their attitude and grab the opportunities,” Abubakar said. The Lapsset Authority has partnered with the university to offer courses with relevant skills.
