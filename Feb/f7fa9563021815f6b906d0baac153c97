The living standard of more that 8,000 families will be uplifted following a new Sh4 billion Maruguini slum upgrading project in Nairobi. Speaking to the Star yesterday, South B MCA Chege Waithera said the project will begin in April and be completed by 2020. It is funded by the county and national government. “Life in the slum is difficult. Sanitation is poor, and there is pollution. This will be addressed once the project is complete,” Waithera said. The project will include 12-floor apartments that will accommodate 2,600 housing units. However, the number of apartments to be build, has not been identified. Waithera said she would push for construction work to be done swiftly so that the project is completed before it’s set timeline. She said resident will be required to pay 10 per cent deposit before occupying the houses and the balance will be clear in a span of 25 years . There is no limitation on the installments.
