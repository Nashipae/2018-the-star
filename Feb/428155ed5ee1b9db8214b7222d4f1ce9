A free medical camp programme has been launched in Thika constituency to extend health services to the poor. The programme, which was launched on Saturday, is an initiative of MP Patrick Wainaina. The MP sponsored a free medical camp on the Kiganjo estate. More than 2,000 residents were treated. Wainaina said many poor residents, especially those in remote villages, do not access efficient and effective health services, since they cannot raise money for transport and medication. The MP said the programme will be rolled out in Ngoliba, Gatuanyaga, Kamenu, Hospital and Township wards. The drive will be conducted every two months.
