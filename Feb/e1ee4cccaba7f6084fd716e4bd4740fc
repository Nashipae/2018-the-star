The outcome of three election petitions in the North Rift region will be known at the end of this month after submissions closed before Eldoret High Court Judge George Kimondo. Justice Kimondo will deliver the rulings on three consecutive days starting with Marakwet East on February 27, Trans Nzoia (Senatel) on February 28, and Nandi Hills on March 1. In Marakwet East, voter Sammy Kemboi is challenging the election of MP Bowen Kangogo who defeated independent candidate and former MP Linah Jebii Kilimo with less than 1,000 votes. Kemboi claims the election was marred by massive irregularities and rigging. In the Trans Nzoia case, former Senator Henry ole Ndiema of Ford Kenya is challenging he election of his successor Mike Mbito of Jubilee. Ndiema alleges glaring irregularities in the re-count in 11 polling stations led to the margin between Mbito and Ndiema to decline by 351 votes. Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter will know his fate in a petition filed by Bernard Kitur. He alleges his opponent conducted illegal campaigns on August 6 and August 7 and also bribed voters. Keter won the seat with 28,923 votes against Kitur, an independent, who got 13,872 votes. ODMâ€™s Isaac Kirwa emerged third with 863 votes.
