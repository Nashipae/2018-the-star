Murang’a residents will get water at cheaper prices. The Murang’a Water and Sanitation Company notified customers via SMS it has advised the Water Services Regulatory Board to approve the reduced prices. From March 1, the base charge will be Sh200, down from Sh330. Residents who use four units will be charged Sh200 and will pay Sh70 for each additional unit up to 20. Businesses that use between 21 to 50 units will pay Sh90 per unit and Sh100 from 51 to 100. The company has also waived meter rent of Sh50, separation fees of Sh1,000, connection fees of Sh2,000 and application fees of Sh200. The reconnection fees has been reduced from Sh500 to Sh300. A letter to Wasreb by Muwasco managing director Daniel Ng’ang’a said the current tarrifs were to expire on June 30 next year. “However, due to the public outcry and pressure from residents, the Murang’a county government has directed water companies to review their tariffs downwards,” the letter dated February 12 reads. The new tariffs will end a row between the company and locals who protested against exorbitant prices. Last year, Governor Mwangi wa Iria called a meeting to discuss the tariffs, but the company sued to block the discussion, saying it was illegal.
