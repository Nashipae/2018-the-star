Kisii University Kabarnet town campus has laid off 11 staff, raising fears it might be grappling with challenges that might lead to closure. Among the affected were departments were marketing, library, registry, finance, ICT and faculty administrators. Those laid off had been hired on contracts. “In December, I was served with a regret letter that finally led to unclear termination of my services,” a ex-staff, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. He is among the 11 staff, whose contracts were stopped, are yet to be paid their dues. New campus director Chang'masa Sogomo yesterday said the campus has few students. “We had to layoff a number of staff,” he told the Star. He said the college had more than 1,000 students last year, but now has only 500. The rest of the students are said to have left because of lack of lecturers and claims of lack of transcripts. Sogomo said hiring of the staff was previously done informally and some of them did not meet the requirements. The campus in Kipnyegwei Plaza on the Kabarnet -Kabartonjo road opened its doors in May 2014. It enjoyed the full political support of former Governor Benjamin Cheboi. It offers courses in faculty of education, arts and social sciences, School of business and economics, faculty of Information science and technology.
