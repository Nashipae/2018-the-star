The Boni community in Lamu county want the government to compensate them, saying their lives have been disrupted by the Lapsset project. They say the Lapsset passes through their lands and there is need for the community to compensated. The community occupies Milimani, Mangai, Mararani, Kiangwe and Basuba areas. Most lands in these areas are still unregistered, hence denying residents legal protection of their property. Elders from the community yesterday said all the Lapsset components, including roads, railway lines and pipelines will go through their lands and the community will be adversely affected. They spoke when they met in Bargoni. Elder Ali Gubo said it is unfair that the government only compensated those whose lands were acquired for the Lapsset in Kililana and Mashunduani. In 2015, the government spent more than Sh1.3 billion as compensation for more than 100 individuals, whose lands was acquired for the project. “Some of us could lose our homes to pave way for the roads, pipelines and railway lines in the port. We still can't understand why the government isn’t talking of compensating us,” Gubo said. Elder Doza Diza said the government had indicated it would only compensate the Bonis for trees that will be felled to allow for the establishment of railroads, pipelines and roads. "It has taken us decades to conserve the Boni Forest and telling us we shall only be compensated for trees is an insult. They know our lands shall be taken away and they must pay us,” he said. He said the community is also disappointed since the government has not put in place a comprehensive and coherent strategy to ensure the Aweer community and other indigenous groups are not deprived of their integrity as a people. Diza said there is little political will towards ensuring that communal land is secured.
