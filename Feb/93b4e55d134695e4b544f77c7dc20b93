Hiring a new Kenya Simbas coach will cost Kenya Rugby Union Sh3m, chairman Richard Omwela has revealed. The Union have identified a coach from New Zealand though Omwela did not divulge his name o the other terms of engagement including contract duration. Omwela revealed that the coach will come with his backroom staff including a strength and conditioning coach, physiotherapist and technical advisers for the team. The union parted ways with South Africa’s Jerome Paarwater in December after a six-year stint with the national side. Last week, the government donated sent Sh31m to the union but Omwela said the hiring of the 15s coach was not among the items factored. Omwela observed that the government is paying dues for Harambee Stars coach, Paul Put, and the same should happen with the 15s team. “I think we at rugby deserve equal treatment that the govt foot the bill for the national team coach because the team will be representing the country in the forthcoming Rugby World Cup qualifiers,” said Omwela. The team started their preparations for the qualifiers last week with two training sessions on Monday and Tuesday with a scaled down squad of 18 players, a departure from the previous program targeting 30-35 players. The squad is going to be increased in the coming weeks according to team manager Wangila Simiyu. The union is planning two test matches in May before the World Cup qualifiers kickoff in June with an away tie in Morocco on June 23 before facing Zimbabwea week later at the RFUEA Grounds. The Simbas then face neighbours Uganda on July 7 at home, Tunisia on August 11 and Namibia on August 18. The winner of the six-nation tournament will automatically qualify for the World Cup while the second placed team will be subjected to a four-nation repacharge tournament that will involve a team each from the Americas, Europe and Asia.
