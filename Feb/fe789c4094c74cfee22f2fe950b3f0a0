A Garissa court yesterday upheld the election of Abakaile MCA Mohamed Ali. Ali (ODM) is also the county assembly Minority leader. He garnered 1,826 votes in the August 8 election, while petitioner Abdiwahab Sheikh of ANC had 1,799. Sheikh had said the election was mired in irregularities. He said the IEBC officials failed to empty ballot boxes before voting started. They also failed to display cast ballots to agents during counting, he said. But chief magistrate Cosmas Maundu said the evidence adduced by the petitioner could not be relied on. He dismissed the case with Sh1 million costs. “The petitioner had not proved the case to the required standards. His evidence was not enough to prove any irregularities during the election. He relied on evidence not in his pleadings,” Maundu said. Ali thanked his family, friends and the people of Abakaile for “standing with me throughout the petition”. “I’ll embark on delivering on my promises,” he told his supporters.
