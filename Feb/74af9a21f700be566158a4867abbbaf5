A group of youth leaders from the Rift Valley have said Bringo Senator Gideon Moi is best suited to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022 and not DP William Ruto. The youth caucus, with representatives from more than 15 counties, said on Saturday although they have no problem with Ruto, they believe Gideon has the best qualities. “He represents the interests of the youth and cuts a national image, which is likeable by many Kenyans,” Allan Mulwa, the chairman of the group, said. The youth said they are ready to back Gideon for the top seat during the 2022 General Election. Mulwa said their support for the legislator is their democratic right to back a leader of their choice. “We know the DP is also eyeing the seat, but it’s our right to back a person we chose. That is why we have settled on Gideon,” Mulwa said. He said the caucus “Vijana na Gidy” will go round the country to interact with the youth and share ideas on how to deal with the challenges they face. “We want the youth to take advantage of opportunities available in the counties, including contracts and job opportunities,” he said.
