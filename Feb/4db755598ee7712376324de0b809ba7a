Sixteen former illicit brew addicts have been discharged from the Igegania Level 4 Hospital in Gatundu North, Kiambu. They had withdrawal symptoms when they were admitted. All the 16 are from Makwa village. Igegania medical superintendent Dennis Kinyanjui said Makwa is an illicit brew hub. The 16 were counselled and given medication. The youths publicly declared they will not go back to drinking again. The group included former distillers who abused changâ€™aa, smoked bhang and took kuber. The illicit brews are distilled on the banks of the River Chania. Kiambu Health chief officer Andrew Toro said the county government will give a Sh300 stipend and facilitate a feeding programme for former youth alcoholics. Toro said they would be given village cleaning jobs to keep them away from the brew dens.
