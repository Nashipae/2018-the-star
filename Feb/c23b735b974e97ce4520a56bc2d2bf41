Kisumu residents, the home county of the film star, got the opportunity to watch
the highly anticipated movie before the rest of Africa. This was during the official launch at Planet Media, Mega City. The film, featuring Nyong'o's daughter, has been developed since 1992. She plays a lead role in the riveting story about a young man
T’Challa, who after the death of his father, returns home to Africa to take his rightful place as a King of the Wakanda. In the film, a powerful enemy reappears and T’Challa’s mantle as
King- and as Black Panther-gets tested when he’s drawn into a conflict that
puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk. The movie is being featured by Crimson Multimedia Limited. According to Crimson MD Trushna Maddhdev- Patel, the film is another
historic moment for Africans as they celebrate another milestone made by fellow
brothers and sisters. Tourism CEC Achi Ojany said the event featured
