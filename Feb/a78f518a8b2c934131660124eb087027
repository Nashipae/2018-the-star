Busia ANC leaders have told Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli to stop sabotaging their party leader Musalia Mudavadi. They said they are firmly behind NASA leader Raila Odinga who was sworn in as the ‘People’s President’ on January 30. Speaking to the media in Port Victoria trading centre, Budalang’i, on Sunday, Busia ANC deputy chairman John Kulokhoma said Atwoli’s persistent attacks against Mudavadi and branding him a coward are baseless. He said Mudavadi is a determined and visionary leader, who openly declared support for Raila before, during and after the August 8 General Election.
