Speaker Justin Muturi has dismissed the "misplaced" petition for Chief Justice David Maraga and several others to be kicked out of the Judicial Service Commission. Muturi also said on Tuesday that the petition was "a long shot, pedestrian and a fishing expedition". "The House will not look at the content of the document ... the petition falls on on its own sword," he said at Parliament. "The petition has failed miserably. The petition is not admissible as it seeks the removal of JSC members in a manner that is unknown and not contemplative. It is fatal." On Monday, a lawyer petitioned the National Assembly to initiate the removal of Maraga, Deputy CJ Philomena Mwilu, and five JSC members for gross misconduct. The others are Justice Mohammed Warsame, Aggrey Muchelule, Tom Ojienda, Emily Ominde, and Mercy Deche Muturi further noted the group did not violate any law and the Constitution He added: "Particulars indicated relate to administrative action which is a matter for judicial review, not for Parliament." Petitioner Adrian Njenga accused Maraga, Mwilu and the others of shielding, protecting and exonerating judges engaged in gross misconduct. "The aforementioned have failed to promote and facilitate the independence and accountability of the Judiciary, and the transparent administration of justice," Njenga said.
