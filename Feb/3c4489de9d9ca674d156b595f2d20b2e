Four people died on the spot near Kwa Mungania, Meru county, after a truck driver lost control of the vehicle transporting fertiliser on Nanyuki-Isiolo road. It was headed to Isiolo. The vehicle veered off the road and crashed on residential homes killing one woman and her child, the driver and another man. Buuri subcounty police boss David Muange said the driver may have been fatigued after a long journey from Mombasa. The vehicle caught fire and its front was reduced to ashes. "If the driver had the experience of certain areas within the road, he could have safely parked it," he said. Muange urged residents who may have been hurt to visit the nearest hospital. Buuri MP asked vehicle owners to employ more long-distance drivers. He also urged traffic base commanders and county commanders to be vigilant on all defective or unroadworthy vehicles.
