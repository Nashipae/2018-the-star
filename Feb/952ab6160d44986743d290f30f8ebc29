Two people died as a fire razed their four houses Kisumu Ndogo Slum in Athi River, Machakos county, early Sunday morning. Vincent Baraza and Gerald Oluoch worked at at the Athi River factory of Kifaru Unga Limited. They had been sleeping when their rented mabati house burned from about 1.30am. Resident Josephine Wambua said Baraza and Oluoch shared a single room and slept on a mattress on the floor. "They lived miserable lives," she said at the scene, adding they did not have relatives. Wambua further said most of the company’s employees live in the slum since they are paid poorly and it’s located nearby. “I sympathise with the company’s employees. They cannot afford modest houses due to meager pay. Some of them do not even have houses." Residents claimed the two went to bed drunk. “We don’t sleep in Kisumu Ndogo whenever Kifaru Unga pays its workers. Majority are drunkards. The two who perished in the fire were also drunkards," Wambua said. Residents said they called Machakos county for emergency response but that they could not get help. “We called for fire brigade services but we were told there was no functional engine. For how long will we live like this? We wonder why the Mavoko sub-county fire engine cannot be fixed to help with emergencies." Wambua said they demolished houses to keep the fire from spreading from four houses which were completely destroyed. The cause of the fire was not immediately clear. Mavoko chief Nzau Komo saidd police took the bodies to City Mortuary but residents said police do not properly clear scenes after such incidents. Click here for the latest political stories
