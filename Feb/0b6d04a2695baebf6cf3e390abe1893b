The government has recruited more police reservists to boost its war against terrorists in parts of Northeastern and along the 1,000Km Kenya-Somalia border The Star has established that armed locals, who are mainly drawn from former police officers, have been deployed to guard key government installations, schools and social amenities along the vast border. This is commendable if it will eradicate the chronic insecurity in the area and along the long border with mostly lawless Somalia. The security challenge will test any combination of forces from anywhere in the world and the government must do all it can to provide the same level of security now established in Nairobi and Mombasa. The vast region has the same language and the same predominant religion and there are unresolved historical issues harking from as far back as the Shifta rebellion of 1963-67 and the 1984 Wagalla Massacre. Northeastern leaders have long urged the government to recruit and deploy locals as National Police Service reservists. They insist locals are the only people who can engage and fight the Shabaab militia, since they have better knowledge of the terrain and hideouts. It is a good thing that government finally seems to have begun listening to the concerned citizens.
