Champion Sanford Otundo has taken a three-point lead in his quest to defend the Inspector General Trophy for a second time in the ongoing competitions at the Defence Forces Rifle Range in Nanyuki, Laikipia County. Otundo is the only firer, who has won the IG Trophy since its inception in 2016 and the astute marksman is keen on retaining it, especially after missing out on three Cups—Gun Score, Bob Morgan and Eleanor Malik—shot in January. Amid the outrageous mirage at the range, the General Service Unit (GSU) senior sergeant Otundo carded 509 points with 31 vee-bulls out of 555, 111v to grab the pole position of the Deputy Inspector General (Administration Police) in the shoot that started on Saturday. Though he came second to Christopher Saina in the short range (300m, 500m and 600m), Otundo excelled in the the long distances (800m and 900m) to claim the top position in the Super-X GSU podium sweep. Both long and short range distances were shot twice to arrive at the Highest Possible Score of 555 points for 111 vee-bulls- 105,21, 150,30 (short) and 150,30 and 150,30 (long). Otundo downed 245 points for 17 vee-bulls in the short distances as senior sergeant Saina carded 248 for 25v and third place Police Constable Reuben Macharia recorded 242, 17v. With Saina leading Otundo with three points, the IG Trophy defending champion raked in 264 for 14v, shooting his way to lead a field of 83 firers. In the 800m and 900m, Saina garnered 258 points to place second overall to Otundo with 506 for 35v. Macharia amassed 245, 8v in the long range shoot to bring his total of the DIG tally to 487, 25v. “It is quite hot down here at the range. The mirage keeps changing direction every now and then, so I’ve been critical that my eyes remain glued to the scope to notice any slight change, and it paid off,” intimated Otundo, who has finally found a balance between his leadership duties as a captain and his performance. GSU’s Grace Rantile was the top lady with 463 points for 24v. ‘X’ class top two positions were a reserve of Directorate of Criminal Investigations shooters as Eliphas Ng’etich and Francis Kinyua raked in 491 points for 21v and 470, 19v respectively.
