Nema might sue a group of supermarkets in Naivasha for disobeying the plastic bags ban. Nema has issued a one-week notice to the traders to stop using the bags to pack customers’ goods. Nema had given supermarkets and wholesalers a grace period to exhaust the paper bags in their stores. But two months after the grace period, some traders were still using the plastic bags saying they had not exhausted their stock. Nema officer Jessica Kahura said small-scale traders have respected the ban, but big businesses are breaking the law. “We are happy Mama mbogas and those packing mandazis are following the law,” she said. Kahura said the majority of residents have followed rules. “We have seen a major difference in Naivasha, which was literally covered in plastic bags. After the ban was imposed, the town became a lot cleaner,” she said.
