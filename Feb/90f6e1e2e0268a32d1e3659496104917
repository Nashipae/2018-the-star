More than 300 professionals from Marakwet on Tuesday called on the state to move with speed and restore order in Kerio Valley. Banditry attacks in the area in the past one year have claimed more than 120 lives and property estimated to cost Sh1 billion destroyed. Led Albert Kimutai and Christine Tarus, they said the community had suffered a lot from banditry and cattle rustling activities perpetuated gangs from the neighbouring Pokot community. Former IG David Kimaiyo and former CEO of the Moi Referral Hospital Dr John Kibosia say the government is a let down. They said a lasting solution should be found since lives of thousands have been ruined by the attackers who roam the valley easily. Kimaiyo called on both Marakwet and Pokot to convene a peace and reconciliation meeting. Kimutai accused the state of sidelining them and protecting the bandits. Taurus appreciated the deployment of police reservists in the region but noted the attacks are still being witnessed. The community has demanded the return of 300 cattle and 1,000 sheep valued at Sh21 million which they claim were stolen by bandits from the Pokot side. They have also threatened to take measures to protect itself should the state fail to play its constitutional mandate to safeguard the lives and property of all Kenyans.
