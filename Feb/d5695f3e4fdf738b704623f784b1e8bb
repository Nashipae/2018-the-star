Kisumu and Busia MCAs have said they did not break the law by passing the People's Assembly motion. The two assemblies said MCAs represent the will of the majority of voters and they cannot be stopped
from conducting business on the floor of the House. Busia MCAs, through clerk Allan Mabuka, said they
passed the motion following popular demand to push for electoral change as the August
8 presidential election was not free and fair. Kisumu clerk Benson Opiyo said the county assemblies are immune
from prosecution in regard to legislation passed. The Attorney General has sued 14 county assemblies for passing the People's Assembly motion. Kisumu and Busia are the only assemblies that
have filed responses. Justice Chacha Mwita referred the case to CJ David Maraga to
constitute a bench to hear the matter.
