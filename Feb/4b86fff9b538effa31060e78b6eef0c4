More than 70 people on Friday were left homeless after a fire destroyed their houses in Raila village, Lang’ata. Nobody was injured. The incident comes barely two weeks after a fire swept through Kijiji village in the same area. Four people were killed in the Kijiji inferno and 6,000 left homeless. The cause of the noon inferno was not immediately established. But some residents and leaders suspect an electrical fault. The fire was put out after about one hour, following the swift response by the county firefighters. “It [fire] started in the house in the middle of this area, but we cannot surely say what caused it,” resident Bob Ogola said. Resident Pauline Mundia said she lost all her belongings. Lang’ata MP Nixon Korir said lack of access roads hindered firefighters from saving many houses. The legislator said he would meet area leaders and homeowners to discuss how access roads can be established in all informal settlements in the subcounty Korir urged the county government to devolve firefighting services to the subcounties. “The county needs to be prepared. We need a fire station, complete with a fire engine, ambulance and water bowsers,” he said Also Read:Fifth body pulled out of Lang'ata slum fire debris Click here for the latest political news
