A rape suspect accused of involvement in the gang-rape of a 14-year-old girl in Wajir was on Friday detained pending investigations. Mohamed Salah and two others are accused of committing the offence in Habaswein. He denied the charges before Wajir chief magistrate Amos Muroka. Salah is alleged to have picked the minor, a Form One student, from school. He had disguised himself as a Good Samaritan who was offering a lift.

Salah then raped the girl before “inviting” his two colleagues who picked up from where he left. Muroka ordered that Salah be remanded until March 5 due to the sensitivity of the matter. He cited earlier incidences where rape suspects were released on bond only for them to compromise the victims’ parents, leading to the collapse of cases. Habaswein OCPD Caleb Wesa said police were still looking for the other two suspects. The minor had been airlifted to Nairobi for treatment. Cases of rape and defilement have been on the rise in Wajir since last year. In December, another secondary schoolgirl was gang-raped by a group of five men. The case is in court. Wekesa urged communities in the region not to interfere with cases involving rape and defilement. Click here for the latest political news
