Kiringi residents in the outskirts of Migori town were yesterday disappointed after police and Kenya Wildlife Service officers stopped them from kill ing a stranded hippo. At night, villagers said they had spotted the animal grazing on the banks of the river. At dawn, an elderly man who had gone to his shamba was shocked when he found the animal eating his cassava crop. “He just stood transfixed as if he had seen a ghost. At first he thought it was a cow. His shamba is near River Migori,” resident Samson Ojwang said. He walked to his house and alerted his children who raised the alarm. “Instead of chasing the animal we came out with pangas, sufurias and knives to have a feat before the animal could make it back to the river,” Ojwang said. The news on the animal spread like a wildfire. Residents took time off from demonstrations to have opposition politician Miguna Miguna released from custody. “We know such animal might have been brought by night runners, but we don’t care as this is ‘manna’ sent from heaven,” resident Albert Odero said. Youths lined up along the river bank and attempted to spear the animal. However, police officers and KWS officers from Homa Bay town arrived the scene and thwarted the villagers plan of a feast. They were forced to fire in the air to chase the mammoth crowd that had turned up for feat.
