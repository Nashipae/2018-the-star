Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o and Deputy Governor Mathews Owili yesterday sued the government for withdrawing their bodyguards. In a petition filed at the Kisumu law courts, Nyong’o and Owili want the decision suspended until the case is heard and determined. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet, Interior CS Fred Matiang’i and the Attorney General are listed as respondents. Nyong’o and Owili said the decision by the government to withdraw their security puts their lives at risk. Through lawyers Victor Obondi and Stanley Ogejo, they said the decision is discriminatory and unlawful. The applicants argued that the state has not given them reasons why it withdrew police officers who have been guarding them. “We are in court to challenge the discriminatory decision by the state,” Obondi said. The police attached to Nyong’o and Owili were ordered back to their respective work stations five days ago. They said withdrawal of security targets members of NASA. “Every elected leader in the country is entitled to security. We will hold the government responsible should anything happen to any of us.” However, Justice David Majanja gave the Attorney General one day to submit a response in the matter. The case will be heard today. Meanwhile, Owili has criticised police for failing to obey court orders. He said the government partially obeyed an order to restore signals of KTN and NTV, leaving out Citizen TV. On Monday, the government restored the transmission of NTV and KTN television stations. The TV stations were switched off on January 30, when the swearing-in of NASA leader Raila Odinga as the ‘People’s President” was going on in Uuru Park. Owili said NASA leaders will not bow to intimidation and pressure from the Jubilee administration to abandon the fight of electoral injustice. “We will soldier on and emerge victorious,” he said.
