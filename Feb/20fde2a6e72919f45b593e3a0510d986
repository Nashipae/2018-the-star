Members of the Parliamentary Service Commission were sworn in yesterday to serve the 12th Parliament. National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi and seven MPs took oath to serve in the fifth commission. The other members are MPs Ben Momanyi (Borabu), Beth Mugo (nominated), Adan Keynan (Eldas), Aisha Jumwa (Malindi), Naomi Shaban (Taveta), George Khaniri (Vihiga) and Aaron Cheruiyot (Kericho). They have been urged to push for the review of the Parliamentary Service Act, 2000, to ensure it complies with the Constitution. Muturi, the chairman of the commission, said there is need for the Parliamentary Service Bill, 2017 to be adopted. He said the Bill should be passed by the Senate and the National Assembly. “We’ve not aligned our own Act to the Constitution. I urge you to actively give your input to the Bill and ensure it is passed,” he said.
