"In other regions, we distributed the same equipment, we had more than 50 beneficiaries in one sub-county but in Siaya we are having 64 beneficiaries," regretted Aliya. He said the tools will help people living with disability to be self-employed. Assistant County Commissioner Rhoda Chepkorir urged the leadership of persons living with disability to sensitize their members for the program. Chepkorir urged the beneficiaries to use the machines for intended purposes and not to sell them for money. She said that her office will closely monitor the beneficiaries and those found to have sold their equipment will face stern actions. The administrator asked chiefs to use their barazas to mobilize persons living with disability to come out and apply for the equipment from the government to boost their living standards. "It's of no benefit for our people to continue languishing in poverty when the government is geared to improve our lives, I want to encourage all persons with disability to ensure they apply for the program," Chepkorir said. She revealed that they are going to map out all persons living with disability in the region for easy identification of the beneficiaries of the program. "Let all those with relatives and neighbours living with any form disability to register them to the chief's offices in their respective areas for easy mapping," she added.
