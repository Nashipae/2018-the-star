A family of a woman who was killed and her body dumped in a bush in Homa Bay ten days ago is seeking justice. The woman's mother Alice Atieno on Sunday urged police to expedite investigations into the murder that took place in Kopiyo village. The deceased father Carilus Gogo who hails from Asumbi in Rangwe said allegedly that her daughter was killed by her husband who has since gone into hiding. Speaking to journalists on Sunday, Gogo said police were doing little to apprehend the suspect. “My daughter was brutally killed and dumped in a bush more than 10 days ago but nothing has happened. I appeal to the police to help me get justice over the death,” Gogo said. Atieno was attacked and killed when she allegedly went to meet a church pastor in Homa Bay. The late Atieno is reported to have been strangled to death. Before the incident, Atieno had quarrelled with her husband. The husband later tried to commit suicide by consuming poison. He was taken to Homa Bay County referral hospital but he later escaped. However, Homa Bay police commander Marius Tum said investigations are ongoing over the matter. “The suspect has not been arrested but we’ve launched investigations into the murder,” Tum said.
