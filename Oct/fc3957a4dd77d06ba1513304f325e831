Under-staffing, lack of drugs and medical equipment, and poor management are hurting services at Mama Lucy Hospital, a report has said. The report on a visit to the facility by the county assembly health team said it faces problems including demoralised staff, congestion and inefficient management procedures. The report was tabled by team chairman Peter Warutere on Wednesday. It said there are only two nurses in the paediatric outpatient section, who attend to more than 500 patients a day. The situation is similar in the medical lab, where there are only 14 technicians against a requirement of 25, it said. The report said the facility has only 112 beds and more than 1,200 patients visit each day. It has no store for drugs and medical equipment and only use an improvised cargo container as a warehouse, the report said.
