Brian Kassaine, a suspect who was arrested over Monica Kimani murder, has been ordered to report to the DCI every Thursday. Principal magistrate Justus Kituku ordered him to appear before the detectives without delays for further probe into the killing. The case will be mentioned on December 14 at the Kiambu law court. Kassaine is TV Journalist Jacque Maribe's neighbour. The latter and her fiance Joseph Irungu are the prime suspects in the case. The businessman, 35, was also directed to deposit his passport within the next 48 hours. "...failure to comply with the orders, the police will be at liberty to seek warrant of arrest on the same," the magistrate said. On his arrest, Kassaine told the police that Irungu, popularly known as Jowie, shot himself in a botched suicide attempt. He said that Irungu had on September 11 borrowed his Ceska pistol for "training", but the gun had no bullets. Kassaine said he was at his Royal Park estate house in Langata on September 21 when he was woken up at around midnight by someone knocking his gate.
