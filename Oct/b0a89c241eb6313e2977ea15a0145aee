 Tomorrow will be a public holiday, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i said yesterday. Matiang’i however said he could not pronounce the manner in which the day will be observed. Moi Day was removed from the list of national holidays following promulgation of the Constitution in August 2010. But the High Court reinstated the day to be marked as a holiday on grounds its removal was in contravention of the Public Holidays Act. Justice George Odunga made the ruling in November last year.
