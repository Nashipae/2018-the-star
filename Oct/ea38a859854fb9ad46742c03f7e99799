A junior KDF officer was among two people arrested in Nakuru on Monday for theft of a motor vehicle. The KDF officer and his accomplice were trailed after allegedly stealing a Probox car in Naivasha. A senior police officer, who is privy to the case, told the Star in confidence that the officer was found with the vehicle which was destined for Kisii. In another incident, a car which was stolen in Naivasha's Kayole estate was found abandoned on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru said the car was stolen during a robbery at the estate on Sunday evening. "We are interrogating the two suspects (KDF officer and his accomplice) in connection with other carjacking incidents." "A hunt is on for three other suspects. The two are on their way to court. We believe they are linked to the robberies here," he said. Separately, a man whose body was found dumped in Kinungi on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway has been identified. Hassan Mahat was reported missing last Friday after he was not seen at his home in Eastleigh, Nairobi. His body was found on Sunday amid questions on how he ended up at the trading centre which is over 50 kilometres from Eastleigh. Click here for the latest political news
