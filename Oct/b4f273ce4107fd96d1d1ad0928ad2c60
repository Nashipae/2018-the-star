Nyeri senator Ephraim Maina has urged the county government to prioritise healthcare. He said Nyeri County Referral Hospital is in “pathetic condition”. Maina on Sunday said there is no point for the county to expand the morgue and abandon those still suffering in hospital. “Let’s not talk of enlarging the mortuary for the dead. Let’s not say we are building roads yet there are no services in the hospitals,” he said. Maina said the referral hospital has only two beds in the intensive care unit, although the facility serves the entire Central region. The senator said he has learnt that many hospitals lack medicine for common diseases and have no laboratory and other standard services. “It is pathetic that basic drugs to treat malaria and pneumonia, among other ailments are unavailable,” he said. Maina said dispensaries, which should be serving people at the grassroots level, cannot provide services. He said 80 per cent of all diseases and conditions can be handled in small clinics and dispensaries all over this county. “We have clinics and dispensaries in every sublocation and they should be operational,” he said. Maina urged the county government to stop other programmes if need be and focus on healthcare. He also urged the government to prioritise Education and Agriculture. Health executive Rachel Kamau did not to comment on Maina’s claims. She said she was attending a church service. County director of medical services Nelson Muriu did not pick calls. Click here for
