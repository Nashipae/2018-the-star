A video clip of Kirinyaga governor Anne Waiguru dancing has excited Kenyans on Twitter. The clip of Waiguru together with other county officials was recorded during a market launch in the county. Kenyans on Twitter were stunned by Waiguru's moves. "Kirinyaga's Got Talent!! DG, MCAs and I got to dust off our dancing skills with this talented youth group from Mwea," Waiguru posted. A video of the governor moving her foot and her waist left many Kenyans wondering how talented she was. With her short skirt and high heels, Waiguru was seen dancing better than the organizers as they threw their hips and hands in the air. She twisted her waist effortlessly, descended and ascended and had her steps in perfect sync with youthful dancers who performed during the event. "Wow, you did great for real.
