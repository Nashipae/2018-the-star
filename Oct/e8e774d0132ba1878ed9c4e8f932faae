A Turkish 'doctor' and his two Kenyan contacts were arrested on Monday for attempting to coerce diabetic Kenyans to seek treatment in Turkey. The three were arrested by officers from Special Crimes Prevention Unit and will be taken to court to face various charges. One of the Kenyans is a student pursuing an ICT course in a Turkish university. The team was talking to diabetics on the need to consider surgery as way out. Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board chief executive Daniel Yumbya said Bora Koc will be charged with engaging in medical services with the board's clearance. The 'doctor' in question arrived in the country on Sunday on a tourist visa. "If a doctor comes in the country to talk to patients or Kenyans about health, their activities must be cleared by the medical board," Yumbya said. "We do not know whether he (Koc) is a doctor. Having not submitted his papers to the board, he could be a witch-doctor or a herbalist. The arrest was drawn from this fact." Koc, who is suspected was on a recruitment mission, will also be charged with violation of Immigration regulations for wrongful use of his passport number U09339292. He pointed out that local doctors who want to give Kenyans a professional talk on health must also be vetted by the board to ascertain "who they are and the content." The board's chairman George Magoha said: "This one (Koc) came without following the due protocol." "In his message, he tells people that they cure diabetes through surgery. Of course he is going to do that surgery in Turkey," he said. The Turkish embassy in Nairobi said it was not aware of any diabetes screening and treatment event by their doctors. "This prompted embassy to report the matter to police and MPDB," Emre Yuksek, head of Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency, said. Click here for the latest political news
