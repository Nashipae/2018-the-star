William Ruto, an accomplished politician, has laid a trap for ODM leader Raila Odinga and those who are pushing for a referendum. Ruto knows he does not need a referendum. Raila and his group have depicted the referendum — and made it about reducing the number of elected leaders and reducing expenditure — that resonates very well with all Kenyans. If Ruto appears to oppose that, he will lose badly. Technically, William Ruto has said that even he supports the referendum as long as it is not about creating positions. Will Raila Odinga be pushing for a referendum without his selfish interest of taking the Prime Minister position? The answer is No. Ruto's position now complicates matters. His boss, President Uhuru Kenyatta, at one time put it very clearly that he does not want talk of a referendum. Is the president now going to support it? Are we likely to see Kenyans rejecting the referendum? If you tell Kenyans they are going to lose counties, no Kenyan will accept that after people have seen the value in counties. People are employed in the counties. Abolishing the CDF is suicidal. In my view, Ruto has read the mood that the referendum is non-starter. The people who campaign for it are the people who are being targeted to lose their jobs, the elected group. Will they sell to the citizens that sack me? Vote and I go home? I doubt it. Ruto sees this as a non-starter and the more he oppose it, the more it gains momentum. Now that he has accepted it, I don’t think the momentum is going to be there. I have looked at Ruto’s politics. Every time he takes a position and the opposition raises objections, he changes his tune and discussions end. I think that by his supporting the referendum, Ruto has killed its momentum. This was a game to get Ruto out of the way, but he has supported it. It is death at the starting gate.  The political analyst spoke to the Star Click here for the latest political news
