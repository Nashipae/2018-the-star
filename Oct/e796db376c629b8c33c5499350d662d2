Isiolo Finance executive Mwenda Thiribi has resigned over what allies said is the failure of governor Mohamed Kuti to protect him from cartels. Sources said Thiribi quit his job on Sunday. “I cannot talk now,” Thiribi told the Star on the phone yesterday. His close allies described him as a no-nonsense professional who adheres to codes of ethics in performing his duties. A county employee told the Star Thiribi resigned on Sunday. Chief of Staff Bitacha Sora declined to comment on the matter. “I do not communicate for the county. Contact the county secretary or the governor to whom all executives report to,” Sora said. In his resignation letter seen by the Star and addressed to Kuti, Thiribi said there seemed to be an assassination plot. The scheme made him employ additional bodyguards, he said. He claimed the procurement department was controlled by cartels with “authority from above”. Thiribi said his proposals to have a clear, transparent and efficient management system in procurement had been thwarted. “I was kept in the dark by all people in the know, you took me lightly. I was convinced I was on my own,” he said. Thiribi said he had identified an “intelligent young man” to assist in controlling cartels in the procurement department. He said the cartels panicked after the man started looking for certain files and purchase orders. He said the county secretary said the young man had become a spy. “Now that the new team has continued with the process of blocking me from the IFMIS, I am more than ever convinced they are getting instructions from somewhere else,” he said. “This is the reason I tender my resignation.” Thiribi promised to continue supporting the governor’s strategies.
