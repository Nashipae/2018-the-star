As Western Stima were crowned the new National Super League champions and first team to earn an automatic promotion, KCB and Nairobi Stima inched closer to grasping the remaining promotion slots with convincing wins over the weekend. KCB fortified the second spot with a 2-0 win over debutants Green Commandos at Camp Toyoyo. Elvis Ayanyâ€™s bankers stretched their tally to 69 points leaving them with a deficit of six points from a possible nine to return to the top flight. Similarly, third-placed Nairobi Stima remained on course for promotion with a 2-0 win over Administration Police to steer their gatherings to 66. Stima will be hoping for a slip up from the bankers in the subsequent matches as they seek to topple them for the automatic promotion slots. Ushuru fluffed a golden chance to come into the promotion mix following a unwelcome one all draw against St Joseph Youth. The result left them perched fourth with 62 points and face a tough task of forcing their name to number two which will guarantee them a straight promotion or finish third and take on the third-from-bottom finisher in the top flight in a KPL/NSL playoff. Relegation candidates GFE 105 and Nakuru All Stars extended their poor run as they lost to Modern Coast Rangers and FC Talanta respectively. Bottom of the standings with 21 points, GFE fell 2-0 to Rangers while Nakuru, who also have 21 points, were downed 3-1 by Talanta to slim their chances of survival.
