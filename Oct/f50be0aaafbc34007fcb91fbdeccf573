Alex Obanda’s 121 and Jadavji ‘Malindi’ Bhimji’s six wickets proved enough for Swamibapa to see off Stray Lions by 121 runs at Nairobi Jaffery and secure second spot in the NPCA Super Elite League. Obanda’s first century of the season paved the way for Swamibapa’s 284 total before Bhimji’s bagged six wickets to bowl out hapless Stray Lions for 113 in just 20 overs. Since their loss to Swamibapa a month ago, Stray Lions have been fielding a more weakened team and yesterday’s match was a culmination of how the club has struggled in the absence of their top players. Obanda was the biggest difference in Swamibapa’s innings, his knock came only off 58 balls with the other players except three failing to do much with the bat. Apart from Naman Patel (50) Pankaj Sangani (37) and Deepak Pal (21) the other batsman failed with four of them failing to trouble the scorers. Obanda hit eight sixes and 13 boundaries. He had a good start that he shared an opening stand of 164 runs with Sangani before was sent back to the pavilion in the 15th over by Shem Obado. His dismissal opened up a collapse in his side that its only the fifth wicket stand of 48 runs which looked to give the visitor’s resistance. Wickets fall quickly at the top that only 40 runs were added in four wickets after Obanda’s departure before the fifth wicket stand between Naman and James Ngoche stepped in. With the board on 266, the hosts lost three more wickets for no run. In reply, Obado was the only batsman to produce any fight against Swamibapa’s bowling with a hard-fought 60 off 38 as his side put on a poor batting show. Obado and Anand Ranganathan put on 79 for the first wicket but after the stand was broken, the defending league champions failed terribly with Jadavji 6 for 6 playing the key role. Ranganthan (12), Rajiv Sutaria (0), David Mutua (1), Nehemiah Odhiambo (0), Alex Kamanjiri (1) and Samuel Okoth (1) all fell to Jadavji.
