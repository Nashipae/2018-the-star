World-renowned Jamaican reggae group Morgan Heritage is set for collabos with Kenyan artistes. "We have a collaboration with Wyre and we are also looking forward to working with Sauti Sol," Morgan told Chito Ndhlovu in a phone interview on Kiss FM. "We love what they are doing with their management and that is gonna be a big one, and when they have the time they will reach out to us. There is so much talent in Kenya, including Elani." Morgan Heritage has been working with East African artistes, with the latest being his collabo with Tanzanian singer Diamond Platinumz and Ghanian dancehall act Stonebwoy, ‘Africa Jamaica’. Commenting on this new release, Morgan Heritage said: “Releasing ‘Africa Jamaica’ is a historic moment in our career that will forever live in our hearts. It was a joy to work with Diamond Platnumz and Stonebwoy — Africa’s best from east to west. We hope the people in Africa and around the world will love the music video. "We had to decide on really influential artistes from Africa so that we could merge Jamaica and Africa." Both Diamond and Stone have previously worked with the Jamaican group, on the tracks ‘Hallelujah’ and ‘Reggae Night’ respectively. ‘Hallelujah’ proved a particularly successful collaboration, with the music video for the song reaching over one million YouTube views in just 15 hours after its release. Morgan added that they will be moving to Kenya in the near future. "Kenya has always given us a good reception and we are always very comfortable when we are there. We fell in love with Naivasha and it is one place we would love to acquire land in when we decide to settle in Kenya in years to come," they said. The group is well known for hits like Nothing to Smile About, about among others.
