An MCA has queried the status of Sh60 billion pending bills inherited by governor Mike Sonko’s administratoin. Woodley MCA Mwangi Njihia said on Tuesday nonpayment of the huge pending bill were hurting the county coffers. “I wish to request a statement from the chairperson of the sectoral committee on budget and appropriations regarding the county pending bill,” Njihia said. He asked the statement should cover all reports on pending bills, measures to offset the pending bills and the status of the Ward Development Fund payments. Vice chair of the budget committee, Patrick Karani, asked to be given two weeks to reply. Early in March this year, Governor Sonko gazette a 10-man committee to review and clear pending debts for goods supplied and services rendered to the government of Evans Kidero. The former governor denies any wrongdoing. “We are aware of the massive graft at the City Hall that we inherited from the previous regime. That is why we have put up measures to curb it,” Sonko said. He said the committee will help bring finality to the problem of pending bills claimed against the government. Former Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission director Patrick Lumumba was appointed to chair the committee. Former Law Society of Kenya bosses Martin Wamae and Erick Mutua were appointed co- chairs. The committee was expected to develop a new payment system.
