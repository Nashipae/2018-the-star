Jubilee Insurance has terminated the medical cover contract with IEBC "We regret to notify the commission medical cover offered by Jubilee Insurance has been suspended with effect from October 17 due to unavoidable circumstances," IEBC Director human resource Mohamed Osman said in an internal memo. "Those that might require medical attention should pay and forewarn the relevant documents for a refund once the cover is opened." Osman asked the staff members to bear with the commission as they solve the issues appertaining to the suspension. IEBC spokesman Andrew Limo told the Star that the medical insurance issue is an administrative challenge that has gladly been resolved. "The LSO was ready by close of business yesterday. We have a two-year contract with the provider and they require to be paid in advance for periods that exceed the quarterly release of funds from the National Treasury," he said. Limo said there was a delay in approvals and access to the online payment system. "You will recall the suspension of heads of procurement in public institutions. It also took a while for new officials to get the access rights," he said. The electoral agency has been going through many leadership and administrative turmoils since the 2017 elections. Last week, embattled Ezra Chiloba was sacked as the chief executive officer. Details:  IEBC sacks CEO Ezra Chiloba over poll procurement queries Also read: CEO Chiloba suspended, IEBC in chaos
