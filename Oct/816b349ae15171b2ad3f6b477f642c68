The Port of Mombasa on Wednesday evening received yet another bigger vessel, which has an overall length of 300 metres and a capacity of over 6,000 total equivalent units (TEUs). This is another maritime record to have been broken by the facility, KPA has said. The vessel - MSC Maxime - which was making its maiden voyage to the port loaded with over 3,194 TEUs, docked at the second container terminal. MSC Maxine, operated by the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), is registered and sails under the flag of Panama. It has a gross tonnage of 94,469 and deadweight is 110,629, making it among the biggest ships in the world with a capacity of over 6,000 containers. It makes 1,450 moves in one shift, translating to over 181 moves per hour. Moves are the number of containers being loaded or offloaded per hour or shift. The 1,450 moves per shift is a new record to have been made by a ship docking at the port. The previous record was of 1,256 moves per shift, according to KPA records. Patrick Makau, the Kenya Ports Authority head of container operations, said it is an honour for the port to accommodate bigger vessels. “We keep on accommodating bigger and bigger vessels. We have grown as a port over the period and our volumes have also gone up and that translates to KPA doing good business,” he said. Makau said the recent upgrading of the port’s handling equipment has enabled the facility to handle bigger vessels and conduct more moves within an hour. In April, KPA received its first 6,000 TEUs series container carrier, MV MSC Portugal. MV MSC Portugal had a length of 304.07 metres.
