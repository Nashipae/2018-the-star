Two police officers who allegedly kidnapped a motorist in Athi River and demanded Sh300,000 ransom from his wife before they robbed him of Sh15,000 yesterday denied charges of robbery with violence. Central police station’s Kelvin Ndosi and detective Johnson Ndung’u attached to the Parliament police station’s DCI offices were charged at Milimani law courts alongside businessman Michael Ogolla. They were accused of violently robbing Philemon Okello of the cash and his car keys in Ruiru where they were intercepted by officers from Mama Lucy AP camp in Embakasi. They had hijacked Okello at Delta Petrol Station along Mombasa Road near Lukenya on October 13, confiscated his phone, all his belongings and handcuffed him before they bundled him at the back of his car guarded by two men. They drove him around different places including Kayole and Kangundo road for six hours awaiting the ransom. Click here for the latest political news
