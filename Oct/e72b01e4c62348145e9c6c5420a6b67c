Team Kenya have been drawn against current world champions Russia in the Amputee football World Cup play-off round in San Juan, Mexico. The two are set to lock horns today. The draw was carried out immediately after the final group stage matches yesterday. This is the first time Team Kenya have progressed into the play-offs round. In the group stages, they lost to European champions Turkey and impressively beat United States in their second match. They profited from a walkover against Liberia, who pulled out of the tournament due to financial issues. Liberia’s absence played to their advantage as they finished second in their group with six points out of the possible nine. Team captain, Dalmas Otieno, is pleased with team’s overall performance, noting that so far they have achieved what many initially deemed as impossible. “We arrived here after a number of challenges but we were motivated with the fact that we are here to represent our country and we have no intention of disappointing the people back home.” “Many people thought we only came here to fill the numbers but we decided to use this opportunity to highlight the role sports can play in improving an athletes’ life,” concluded Otieno. The last time the two teams met, Kenya lost 4-1 to Russia in the first Group ‘C’ match of the 2014 World Cup— a result they attributed to lack of experience then. However, this time round, Otieno feels they have come of age and he is hoping they can pull a major upset against Russia. “We have learned from our mistakes and we are prepared to go toe-to-toe with the Russians, who have fielded a weaker team this year,” he emphasised. Should Kenya see off Russia, they will meet either Ireland or title favourites Turkey, who have scored a whooping 12 goals and reached the play-off round after winning all their three games.
