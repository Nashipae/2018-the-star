Two Kakamega community groups want mining and removal of gold tailing stopped pending public participation and a health impact study. They have written to Mining CS John Munyes to stop gold extraction from the Rosterman area. They want the contractor stopped from taking away gold tailings until the full impact on residents is known. Tailings are the materials left over after a mineral is extracted. Some tailings contaminate soil and water. Rosterman Community Welfare Association and the Bachelle Rosterman Senior Citizens self-help groups have given the government seven days to stop the project. After that they will sue for relief, they said. They said there was no public participation as required by the Constitution before the contractor was authorised to begin mining. They also questioned the tendering process. The groups want the ministry to inform residents of the likely health risks of gold mining that uses toxic mercury for extraction. Mine workers and those handling tailings could be exposed to danger, they said “Kindly, order an immediate stop to removal of gold tailings from Rosterman until the issues are addressed. Public participation would have cleared the air,” reads the October 23 letter to the CS, copied to Governor Wycliffe Oparanya. Two weeks ago, Munyes said the government was completing feasibility studies for a Sh1 billion gold refinery in Kakamega. He said mining will become an economic game-changer for Western region, which relies heavily on agriculture. Oparanya said the community would own 30 per cent of the refinery through the county government. UK-based Acacia mining company announced in February that it had found 1.31 million ounces of maiden high-grade gold in its Liranda corridor in its exploration project in Western Kenya. The last large-scale mining was carried out between 1935 and 1952 by Rosterman Mining Company.
