Citizen TV journalist Jacque Maribe has been released on a Sh1 million cash bail in the Monica Kimani murder case. She was granted an alternative of a Sh2 million bond or three sureties of a similar amount. Her fiance Joseph Irungu alias Jowie, however, will remain in custody for the rest of the murder trial. Justice James Wakiaga, citing Jowie's history with guns, said the first accused would pose a risk by creating fear and intimidating witnesses. The judge, in his ruling on Tuesday, said material placed before the court informed his decision on Jowie's bail application. "Being a person with specialised security training, and having handle various guns, he would pose a risk by intimidating witnesses." "This court orders that the first accused person remains in custody for the period of his trial and must be accorded proper treatment," Wakiaga ordered. The judge cited grounds that the "prosecution had positively placed Jowi at the murder scene in an attempt to tamper with evidence." He further cited the prosecution's argument that Jowi had a self-inflicted a wound on himself by attempting to commit suicide. Jowie had argued that his life is in danger and needed protective custody under proper police supervision. For Maribe, Wakiaga said the prosecution had not given compelling reasons as to why she should be denied bail. The anchor, in her affidavit, swore that the relationship she had with Jowie was a thing of the past. Last week, they were charged afresh over the murder of the 29-year-old businesswoman. They denied the charges.
