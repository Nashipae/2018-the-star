The National Police Service will soon build a 300-bed police hospital, Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet has said. The hospital will be put up on a five-acre parcel donated by Kenyatta National Hospital opposite Mbagathi Hospital. It will have a forensic laboratory, doping test lab, a first class emergency centre, a VIP suite and a mortuary. It will also have training and education, operation and maintenance support facilities. Officers and their dependents will access quality and affordable care. NPS is intends to have a specialised treatment facility similar to the Kenya Defence Forces Memorial Hospital for its officers. The project has been approved by the Cabinet. Hundreds of officers are injured in security operations and accidents annually, and since independence, there has never been a hospital to exclusively take care of police officers and their families. They have been forced to seek medical attention in civilian hospitals. Cops can, however, access medical services at the Nairobi West Hospital, which has an agreement with the NPS, KNH and occasionally at the DFMH. The NPS Hospital was initially set to be built next to the Inland Container Depot in Embakasi but plans changed. The new site was chosen because of its proximity to Wilson Airport and other hospitals.
