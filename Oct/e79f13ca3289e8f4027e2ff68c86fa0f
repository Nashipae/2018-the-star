Saudi Arabia's foreign minister has said the suspects in the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi would be prosecuted in Saudi Arabia. At a conference in Bahrain, Adel al-Jubeir accused the western media of "hysteria" in its coverage of the case. His comments come a day after Turkey said it wished to extradite 18 Saudi nationals authorities say were involved in the murder. The writer was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul three weeks ago. Riyadh denies the ruling royal family was involved and blames "rogue agents". Saudi Arabia initially denied all knowledge of the journalist's fate but the Saudi public prosecutor now describes it as premeditated murder. Khashoggi had been an outspoken critic of the crown prince, the de facto Saudi ruler. "On the issue of extradition, the individuals are Saudi nationals. They're detained in Saudi Arabia, and the investigation is in Saudi Arabia, and they will be prosecuted in Saudi Arabia," Mr al-Jubeir told a security conference in Bahrain. Turkey and Saudi Arabia are not known to have an extradition treaty. US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said Khashoggi's death in a diplomatic facility "must concern us all". He said the United States "does not tolerate this kind of ruthless action to silence Mr. Khashoggi, a journalist, through violence." "Failure of any nation to adhere to international norms and the rule of law undermines regional stability at a time when it is needed most," he added. Click here for the latest political news
