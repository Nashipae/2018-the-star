City Hall now wants private organisations to take up recycling, transportation and solid waste management. The County’s Annual Development Plan 2019-2020 shows some of the major challenges facing the county in regards to solid waste management include collection and disposal. The plan seeks to create awareness about waste management to Nairobians for efficiency. The county government will also provide dumpsites for methane gas collection to power electricity generating plants. This will be in Kamukunji and Lang’ata subcounties. “In these sites, street families will be mobilised through saccos to participate in garbage collection and hence economic empowerment,” the county government says in the plan. “Identification and maintenance of final disposal sites will be critical,” the report notes. According to the plan, the county generates more than 2,000 tonnes of garbage per day but only 900 tonnes is collected and dumped at the Dandora dumpsite in an environmentally unsustainable manner. Recycling remains low at less than 10 per cent. “The remaining waste ends up in undesignated areas, including illegal dumping sites, rivers, drainage systems and some alleys. The management of electronic waste is not well structured... and most of it not properly handled,” the report says. Other policy actions include research and adoption of technology.
