Melania Trump has revealed even she sometimes finds herself begging the President to stop tweeting. The First Lady laughed on Saturday as she admitted she's told her husband to put the phone down amid one of his famed rants. "I don't always agree with what he tweets, and I tell him that," she said. "I give my honest opinion and honest advice. Sometimes he listens and sometimes he doesn't, but I have my own voice and opinions, and it's very important to me I express what I feel." When a reporter asked her: 'Have you ever told him to put his phone down?' she responded: "Yes". The pair have long clashed about how best to use the internet. The First Lady was in Egypt on Saturday to wrap up her four-country tour of Africa. She visited the Great Sphinx and the pyramids, after meeting with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and his wife, first lady Entissar Mohameed Amer. Trump received a warm welcome from Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and his wife, Entissar, at the presidential palace in Cairo before she headed to visit the Pyramids and the Great Sphinx. At the meeting which lasted for nearly an hour, Sisi sat in the middle, with Trump on one side and his wife on the other. No statements were made to the press. Click here for the latest political news
