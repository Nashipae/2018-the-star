Commercial operations run by the prisons department will be privatised once President Uhuru Kenyatta assents to the Kenya Prisons Enterprise Corporation Order, 2018. The order merges the Kenya Prison Farms Fund and the Kenya Prison Enterprise Fund into the yet to be established Kenya Prison Enterprise Corporation. The corporation will be mandated with the expansion of the scope of prisons programmes. A statement from State House yesterday said the corporation will unlock the revenue potential of the prison industry and make it self-sustaining. The new corporation will also contribute to the realisation of the Big Four agenda, particularly on food security, affordable housing and manufacturing, the statement said. The corporation will be mandated to organise and manage the assets of the department, including 86 farms on 18,225 acres. Production and sale of the produce are currently managed by the Kenya Prison Farms Fund and the Kenya Prison Enterprise Fund. The merging of the two is aimed at spurring economic growth in the department, State House said. The enactment of the order will be followed by the appointment of the corporationâ€™s board of management and the recruitment of the chief executive officer and the secretariat. BETTER PAY The corporation is expected to eliminate bureaucracy and establish professional training and certification for staff and inmates for ease of partnership with the private sector. The move is a strategic investment by government to ensure prisoners are rewarded through better pay for their labour. The corporation will be wholly owned by the government.
