Maize farmers are just fed up. In fact, going by their sentiments at a Senate sitting in Eldoret last week, fed up is an understatement. Elderly men and women, who have over the years relied on maize farming to bring up their families, lectured senators and the country’s leadership, accusing them of paying lip service to agriculture. They questioned why the government cannot decisively deal with maize cartels. Agriculture still plays a key role in Kenya’s economy, affecting about 70 per cent of the country’s population. The sector brings in 65 per cent of the export earnings and provides livelihoods to more than 80 per cent of the population through employment, income and and food needs. In the current budget, Agriculture has been allocated Sh16.4 billion. Though inadequate for a country whose economy is agriculture-driven, the amount, if well utilised and directed to real and not phantom farmers, can help re-energise the sector. Ensuring food security is one of the planks of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda, but this can only be realised if farmers interest in agriculture is regained. Short of this, Kenya will increasingly become a net importer of food.
