Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka visit to State House on Tuesday could benefit the Kamba community if his wish list is anything to go by. The meeting came hardly a week after Kalonzo told the President that he wanted to get fully involved in the peace deal he signed with Raila Odinga. Bungoma senator Moses Wetang'ula, who has been a strong critic Uhuru and Raila, especially after the March 9 handshake, also attended the function. Kalonzo said he was not after political power but development, and the Big Four agenda.
