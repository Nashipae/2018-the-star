The Nairobi County has defended itself over the removal of eight advertisement panels set up by the Kenya National Highways Authority along Mombasa Road, Nairobi. In a statement on Monday, Communications Director Elkana Jacob said the panels were illegal and set up under the guise of preventing pedestrians from crossing the highway, but were in fact leased out as advertising spaces without consent and statutory approvals from the County Government. "The Constitution of Kenya, 2010 and the Devolved Governments Act, 2012 give county governments the powers to take action against unauthorized advertisement and related structures which KeNHA has erected or permitted to be erected in the road reserves," the statement said. The move follows a similar action KeNHA took on September 27 when it removed footpaths between Nyayo Stadium and Bellevue along Mombasa road believed to have been constructed by the Nairobi county government. The authority said it was unauthorized works on a road reserve which required proper approval. Elkana said the local government will not be drawn into an unnecessary altercation with KeNHA over an issue whose legal position is clear. He said KeNHA is responsible for construction, operation, maintenance and setting standards for construction of roads while county governments are responsible for the control of outdoor advertisement,  county planning and development. "Therefore, it is clear that the county government is mandated to undertake the specific function regarding the issue at hand," Elkana said. Click here for the latest political news
