Kenya’s funding needs for HIV, TB and malaria will total Sh84 billion between 2019-22, Health PS Peter Tum has said. The bulk of the money is from the Global Fund, US government and other donors. “But for the country to achieve universal health care, there is need to replace the current external partner investment with internal resources from the national and county government as well as the private sector,” he said. He spoke yesterday in Nairobi during a meeting on domestic resource mobilisation for Health in Kenya. Tum said there is an epidemic transition where the burden of disease is rapidly changing with increase in chronic care conditions. These are costly to treat in the long-term, hence the need to increase more money for health and ensure prudent use of resources.

Chege said this will ensure there is enough money to pay and employ more doctors and nurses in the country, adding that living it open is messing the health sector. “That is why we have cases of people going to hospitals and not getting enough drugs or even staff to offer services,” she said. She added that with the debate on a referendum, the Health Parliamentary Committee is discussing on what issues in the sector should be devolved and what should be moved back to the national government. The chair said primary or preventive care is key and should be handled at the county level. Read: Global Fund gives Kenya Sh33b for HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB Click here for
