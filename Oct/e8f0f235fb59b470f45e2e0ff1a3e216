Justus Madoya took an early lead as the 2018 Prime Bank Diani Beach Masters teed off at the par 72 Leisure Lodge Beach and Golf Resort. The Great Rift pro played a round of 1 under par 71 gross to take a one shot lead over Muthaiga’s Greg Snow. Snow, one of the finest players in the country played level par, but admitted it’s still early days. It was a bad day at the office for long-hitting Mumias pro Dismas Indiza, who failed to sparkle on the leaderboard. Indiza shot a disappointing 9 over par 82 gross to end his day one campaign on an unfamiliar 26th spot. “Its one of those days, when you hit as hard but your shots don’t impress,” said Indiza. Alfred Nandwa is lying third with 3 over par 73 gross. Joint fourth on a score of 2 over par 74 are Frank Matilo, David Wakhu and Riz Charania. Charan Thethy who is also the chairman of Professional Golfers of Kenya said it’s still too early to predict but Indiza cannot be ruled out. Round two today will see the top 20 make the cut to tomorrow’s final round which is also the Pro Am. A total of 120 amateurs and 40 pros are taking part in the three day Pro-Amateur events which starts on Friday through to Sunday. Amateurs drawn from Machakos, Nairobi, Nyali and Mombasa clubs will play today and tomorrow. Royal, Railway and Golf Park have six players apiece with Mombasa having 15 golfers, six of whom will be representing Nyali. Prime Bank business development director Vijay Kantaria said the support from the bank is a long-term commitment towards promotion of golf tourism in the country. “Prime Bank continues to support golf through our flagship Prime Visa Golf Card. We are proud to be associated with PGK and more so Diani Beach Masters where we return as main sponsors for the umpteenth time. We wish the pros and amateurs a great golfing experience in the coast. We are overly excited to be part and parcel of the country’s vibrant golf tourism industry,” said Vijay.
