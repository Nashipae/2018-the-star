The hearing of the Anglo Leasing case failed to start today after the prosecution declined to avail a witness. The case was scheduled for three days before Chief Magistrate Felix Kombo. But prosecutor Mercy Gateru made an application to postpone the case until the first week of December. Gateru informed the court that EACC is experiencing difficulties in presenting the witness and she learnt about the inability to secure the witness as expected late. She sought to have the next witness to testify via video link but defence counsel Caren Saadia opposed the same. Saadia said: "the amount of money the EACC has spent in visiting the UK for investigations is more than that of bringing the witnesses".
