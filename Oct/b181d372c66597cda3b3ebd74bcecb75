Iten County Referral Hospital has a shortage of more than 100 nurses, leading to slow services to the public. Elgeyo Marakwet governor Alex Tolgos says the hospital, which is classified as Level 4, will be upgraded to Level 5 and given a facelift along with additional facilities because it serves more than 450,000 people. He said the county will put up ICU units at the facility to reduce referral of patients to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret. The county boss was speaking when he inaugurated a new board to manage the hospital. Board members appointed include former MTRH chief executive Dr John Kibosia, accountant Reuben Chesire, university lecturers Dr Risper Berem, Dr Sally Kimosop and  Sing’ore Girls Principal Rose Koech. Others are Jeremiah Laktabai, Elias Komen and  Benjamin Kimaile, who is also the hospital medical superintendent. “The appointment of the eight board members is for a term of three years and they will be expected to steer the facility to greater heights in terms of infrastructure and management,” said Tolgos. He said the new board members are experts in various fields. The governor thanked them for accepting to serve the hospital. Chesire will be the board chairperson. He said they will strive to improve the facility to benefit residents. “Health is one of the devolved functions that has given county governments challenges but for our county, we gave it a priority,” he said on Saturday. “We are on course to ensure our people enjoy modern and affordable services.”
