The Indonesian jet which crashed shortly after take-off had suffered instrument problems the day before, according to a technical log obtained by the BBC. A technical log from a flight from Bali to Jakarta on Sunday said an instrument was "unreliable" and the pilot had to hand over to the first officer. The Boeing 737 airliner crashed into the sea with 189 people on board. It went down after taking off from Jakarta. There is no sign of survivors. The BBC has so far been unable to reach Lion Air, the low-cost airline which owns the plane, for comment. Flight JT 610 was headed for the western city of Pangkal Pinang on Monday when it came down. Rescuers have recovered some bodies and personal items, including baby shoes. Families are being told to go to a hospital to identify the dead. The incident is reported to be the first major accident involving a Boeing 737 Max - an updated version of the 737. A technical log obtained by the BBC from the plane's previous flight suggests that the airspeed reading on the captain's instrument was unreliable, and the altitude readings differed on the captain's and first officer's instruments. "Identified that CAPT [captain's] instrument was unreliable and handover control to FO [first officer]," the log reads. Click here for the latest political news
