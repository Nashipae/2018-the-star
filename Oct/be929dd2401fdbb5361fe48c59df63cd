Changamwe MP Omar Mwinyi has said any changes to the Constitution must be for the benefit of the youth. A survey funded by the Star newspaper and conducted through computer-aided telephone interviews in 26 counties representative of all regions, shows that 56 per cent of Kenyans do not support calls for a referendum, while 44 per cent are in support. The majority of those opposed to the idea are youths. On Monday, Mwinyi said, “The youth are the backbone of the economy and they determine the future of the country.” He said Kenyans should be ready to vote based on facts and what is right for Kenya.
