The government has directed the National Cereals and Produce Board to check the quality and quantity of maize stored in its depots.Agriculture CAS Andrew Tuimur gave the order following earlier reports that maize in some silos was going bad. He wants the board to assure Kenyans that the maize is fit for consumption before releasing it to millers.Some small-scale millers have urged the government to release maize being held by the cereals board for Sh1,400 a bag to sustain the retail price of Sh75 for a two-kilogramme packet of maize flour.On Thursday the United Grain Millers Association said they might not sustain the price because of to high maize prices.Chairman Peter Kuguru said that when they met with Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri in September, the price of a 90kg bag of maize was Sh1,600 and below, but it has increased to Sh1,800.“Millers are willing and able to retain a price of Sh800 per bale of unga and Sh75 per 2kg if the government, through the NCPB, can release maize in the storage to the millers at Sh1,400 per bag as promised by the CS in our last meeting,” he said.

We are currently selling a 90kg bag of maize at Sh2,300, which is higher than what is being offered in the local market,” he said.A 90kg bag of maize is retailing at between Sh1,200 and Sh1,400. Sang said millers have no choice but to sell a 2kg packet of unga for Sh75.“Farmers are willing to sell maize to anybody, but the NCPB has yet to receive money,” Sang said.According to a source who asked not to be named, the government will not release or buy more maize before it clears payments to all the small-scale farmers who supplied the NCPB last year. Some have been paid. Harvesting of this year’s crops is underway.“This is to avoid paying unscrupulous traders at the expense of genuine farmers, as happened earlier,” the source said.
