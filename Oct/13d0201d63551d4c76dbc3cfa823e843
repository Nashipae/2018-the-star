Busia County has registered more girls than boys for the 2018 KCPE that starts tomorrow. County Director for Education James Gachungi said a total of 11, 255 girls will sit the exams compared to 10,939 boys. He attributed the increase to affirmative action which gives girls equal opportunities with the boys. Last year the county also listed more girls than boys. A total of 11,163 girls sat for the exams compared to 10,694 boys. Gachungi said the rehearsals on Monday went on without any hitches, adding that strategies have been put in place to ensure that the integrity of the exams is not compromised. He said special boats to ferry exam papers to Bulwani, Maduwa and Osieko primary schools in Bunyala Sub County have been put on standby. Click here for the latest political news
