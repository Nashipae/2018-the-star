Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this Monday. WATCH Storm in ODM as Raila allies fight his succession A vicious but a hushed battle for control of Luo Nyanza politics has erupted in what is promising to define 2022 combat for the country's top job. The battle pits Opposition chief Raila Odinga against Siaya Senator James Orengo, his former alley and close legal adviser. The two have been rivals in the past and more recently Orengo was not privy to talks on the handshake between Raila and President Uhuru Kenyatta on March 9. Outside Nyanza, Mombasa governor Hassan Joho and his Kakamega counterpart Wycliffe Oparanya are scheming to take over the ODM political machine, despite signals that Raila has no intention of hanging up his political boots. Orengo is said to have assembled mostly first-time MPs, particularly those with legal background to oppose Raila’s position on a number of issues. At the centre of the row is Raila's decision to work with President Uhuru Kenyatta. _____________________________________________________ EACC Comb through ten bank accountS in Sh1.2 billion probe The EACC is investigating at least ten bank accounts suspected to belong to top civil servants as it seeks to unravel the mysterious payment of Sh1.2 billion to Era Two Thousand by three ministries.

According to documents seen by the Star, some of the parcels the EACC listed are registered in the names of blue chip companies that the former governor says he does not own.

During an impromptu visit at the facility Sunday morning, he said the county should expect some changes at the hospital in the next 48 hours. “We can even reinstate the suspended doctors now.
