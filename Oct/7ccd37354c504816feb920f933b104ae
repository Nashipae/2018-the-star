Free public wireless internet connection commonly known as WiFi is not entirely safe as you had thought, digital technology experts have cautioned. According to the experts, most users of free public WiFi hotspots ran the the risk of exposing sensitive data to intruders with malicious intent. “Internet Providers should work towards encryption of the services, and adopt Blockchain technology to help in the process,” Blockchain and Artificial intelligence taskforce chairperson Bitange Ndemo said. In the meantime, he said consumers must work towards securing themselves. In a phone interview, Ndemo called on the adoption of Artificial intelligence by the service providers that would help in alerting users whenever anyone is monitoring their activities online. Currently, there are more than 1,000 wifi hotspot centres across the country with Internet Solution intending to add 5,000 hotspot centres in the next 24 months at an estimated cost of Sh300 million. The internet service provider has partnered with US social media giant Facebook and Surf to roll out the hotspot centres across Kenya. However, early this year, Facebook was in trouble for collecting extra levels of personal information in Kenya, across both its users and non users from access points for the Express WiFi service. According to human rights advocate Mugambi Laibuta, there is need for comprehensive data laws to help boost confidence in use of service like free WiFi.
