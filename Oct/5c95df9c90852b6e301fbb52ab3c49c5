Preparations for Saturday’s Mashujaa Day celebrations in Kakamega are now complete, officials have said. President Uhuru Kenyatta (pictured) is expected to lead Kenyans in the celebrations from Bukhungu Stadium. New terraces have been constructed at the stadium. Kiosks have been pulled down along the Kakamega-Kisumu road as the town got a facelift. Security has been enhanced with the presence of KDF around the showground. GSU officers are camping at Kakamega Hill School with APs at Lurambi chief’s camp. Governor Wycliffe Oparanya yesterday said he will hold a final meeting with Chief of Defence Forces Samson Mwathate and Interior PS Karanja Kibicho on Friday to confirm final preparations. “We’re set for the event. We keep on improving on what we’ve already put in place every day,” Western regional commissioner Anne Ng’etich said. State House spokesperson Kanze Dena was at the weekend in Kakamega to inspect preparations for the celebrations. It will be the first time a national celebration is held in Kakamega after Uhuru announced the events will be rotated across the counties. Previous celebrations have been held in Nakuru, Nyeri, Machakos and Meru. Dena on Sunday said Namibian President Hage Geingnob will attend the event.
