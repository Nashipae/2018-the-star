Members of Parliament on Wednesday passed a motion declaring youth unemployment a national disaster. The motion moved by Mathare MP Anthony Oluoch seeks to compel the government to absorb the youth in formal employment. He wants the state to consolidate various youth funds into one account to address their needs. MPs said that 75 per cent of Kenya’s population is under 35 years. They want the government to establish a National Youth Fund of at least 5 per cent of the national revenue collected each year to be administered by an authority or commission. Oluoch said ILO report indicates Kenya's youth population stands at 77 per cent out of whom 27 percent are unemployed.

The government should improve the transition from primary school to secondary school to reduce unemployment." Mandera East MP Hassan Omar said radicalisation and insecurity in Northern Kenya have denied youth job opportunities. He wants more youths placed in mid-level colleges to equip them with skills for the job market. Saboti MP Caleb Luyai  asked, "If we have a cash transfer programme for the elderly, why not for the youth?" Isiolo MP Rehema Dida said, "In Isiolo, we are dealing with rising radicalisation among the youth who are joining al Shabaab terror group. A majority of them have gone to school and even universities, but they lack employment." Click here for the latest political news
