Gospel artiste Papa Dennis has featured Jamaican artiste Cecile in his new song, 'I am Blessed'. Papa Dennis, who won Best Gospel Artiste of the Year Award at Afrimma, said he has always wished to work with Cecile, and has been listening to her music. "My managers connected me with her managers and we did the song. She recorded her verse from there and I did mine here, and the beat of the song is by Sappy," Papa told Adelle and Shaffie on Kiss FM. Papa said he is now eyeing bigger awards. "The competition was tough because there were artistes who are bigger than me because they have been in the industry longer than I have, but I thank God I won. I appreciate my fans that they voted for me," he said. "This award is big and although I have been working so hard, it encourages me to keep working hard. My dream is to bring the Grammy Award home." Papa Dennis also shared a personal experience that he had with a lady he wanted to date before fame. "I have a new song titled Swap, which was inspired by my own experience. There was a time I was dating but I did not have a house of my own and this lady wanted to visit me. I took her and went for rounds with her in Umoja until she got tired of me. My friend, who was supposed to host us, was away, and so she left me," Papa recounted.
