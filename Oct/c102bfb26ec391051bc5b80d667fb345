Two Murang’a county MPs have urged CS Simon Chelugui to urgently organise meetings with local leaders to discuss the water levy issue. Kigumo MP Ruth Mwaniki and woman representative Sabina Chege said following President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive for dialogu, the Water ministry should organise forums for negotiations with local leaders. Governor Mwangi wa Iria has insisted Nairobi county will have to pay a levy on water drawn from Murang’a rivers and Ndakaini Dam. The governor recommended a 25 per cent levy on all revenue derived from the dam, but said residents will make the final decision during public participation forums conducted by the county assembly. Chege said Murang’a residents want justice. “We want them to call us as local leaders so that we can present our case and debate on how the issue will be resolved,” she said on Tuesday. The assembly is in the process of drafting a law that MCAs have said will enforce the levy. The revenue will be controlled by a board charged with connecting all areas with water. Only 37 per cent of locals have tap water ,with the rest having to fetch it from rivers. Mwaniki said there are concerns the Sh6 billion World Bank-funded Northern Collector Tunnel may have far-reach negative effects. Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria said he will convene a reconciliation meeting between Nairobi Governor Mike Mbuvi and Wa Iria.
