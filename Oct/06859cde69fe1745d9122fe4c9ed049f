Wajir governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud has tabled before the Supreme Court new evidence as proof he is a graduate of Kampala University. On September 28, the Supreme Court allowed Mohamud’s application in which he accused the lower courts of attacking his education credentials, yet he holds a degree from the university which is accredited by the Commission for Higher Education. The governor’s election was nullified by the High Court and Court of Appeal but he moved to the Supreme Court. Mohamud produced an affidavit from the current academic registrar of the institution, Ssegawa Hamza, confirming that he graduated with a degree.
