The Kitui government plans to start structured mining. Governor Charity Ngilu said artisanal mining of gemstones will provide direct employment for about 1,000 people and indirectly benefit 8,000 residents in the supply and maintenance chain.  The remarks were contained in a speech read on behalf of the governor by Mineral Resources executive John Makau on Friday. He represented Ngilu during the graduation of the second lot of artisanal miners at South Eastern Kenya University. The latest batch of graduates brings to 110 the number of artisanal miners sponsored by the county to study at the university. Ngilu said 1,000 residents will be trained. She said Kitui county is endowed with vast mineral resources and this informed the decision to sponsor residents for the training. Ngilu said mining has the potential to create wealth for Kenyans. The governor said she would rely on Seku’s expertise to help achieve her pre-election five-pillar manifesto agenda of food and water security, quality healthcare, education and youth training, women empowerment and wealth creation. She added that her government has initiated procurement for the establishment of a gemstone laboratory in Mwingi town to not only test minerals, but boost their value addition. “The facility will be fully funded by the county government for the purpose of testing and value addition of gemstones. This will greatly improve the livelihoods of our people through direct and indirect employment,” Ngilu said.
