Candidates in six schools along the Kitui-Tana border may not sit for national examinations if security is not beefed up in the banditry prone area, Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi has said. One person was killed by bandits who have been attacking residents while pretending to be herders. Mulyungi urged Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to ensure adequate security is deployed. He said pupils have abandoned the schools. “We have more than 200 candidates affected in Mwanzele, Kathungu, Ukasi, Sosoma, Iviani and Muuani who may not sit for the upcoming national exams if urgent intervention is not made,” Mulyungi said. Iviani resident Musunza Munyoki said the students have abandoned the schools and are living in fear of being attacked by bandits. “This has become a perennial problem and I wonder if it will end at all. We live like strangers in our motherland yet the intruders have got all the freedom they want,” Munyoki said. He said local leaders have tried to drive away the bandits, but they are relentless. Mulyungi alleged bandits who call themselves herders have “godfathers who are very senior in the government”. “Who legalises their guns and since when did a herder carry a gun? Who provides the guns to them? These are the questions we need addressed immediately,” Munyoki said. At least 1,000,759 KCPE and 664,586 KCSE candidates are sitting their national exams this year.
