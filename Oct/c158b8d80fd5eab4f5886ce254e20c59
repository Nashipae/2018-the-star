Pupils of a school in Baringo Central subcounty have to travel five kilometres daily to look for water. “We have just sent them right now to go and fetch water downstream, some five kilometres away and they will be back probably by the next one hour,” Sironoi Primary School deputy headteacher Roseline Jemutai said on Friday. She said the water crisis has persisted for the last 20 years. The dirty water fetched from Kipketio springs down Kapsigorian hills is used for cooking lunch, porridge for nursery kids and drinking. Residents of Lolwo, Sironoi, Kapiman, Tambochwo and Kapsigorian villages in Sironoi sublocation also converge in the single spring to wash clothes, bathe and water their livestock. Jemutai said upon arrival from the water source, the exhausted pupils settle down to start their lessons around 10am. “They are then forced to drop back to the stream in the afternoon again after taking their lunch to fetch extra water for drinking,” she said. The last drop of rain water harvested in May and June in the two school tanks (pictured) was exhausted last month. The school is located 15 kilometres from Kabarnet town, the county headquarters, which draws its water supply from the huge Kirandich Water Dam. Research by Unicef in 2010 reveals millions of children in developing countries lack safe water, posing risks to their sanitation, health and education.
