Kenya Airways management will address the aviation workers' strike threats before October 28, Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia has said. Kenya Aviation Workers’ Union threatened to go on strike unless a pay deal is agreed by October 28 - the day the carrier is set to begin direct flights to the US. The union said the looming industrial action would include cabin crew refusing to perform duties on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft that will be deployed for the first direct flight to New York.

The CS told journalists on Tuesday that no employer would like to be blackmailed especially if the prospects are looking good. "If KQ does not succeed, then the competitor will succeed. Would they love a situation where KQ is grounded and others succeed?" he asked. "Reason will prevail and we have confidence that the management will also prevail." Macharia said if the management needs help from the government, then they are willing to step in and help. "If they need us, we will be there to complete the engagement process. As a government, we have committed a lot of resources to make sure we don't let Kenyans down." He said the government is aiming at making Nairobi and Kenya a hub where investors can come without having to think twice. Business Daily reported that Kenya Airways chief executive officer Sebastian Mikosz asked the union to abandon the strike plans, arguing that the airline will pick up the CBA negotiations with the union after the launch of the direct flight.
