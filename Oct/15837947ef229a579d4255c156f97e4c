Garissa branch Knut executive secretary Abdirizak Hussein has urged Knec to ensure security of exams “instead of heaping blame” on teachers and students over alleged cheating. “Knec should concentrate its energy on securing the national exams and stop looking for scapegoats. It’s their mandate to secure all examination papers before, during and after the exams,” he said yesterday. According to Knec, 30 schools countrywide are currently under scrutiny following intelligence reports they are planning to engage in malpractices in the forthcoming national exams slated for next month. Knec chairperson George Magoha said the council is focusing on several schools across Kisii, Meru, Garissa and other counties. He said adequate security measures have been put in place to oversee the exams. Abdirizak said teachers and students in Garissa have suffered due to a shortage of teachers and a harsh working environment. He said Knec should not add insult to their injury. “Students from this region have worked hard. Knec should focus their energy on big schools that previously used to get over 200 As which was as a result of cheating,” Abdirizak said. The Knut official accused Knec of failing to heed to their recommendations that could have sealed possible cheating avenues. The recommendations included increasing the number of containers to reduce the distance school heads and principal take to collect examinations. “The longer the distance, the higher the chances that the exams will arrive late or anything can happen in between the examination centres and the containers,” Abdirizak said.
