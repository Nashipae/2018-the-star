The Garissa assembly on Thursday passed the Investment and Development Authority Bill, which provides for the establishment of legal and institutional frameworks for the promotion of investment. The Bill will enhance financial and economic prudence in the county’s investment, establish effective instruments for managing investments as well promote local investment and economic development. The Bill is seeks to enhance the county’s revenue base, provide mobilisation of finance, provide for investment in socially beneficial projects and coordination. In a session presided over by deputy speaker Mohamud Abass, the MCAs said the bill is long overdue. Trade and Tourism executive Adow Jubat and chief officer Mahat Sheikh were present at the public gallery during the passage of the bill. The chief officer described the passage of the bill as historic and said it will have a positive socioeconomic impact. He said the bill, drafted by his department, borrows heavily from the Kenya Investment Authority policy and draft national bill on investment. “The public has been consulted and has given its input, so this bill has covered all what is required, it will help bring in investors of all cadres, weather local and international, and provide a legal framework” Mahat said. He said the bill will set the stage for the formation of an investment authority which will be independent and will manage all issues of investment in the county. “The bill is going to bring sanity in investment and development in the county. There are so many people willing to invest, but they don’t know the prerequisites,” he told journalists outside the assembly.
