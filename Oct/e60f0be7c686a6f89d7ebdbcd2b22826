A land ownership plan targeting young people earning as little as Sh30,000 to Sh100,000 per month has seen 5,000 title deeds issued in five years, laying ground for President Uhuru Kenyatta’s agenda on affordable housing. Championed by Username Investment, the plan offers properties ranging between Sh199,000-430,000 which can be paid in 12 months instalments. In an interview with the Star, Username’s chief executive Reuben Kimani said that they started the firm in 2013 to provide young people with affordable opportunity who cannot afford expensive mortgage products. “The traditional mortgage sector pushes away low income earners, especially young people entering job market. Our property investment model appeals to that young man hawking in streets and a junior executive in the corporate world,’’ Kimani said. The firm’s mission is to provide the current and upcoming generation with a place they can call home. They install amenities like water, electricity and fence, reading buyers for construction. “We sell land to people knowing that they will either put it into use or sell the property to someone else. The value addition part has been the selling point for most of the company’s properties,’’ Kimani said. The company demarcates and sells prospective properties measuring 50 by 100 metres across the country with footprints in Kajiado, Nakuru, Machakos and Kiambu counties. “Land is a high value investment with minimal risks. Stop wasting money on social affairs like alcohol and betting and safeguard your future,’’ Kimani advised the youth. According to KPMG, of 2.48 million Kenyans in employment in 2016 only 77,000 earned over Sh100,000, the threshold for affordable housing. The government is targeting to construct at least 500,000 housing units by 2022 with Finance Act 2018 compelling salaried employees to contribute to the housing kitty referred to National Housing Development Fund (NHDF). According to the law, employers will contribute 1.5 per cent of monthly basic salary from each employee and remit it to NHDF on or before ninth day of preceding month. Employees will contribute another 1.5 per cent subject to maximum contribution capped at Sh5,000.
