DPP Noordin Haji has ordered investigations over the missing documents meant for prosecution of top Kenya Power managers. The prosecution told the court the documents were in the custody of the power firm. The Sh4.5 billion case against embattled chief executive officer Ken Tarus, his predecessor Ben Chumo alongside other top managers, began on Monday. Senior assistant DPP Alexander Muteti told chief magistrate Felix Kombo the original ERC report prepared on the procurement of faulty transformers was missing. He said the document is crucial to the prosecution's case and even though they have photocopies, they need the originals to go ahead with the trial. Several senior Kenya Power officials were arrested over corruption charges relating to the supply of faulty transformers. They were all charged with conspiracy to commit economic crimes and abuse of office on July 31. They denied the charges and were released on a Sh1 million bond. On October 4, Kenya Power's internal auditor Kodhek Ochiel revealed there was non-compliance to procurement rules and presentation of false documents.
