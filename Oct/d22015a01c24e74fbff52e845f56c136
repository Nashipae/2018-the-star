A KCPE exam candidate in Gatanga subcounty succumbed to rabies shortly after completing her first day. Lucy Wambui, 14, was a pupil at Mwiting’iri Primary School in Gatanga subcounty. Head teacher Lydia Mwangi said the pupil was unwell as she sat her exam. She said the school informed Wambui’s mother her daughter was unwell and she picked her and took her to hospital. Wambui died shortly after undergoing treatment at Thika Level 5 Hospital and being discharged, Mwangi said. She spoke when Water CS Simon Chelgui visited the school. Fellow candidates were shaken by the news. “We have counselled them to enable them to sit for the day’s examinations with courage,” Mwangi said. “I was shocked this (yesterday) morning when I received a phone call from the area chief informing me that Wambui had passed away last night.” Murang’a county commissioner John Elung’ata said Wambui was diagnosed too late. He condoled with the school and urged candidates to be courageous as they embarked on their second day of the national examinations. Wambui’s death is the second in the county during the exam period. A KCSE exam candidate collapsed and died during a Form 4 students’ party at Gaichanjiru Boys High School on Saturday night. Compromised standards “The examinations have been going on well without any other incidents,” Elungata said. Chelugui urged candidates to be strong despite losing their classmate. He urged them to focus on doing their best in the exams.The CS toured several schools in Gatanga subcounty yesterday morning. Cabinet secretaries have been deployed across the country to encourage students and ensure rules are observed. The government has said it is committed to eradicating cheating during national examinations. Chelgui said cheating compromises standards in different sectors across the country. Cheaters, he said, end up in professions they are unqualified for and thus begins a negative cycle of poor services.
