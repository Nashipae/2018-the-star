Four people were killed  in Marsabit following clashes pitting Borana and Garba communities on Saturday. Fighting erupted in Shurr village leaving three locals and one assailant dead in the retaliatory attack. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet, during tour of the region last month, warned of arrest of politicians who incite people to violence. He ordered investigations into the leaders' conduct with a view to arresting and charging them in court in the event they were found to be in breach of the law.  More to follow.
