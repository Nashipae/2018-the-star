A fisherman in Homa Bay who has been stuck in Lake Victoria's water hyacinth for three days has appealed for his rescue. David Ouma, 34, told the Star on the phone that he has been struggling to free himself from the weeds in vain. The fisherman, who hails from Seme in Kisumu county, was on an expedition near Obaria beach in Karachuonyo when he got stuck. "Strong waves pushed me towards the hyacinth which has surrounded my boat. I cannot move forward or backwards," he said. Ouma said he was with other two fishermen who were in a separate boat. "They drifted away and I haven’t seen them from Tuesday afternoon." "I'm near Obaria beach and not able to see people on dry land. I'm appealing to relevant authorities and well-wishers to come to my aid," he said. Eliud Onyango, Homa Bay county director of disaster management, said they have contacted Kenya Maritime Authority officials to rescue the fishermen. "We’re already at the beach. Rescue efforts will start as soon as the maritime officials arrive," Onyango said. A month ago, four fishermen also got stuck at Ngegu beach in Homa Bay. Samuel Otieno 31, Raphael Otiu, 36, Kennedy Oluoch, 27, and Shadrack Ogutu, 28, were trapped in hyacinth for three days. They were rescued by a motorboat from Kisumu Kenya Maritime Authority. Homa Bay beach management unit chairman Edward Oremo appealed to the county government to find ways of removing hyacinth in the lake. "The water weeds affect residents whose livelihoods depend on fishing," Oremo said. Click here for the latest political news
