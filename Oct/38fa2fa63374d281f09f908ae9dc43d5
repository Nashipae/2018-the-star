The hearing of a case in which a senior police officer is to be charged with killing a university student in Kisumu last May begins today. Kehancha police station OCS Sebastian Ambani (pictured below) was found to be fit to stand trial after a mental examination. He was arrested in Osiepe village, Kisumu East constituency, in connection with the death of Brian Chacha. The 22-year-old KCA University student died of gunshot wounds at Mamboleo market in a changâ€™aa den. Chacha, who was from Kuria West, was shot in the head and chest. Appearing before High Court judge Fred Ochieng last Wednesday, Ambani denied the charges and was released on Sh500,000 bond and surety of the same amount. Justice Ochieng also ordered the accused to refrain from making any contact with the witnesses directly or indirectly.
