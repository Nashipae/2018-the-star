Migori Governor Okoth Obado will know his fate today on whether he will be released on bail or not. High Court judge Jessie Lesiit is expected to deliver the ruling on Obado and his co-accused bail applications at 9 am. Obado has been in remand at the Industrial Area prison for 33 days after his arrest on September 21 in connection with the murder of Rongo university student Sharon Otieno. Justice Lesiit had declined Obado’s first application for bail on September 27. Lessit said that uncertainty of the safety of witnesses in the murder trial led to the denial of bail. Read: Obado's PA to take plea in Sharon's murder case on Tuesday Obado is facing two murder charges alongside his personal assistant Michael Oyamo and County Clerk Caspal Obiero. The second charge is that of killing Sharon’s unborn child. They allegedly committed the offence between September 3 and 4 this year at Homa Bay County. In his second application, Obado pleaded through lawyers Nicholas Ombija, Cliff Ombeta and Rodgers Sagana for the judge to reconsider citing serious health problems that could only be addressed if he was out on bail. Lawyer Cliff Ombeta asked the court to free the second term governor since the prosecution had not adduced compelling evidence suggesting the county chief could interfere with witnesses.
