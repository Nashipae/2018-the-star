A City Hall official has been accused of collaborating with boda boda operators to sabotage the implementation of the riders ban from the Central Business District. The Kenya County Government Workers Union secretary for Nairobi branch Boniface Waweru said Tito Kilonzi is sabotaging the work of the inspectorate department. Kilonzi is the chief security officer at City Hall. He has been accused of selectively directing the arrest of boda boda riders in the CBD. City Hall banned boda bodas from the city centre early this year to reduce congestion and curb surging crime. Waweru last week told the County Assembly Committee on Labour that Kilonzi was in “a deal with the boda boda operators”. Kware MCA Rose Ogonda said Kilonzi was part of the boda boda cartels. ”Its not logical that boda boda operators along University Way are arrested while those close to City Hall within the CBD are spared,” Ogonda said. Committee chairman Peter Wanyoike said they will summon Kilonzi to respond to the claims.
