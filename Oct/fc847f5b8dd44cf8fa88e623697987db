TV journalist Jacque Maribe will be detained for 11 more days at the Gigiri police station as officers continue investigations into the murder of Monica Kimani. Kiambu Principal Magistrate Justus Kituku ordered that Maribe should not be coerced to record a statement in the absence of her lawyer and her safety must be guaranteed. The prosecution had sought to detain her for 14 days citing ballistic examination of the samples that they took from her house and a pending DNA test. “The general nature of the offence is a serious charge which could be accessory to murder and possession of firearms,” prosecutor Jacinta Nyamosi said. However, Maribe's lawyer Katwa Kigen opposed the application saying the court should give a maximum of three days for the prosecution to conclude their probe. Maribe was arrested on Saturday after two days of interrogation by detectives. A source privy to the investigations said Maribe was arrested after investigators recovered some documents, among them a wallet and a handbag believed to belong to Monica at her house in Royal Park, Lang’ata. Police also believe that the Citizen TV anchor knew that her fiance Joseph Irungu had killed Monicah but failed to report. Read; Detectives ‘find Monica’s handbag’ in Maribe’s house
