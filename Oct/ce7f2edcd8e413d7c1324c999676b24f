Early morning drives through the park are always events that have a feeling of the unexpected. Such an event happened near junction No7, after we had entered from the east gate. Suddenly, four hyena appeared in the road. I immediately stopped and switched off the engine. The hyenas hesitated and observed us for a while, and then slowly moved up the road towards us. They moved off into the long grass for a brief moment and then returned into the road behind us. We decided to follow them. After turning around, we watched them behaving naturally as they walked down the road for at least 1km. We eventually left them when a tour van arrived, so the tourists could have a special sighting. Wow! What a sighting. Hyena sightings in the Nairobi Park are fairly rare but always unique. The hyenas that live in the Nairobi Park live an elusive life due to persecution over many years. They live in small family groups, usually with a den. It has been noted, however, that the hyena population within the park is slowly increasing. Spotted hyenas (Latin – Crocuta Crocuta) have a reputation for being scavengers. However, they play a vital role in nature by cleaning dead remains of animals, and in so doing reduce possibilities of diseases. Sadly in Nairobi, some of the hyenas do wander out of the park and forage for food at night, often with tragic consequences, such as poisoning. Their eerie “whoop… whoop” call is often heard late at night in some residential areas. In other parts of Africa, hyenas are so bold that they even hunt live animals in packs. It is always best to expect the unexpected. Rewards will come in time.
