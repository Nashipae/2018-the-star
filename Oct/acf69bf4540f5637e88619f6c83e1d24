A senior Nandi county assembly finance officer was found dead in an Eldoret hotel two days after she went missing. The body of Stellah Jepkoech, 25, was found in a room at Venus Hotel off the Eldoret-Kapsabet Road. Her saloon vehicle, a Toyota Premio, was found parked outside the hotel. Jepkoech was the assembly budget officer and is suspected to have committed suicide over a love triangle. Nandi assembly speaker Joshua Kiptoo said her body was found in a room she had booked on Monday. “She had failed to report to work on Monday and Tuesday and had last been seen driving towards Eldoret alone in her car,” Kiptoo said. Hotel bosses ordered her room broken into after they suspected something could have gone wrong since she had not left her room for two days. She is reported to have been depressed after she found out the man she considered her husband was married with two children. She has left a six-month old son fathered by the man. The Nandi assembly was thrown into a state of mourning after the discovery of her body as the proceedings came to an abrupt end. The speaker had to adjourn. A colleague who requested not to be named claimed the deceased had been had been suffering from depression had refused to see a doctor had expressed her interest to take away her life. Her body was moved to MTRH hospital mortuary in Eldoret, she hailed from Kapsisywa village in Chessmen sub-county. “She found herself helpless on discovering that her boyfriend was a married person, she felt betrayed,” the officer said. Jepkoech’s death brings to three the number of staff who have committed suicide under unclear circumstances in the county government establishment. In May 2017, a procurement officer Kevin Kemboi hanged himself at his cowshed in Kapsabet, and in October, Shadrack Biwott a technician at the county referral hospital took poison and died.
