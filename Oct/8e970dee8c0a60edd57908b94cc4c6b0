Chemelil Sugar head coach Francis Baraza has revealed his plan of bringing in eight new players in preparation for the forthcoming 2018-2019 SportPesa Premier League set to kick off on December 8. Chemelil narrowly escaped the wrath of the axe last season, finishing14th with 39 points, a position which Baraza believes can be improved by beefing up his squad with the new eight acquisitions. The millers were on course to a respectable finish in the first leg of the just concluded season but a financial turmoil in June saw more than 15 experienced players leave the club for greener pastures, reducing the club to relegation candidates. However, the arrival of Baraza from Tusker in the same month gradually stabilised the fast-sinking club as he gallantly fought in the final rounds of the season to save their top flight status. The former Kenyan international believes bolstering his playing unit will play a key role not only to restore the glory of the club but also bring in competition. As it is the norm of many top flight clubs to conduct trials in search of new talents, Baraza said he had identified his potential targets to strengthen his weak areas and would launch negotiations soon. He said: “I want to sign eight players to beef up the current squad. I will go for players, who have the top flight experience irrespective of their age. From the past season, I have identified players who will help us in our bid to redeem ourselves from last season’s poor run. I will not conduct trials since I have already identified my targets and soon we will begin negotiations.” He added: “The striking front tops my priority where I want at least two lethal strikers and few attacking midfielders. I also want two central defenders and an additional goalkeeper.”
