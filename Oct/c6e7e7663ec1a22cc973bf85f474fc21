Jamaican reggae star Tarrus Riley has shared the inspiration behind his most famous song, Just the way you are. The reggae star, who is in the country, said the song is about giving confidence to women because that is what they need. "'Just the way you are' sounds very bright and so does the video. The song portrays good vibes as well. I wrote it because I write about happy moments and love songs. Every time I write love songs about women, I do it by trying to give them a lot of confidence, because every woman wants to be the prettiest, the sexiest woman as well as the brightest woman," he told the press at DusitD2 yesterday. "If a man has higher expectations over a woman, what I am saying is I love you just the way you are. If today you are in your best clothes and your makeup is good, fine. And if tomorrow you are not like that, then I love you just the way you are. That's what it is about." Tarrus Riley has visited the country several times. He is set to perform at the KICC on Saturday, during the Mashujaa Day holiday weekend. Other reggae artistes in the line-up include Everton Blender. "Every time I come to Africa is very special, and it is a pleasure to be in Kenya and I'm very excited," Tarrus said. He also talked about his mother, who has been very active in mentoring and supporting his career. "My mother and I are very close. She has told me so many things that I cannot talk about one particular thing she said, but she is very nice. Everything she says to me is like a book that I can open every day and read." Tarrus has a new release, Uganda, named after his first-ever performance in Uganda in August. The New York-born artiste has received lots of attention for his talent, with over 10 awards nominations. His biggest hits include Just The Way You Are, Don’t Come Back and Superman.
