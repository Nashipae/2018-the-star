The High Court has rejected an application by the office of the Attorney General seeking to have a case challenging the Finance Act 2018 referred to the Chief Justice. Justice Wilfrida Okwany said there is nothing so complex or grave about the petition that her court cannot determine. The AG, she said, did not satisfy the threshold laid down by the Constitution to have the case heard by an uneven number of judges. “Matters taken to a three-judge bench take longer than a single judge and for balance of justice I therefore find that the conduct of the AG is not withstanding. This is not a proper case for certification for the CJ to empanel a bench of uneven numbers to hear and determine it,” she said. The case will now be heard on November 20. The AG, through lawyer George Oraro, had argued that the matters in the petition raised substantial questions of law that needed to be determined by a bench. It was argued that the bench, if constituted, would determine whether any country can operate without a Finance Act. However, activist Okiya Omtatah was opposed to the application, arguing that the state is simply buying time in order to delay the hearing and determination of his petitions. Omtatah also said if the court grants the application by the AG, then it will undermine the administration of justice which depends largely on perception, and the court will be seen as agreeing to the demands of the Executive.
