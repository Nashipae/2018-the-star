Retired President Daniel arap Moi on Wednesday marked Moi Day quietly at his Kabarak home with family and friends. Moi said he was overwhelmed by the messages of goodwill and greetings from Kenyans of all walks of life. He thanked Kenyans for their expression of love for him and the many fond memories. Moi said he prays for God's blessings for Kenya and its people. On November 9, last year, the High Court reinstated October 10 as a public holiday. Justice George Odunga said its nullification contravened the Public Holidays Act. However, he did not specify how the holiday should be celebrated and left the matter to Parliament and the Interior ministry. Kenyans love holidays so it is no wonder that many appreciated the judiciary's reinstatement of Moi Day. Kenya had been marking the holiday since 1988, when then PresidentÂ Moi marked 10 years in power but it was scrapped in 2010. The constitution recognises only three public holidays: Madaraka Day (June 1), Mashujaa Day (October 20) and Jamhuri Day (December 12).
