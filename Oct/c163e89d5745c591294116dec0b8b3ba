The Senate has promised to approve funding for a new assembly complex for Uasin Gishu, majority leader Josphat Lowoi has said. Lowoi said senators also agreed to approved funds for a new level five hospital to decongest Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. The resolutions were made last week when when the Senate held sittings in Eldoret. It was the first such session outside Nairobi. MCAs said they were glad to interact with senators during the sessions. The ward representatives said they learned a lot from experienced lawmakers, including James Orengo (Siaya), Amos Wako (Busia) and Moses Wetang’ula (Bungoma). “We had a whole week to interact. They inspired us a lot,” nominated MCA Josphine Barmao said. Lowoi thanked the senators for their intervention for quick payment of maize farmers. The farmers had not been paid for produce delivered to National Cereals and Produce Board in December last year. The senators appealed to the government to speed up payment. The cash has since been disbursed. “The farmers will be paid because the senators made the appeal after listening to their cries,” Lowoi said. Uasin Gishu speaker David Kiplagat said he was honoured with a new official seat in the assembly. strengthening devolution “The Senate Mashinani initiative was very successful. As a county, we benefited in terms of both learning experience and new projects that will be approved by the Senate,” Kiplagat said. Governor Jackson Mandago and Senator Margaret Kamar said the county benefitted greatly. “It was a wise move to bring the sittings of the Senate to Eldoret. It should be replicated elsewhere to strengthen devolution and cordination with the Senate,” Mandago said. The MCAs said they learnt new ways to strengthen oversight.
