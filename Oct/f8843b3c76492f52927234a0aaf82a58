The Federation of Women Lawyers–Kenya wants to be enjoined in a petition challenging the prosecution of DCJ Philomena Mwilu. Through lawyer Jemimah Keli, Fida says in its application that it has genuine interest in the petition. The organisation engages in public interest litigation to promote and protect women personal, political, social and economic rights. In an affidavit, Fida executive director Teresa Omondi says they are disturbed by Mwilu’s prosecution in a criminal court on matters, which are alleged to have happened before she was appointed. In the case, Mwilu and her co-accused Stanley Kiima were on August 28 arraigned to face charges of abuse of office, bribery and tax evasion. But before she could plead, her lawyers successfully argued an application at the High Court and obtained orders staying the criminal proceedings. The charges against Mwilu relate to credit facilities and transactions between her and Imperial Bank Ltd — in receivership — and an alleged failure to pay stamp duty on four properties she purchased between 2014 and 2016. The judge claims the basis of the alleged offences stems from contractual commercial/banking relations, which are governed by the contractual relationship between her and her banker Imperial Bank. According to court documents, any claim concerning the banking and commercial transactions should have been pursued by the bank through the civil contractual relationship mechanism. The bank, she says, has never confronted her with any complaints or issues on any of the alleged matters. The DPP has filed an application to have the matter heard by an uneven number of judges. He wants the orders suspending Mwilu’s criminal case set aside. The case, which is coming up, on Monday before Justice Chacha Mwita, will give directions on both applications.
