A section of Central MPs have asked the government to regulate imports and promote local production. The legislature said local traders are suffering because the market is flooded by imported products which can be produced locally. The MPs spoke on Wednesday during a press conference at Parliament building. "The government needs to create a level playing field for all business owners regardless of their size," they said in a joint statement read by Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro. The leaders asked the government to nullify work permits for foreigners who are doing what Kenyans can do. "Business people have taken loans, bought items from China but because of government inefficiencies they are not benefiting," Nyoro said. The leaders said it is shocking that some established manufacturers are opting to import instead of manufacturing locally "Why are imports more than the local commodities, there must be a conscious search to establish why are they finding it easier to import." The 2018 statistics from Central Bank show import orders hit Sh22.33 billion between the January-April period. This is a 133.08 per cent rise compared to a bill of Sh9.58 billion over a similar period in 2017. On Tuesday, President Uhuru Kenyatta banned the importation of fish from China saying it was strangling the local market. Local Manufacturing is part of the President's Big Four Agenda.
