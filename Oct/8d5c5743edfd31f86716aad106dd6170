Former US President Barack Obama has mocked his successor Donald Trump for the "massive" number of indictments in his administration. According to the New York Post, Obama accused Trump's administration of racking up enough charges to field a football team. He further slammed the Republicans for ''making stuff up.'' “What we have not seen before in our public life is politicians just blatantly, repeatedly, baldly, shamelessly, lying. Just making stuff up. Calling up, down. Calling black, white,” he said. He spoke on Friday evening at a democratic party rally in Detroit ahead of the November midterm election. “In Washington, they have racked up enough indictments to field a football team, nobody in my administration got indicted,” Obama said. Reuters News on September 8 reported that five key Trump advisers have admitted to crimes or been convicted since the election in November 2016. They are Trump’s campaign chairman, his deputy campaign manager, his national security adviser, his personal lawyer and a foreign policy aide. Others charged and being investigated are 12 Russians, 13 Russian companies and two other individuals. They face charges of interfering with the 2016 presidential elections. Obama also criticized Trump's promise to "drain the swamp", a popular slogan he used during his election campaign. He said Trump has instead gone to Washington and just plundered away. He accused Republicans of intentionally labouring on Hillary Clinton’s email server to “scare the heck out of people before every election.” "They didn’t care about emails and you know how you know? Because if they did, they’d be up in arms right now that the Chinese are listening to the president’s iPhone that he leaves in his golf cart,” the former president said.
