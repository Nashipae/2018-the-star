Kibra MP Ken Okoth is preparing a bill to legalise the growth and consumption of marijuana. Marijuana, also known as bangi or cannabis, is a relatively mild drug. It is not addictive like heroin or cocaine, although it may be habit-forming. It does not cause hallucinations although its use by adolescents can lead to schizophrenia in later life. It is best compared to alcohol, which can be addictive and destructive to health but is popular globally. Alcohol is a pleasant relaxant in moderation. Marijuana is an effective painkiller for certain medical conditions as well as being a relaxant. However marijuana is illegal and finances criminal activity in urban centres. In rural areas where it grows like a weed, young men are often sent to jail for smoking it. If marijuana were legalised, it would generate tax income for the government and stop money from going into the pockets of criminal gangs. It would save young men from being sent to jail unnecessarily. So let Kenya join Colorado and South Africa in legalising marijuana.
