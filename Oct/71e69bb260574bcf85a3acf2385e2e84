The Central Organisation of Trade Unions has sued Labour CS Ukur Yatani for failing to reappoint secretary general Francis Atwoli to the National Social Security Fund board. Cotu said the failure was part of a scheme to kick Atwoli out of the board. Lawyer Okweth Achiando said it would be prejudicial for the board to convene a meeting in the absence of Atwoli.

The board has said it will meet as usual to consider issues not limited to financial reports, approval of major projects, job advertisements, interviews and appointment of the general managers. “Convening such meetings in the absence of the nominee of Cotu is an action that is prejudicial to the interest of the union,” Achiando said. Cotu asked the court to restrain Yatani and the NSSF board from convening meetings pending the reappointment of Atwoli. The union also wants ordered compelling the CS to appoint Atwoli to the board. Employment and Labour Relations Court judge Onesmus Makau certified the matter as urgent and directed Cotu to serve the CS with documents ahead of hearing on Monday.
