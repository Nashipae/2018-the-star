The woman accused of assaulting a Kenyatta National Hospital nurse has said that she acted out of pain and anger. Pamela Akinyi, 40, said she rushed to the hospital upon receiving a sad news that her son Elisha Juma, 17, passed on. The single mother of two was informed of the death by her son Gideon Ogola, who was looking after Juma when she was away. Pamela told the Star that the said nurse rudely told her that they had dealt with Ogola and hence, could not attend to her. She said that on asking the nurse to explain why she couldn't be briefed as the mother of the deceased, the latter walked away. "My late son earlier told me the nurses were harassing him. He even wanted to be transferred to another hospital but the doctors refused." Pamela, who has dismissed claims she strangled the nurse, said they wanted to take the sick boy to Nairobi West Hospital. She also denied allegations that she used a blunt object to hit the health worker. "How could that be possible? Those are fabrications," she said. The case is recorded under OB No. 14/13/10/18. Pamela was freed on Sh5,000 cash bail after she reported to Kilimani police station as directed by the investigating agencies. Kilimani OCPD Michael Muchiri said they could not detain Pamela on grounds that the nurse is yet to record a statement. He emphasised the law would take its course upon completion of all legal processes. "The law allows the release of a suspect on bond. It will be illegal for her to be detained yet the nurse has not recorded a statement." Click here for the latest political news
