Artistes are approaching Elani for collabos after the trio made a comeback. Not
so long ago, they finally launched their album, ‘Colours of Love’, on
Kiss FM, and amazed fans with the first song they released, Heartbeat. "People have approached us for collabos on email, on
Facebook, and the thing about us is that we are not opposed to writing
music with people, so long as you show us content. Just prove to us you
are worth the time," they said during an interview with Adelle and
Shaffie on Kiss. Releasing
a song after taking time away from the music industry can be tricky. "We
were so scared when we dropped the song after a long break. You know
you can plan so well, and when the song is out, you get a negative
response. We thank our fans for their response and for welcoming us with
open arms, having waited patiently for the song," they said.
