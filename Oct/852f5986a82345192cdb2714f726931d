The government which is facing a financial crunch and Sh500 billion budget deficit has issued stringent guidelines to stem the penchant for foreign trips among county government officials. The government projects to slash by half the Sh65.5 billion foreign and domestic travel for county workers and members of county assemblies. In the new stringent regulations, MCAs and county staff will now have to justify and seek the approval of the Ministry of Devolution to travel abroad. The approval will be made upon submission of a needs-and-benefits assessment before travel arrangements are made. Both the Council of Governors and the County Assemblies Forum reacted angrily to the new regulations, terming them as an assault on devolution. _____________________________________________________ Storm at DCI over Uhuru changes in police A storm is brewing within the National Police Service over the changes announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta last month.

The failure by the officer, only identified as Changilwa, to ferry the bodies to the morgue led to the accumulation that was later discovered by Governor Mike Sonko in an impromptu visit. The county assembly health committee investigating the incident said they summoned Changilwa after acting medical superintendent Beth Maina, who was at the hospital at the time the Governor visited, said they could account for 10 bodies. _____________________________________________________ Watchmen put lives on the line for as little as Sh5,000 a month How much does the security guard at your residence, office or favourite shopping mall earn?
