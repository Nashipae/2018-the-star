Nominated senator Falhadho Iman has urged the Garissa executive to use resources to improve lives. There has been a general feeling across the country that resources allocated to the counties are being looted because of weak oversight structures. Iman said on Monday that she will push for allocation of more resources to the counties but warned that they must be used prudently for the benefit of all residents. She spoke in Garissa town. “It’s quite unfortunate that counties haven’t been able to account for resources allocated to them. Claims of massive looting are widespread. Devolution was meant to uplift people’s wellbeing,” she said. The lawmaker promised to work with Senator Yusuf Haji to oversight the county and hold its administration to account. Iman urged other Northeastern counties to seize the opportunity created by devolution to end decades of suffering brought about by marginalisation under the past regimes. “Devolution is a blessing for us and an opportunity for our communities to catch up with the rest of Kenya. We can’t squander this moment,” she said. The legislator told the counties to prioritise skills development. She urged the Garissa government to award 30 per cent of tenders and jobs to the youth and women — a legal requirement for empowerment. Infrastructure development alone is not enough, Iman said. “Our youth and women must be empowered through technical education training and skills for life programmes so they can seize opportunities,” she said.
