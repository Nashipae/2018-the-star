Political leaders and elders from both the Gabra and Borana communities have agreed to implement resolutions made during a peace meeting to end hostilities. They reached a deal following tribal clashes between the communities that left at least 14 people dead. Scores of people were displaced and 10 schools were closed. The leadersÂ and elders held a daylong meeting organised by Marsabit Interfaith Council in Nairobi on Thursday. The meeting was attended by Marsabit governor Mohamud Ali, senator Godana Hargura, nominated senator Naomi Jillo, four MPs, all MCAs from the area and elders. Saku MP Dido Ali Raso told displaced families to return to their homes. He said leaders have resolved to preach and uphold peace. The MP appealed to communities to live in harmony as leaders seek long-long solutions to the conflict. North Horr MP Chachu Ganya blamed leaders for failing to give guidance to the communities. Governor Ali has called on the government to disarm civilians with illegal firearms. He said insecurity dragged behind Marsabit's economy. Click here for the latest political news
