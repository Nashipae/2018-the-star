Consumers are likely to start paying more for a two kilo packet of maize meal from next week. Small-scale millers yesterday warned that the price of unga is likely to shoot up from Sh75 to between Sh95 to Sh100 if the government does not release maize from the National Cereals and Produce Board. Peter Kuguru, the chairman of United Grain Millers Association said the government should release maize being held by NCPB to millers at Sh1,800 but he added that the maize can only last for two weeks. “At the moment, we do not have enough maize to mill and farmers are holding their maize and not willing to sell as they wait for the government to buy it at Sh3, 000 per 90kg bag,” he said. He was speaking yesterday during a press briefing on the current price of maize flour. Currently, a 90kg bag of maize in Nairobi and other urban towns is selling at between Sh2, 000 to Sh2, 600. Kuguru said that when they met with agriculture Cabinet secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri and the millers agreed on the Sh75 retail price of unga, the price of a 90kg bag was selling at Sh1, 600 in the local market but it has since gone up. “The increased price of maize across the county and its unavailability will eventually force the market to increase the price of flour,” he said. A spot check at local supermarkets showed that the price of a two kilogramme packet of maize meal is retailing at Sh75 but traders say that there have been rumours that the price is likely to go up. NCPB acting managing director Albin Sang said currently the country’s maize stock is at 6.5 million bags and out of this, only 240, 000 bags are what remains from the maize imported from Mexico last year. “We are waiting for a directive from the Strategic Food Reserve on when to sell maize and at how much,” said Sang.
