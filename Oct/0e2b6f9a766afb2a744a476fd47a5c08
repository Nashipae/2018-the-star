Former Airforce soldiers from various counties across Western Kenya have filed a compensation suit at a Kisumu labour court. Appearing before Justice Mathews Nderi, the 80 former soldiers want to be paid for what they term as unfair dismissal after the failed 1982 attempted coup. Justice Nderi directed the parties to appear before the court on December 5 for mention of the case. He gave the Attorney General 14 days to file submissions.
