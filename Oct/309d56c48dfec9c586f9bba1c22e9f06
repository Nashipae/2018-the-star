Renowned UoN Literature don Chris Wanjala has died aged 75, the family said on Monday. His son and family spokesperson Alex Wanjala told the Star on the phone that his father died at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. "He was rushed after complaining of chest and stomach pain. He died on the wee hours of Monday," he said. The late don's last public appearance was at a funeral of his childhood friend Julius Sindani at Chesamisi village on Saturday. "We can't authoritatively tell what led to his death but all we can say is that he had complained of severe chest and stomach pains," Alex said. Prof Wanjala's most recent contribution to literature is "Memories We Lost" - an anthology of short stories among other books. He was hailed by many as an icon revered in academic circles. He was one of Kenya’s leading literary critics and historians. Over the years, Prof Wanjala made vast contribution to the nation as a literary scholar, writer, critic, and man of culture. Several leaders eulogised Wanjala as a great man who made an immense contribution to literature. "He was also my great political supporter and one of the resource persons during the Bungoma County Cultural festivals in my term as Bungoma Governor," Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka said.
