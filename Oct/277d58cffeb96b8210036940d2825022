Two hardcore criminals who were being sought for the murder of an assistant chief in Nyeri county on Monday surrendered to the police. John Githinji and Joseph Kangethe were presented to the police by lobby groups Muslim for Human Rights (Muhuri) and Infoaction after being in hiding. The two approached the two rights groups after fears they would be gunned down. They surrendered following a crackdown on Gitathiini assistant chief Peter Nyuguto's killers. The administrator was shot dead in August.

He said the two will be questioned and will be charged in the event they are found to have committed a crime. Githinji said he has not been engaged in any criminal activity of late since his conviction in 2006. At one time, he confessed having attempted to carjack Nyeri Central OCS at gunpoint among other daring crimes. Kangethe’s criminal record dates back to 2002 when he joined the outlawed Mungiki sect. The group took over bus parks and terrorised residents and business leaders in Mount Kenya and Nairobi. Nine years ago, Kangethe was among suspects linked to the murder of Jonah Nzau - a DCI officer in Othaya. Nzau was shot dead near his residence at the approved school in Othaya town in Nyeri county. "I have been in hiding for the past six months for fear of my life. I was always told that security officers frequented my homestead looking for me," Kangethe said. The father of two lives in Majengo slums while his counterpart is a father of six from two wives. Muhuri director Khelef Khalifa concurred with the police on checking the duo's past records but insisted that their rights should be respected. Click here for the latest political news
