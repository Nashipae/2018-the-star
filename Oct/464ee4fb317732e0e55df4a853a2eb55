Emmanuel Chemengich was on Sunday consecrated as Kitale ACK bishop following his election on August 25. The ceremony was presided over by Archbishop Jackson Ole Sapit at the Kitale Agricultural Society of Kenya showground. Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula were among leaders present. Chemengich, 49, defeated Polycarp Meger and Kimatai Chesos during the election. He succeeds Bishop Stephen Kewasis who retired in July. Faithful described Chemengich’s rise as a new chapter in the church’s transformation and pledged support. “I accept the trust bestowed on me as the new head of the diocese. I humbly present my proposed five strategic pillars which I hope will help the church grow,” Chemengich said.
