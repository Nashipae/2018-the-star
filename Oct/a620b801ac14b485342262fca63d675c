Former MPs from Kilifi county have formed a caucus to promote development. On Saturday, the 21 leaders met in Kilifi to launch the caucus, which will operate under the banner of the Former Parliamentarians Association (FOPA) Kilifi Chapter. Former Kaloleni MP Morris Dzoro said ex-legislators have been sidelined by the current leadership despite having vast experience in leadership. “Most of the former legislators are professionals with a lot of experience in different fields. We have been offering consultancy in other areas but it is now time we focus on our home county. This is the main reason we have decided to come together,” he said.
