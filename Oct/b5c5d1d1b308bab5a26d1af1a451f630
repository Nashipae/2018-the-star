Good Morning. Lugari Member of Parliament Ayub Savula Angatia was on Friday night arrested by Directorate of Criminal Investigations detectives for allegedly conspiring to steal Sh122,335,500 from the ICT ministry. "He will be arraigned in court on Monday," DCI said in a tweet after the arrest. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this Saturday morning. Why maize crisis could haunt Ruto's 2022 presidential bid The maize crisis facing farmers especially in Rift Valley is shaping into a storm with damaging political consequences for Deputy President William Ruto. At the centre of the storm are simmering claims that the Deputy President is among the beneficiaries or has done little to address the cartels that flooded the market with imported maize — some of whom were paid promptly at the expense of genuine farmers. It is emerging that farmers in Uasin Gishu, Nandi, Trans Nzoia, Bungoma, parts of Kericho, Bomet and Narok believe that Ruto, who was Minister for Agriculture in the Grand Coaltion government, has abandoned them and done little to politically resolve the crisis. _____________________________________________________ Kenya at risk of a constitutional crisis if next general elections are held in 2022 Two activists have filed a constitutional petition seeking to declare that the next General Election should be held in August 2021 and not 2022. Okiya Omtatah and Wycliffe Gisebe say that holding the elections in 2022 will be unconstitutional as the term of the current elected leaders will have exceeded the “fifth” year term limit. The two argue that the second Tuesday of August 2022 will fall in the sixth year after the 2017 elections, while the Constitution requires that the election is held the second Tuesday of August of the fifth year. _____________________________________________________ Over 40 per cent form four leavers unable to read and write -World Bank More than 40 per cent of students finishing form four in Kenya don't meet the minimum basic literacy level of reading and writing, a World Bank Flagship report has revealed. The illiteracy problem among the form four leavers, according to the WB's World Development Report 2019, is attributed to the poor quality education. The 151-page report groups Kenya, Ghana and Bolivia among countries that their high school leavers aged between 19 and 20 years score below the basic literacy level. _____________________________________________________ Raila's appointment by AU is not a full-time job Raila Odinga’s appointment as the High Representative for Infrastructure in Africa is not a full time job: It is part time. It, therefore, does not stop him from either staying in Nairobi and Bondo, or going about with his current responsibilities, nor does it mean he will stay in Addis Ababa. And this is not the first time Raila has served the AU in such a high capacity. But because Raila is Raila, anything he does must be seen to be larger than life. _____________________________________________________ Why Diani is becoming Africa’s tourist destination of choice Five years in a row, Diani Beach in Kenya’s South Coast has been named Africa’s Leading Beach Destination at the World Travel Awards. The Kenyan South Coast is steadily becoming tourists’ destination of choice, beating Cape Town of South Africa, Sharm El Sheikh of Egypt and Zanzibar of Tanzania. Previously, Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt won the award in 2010 and 2011, Cape Town South Africa won in 2012 and Zanzibar in Tanzania in 2013. However, what is coming out clearly is the competition at the Kenyan South Coast, which is now leading as the region with the most five-star and four-star rated hotels at the Coast. _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
