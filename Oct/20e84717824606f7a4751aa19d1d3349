Kisumu residents yesterday raised the alarm over increasing insecurity. They urged IG Joseph Boinnet to intervene before the problem gets out of hand. Kisumu City Residents’ Voice chairman Audi Ogada said many people have been robbed, others shot and scores killed. He accused security officers of laxity. They plan to present a petition to Boinnet today. He is expected in the lakeside town. “A number of transfers were made recently and this could be a protest by some officers. We also had police units disbanded under unclear circumstances. I believe these might be some of the issues causing the problem,” Ogada said. A college student was killed in Mamboleo at 8pm on Wednesday. Ogada said police are effective when raiding shops and homes in search of illicit alcohol but inefficient when dealing with criminals. Surprisingly, the police are also targetted. A youthful AP officer from Kibos Kebs office was attacked last week and his gun stolen. He succumbed to his injuries at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital. Ogada warned that such a worrying trend could scare away investors. Trader Mark Oluoch from Mowlem said they fear for their lives after a shop was raided and the owner shot dead. “We’re afraid of opening our shops. We’re not sure if they’ll follow us to our homes,” he said. Some thieves spray sedatives into houses, making occupants unconscious before they break in. In August, Nation Media photographer Tonny Omondi was a victim. “When I woke up, I realised the thugs broke into my house through the kitchen window. They stole my gas cooker, camera and accessories,” he said.
