The DPP has ordered investigations into allegations of fraud in the subdivision of ILRI land in Mavoko constituency. Noordin Haji, in a statement on Monday, singled out Makonza Society, Kamulu Self-Help Group, and Makonza South entities as suspects. "I have directed the DCI to immediately commence investigations and ensure that the persons responsible for such illegal acts are promptly brought to justice," he said. The DPP further warned members of the public against making any further payments or engaging with the said entities and others fronting themselves as the holders of the said parcels of land. The land in question is alleged to be the property of the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI). "The land is unavailable for allocation by or to anyone," Haji stated further asking those who have transacted with the three entities to contact the DCI with a view to helping the investigations. "Let them provide any documents that may be in their possession to assist in unraveling the fraudulent scheme," the DPP said. Squatters on the land have been complaining of unwarranted evictions from the property which they claim was theirs before it was apportioned to ILRI for livestock research.
