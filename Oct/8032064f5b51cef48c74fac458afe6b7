Youth leaders in Kisumu have told Kisumu MCAs to stop fighting over money and power and focus on the electorate. They said the constant wrangles by ward representatives are demeaning to the electorate. Chief sergeant- at-arms George Amayo was on Tuesday forced to shoot in the air to scare MCAs baying for his blood. Led by George Abwajo, Kisumu County Budget and Economic Forum told MCAs to focus on services instead of petty fights driven by lust for money. “We wish to remind MCAs that their main duty is to oversight, legislate and represent the electorate,” Abwajo said yesterday. The continuous fights at the assembly hamper economic development as they scare potential investors in the county, he added. Abwayo noted that Kisumu is faced with unemployment, poverty, health issues and lack of proper infrastructure. The youth noted with concern the trend of wrangling in Homa Bay, Migori and Kisumu believed to be about money and 2022 politics. “Our representatives should stop personalising issues. They should be committed towards delivering in their duties.” Abwajo said the youth have watched as leaders abdicate their principal role of checking the executive. “Some leaders have in turn changed to singing executive praises notably in funerals and rallies. Let them convert the praises and shout matches to objective discourses in the assembly,” he said. He warned that they will not sit and watch them focus on personal issues.
