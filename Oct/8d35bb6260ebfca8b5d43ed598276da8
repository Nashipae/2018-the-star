Public funds should not be used to set up smoking zones, a tobacco control lobby has said. Kenya Tobacco Control Alliance chairman Joel Gitali yesterday termed the move by some county governments to use taxpayers money to set up designated smoking zones a waste of public money. He said the Tobacco Control Act bans smoking in public places, tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship. Gitali said it clearly states that owners of public places, including restaurants, bars and hotels should provide an outdoor “smoking zone”. “If you run a business, which you think smokers are the largest contributors in your revenue, then take it upon yourself to set up an area where they will be smoking. County governments should not use public funds to do so,” he said. Click here for the latest political news
