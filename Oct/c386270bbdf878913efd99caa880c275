Former MP Danson Mungatana admitted yesterday he was conned out of a ‘large’ sum in a fake investment oil scheme operating in an undisclosed place. He was responding to widespread media reports last week that he lost Sh76 million to conmen. “About eight years ago, I lost a lot of money in a fake investment oil scheme that was run by Abdalla Tamba. He [was] later freed in Kenya, which I came to learn when I saw him on TV,” he said at the Laico Regency. “After the police displayed him in public, I submitted myself as they had asked if anyone who had been conned to report to them.” Mungatana explained the business cost him a lot of money together with other prominent individuals. “Abdalla and his partner came and told me to invest money so we would buy oil. The first and second round there was profit, but the third round, the foreigners simply disappeared and went with the money till recently when I saw him arrested. “It was not only me who suffered but there were a lot of prominent people who fell prey to the scheme as it seemed genuine.” The former lawmaker denied that he wanted to be an overnight billionaire. “My mother taught me to work hard. An accident can happen to anyone as crimes do not respect [people]. If someone suffers such a thing, don’t shame the victim,” Mungatana said. Click here for
