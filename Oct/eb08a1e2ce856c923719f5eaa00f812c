DPP Noordin Haji has ordered the release of two suspects arrested in connection with the murder of former Kakamega DC Paul Yatich's wife. The two, Laban Cheruiyot and Simon Lumile were arrested in Nandi last week while in possession of a vehicle belonging to the deceased Loise Yatich. Haji said the two should instead be witnesses against the prime suspect Boniface Kiptoo who was arrested in Nakuru town. Consequently, Chief Magistrate Charles Obulutsa directed police to release the two. Haji said the investigations file indicated they were not involved in the killing. The DPP directed police to record statements from them as prosecution witnesses. The investigating officer John Wanyonyi presented the DPP report to Obulutsa when the two were presented to court after being held in custody for 14 days. “I direct that the two be released and the charges against them are withdrawn”, said Obulutsa. He said the court has considered DPP’s letter which indicates that the suspects will now be state witnesses. Loise was as a curriculum development officer with the Teachers Service Commission in Uasin Gishu County. Separately, a court in Eldoret began hearing the burial dispute over the body of Loise.
