The National Assembly's Public Accounts Committee will from tomorrow camp in Kisumu to write a report on how the government spent the budget for the 2014-15 financial year. PAC chairman Opiyo Wandayi yesterday said the team has concluded auditing the accounts for the year. Auditing of the expenditure for the 2015-16 financial year is 70 per cent complete. Only 17 departments have not appeared before the committee. "They are scheduled to appear in November and December," Wandayi said. The team will be in Kisumu until Sunday. The report is expected to be tabled in the House on November 13 when MPs return from a 10-day recess that begins tomorrow. National Assembly watchdog committee, PAC, has scheduled a three day retreat in Kisumu to write reports on how state departments spent billions of taxpayers’ money. The Committee responsible for examinations of the accounts of various ministries and government expenditure has concluded examining accounts for the fiscal year 2014/2015. The Committee has also finalized 70 percent of the 2015/2016 accounts and will finalise on the remaining 17 departments before the end of the year. “The respective accounting officers remaining are scheduled to appear before the Committee in November and December 2018. The resultant reports will be tabled for consideration by the House by 13th November 2018,” PAC chairman Opiyo Wandayi told Star yesterday. “We have worked tirelessly to clear the huge backlog of unexamined accounts we inherited from the last Parliament,” the Ugunja MP said.
