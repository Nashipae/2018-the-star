Abraham Kiptum has broken the men’s world record at the Daegu International half Marathon in Valencia in 58 minutes and 18 seconds. In the Sunday IAAF Gold Label road race, Kiptum took three seconds off the mark set by Eritrea's Zersenay Tadese in 2010. "Boosted by the crowd and fully aware that he was close to world record schedule, Kiptum kept on pushing hard to open a sizeable margin over the Ethiopian pair," IAAF said in a statement. "Kiptum strode home in 58:18 to bring the world record back to his country’s possession, Samuel Wanjiru being his predecessor in 2007 (58:35)," it added. Kiptum,27, had previously participated in the IAAF marathon in April where he emerged the winner in a record time of 2:06:29. Ethiopia’s Jemal Yimer was still just two seconds behind Kiptum, and his compatriot Abadi Hadi, the world cross-country bronze medallist, was in third, another second in arrears. Yimer also destroyed his previous career best of 59:00 as he was timed at 58:31 to move to third on the world all-time list while 21-year-old Hadis clocked 58:43, lowering his best by almost two minutes.
