The treason case against Ugandan lawmaker and musician, Robert
Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, and 34 of his co-accused has been
adjourned to 3 December. The government told the Magistrate’s
Court in northern Gulu that it needed more time to conclude its investigations before the
trial can begin. The accused were arrested following a by-election campaign in
the northern town of Arua in August and are alleged to have stoned President
Yoweri Museveni’s convoy. They deny the charges. Treason charges have been brought against Mr
Museveni’s political opponents in the past but the cases either drag on in
court or the charges are eventually dropped. At the last hearing in August, there were 33 people charged in
this case but since then two more of Bobi Wine’s associates have been added to
the charge sheet, making a total of 35 people. Click here for the latest political news
