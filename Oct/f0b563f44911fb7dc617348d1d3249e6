Poultry farmers have expressed concerns over alleged meat imports from the US. The farmers claimed about 20 tonnes of poultry meat originated from the US and was shipped to Zanzibar. “It was repackaged and rebranded before being brought to Kenya,” Association of Kenya Feed Manufacturers managing director Humphrey Mbugua said. Mbugua said the imports are hurting poultry farmers as they are selling at Sh200 and to breakeven, farmers need of sell at the lowest price of Sh250 per kilo. Mbugua said traders often use cold water or crushed ice instead of electrical cooling systems to preserve the imports. Constant alternate freezing and thawing, with inefficient cooling systems encourage microbial growth, leading to high incidences of food-borne diseases. But Agriculture CAS Andrew Tuimur yesterday said the ministry is unaware of any poultry products imports. He told the Star Kenya does not import any poultry or by products from the US and the ministry is investigating the matter. “So far, Kenya has allowed partial importation of eggs from a few companies in Uganda that meet the required standards. We also import from Tanzania,” Tuimur said. Director of Veterinary Services Obadiah Nyaga said the importation is not captured in their official system as it is required. He said they will meet today with farmers to get more details to help in the probe. The farmers worry that if this goes unchecked, it will set a precedence for more poultry imports from other countries.  “Outbreaks of avian influenza in many parts of the world should serve as a wake up call. Kenya should restrict importation of poultry and its products from these countries,” Francis Wanderi, from the Nairobi Poultry Breeders Association, said.
