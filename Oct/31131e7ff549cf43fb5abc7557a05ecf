Komo residents in Thika East have protested the deplorable state of roads. From Saturday, they barricaded the Komo-Githima-Munyu-Kang’oki road and disrupted transportation. The resumed the demos yesterday. They included boda boda riders, stones transporters and other traders. MP Patrick Wainaina called for calm and promised to have the road repaired in one week. The residents accused the Kiambu government of failing to repair the road. It is impassable because of huge potholes, yet the county collects levies from trucks and other motorists for maintenance, they said. “We’re tired of being deceived. The county government is only interested in levies while overlooking our plight. Enough is enough and no one will part with their cash until the roads are rehabilitated,” boda boda rider Geoffrey Chege said. They warned that many people are already suffering from respiratory ailments because of dust from the road. The area is known for quarries, which provide a lot of revenue for the county. Residents said more than 600 lorries transport stones from the area daily. Each lorry pays Sh500-1,000 to the county government, they said. Driver s Mathew Maina said they suffer huge losses to wear and tear. “Every week, drivers usually visit mechanics twice. We’ve played our part by paying the required levies,” he said.
