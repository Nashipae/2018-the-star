President Uhuru Kenyatta has banned the importation of fish from China. Uhuru said the Chinese fish was strangling the local market. He spoke on Tuesday at the Strathmore University during the 2018 SMEs conference. "I have been told about the imported fish from China. It is not possible that we import Chinese fish when our local traders are here," he said. Uhuru said though the Finance Bill 2018 was signed to law, it does not mean that imports be replaced with what is available in the local market. His sentiments come amidst public outcry over the unregulated importation of fish from China. In June this year, fishermen at Lake Naivasha said the foreign fish had flooded markets and called upon the government to intervene.

He said that there is no logical rationale for allowing the trade which has already affected the local fish market. “It will increase unemployment, poverty and inequality in the economies of counties like Kisumu that have traditionally depended on fishing fa or livelihood,” he said. Ranguma said more than 80,000 people are directly affected if the imports continue to flood the Kenyan market.

KNBS states that the total value of fish landed, which has been down for three consecutive years dropped from Sh24.5 billion in 2016 to Sh23.0 billion in 2017.
