Seven Bomet MPs on Monday walked out on President Uhuru Kenyatta after they were denied a chance to address a meeting presided over by the Head of State. Senator Christopher Langat and Woman Rep Joyce Korir led the lawmakers in the protest. Others are Nominated Senator Alice Milgo, MPs Ronald Tanui (Bomet Central), Beatrice Kones (Bomet East), Brighton Yegon (Konoin),Â and Gideon Koskei (Chepalungu). They accused Governor Joyce Laboso of failing to recognise them. Uhuru was in Bomet for the Lake Region Economic Block conference where 14 counties are participating. The dramatic event unfolded after Uhuru visited Bomet University College for the official opening of the institution's Green Tuition Block. The tuition block embraces all tenets of sustainable green environmental
conservation and is hailed as the only one of its kind in the region. It is said Laboso, who was presiding over the event, failed to give the leaders a chance to speak, hence the walk out from the regional economic bloc's meeting. In their protest, the legislators said they had pressing issues that they wanted to air for Uhuru and DP William Ruto to address. Among them was the Mau forest evictions and the sorry status of roads in the county. The legislators told journalists that they wanted the governor to explain why the university has taken so long to be completed. They accused the governor of having awarded the construction tender to a certain politician, hence wanted the president to intervene. On Sunday, Luhya politicians complained that their leaders were not recognised at the Mashujaa Day fete in Kakamega. Click here for the latest political news
