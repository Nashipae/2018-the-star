The government is seeking to hire a helicopter and a fixed-wing aircraft for Deputy President William Ruto. In a tender invitation in the local dailies, interested service providers may obtain tender documents from Harambee House Annex 1st Floor in person or against a written application. “A non-refundable fee of Sh1,000 is to be paid in cash before 4 pm on normal working days or in banker's cheque payable to the Principal Administrative Secretary in the Office of the Deputy President,” reads the advertisement.

The service provider must also have a bank statement indicating sound financial standing and adequate access to bank credit line. “The bid security of sh 500,000 which must be from an established bank or approved insurance company shall be valid for 150 days from tender opening date,” the advert states. The deadline for obtaining the tender documents is October 23, 2018, at 10 am. DP Ruto has previously been on the spot with a section of the press claiming he owns a fleet of helicopters and choppers. He has, however, refuted these reports, even once claiming that the chopper he frequently uses belongs to Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria.
