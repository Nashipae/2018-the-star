David Wakhu rallied from penultimate day fourth spot to win the Prime Bank Diani Beach Masters at Leisure Lodge in South coast yesterday. The Golf Park pro had his campaign effectively sewn up after day two leader Greg Snow faltered on the final round which was a Pro-Am. The coast event produced another last gasp dramatic performance from Wakhu, who won the second round of the Safari Tour at Nyali on the last day last month. Wakhu ended the Diani Beach Masters on a gross total of 4 over par 220 made up of 74, 74 and 71. The south coast event proved quite unforgiving for day one leader Justus Madoya, who managed fifth on 8 over par 328. Day two leader Snow’s round of 10 over par 82 dipped him to eighth overall. Dismas Indiza, who had earlier been tipped for victory shot a disappointing 3 over par 75 to settle for ninth. But ninth wasn’t that bad for Indiza who had to contend with 28th overall on day one. Wakhu’s victory earned him the top prize of Sh135,000. Windsor resident professional Rizwan Charania settled for second with a prize money of Sh90,000. Nyali resident professional NM Ngugi and Muthaiga’s Frank Matilo came in third to share a prize money of Sh69,750 each and a gross total of 6 over par 224 to boot. Madoya’s fifth spot earned him Sh63,000. Wakhu was all smiles after victory, saying: “A great day again in the coast and what an inspiring way to end the last day on a high. The game plan was keeping it on the fairways and putt with precision. It’s the second time in less than two months that I have taken the top prize on the last day.” Snow had taken over the lead at the penultimate round on Saturday despite a round of 1 over par 73 in the three day 54 hole competition. This saw day one leader, Madoya, dip to second position following a disappointing round of 3 over par 75 for a gross total of 146 on Saturday. Mumias long hitter, Indiza who finished day one in an unfamiliar 28th overall position survived the cut with a level par score on day two.
