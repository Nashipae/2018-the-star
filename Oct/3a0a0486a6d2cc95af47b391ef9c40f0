Kajiado County Commissioner David Kipkemei on Saturday cautioned hotel and lodge owners in Amboseli national park against admitting foreign guests without documenting them. Kipkemei also warned them against employing foreigners without requisite documents. He spoke at a public baraza at the border town of Rombo that borders Tanzania. “I know that the East African Charter is supposed to hold us together as a unit but at all times we all need to exercise caution. I am therefore instructing all foreigners who are working without permits to liaise with the offices of chiefs near them and notify them of their presence,” said Kipkemei. Kipkemei also ordered Assistant County Commissioner and Chiefs to close down illegal beer outlets. "It is regrettable that some children of this area have become drunkards yet their peers elsewhere are in schools developing their knowledge. Call me if you find out that our officers are not taking any action,” said the commissioner. Kipkemei at the same time directed the Sub-County Land Board not to approve any land transactions without full consent of family members. “I am shocked that there are several land cases among families which happened after either the children or the father sold land without the consent of all family members. This is unacceptable because it brings a lot of animosities,” said Kipkemei. Click here for the latest political news
