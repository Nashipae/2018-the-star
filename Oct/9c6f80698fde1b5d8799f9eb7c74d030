President Uhuru Kenyatta has asked politicians to end row on Ndakaini Water. Speaking in Makadara on Saturday, Uhuru said no one should politicize the sharing of natural resources. "Naomba viongozi wote, tuwache hii siasa ya maji. Maji ni kipeo kutoka kwa mwenyezi mungu kwa watu wake...," he said. (I beg all the leaders, stop politicising the issue of water. Water comes from God). Uhuru asked all leaders to come together so us to learn on how to share the resources. "Tunafaa tuje pamoja ili tujue vile tutaitumia hii maji kwa manufaa ya watu waKenya... hi rasilimali ni yetu wote," he said. (We need to come together so that we determine how to share what is there with all Kenyans) Last week, Nairobi governor Mike Sonko told Murang'a leaders to stop threatening to cut water supply from Ndakaini Dam. He said the county acquired the dam's 1,200 acres in 1988 and locals were compensated. Sonko was reacting to remarks by Murang'a governor Mwangi wa Iria who has demanded 25 per cent revenue from water supplied from the dam.
