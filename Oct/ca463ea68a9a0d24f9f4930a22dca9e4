Mandera East MP Omar Mohamed has dismissed claims security agencies have failed to secure the region. He said the officers have done a lot to restore order and curb runaway insecurity. He urged residents to maintain calm and avoid unnecessary criticism. The lawmaker spoke during Mashujaa Day celebrations in Mandera Stadium. He said al Shabaab militants have been changing tack and security officers have also had to use new strategies to tackle terrorism. Mohamed commented after other leaders used the event to hit out at security agents for laxity. They were legislators Adan Ali (Elwak), Bashir Abdullahi (Mandera North) and Aden Noor (Eala). They accused the government of surrendering to al Shabaab. Meanwhile, Abdullahi noted many residents survived by working in quarries and said banning stone mining has hurt their liveilhoods. “Over 2,000 miners, their families and transporters get their livelihood from the quarries. These families are now jobless. Let security chiefs provide security around the quarries,” he said. The government banned quarrying in September to prevent more deaths from terror attacks. More than 50 miners have been killed by the al Shabaab since 2014. Mohamed also took issues with the construction of the Kenya-Somalia border wall, saying the materials are substandard and will not keep out al Shabaab. “On Thursday, I’ll raise the concerns in the House to get answers and a way forward from the Ministry of Defence,” Mohamed said.
