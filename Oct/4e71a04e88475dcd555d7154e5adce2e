A Mombasa politician has criticisied Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa, saying she does not represent the image of Coast people. Jumwa, who supports Deputy President William Ruto’s bid for President in 2022, was accused of using derogatory and abusive language in public rallies. Political activist Abdulsalaam Kassim, who vied for the Mombasa senator seat on Jubilee ticket, said political leaders should be role models to the youth. “They have lost morals and are leading the youth astray,” he said. He spoke to the Star on Wednesday on the phone. He was responding to Jumwa’s words that “waists are used for other purposes”. He said the MP should apologise to the Jubilee leaders and the people of the Coast for damaging their reputation. “We see leaders standing on podia and use foul language. The bad thing is this foul language is repeated many times,” said Kassim. Jumwa spoke in Kwale last Saturday when Ruto toured the region. She said: “When we come here, we come for development. But there are other functions organised here where people come to politic while we are required to shake our waists. “The waists have their functions. We no longer shake them for people. We will only dance when there is development. If there is no development, I will keep my waist, there is someone who needs it.” Kassim said Jumwa was wrong to use that language in a public meeting. “What kind of respect is that? What dignity are you showing the DP? Leaders should not be laughing about this,” said Kassim. “This is no time for insults or negative criticism. It is time to build the country through development projects,” said Kassim. The former pugilist said: “It is very shameful that she spoke in front of the Deputy President. The other leaders at the podium were happy and laughing about it instead of rebuking it.” He said politicians, especially those in Jubilee or those supporting Jubilee, should cease using foul language in their speeches.
