SportPesa Premier League champions Gor Mahia bounced back to winning ways yesterday after thrashing Zoo Kericho 4-1 at Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos. Prior to the match, Gor had endured a four-match win-less streak, losing to Thika United, Ulinzi Stars, Vihiga United and drew Mathare United to collect a single point out of a possible 12. However, after being handed the trophy last week at Moi Stadium, Kisumu, Dylan Kerr charges seemed to have regained their championesque performance, serving Zoo with the heavy defeat to extend their unbeaten run over them since their elevation to the top flight last year. Former Sofapaka left-back Wesley Onguso launched Gor’s onslaught with a 15-minute opener. ‘Golden Boot’ chasing Michael Madoya replied for Zoo in the 32nd minute to take his tally to 14 goals—one shy of the leading duo of Erick Kapaito and Elvis Rupia. The goal by Madoya turned a mere consolation as Burundian forward Francis Mustafa restored Gor Mahia’s lead a minute later before Wellington Ochieng put the match beyond reach with the third goal four minutes later. After the break, Bernard Ondiek made it four for Gor in the 50th minute to hand K’ogallo the third win in the four matches they have played against Zoo since last year. Following the win Gor took their tally to 75 while Zoo remained 11th with 41 points and will be aiming to redeem themselves when they play Sofapaka in their final league match this weekend. On the other hand, Gor will be out to replicate the same performance when they play Tusker in their last match.
