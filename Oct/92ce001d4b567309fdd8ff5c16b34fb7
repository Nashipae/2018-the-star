A referendum should focus on IEBC reforms, improving governance and reducing the wage bill, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has said. In an advert yesterday, Mudavadi warned that some politicians were keen on hijacking the calls for law change to fulfill short-term interests. He called for caution. “Some people have rolled up their sleeves and thrown away their gloves and caution. They are now ready for a rough political contest disguised as a call for or against constitutional reforms,” Mudavadi said. There have been calls for an expanded Executive for more inclusivity in government to promote national cohesion. Mudavadi however wants the key issues be about bringing down the cost of living, achieving the contentious two-thirds gender rule and inclusion of marginalised groups. The former Deputy Prime Minister also wants the referendum question to include whether the presidential and parliamentary elections be separated. He asked Kenyans to consider whether to continue with a presidential system or move to a parliamentary system. “How do we make the Executive truly inclusive, without seeming to be creating short-term positions for some specific individuals?” he said. Mudavadi said the key concern should be on IEBC with the aim of resolving “contradictions” where the commission is also a player in elections. He said Kenyans should be asked whether they are comfortable with the integrity of the referee. Among his proposals to reduce wage bill include reducing the number of MPs and MCAs. He said issues like stalled police reforms, negative ethnicity, corruption, budget deficit, reckless borrowing and taxation can be resolved without a referendum.
