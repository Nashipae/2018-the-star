Iron deficiency is the biggest cause of increasing anaemia cases among Kenyan women. A report released by the Ministry of Health, the World Food Programme and Unilever shows one in four women of reproductive age suffers from iron deficiency. "The high cost of food explains why food insecure families are at a higher risk of anaemia. Readily available meals such as sukuma wiki can have added nutritional value when mixed with iron-rich foods such as spinach,” Dr Myriam Sidibe said.
