Senate Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen has backed DP William Ruto's claims of ODM scheming to destabilise the Jubilee party ahead of 2022. Murkomen said Raila Odinga's party wants to paint the DP in bad light while its members praise President Uhuru Kenyatta. The Elgeyo Marakwet Senator was responding to remarks by Minority Whip Junet Mohammed that "Ruto was using Raila as a scapegoat to leave Jubilee".

We've been reminded all the time that the handshake is about two people and the DP should not involve himself," he said on Monday. The legislator told journalists at Parliament Buildings on Monday that ODM was using the handshake to undermine the deputy president.

In apparent reference to Raila, the DP said the latter chased him away from ODM and has now followed him to Jubilee to do the same. Junet, however, said the deputy president has a history of ditching parties and should not try to pin his imminent exit on Raila or ODM. Murkomen, a key Ruto confidant, claimed that Raila hinted at the plan to wreck Jubilee during a recent meeting with Ford party leaders. "When he met the Ford leaders two weeks ago Raila said he would break Jubilee," the Senator said. The claims came in the wake of Siaya Senator James Orengo maintaining that Raila would contest the top seat in the 2022 elections. However, the ODM leader has steered clear of the discussion.
