Treasury CS Henry Rotich has asked counties to pay suppliers and contractors more than Sh30 billion owed to them. He said counties had by June 30 received money for the suppliers and contractors but some of the regions were withholding the money. Rotich said some counties had taken long to audit pending bills causing delayed payments for those owed for work done more than a year ago. “The counties should not use the auditing exercise to withhold the money longer. Pay up those owed to help the economy grow faster,” he said in Eldoret on Saturday. Rotich said the national government would also clear its bills giving priority to groups formed by youth, women and people living with disabilities. Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry chairman Kiprono Kittony said failure by the government to pay suppliers and contractors was stifling many economic activities. “The suppliers and contractors invested their own money in some of these projects and services rendered and when they are not paid, the economy does not move because there is little money in circulation,” he said. Kittony said a weak economy can lead to increased crime as some people turn to crime to make a living. Rotich said the government was aware of the harsh economic situation currently and would make efforts to clear the pending bills. Some governors in the North Rift have blamed the national government for the pending bills, saying it failed to release money on time. Uasin Gishu governor Jacskon Mandago said his county has Sh320 million debts and pending bills.
