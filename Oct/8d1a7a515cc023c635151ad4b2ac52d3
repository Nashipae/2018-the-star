The Kenya Rugby Union has changed the player transfer window and scheduling of the local rugby calendar. Director of Rugby Thomas Odundo said the new season will start with the national sevens circuit in July and end with the 15s season. Previously the season used to start with the 15s season, the Kenya Cup in November, and end with the national sevens circuit in September . The new move will take effect from next season. Consequently, the transfer window will shift accordingly to align to the new season. It will now open at the end of the 15s season until two weeks to the start of the Sevens circuit .According to regulation 11 of the season, Article 11.1. states: “a season shall commence with the first date of the national Sevens circuit and end on the date of the last KRU fifteen-a-side competition, from the 2018-2019 season until a variation is made by the KRU board.” “All these changes have been agreed upon and will take effect from next season. The new regulation has already been shared out with clubs and will take effect at the end of this season,” said Odundo The transfer season for next year will open on May 19. The current transfer window opened last month, right after Christie Sevens, the sixth and final leg of the national Sevens circuit and will close on November 3, two weeks to the new season. Elsewhere, former Kenya Cup champions Nakuru RFC will play three build up matches as well play at the Impala Floodlit tournament next month. The Wanyore are expected to face Homeboyz, rivals Menengai Oilers and Kabras. Head coach Mitch Ocholla is targeting to get the Rift Valley-based side back to the playoffs after missing out in the last two seasons . “The play-off remains our main target but we will review it once we get there,” said Ocholla.
