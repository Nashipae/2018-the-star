Migori governor Okoth Obado has filed a fresh petition for review of his bail application, saying he needs special medical attention. Obado has been charged with the murder of his pregnant lover Sharon Otieno and has been in remand since September 21. Lawyer Roger Sagana, who filed the application under a certificate of urgency, said Obado is unwell. The governor said he suffers from severe back problem known as a nerve compression. He said the problem began in 2013. Obado said he has always been under special care of a doctor called Prof Ating’a to manage the condition. “This condition adversely affected my ability to stand for long hours. Since my condition has not been attended to for the period I have been in custody, the complication aggravated and I was taken ill on September 29. I was subsequently admitted at Kenyatta National Hospital but my condition has not improved,” he said. Obado first made an application for bail pending trial on September 25. Two days later, justice Jessie Lessit disallowed his application, saying the prosecution had not supplied all the witness statements and evidence. The court said it can consider the application only after committal bundles have been supplied. Obdao said parties were supplied with the bundles on October 3, and that he was at liberty to make a fresh bail application. The governor said it was not permissible for the prosecution or the victims to punish him through denial of bail. Read: Obado safe after stomachache scare Click here for the latest political news
