A medic yesterday told a Kisumu court that there was evidence of penetration in a case in which a six-month-old baby is alleged to have been defiled. Suspect Joseph Ochieng was charged with defiling the baby in April. Doctor Eugene Ochieng of Kisumu County Hospital examined the baby. He said in the P3 form that tests confirmed blood presence in the virginal canal and a watery discharge. His report however says that the baby’s head, neck, thorax, abdomen and lower and upper limbs were normal because she had been washed before she was presented to the hospital. Eugene said a blunt weapon was used. Defence lawyer Charles Onyango took Ochieng to task to explain the contradicting reports in the police medical examination report form (P3) and the post-rape care form presented before the court as part of evidence. “How is it possible that you came to a conclusion that there was evidence of penetration, yet the PRC form highlighted that the baby’s hymen was intact,” he asked. The doctor said he gave the conclusion after examining the baby days later. He said the baby was admitted when he was not on duty and was handled by another officer. “The PRC form was prepared by my colleague who was in charge over the weekend and she is the one who can explain the results on the form,” the medic said. Earlier, the baby’s mother wept as she narrated the ordeal her child allegedly underwent at the hands of her neighbour and friend. She said she left the baby with the suspect after breakfast as she proceeded to her rice farm. The hearing will continue on November 1. Click here for the latest political news
