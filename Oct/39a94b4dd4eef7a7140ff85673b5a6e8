Cases of traffic jams and congestion in Nairobi City could be a thing of the past after a committee formed to look on how to solve the congestion issues began its work. The move will ease traffic on various roads leading to the CBD. This emerged when the new Nairobi County Transport and Safety Commitee met stakeholders in the transport sector on a new plan on easing traffic in the city. Addressing the press after a three-day meeting in Naivasha, Infrastructure executive Mohammed Dagane said they are determined to end the snarlups. The committee brings together representatives from NTSA, the traffic department and PSV owners and was part of the larger Nairobi regeneration committee. “We are working to ensure we have a new Bus Rapid Transport system by December 12 this year and this will help in decongesting the city off traffic,” he said. More than 300,000 private vehicles and 40,000 motorcycles go to the city daily and Dagane said the county is working in how to reduce the number. Nairobi Bus Transporters chairman Edwin Mukabana welcomed the idea to decongest the city describing it as long overdue. He said though they were initially opposed to the idea with the thought of losing business, they had seen it was for the best.
