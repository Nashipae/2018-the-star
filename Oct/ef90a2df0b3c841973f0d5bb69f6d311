Northeastern leaders will only support a constitutional review if it doesn’t weaken devolution, Garissa governor Ali Korane has said. Calls for a referendum on the Constitution have gained momentum, with ODM leader Raila Odinga championing the cause. Some leaders want the number of lawmakers, counties and constituencies reduced, saying a bloated government is a burden to taxpayers. But Korane said on Saturday that the region has benefited significantly from allocations to the counties. Residents have got much-needed economic relief, he said during Mashujaa Day celebrations at Garissa Primary School. “The 2010 Constitution brought us the devolved units, which have brought a lot that we couldn’t get since Kenya got its independence. “We don’t want any referendum that will interfere with the counties,” Korane said. He called for public participation to ensure any changes proposed consider the interests of all regions. Fafi MP Abdikarim Osman and Woman Representative Anab Gure and national and county officers attended the function. County commissioner Joshua Chepchieng warned those instigating violence between Garissa and Isiolo communities that they will face the law. He called for lasting solutions to border conflicts. Last week, an elderly man was killed while herding goats in Barquqe in Lagdera subcounty. “Peace is cultivated by the people. The work of the police is to restore order. Elders from both sides should spearhead peace-building initiatives,” he said.
