Wajir East MP Rashid Kassim has cautioned a section of politicians against exploiting the handshake for expediency. The MP said a few selfish politicians want to hijack the process and turn it into a 2022 succession campaign tool. The MP who was speaking in Wajir town Wednesday. He said the March 9 handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga was well structured with terms of reference and goals. “We are closely watching the political arena. One thing is clear — it is no longer about the handshake but 2022 succession,” Kassim said. The Wiper legislator said the handshake is is being exploited to threaten the independence of the Parliament. It has hurt the opposition, he said. “There needs to be clear separation of powers between the Executive and Parliament to enable checks and balances to prevail. We risk missing the whole point, due to the much hyped handshake,” he added. Kassim cited the recent chaotic passing of the Finance Bill, including eight per cent VT on petroleum products by the National Assembly. He said it was driven by partisan interests, not people’s interests.
