Property worth millions was destroyed on Friday evening after a fire broke out at a godown along Moi Avenue in Mombasa. The Mamujee Hardware and General Stores, which deals with paints and building materials, is next to Autoport Container Freight Station. The latter is owned by Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho’s family. Initially, there was panic that the CFS could have been part of the burning building. Firefighters from the Kenya Navy, Mombasa county, Kenya Ports Authority, and private firm Jeffery Foundation battled the huge inferno for close to three hours. KPA and Mombasa county government had two fire engines each while Kenya Navy and Jeffery Foundation dispatched one each. However, the six fire engines were forced to make many trips to collect water for use in fighting the intense flames. By the time of going to press, the fire fighters were still battling with the inferno. Mombasa county commander Johnstone Ipara led the operation and said he would give an update on the incident. General Service Unit and the Administration Police officers assisted the teams in handling crowds that formed around the Mamujee Hardware and General Stores. Click here for the latest political news
