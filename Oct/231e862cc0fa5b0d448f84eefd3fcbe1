Nyeri governor Mutahi Kahiga yesterday urged counties to focus on internal revenue generation to support development. He spoke after signing the Finance Bill into law. It will enable the county to collect revenue. The bill had been delayed for three to four years. The governor was accompanied by other county officers, including county assembly leaders. Kahiga said the new law will identify more than 73 revenue streams, accruals from penalties and outstanding fees. Focus areas include parking fees, hospital charges and land rates. The county is revaluing property to help it determine new rates. In the current budget, the county targets Sh1 billion local revenue. Kahiga said the county will have to raise an extra Sh180 million to cater for the Sh160 million lost after the recent budget cuts by the national government. Nyeri has to meet its goals and spend its cash prudently, hence, the need to strengthen revenue collection, he said. The county will hire 30 more revenue collectors. “We thank the people of Nyeri because in the year gone by, they’ve been able to raise the revenue from Sh630 million to Sh730 million,” the county boss said. “We’ve continued to say that Nyeri is a corruption-free county. We want to spend wananchi’s money the way it should be spent.” Seven county employees were recently charged with corruption in Karatina, Mathira, and Mweiga, Kieni.
