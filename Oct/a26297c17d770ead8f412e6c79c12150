A government plane carrying Melania Trump was forced to turn around Wednesday and return to an air base in Maryland after smoke filled the cabin. Secret Service agents leapt from their seats 10 minutes into a morning flight and ran to the front of the aircraft. Reporters on board said they were told a 'mechanical' issue caused the scare. No one was hurt but the first lady didn't reach her destination. She was headed to Philadelphia to address a hospital conference on neonatal abstinence syndrome, a condition that strikes infants who experience withdrawal from their mothers' use of narcotics while pregnant. A press pool reporter on board said journalists 'could see a thin haze of smoke and smell something burning. The smell quickly became stronger.' A crew member told the reporter that a 'malfunctioning comms unit' was to blame. The White House has not confirmed any details. Melania's flight returned to Joint Base Andrews and landed safely at 9:05 a.m. A spokeswoman for the first lady couldn't immediately be reached for comment. The plane was a C-32, the military's version of the Boeing 757-200, and seats 45 people in First Class-style seats. It's the same aircraft that took the first lady to Africa this month, and is routinely used as  'Air Force Two' when Vice President Mike Pence travels outside Washington. On occasion it has also been used as a more compact version of Air Force One when presidents, including Donald Trump, fly to airports whose runways are too short to safely land the more familiar 747.
