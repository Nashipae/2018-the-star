The
Kenya Film Commission on Wednesday unveiled the 2018 nominees for the
Kalasha Film and TV Awards at Prestige Cinema, Prestige Plaza. The award gala will be held on November 24. Some 140 nominees will be competing in 32 categories, including Special Awards, which are Kituo Halisi supported by Communications Authority of Kenya, Watershed Compliant Station and Lifetime Achievement Award. The awards are an initiative of the Kenya Film Commission, which seeks to recognise talent in the different facets of film and TV. Central to the commission’s mandate is the promotion of a
vibrant local film industry. “By recognising our own level of
excellence and the achievements of our film practitioners, we set
benchmarks for future film-makers and encourage the expansion of the
industry,” says KFC acting CEO Timothy Owase. Nomination Academy chair Dr Zippora Okoth says the
quality of submissions this year is "much higher".
