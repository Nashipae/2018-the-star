The Rwandan government is set to grant Mount Kenya University’s Kigali campus a charter to operate as a full-fledged national private institution. The charter comes after a year-long wait. The university had applied to be accredited in 2017 after completion of a new campus a year before. “Reference is made to the assessment conducted by a team constituted by the Higher Education Council (HEC) to assess the readiness of MKU, Kigali, to change its status to the proposed Mount Kenya International University of Technology,” executive director of the Higher Education Council Emmanuel Muvunyi said on Friday. The move will be a relief to students who have in the past been travelling all the way to Thika for their graduation. Founder Simon Gicharu said the move had been necessitated by the need to overcome cross-border challenges in running the university. “With the growing number of students now at 600, we thought it would be wise to make MKU Rwanda, autonomous to serve them better. And the government of President Paul Kagame continues to be very supportive. We thank him for this,” he said. MKU was in 2016 rated the best among Kenyan universities in Rwanda. The university emerged position 11 out of 29 among universities that were ranked by the Rwanda’s higher education body, with 380 marks out of 1,000. MKU scored 88 on physical and academic infrastructure; 87 on faculty, research, consultancy and other programmes; 75 on admission, curriculum and delivery systems, and on industry interface it got 129.
