Police in Karatina are holding two Kirinyaga County Government officials for allegedly demanding and receiving a bribe. The two are Samuel Mwangi Mureithi, the Kirinyaga Central Director of liquor licensing and Joseph Mureithi Njeru, the Kirinyaga Central sub-county Administrator. Detectives from the Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission arrested the officials on Saturday night for allegedly demanding and receiving Sh300,000 from a trader as a precondition to issue him with a liquor licence. The detectives swung into action following a complaint from the businessman. They laid a trap and arrested the two officials in a Hotel in Karatina town, Nyeri County. "The trader complained to us on Thursday that the two officials were demanding for a bribe in order to issue him with the licence," Central region EACC manager Charles Rasugu said. He said investigations are ongoing and the suspects will be arraigned soon to answer to corruption and economic crimes-related offences. Click here for the latest political news
