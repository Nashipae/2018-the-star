Nyandarua assembly speaker Wahome Ndegwa has trashed a letter directing changes on Jubilee Party house leadership. He said on Wednesday he could not communicate content of a letter sent by secretary general Raphael Tuju, as it was not binding on him. On October 3, Tuju summoned 36 Jubilee MCAs to come up with a way forward after Ndegwa declined to recognise new leaders elected at a Nakuru hotel in September. In an October 5 letter, Tuju informed Ndegwa the party had agreed on Wambugu King’ori as majority leader and Justus Gaita as his deputy. Wangari Methu was to take over as chief whip and Ken Mukira as deputy whip. Some members opposed admission of the letter. Kipipiri MCA Isaac Kung’u said the party can only communicate through its leaders, not directly to the speaker. On Wednesday, Ndegwa concurred. He said he was guided by the precedents set in similar situations by Parliament speakers Francis Kaparo (former) and Justin Muturi.
