Siaya Senator James Orengo has dismissed claims that the referendum is about creating posts in the executive. Addressing journalists in Rarieda, Orengo asked those spreading rumors about the introduction of many positions in case of a referendum to stop misleading the country. He clarified that the referendum is about creating harmony and unity in the country after every election period. The Siaya senator said the push for a referendum to introduce a parliamentary system does not mean that there must be a prime minister as some leaders think. "In South Africa, there is a parliamentary system but there is no slot of a prime minister, and that is why those opposing the referendum because of the introduction of the new position must be advised," Orengo said. The Senate minority leader insisted that the war on corruption cannot be realized with a pure presidential system in a country where checks and balance need to be enhanced. Orengo said in many countries where there is regional and community tension, parliamentary system is always the best option to address any tension, especially with the set up of the winner, takes it all. He said if the referendum can create a room where everybody comes together in harmony and unity after elections then that is the way to go. "We must have unity in the governance of the nation with or without elections," Orengo said. He said those opposing the referendum move have not been enlightened on how the constitution review will open their democratic space. "Many countries have embraced constitutional review through the referendum and some leaders should not make it appear as if it's exceptional to our country," he added. Orange was optimistic that with some community and regions supporting the referendum the change will be realised.
