Nairobi governor Mike Sonko yesterday told off politicians using water resources to gain political mileage. He said some politicians from ‘neighbouring counties’ are threatening to interfere with supply of water to Nairobi. “No one can pretend to own water resources. Water is a national resource and Nairobi is the capital city of Kenya,” Sonko said. He spoke at Jamhuri grounds during the Nairobi International Trade Fair. Sonko said the Nairobi government is legally in possession of the land title deed of Ndakaini Dam, which is among the sources of water for the capital city. He said his administration will strive to ensure water supply to the city is improved to end cases of water rationing. “President Uhuru Kenyatta has cemented his legacy of uniting Kenyans after the handshake. We won’t allow politicians to use divisive politics,” Sonko said. Read: Sonko to Wa Iria: 'Nairobi owns Ndakaini Dam, stop threats of shutdown' Click here for the latest political news
