More than 500 community health workers are going door-to-door to recruit 400,000 residents into the National Hospital Insurance Fund under the universal health care plan. The recruitment drive will take three months. Health executive Ruth Koech said on Monday that the county is partnering with Pharm Access Foundation to establish a digital health platform. She spoke at her office during a meeting with NHIF regional manager Valentine Morogo and Kapsabet branch manager Hussein Dore. The NHIF has picked Nandi among five counties where the universal health care recruitment is being piloted. The others are Kisumu, Machakos, Isiolo, and Nyeri. "The county aims to use the digital platform that includes M-TIBA, a mobile health app, to document new and old members in the system in a cost-effective and transparent way," Koech said. The move is part of the Big Four agenda, which includes universal healthcare. North Rift counties  are setting up a cancer register to track the disease after more than 5,000 new cases were diagnosed in eight counties this year. Health officials are partnering with the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital to collect the required data. About 30 new cases are diagnosed every month in Nandi.
