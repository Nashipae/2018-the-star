Good Morning. As students prepare for this year's examination, the government has come up with measures to deal with cheats as fake papers hit the market. The Ministry of Education has already identified cartels that are behind the fake papers and urged parents not to engage with them. On another day that the weatherman tells Kenyans to expect rains across the country, here are the stories making headlines in the Star this Tuesday morning. How Statehouse stopped arrest and prosecution of Wario in 2016 The arrest and prosecution of three top athletics officials over the Sh55 million Rio Olympics scandal came as a surprise to the suspects. They believed the matter had been sorted in December 2016. Former DPP Keriako Tobiko had directed then DCI Muhoro Ndegwa to arrest and prosecute former Sports CS Hassan Wario and PS Richard Ekai over the scandal after investigations were completed. At the time, only the two officials were to be charged. Highly placed sources familiar with the investigations told the Star that a top State House official stopped the arrest and prosecution of Wario and Ekai. The reason was the fear of possible political repercussions coming so close to the general elections. _____________________________________________________ Government moves to ensure cheat free exams The Ministry of Education has threatened to withdraw the certificates of parents who aid their children in cheating by buying them fake examination papers. Education PS Belio Kipsang told a stakeholders’ forum in Nairobi on Monday that parents are the problem since they are the ones who part with as much as Sh90,000 to buy fake examination papers for their children. Education CS Amina Mohammed said the ministry has identified cartels behind the sale of fake examination papers to unsuspecting parents and candidates. She promised to engage the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions, Attorney General, and Interior Ministry to deal with the culprits. _____________________________________________________ State mulls adopting Blockchain for affordable housing The government plans to use blockchain technology to deal with allocation and funds management of the cheaper 500,000 housing units. The agenda will be financed by National Housing Fund under Finance Act 2018 with a three per cent contribution by employers and employees, borrowing, issuance of asset-backed securities to investors and rental revenue from current available housing stock. The tax deductions are set to begin this month. Housing and Urban development PS Charles Hinga said the fund to will raise Sh6 billion a month translating to Sh55 billion a year to unlock the supply side of projects. _____________________________________________________ DP Ruto says its him who can deliver Luhyas in government in 2022 Deputy President William Ruto has said he has the capacity to deliver Luhyas in government in 2022 and the region should back his bid to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta. While presiding over a funds drive in aid of Matungu women groups, Ruto asked ANC and Ford Kenya members to switch camp and work with him instead of being professional opposition. Ruto said that the community had lagged behind by being in the opposition and they ought to stop supporting the NASA coalition under Raila Odinga. This comes as the Ford Kenya brigade in the region fought off claims that they had decided to work with Ruto ahead of 2022. _____________________________________________________ Why I abandoned degree for mitumba business – graduate Selling second-hand clothes might not be a dream job for many graduates today. In fact, many view it as a job for the uneducated. This, even as 50 per cent of the jobless 1.4 million Kenyans who make up the country’s labour force attribute their state of joblessness to few job opportunities in the market, as reported in Brighter Monday’s Kenya Job Market Report 2017. One graduate who has embraced mitumba is Grace Wambere, a Bachelor of Arts graduate in Information Technology from the University of Frankfurt in Germany. Wambere, a mother of two, has been selling mitumba clothes for the last five years. Pregnancy and unfair competition from the IT industry pushed her to Gikomba market. _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
