They pounced on the suspect at 5am. "We are linking with our colleagues in Voi to establish at what point the driver was separated from the vehicle with intend to find out whether it was a plan to steal the goods," said Napeiyan. He said the driver of the lorry claimed the ambush happened at a bushy area near Voi when he was inspecting the tires. Police are investigating to find out whether the driver was part of the gang.
