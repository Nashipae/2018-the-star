Top 14 county teams have been selected to participate in the upcoming Inter-Region Economic Network Technologies and Innovation Challenge Trade Expo.The evaluation started last week and was concluded on Thursday. Those that emerged tops demonstrated a high level of initiative and drive to fix county problems in the Lake Region Economic Bloc.Member counties are Bomet, Bungoma, Busia, Homa Bay, Kakamega, Kericho, Kisii, Kisumu, Migori, Nyamira, Nandi, Siaya, Trans Nzoia and Vihiga. The ITIC-2018 Expo set for November 29 in Kisumu will feature key solutions developed by the 14 hubs of three-five members from the initial 28. Each county solution hub was tasked to come up with technologies and innovations relevant to their immediate food security challenges.All participating hub members went through a six-month mentorship programme to identify the challenge in their county, conceptualise a viable solution, work as a team to actualise the solution and develop a prototype.“We congratulate the 14 county solution hubs that have emerged tops. We welcome more partners to join the initiative and expand the solution offer to the counties,” Veni Swai, senior programme officer for Friedrich Naumann Foundation, East Africa, said.The solutions included one for pest control, cereal driers, a tomato processor and storage units to prevent post-harvest losses. Some on-farm initiatives include a solar-powered water pump, a weeding machine that doubles up as a grain processor, an improved knapsack and a machine that manufactures fertiliser from eggshells. Others are a solar powered poultry hatchery and a portable dairy feed maker. Some digital platform initiatives included Mfugo Bora, Mkulima Voice and Mfood to link actors along the agribusiness value chain.The 14 groups will showcase and pitch their innovations to development partners, government, educational institutions, for-profit organisations, farmer associations, traders’ associations and investors.
