National team, Harambee Stars have risen two places in the latest Fifa world rankings released yesterday. Stars rose to 105 after collecting crucial points against Ethiopia in their ongoing Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. They drew 0-0 away in Addis Ababa and won the return leg 3-0 in Nairobi on October 10 and 14 respectively. Stars are top of Pool ‘F’ with seven points and may gain an automatic qualification to the continental finals should Fifa uphold their decision to bar Sierra Leone from playing in the qualifiers. Other countries constituting the pool include Ghana, who dropped a place to 53rd after being out of action during the Fifa international break as they await Fifa’s verdict on the Sierra Leone impasse. Sierra Leone are ranked 115th while Ethiopia are 150th. Regionally, Uganda reigned supreme again, moving four places up to 79th, thanks to their home and away wins over Lesotho, who left them a point shy of sealing a place at next year’s tournament. Kenya are second while Tanzania, who posted mixed results in their double encounter against Cape Verde, are third after scaling four places to 136. Tanzania lost 2-0 away to the Islanders but avenged the defeat in an identical margin in the return match. Rwanda plummeted a slot down to 138 while Burundi were the best movers regionally as they shot six places to 142. Continentally, Tunisia are ranked the best at 22nd globally, while Senegal (25), Nigeria (44), Congo DRC (46) and Morocco (47) complete the best five. Reigning champions Cameroon are 51st while African giants Ivory Coast and Algeria are 64th and 67th respectively. After gaining their maiden qualification to the Afcon, Madagascar are placed 100th. Globally, Belgium maintained the top spot while champions France are second. Five time champions Brazil are third as beaten world cup finalists Croatia and England wrap the top five.
