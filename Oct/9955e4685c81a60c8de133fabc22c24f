Good Morning. On Sunday, Harambee Stars enhanced their chances of qualifying to the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations finals with a convincing 3-0 win over Ethiopia at Kasarani Stadium. Today, eyes are again on the courts with Citizen TV journalist Jacque Maribe and her fiance Joseph ‘Jowie’ Irungu expected to take a plea to the charge of murdering Monica Kimani. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this Monday morning. Poll: Youths opposed to calls for law review A new survey shows a majority of Kenyans, particularly the youth, are opposed to calls for a referendum even as a constitution review debate rages. It further reveals that a majority of NASA supporters, 63.2 percent, are against the proposed review. Only 36.8 per cent back the proposal. In Jubilee, 54.9 per cent oppose the calls, but a significant 45.1 per cent think its time for a review. Among opposition supporters, Moses Wetang'ula’s Ford Kenya leads with 84.6 per cent opposed to calls for constitutional changes. More Wiper supporters than ODM, the poll showed, were in support for the referendum at 60 per cent and 56.5 per cent respectively. _____________________________________________________ Corruption biggest concern for Kenya, Radio Africa Survey Corruption is the biggest challenge facing Kenyans today, latest survey by Radio Africa Group has revealed. According to the study, 39.7 per cent of Kenyans cited corruption as the leading social economic challenge; followed closely by the high cost of living at 30.7 per cent. Kenyans’ concern about corruption should perhaps worry President Uhuru Kenyatta who in September an all-out war on the vice that Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) estimates take away at least Sh600 billion of the country’s budget every year. _____________________________________________________ Kidero wants EACC investigator held liable for perjury Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has applied to the court to have Mulki Abdi Umar - an EACC investigator, punished for lying under oath. Under a certificate of urgency, the governor has asked the court to also declare the EACC seizure of his property illegal and unconstitutional on grounds of perjury. He says Umar lied to the court by linking him to property that he doesn't own and wants the claims struck out as well as expunged from court records. Kidero avers in the yesterday's application that the EACC investigator, who is an advocate of the High Court, had knowingly sworn an affidavit with claims she cannot prove. _____________________________________________________ Requiem mass for 30 Kericho bus crush to be held in Kakamega on Wednesday A joint requiem mass for 30 victims of the Fort Ternan bus crush from Kakamega county will be held on Wednesday. The Wednesday dawn crush of the Kakamega bound Homeboyz bus claimed 56 lives and left 15 others admitted in various hospitals with serious injuries. The county government will meet the cost of the funeral arrangements. The mass will be held at Amalemba grounds in Kakamega town. A member of the county funeral committee Dick Rayori said that the county the committee will purchase coffins in Kisumu today as the caskets available in Kakamega were not enough. _____________________________________________________ Poaching of 55 elephants daily leaves extinction a decade away As world leaders and conservationists descended on London last week for the Illegal Wildlife Trafficking Conference, the burning question in their minds was: How can trade in ivory, especially in Asian countries be contained? The fear is that Africa’s elephants could go the way of dinosaurs. Some 20,000 jumbos are killed each year — 55 every single day — mostly for the illegal ivory trade. The war on the illicit trade was dealt a blow on February 4, when ivory researcher Esmond Martin, who had authored several investigative reports on rhino and ivory smuggling in Kenya and the trade in China, Vietnam, and Laos, was found murdered in his Karen home in Nairobi. Speaking at the conference, First Lady Margaret Kenyatta said Kenya has recorded a significant decline in poaching due to its enhanced wildlife law enforcement efforts and the government’s proactive anti-poaching measures. _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
