Voting in Migori's Senate by-election ended at 5 pm in all the 826 polling stations. Counting is underway. The by-election was however characterised by low voter turn out. Among the centres that recorded low turnout was Rapogi Primary School in Uriri constituency where governor Okoth Obado would have cast his vote. Obado is in custody in relation to a murder case of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno. Villagers at the center which is only meters away from Obado’s rural home were glued to their television sets following court proceedings in Nairobi.

Before his arrest, Obado had broken ranks with ODM leader Raila Odinga and the party candidate Ochillo Ayacko. He instead threw his weight being Federal Party of Kenya candidate Eddy Oketch who also hails from Kanyamkago clan in Uriri. Nominated Senator Rose Nyamunga who accompanied Rongo MP Paul Abuor in his constituency said by 1pm the area had 40 per cent turnout but expected more.
