 The Homa Bay county assembly was closed indefinitely yesterday after members engaged in fistfights over the leadership of the house. Speaker Elizabeth Ayoo ordered closure, citing persistent wrangles by members allied to different factions. “Due to the ongoing wrangles and insecurity of members within the assembly precincts, the assembly stands adjourned indefinitely,” the memo reads. The assembly was resuming sittings following a recess. But members from the two factions were engaged in physical and verbal fights from as early as 8am. Police lobbed teargas after youths stormed the assembly. The youths claimed they wanted to protect the office of the majority leader, which is at the centre of the wrangles. A security guard told the Star some youths entered the assembly as early as 5am. Kanyidoto MCA Walter Muok is fighting to replace his Kwabwai counterpart Richard Ogindo as the Majority leader. Chaos erupted after women MCAs led by Joan Ogada and Monoflorita Ondiek started shouting, saying they will not allow their colleagues to remove Ogindo from his position. They confronted their counterparts allied to Muok. The melee that lasted three hours ended with the closure of the assembly. “We had to arrive here very early so they don’t deny us access to the assembly premises,” Ogada said. MCAs threw stones at assembly staff who opposed the violence. Police officers from Kendu Bay, Rangwe, Ndhiwa and Mbita stations were called for reinforcements. Standard Group journalist James Omoro was injured by a police officer during the fracas. County police commander Marius Tum said they were investigating.
