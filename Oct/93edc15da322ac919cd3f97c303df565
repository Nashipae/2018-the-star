Police in Kajiado have arrested a watchman at Bissil Girls' secondary school after an attempt to sneak in some examination documents. The guard was arrested on Monday and handed over to the DCI. He reportedly tried to sneak the fake papers to a form four student. Kajiado Central deputy county commissioner Charles Wambugu said the student, who was to receive the documents, will also be required to record a statement. "The suspect told the police he was handed the documents to deliver to the candidate." "The police are tracking down the person who handed the papers to the watchman," Wambugu told the Star on the phone. The administrator said the watchman was arrested at about 10pm adding that the girl in question will record a statement as soon as she is through with KCSE. "We do not want to instill fear or interrupt her concentration as the exams are still ongoing," Wambugu said. Meanwhile, Kajiado county commissioner David Kipkemei on Tuesday night rescued a KCPE candidate hours after being married off in Mailwa, Matapato South ward. The commissioner said the pupil was noted missing after she missed exam rehearsals at Mailwa primary school examination centre on Monday. "We received a tip-off from her parents' neighbours of the development. The man who had supposedly married the 14-year-old girl escaped," Kipkemei said. He said the girl's parents also escaped the police dragnet. "I am happy to report that we managed to secure her and she is now sitting her Class 8 examination at the school," the administrator said. Earlier, Immigration PS Gordon Kihalangwa officiated the opening of the examination papers in Kajiado. He assured the stakeholders of security.
