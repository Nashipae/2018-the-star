The Kamba community at the Coast will on Saturday meet to discuss their unity. An agreement will allow them to make political deals with other communities in 2022. They will seek social and economic relations. Kamba political leaders chairman John Mutema said lack of a common voice has cost them. “We are yet to know if the community will field a candidate,” he said. Organising secretary James Muuda said Kambas have always been portrayed as divided at local and national levels. “We will challenge our governors to avoid divisive politics,” Muuda said on Sunday at a press conference in Mombasa. The outfit’s patron, Lawrence Kisiilu, said most Kambas depend on clearing and forwarding business that has been affected by the standard gauge railway. “Because we had no common stand, we are suffering the effect of this train. We have lost business,” he said. Such meetings have been held nationally by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka. Recently, Kalonzo led members to present their demands to President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House, Nairobi. Among the issues they wanted addressed are infrastructure development and market for their local products. In Mombasa, Kambas have only two elected MCAs, despite being the second-most largest community. In April, Ukambani leaders met to chart Kalonzo’s future in Nasa. Politicians, religious leaders, professionals and residents of Machakos, Kitui and Makueni counties attended. Former Machakos senator Johnson Muthama said they were keen on plotting their political future like any other community. “Our meeting is like those that have been held in other parts of the country,” he had said. Muthama said they would push for a situation where a party attracts all Kenyans as a way out of the divisions spurred by ethnic biases.
