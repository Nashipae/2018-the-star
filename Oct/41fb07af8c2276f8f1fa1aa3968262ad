The hearing of a case involving former chief government pathologist Moses Njue has been adjourned to today.  He is accused of stealing the heart of a deceased man. The hearing was pushed after his lawyer urged the court to adjourn the case because the prosecution had not supplied the accused with witness statements.  In August, the hearing failed to kick off because the magistrate handling it was on leave.  State Prosecutor Anthony Musyoka opposed the application, saying the prosecution had three witnesses in court from Nairobi and ready for the hearing. Meru chief magistrate Hannah Ndungâ€™u ordered the case hearing to start tomorrow.
