Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has identified 58 properties which he wants EACC barred from investigating in his graft case. The ex-county boss, in a notice of motion, says he acquired the said properties (all developed) before becoming Nairobi governor. In Nairobi, Kidero wants Gem Apartments in LR 21/1/36 sparred saying he bought it in 2011. He has also named apartment No. A7
on LR is 991/13 and apartment No. B6 on LR Number is 991/17 bought in 1995. Kidero
also wants a property situated in Gigiri road whose LR Number is
7258/48 not subjected to the probe saying he acquired it in 2002. He also wants Block 91/156 also in Gigiri sparred from the probe saying he bought it 1991. In Karen, Kidero wants a property situated on Ndege Road not probed as he acquired 2007. The former governor further wants flats in Nairobi Dam (LR 209/9841) exempted from the probe saying he bought them in 2004. He also wants a maisonette near Nairobi dam sparred from the probe saying he acquired it in 1987. Describing himself as a "man of decent means", Kidero also wants House No. 29 in Nyari on LR No. 12241/29 spared on grounds that he bought it 1998. He also wants House No. 31 in Nyari with LR No. 12241/31 not probed as he acquired in 1995. Kidero
further wants detectives to spare Plot 91 with LR No. 420/191, LR
No.10419/17 and 10419/18 saying he acquired them in 2009 and 2010
respectively. The ex-Nairobi county chief says his Muthaiga's residential home, that he jointly owns with his wife Susan, was bought in 2010 and as such should not be probed. Kidero said 16 properties in Korando should not be probed as he bought them in 2008. He further wants five properties in Kogony not investigated saying he acquired 2008. Kidero also wants five properties in Homa Bay county not subjected to the EACC investigations. His lawyer Tom Ojienda, who describes him 'as a classic example of a worker bee', accuses EACC of overstating the value of
properties. He attributes it to "malice and
abuse of power by EACC."

He says there is imminent danger that the tenants, occupants, and patrons will vacate the properties in fear of harassment. "The second respondent's action and conduct amount to economic sabotage against the first petitioner and is intended to cripple him financially," Ojienda says. The properties were subjected to scrutiny in the case where Kidero is accused of misuse of funds during his tenure at the Nairobi county government.
