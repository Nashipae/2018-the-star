In what many never envisaged, title hopefuls Butali Warriors bowed 1-0 to relegation-threatened Parkroad Badgers at City Park to slow their pace in reclaiming the crown they last won in 2013. What was supposed to be a routine win for the high-scoring Butali ended in favour of the youthful Badgers, who got all the important goal in the 38th minute through Gordon Oduor. Butali found it tough to break the water tight defence mounted by the Badgers as they lost their second match of the season. The former champions dominated the entire game and will rue the numerous chances they squandered, giving champions Police a chance to close in on them. The 2013 champions had a sniff at Badgers goal in the fourth minute through Emmanuel Simiyu, who was put through by Maxwell Fuchaka, but his attempt narrowly missed the target. Minutes later, red-hot George Mutira was denies by Badgers Jeremiah Okaka on a one on one situation. Mutira also flapped open chances in the 26th and 29th minute of the game. The under pressure Badgers managed a number of counterattacks in the second half through the forward duo of Andrew Kamau and Ian Lang’at but it was Oduor who got them the match winning goal in the 37th minute. Oduor plundered home Philiph Omunyi’s short corner a goal which proved to be the differences between the two sides at full time. At the same venue,Yvonne Karanja netted a brace as Strathmore University Scorpions stung JKUAT 3-0 to fortify their second place in the ladies division with 24 points. Karanja broke the deadlock for Meshack Senge’s girls in the 40th minute through a field goal before Diana Awino doubled the scores 11 minutes later from a short corner. Karanja completed her double in the 54th minute.
