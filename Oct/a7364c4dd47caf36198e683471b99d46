Deputy President William Ruto has said the Opposition has gone into panic mode because of his close working relations with Coast leaders. Ruto said the "Opposition suffers panic attacks whenever he tours the region. He said it was ironic that the Opposition was talking of uniting the country yet at the same time in the process of disciplining some MPs from the region for working with him. The DP spoke in Voi on Monday in the company of Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja and more than 20 MPs from different political parties. The Deputy President said he will continue associating with all leaders of different backgrounds for the country's development. He asked why the Opposition was claiming to be building bridges of unity in the country while at the same time isolating and discriminating others. At the same time, Ruto asked the Opposition to stop pretending to be the ones spearheading the fight against corruption. "The Constitution is clear; we have independent institutions charged with the fight against corruption, resources wastage and mismanagement," he said. He said if the leaders in the Opposition have no agenda for Kenya, then they need not to politicise the fight against corruption. "Importantly, leaders should focus on discussing issues that would transform Kenya rather than wasting time talking about others," he said.
