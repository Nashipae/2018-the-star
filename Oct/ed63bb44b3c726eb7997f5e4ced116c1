Kirinyaga governor Anne Waiguru has said she will only support a referendum if it will create 50-50 equality between men and women. She said she will mobilise residents to oppose the referendum if it does not seek to achieve the gender balance. Waiguru spoke on Saturday at Baricho Primary School during Mashujaa Day celebrations. ‘’We want a country where our women can use title deeds to take loans from cooperatives, just like men. Unfortunately, they [women] cannot access loans using title deeds as most lands are registered in men’s names,’’ she said Waiguru said women toil on farms, but at the end of the day, they do not enjoy the proceeds. She singled out tea farming, saying men are usually beneficiaries of year-end bonuses. She said her government is committed to improving healthcare. Click here for the latest political news
