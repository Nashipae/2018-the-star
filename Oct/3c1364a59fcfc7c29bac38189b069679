 A study by ActionAid shows that most of the facilities in the counties under study have been set up by volunteers and are not enough. The results released on Monday showed that most schools lack toilets and water. This makes the drop out rate to be high. The counties are Baringo, West Pokot, Migori, Garissa, Embu, Taita Taveta, Isiolo and Kajiado. "Menstruation remains a challenge to girls, especially due to water shortage in schools. The government supplies sanitary pads but the supply is neither consistent nor adequate. This adversely affects girls when they are in their menses," ActionAid consultant Margaret Akinyi said. According to the statistics, retention and performance are reported to be below standard. Performance is reflected in the low marks girls score in the class. "Statistics of Kamuthe in Tana River county show the dropout rate for primary schools was 43 per cent for girls and 31 for boys. In secondary, it was 15 and 22 for boys and girls respectively. Among the primary school going age (6-13 years), only 12.5 per cent of this population is in school. The situation is not different from the other seven counties," Akinyi said. She said the distribution of pads is done by a male teacher because most schools in this areas have only one female teacher employed by the county government. "Water is a problem especially in Baringo and West Pokot. These are dry areas and drought brings about poverty. Some engage in sex to get money for pads," Akinyi said. ActionAid CEO Makena Mwobobia speaking at the event said there is need to advocate for the need of girl child because they are born in society where education is not taken seriously.
