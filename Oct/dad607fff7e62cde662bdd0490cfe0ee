Ruiru MP Simon King’ara has asked the state to declare cancer a national disaster. The MP also wants the government to make screening and treatment free. Speaking during a free medical camp organised for Ruiru residents by the Simon Ng’ang’a King’ara Foundation on Saturday, the MP said a high percentage of Kenyans are suffering in silence. King’ara said most poor Kenyans refuse to go for cancer screening, fearing they will be diagnosed with the disease, which is expensive to treat. “Like today, we have detected five cases during this medical camp and after interrogating the patients, they’ve disclosed their worst fear is that they cannot manage to treat the disease,” he said.
