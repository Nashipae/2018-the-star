There is overwhelming evidence of widespread corruption in both the national and county governments. Whereas the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has tried to spread its wings to cover all forms of malfeasance and unethical conduct in the public sector, it is hopelessly out of its depth with the herculean task at hand. It is impossible for the agency to muster the resources and human capacity to seal all the loopholes being exploited daily by crafty public servants conniving with private profiteers to fleece the public. Corruption — whether through inflated pricing, phantom suppliers or riff-off schemes — is denying the country desperately needed resources for development. It is estimated that we could be losing over Sh1 billion daily to corruption, hence, the mantra that the government should tackle graft to avail more resources instead of resorting to higher taxes and loans. And if the government means business, it should embrace citizen participation in the war on corruption. It should reward whistle-blowers, but more importantly, open avenues for the public to report suspicious dealings. The counties are replete with tales of how officials are lining their pockets and accumulating wealth overnight by manipulating tenders or openly stealing from the public by falsifying documents. The EACC should not be groping around for suspects to prosecute after the fact. The government must also demonstrate seriousness by following through on its own directives, such as the Executive Order on transparent procurement.
