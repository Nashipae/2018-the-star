The 2018/19 Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) Championship league will kick off on November 17. Twelve teams will battle it out for the two slots in Kenya Cup with Resolution Kisii and Mombasa RFC seeking a quick return to the top flight league. The two clubs were relegated after just one season in Kenya Cup and they are keen to return this season. Kisii will open their campaign against another former Kenya Cup side, Kisumu RFC at Gusii Stadium with Mombasa hosting United States International University-Africa. Mombasa unveiled a new technical bench with Kenya 7s player Lewis Olaka replacing Chris Atingo as head coach. Derrick Wamalwa is the forwards’ coach while Andrew Aseka is the backs coach. Promoted Masinde Murilo University starts their campaign against University of Eldoret’s Trojans while Kitale RFC, also playing their first season in the second tier league, play former Kenya Cup side Western Bulls. In other Day One fixtures, Catholic Monks battle it out with Ngong Warriors while South Coast Pirates host Egerton University’s Wasps. According to KRU, this season’s competition retains its structure from last season, where the 12 teams were grouped into two pools of six each and will be played on home and away basis within respective pools. This will be followed with a crossover fixture against sides from the other pool before heading into the post season playoffs. In the playoffs, the top two teams will have earned themselves a direct home semi-final while Rank 3-6 will face each other in the quarters. This will pit Rank 3vs 6 and Rank 4 vs 5. Rank 1 will host the winner of Rank 3 v Rank 6 in the first semi-final while Rank 2 host winner of Rank 4 vs 5 in the second semi.
