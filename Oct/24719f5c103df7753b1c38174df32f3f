Busia MCAs have dismissed claims they plan to remove Governor Sospeter Ojaamong. On Sunday, they pledged to work with the county boss to deliver to residents. They spoke at St Paul’s Anglican Church of Kenya, Machakus, during a fundraiser. Majority leader Laban Mukhwana, deputy speaker Lawrence Okaale and Amukura East MCA Moses Echopat said those spreading propaganda are doomed to fail. “We’re behind you in your bid to leave a legacy. Those trying to create a rift between us will be shamed in Jesus’s name,” Okaale told Ojaamong.
