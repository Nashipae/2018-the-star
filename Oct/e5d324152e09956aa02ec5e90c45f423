The Solai Dam case in which 48 people were killed has been postponed once again after the DPP sought more time to get witness statements. Nine suspects including the owner Perry Mansukh have been charged with nine counts of manslaughter following the tragedy. State counsel Alexander Muteti told Naivasha principal magistrate Esther Kimilu that they required two more weeks to supply all the trial documents to the defence team. Muteti said the prosecution would be calling more than 70 witnesses. He said recording the statements is a long process. He told the court two suspects including Manusukuh and John Njuguna, the director of water in Nakuru, had filed an application seeking to travel out of the country. He said the defence was yet to peruse the application and called for more time before filing a replying affidavit.

Ngatia said that they were not opposed to the move to change the pre-trial dates. He made an application to have the issue of pre-trial and that of the suspects seeking to travel out of the country mentioned on the same date. The magistrate set the mentioned date on  October 29. The application to travel will also be addressed. The other eight suspects are Vinoj Jaya Kumar, Luka Kipyegen, Johnson Njuguna, Winnie Muthoni, Jacinta Were, Tomkin Odo Odhiambo, Williec Omondi and Lynette Cheruiyot. Two weeks ago, the High Court in Naivasha dismissed an application by the DPP seeking to transfer the matter from Naivasha to Nairobi following alleged threats to witnesses. High Court Judge Richard Mwongo said the application by the DPP had failed to raise enough grounds to warrant a transfer. Click here for the latest political news
