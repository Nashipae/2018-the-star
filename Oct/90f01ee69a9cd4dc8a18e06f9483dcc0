There was a fracas at City Hall yesterday after rowdy youths stormed the county assembly premises to eject minority leader Elias Otieno and chief whip Peter Imwatok. They claimed the duo have been removed from their positions by the ODM party and demanded that they vacate the offices. The rowdy youths, about 30, attacked sergeant at arms and administration police manning the main entrance to the assembly and attempted to force themselves into the premises. The sergeant called for reinforcement from the central police after the youths threatened to break the gate. Central police boss Robinson Thuku arrived within minutes with a contingent of police officers and managed to contain the situation. The officers camped outside the premises for the better of the day. On Thursday, ODM chairman John Mbadi wrote to acting speaker Mwaura Chege replacing Otieno with Highrise MCA Kennedy Oyugi and Imwatok with Lower Savanna ward representative Nicholas Okumu. Mbadi cited the arty constitution and Standing order 21(7) and (9) in making the changes. “The party expects the above changes to take effect immediately. Therefore, this letter overrides the earlier communication from the part,” the letter reads in part. But Mwaura wrote back to Mbadi, rejecting the changes. He said the ODM chairman did not follow the laid down procedure and Standing Orders.
