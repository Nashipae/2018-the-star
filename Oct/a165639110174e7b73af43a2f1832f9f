Power generator KenGen has ended a two-year dividend dry spell, awarding investors Sh0.40 per share. This, despite the firm’s profits for the year ended June 30, 2018 dropping 12.4 per cent to Sh7.89 billion from Sh9.01 billion last year. The company attributed the profit drop to high taxes. During the year, KenGen paid an income tax of Sh3.85 billion up from Sh2.45 billion in 2017. Moreover, It did not commission any new project hence did not recognize any capital allowances for which tax credits are realized. Shareholders last year went home empty handed even after the firm reported a net profit growth of 34 per cent to settle at Sh9.057 billion, up from Sh6.743 billion the previous year. Revenue rose 4.3 per cent to Sh45.29 billion up from Sh43.4 billion in 2017, driven by growth in steam revenue, which rose from Sh5.2 billion to Sh6.2 billion during the year under review. Speaking while unveiling the full year results yesterday in Nairobi, KenGen managing director Rebecca Miano attributed the improved performance to increased net finance income despite turbulent microeconomic environment “We remained resilient in turbulent waters during the year marred with drought in the first half that affected our water reservoirs and heightened political activities that culminated into prolonged election cycle,” Miano said. Miano thanked investors for accepting to plough back their returns into the capital intensive business, saying it is such investment that will underpin further rapid growth going forward with overall objective of a steady return for shareholders. Her sentiments were echoed by chairman Joshua Choge, Energy PS Joseph Njoroge and Water CS Simon Chelugui who both congratulated the firm for posting good results. Plans are underway to commission the 165.4 megawatt Olkaria V Geothermal Power Plant in Naivasha in July next year and the 83 megawatt Olkaria VI by 2021. The Sh40 billion project is in its final phase with construction of a power house, electrical and steam field underway. This is expected to further push KenGen’s geothermal production up from current generation of 3867 Gigawatt hours, accounting for 48 per cent of the firm’s generation mix followed by hydro at 3187 Gigawatt or 40 per cent. The firm currently produces 888 Gigawatt of thermal power and only 47 Gigawatt of wind energy, accounting for only one per cent of total generation mix. KenGen is the leading power generator in the country, controlling 69 per cent of the country’s installed capacity of 2359 megawatts and 75 per cent of generation output estimated at 10702 Gigawatt.
