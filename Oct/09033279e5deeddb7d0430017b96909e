The government intends to issue all citizens with unique Huduma numbers to help ease service delivery, CS Joe Mucheru has said. The Cabinet Secretary said the numbers will be used to synchronise all government systems. While he did not disclose when the numbers will be issued, Mucheru noted that the move is key in realisation of Vision 2030. He spoke during the official opening of the 10th Connected Summit held in Bomas of Kenya on Tuesday. Currently, at least 55 government services are being offered through the Huduma Centre and the e-Citizen platform. Mucheru said they are working to make the centres a one-stop shop for all government services. To further enhance service, the CS noted that in partnership with the National Transport and Safety Authority they intend to roll out Smart stops along the highways. The stops will be used to report accidents and emergencies. Mucheru officially unveiled the White box- a platform or an incubation hub to support innovation and the communication of ideas that can be applied to boost government service delivery. According to the minister, White Box targets to link these groups of people, and create a space where they can gather and brainstorm ideas and innovations that can be tested by experts in the government. If feasible, the ideas can then be absorbed in whichever sector they purposes to serve.Â The ICT Ministry has set aside Sh1 billion to encourage the growth of startups.
