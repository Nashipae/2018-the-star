The wrangles in the water sector in Murang’a county have taken a new twist following the gazettement of water companies as agencies of the county government. The five companies are Murang’a, Murang’a South, Kahuti, Gatamathi and Gatanga Water and Sanitation Companies. The gazette notice published on Friday by Finance executive David Waweru said it is in line with the Public Finance Management Act. Waweru further gazetted Fort Aqua Beverages, which is owned by Muwasco, as one of its agencies. The company packs water for sale and makes more than Sh100 million every month, according to Muwasco chairman Peter Munga. Munga told Water PS Joseph Wairagu during a visit to the company in July that the Sh18 million plant has the capacity to produce 5,000 bottles of water every day. The profits, he said, are channelled back into the community through expanded water connectivity and improved water and sanitation services. The gazettement notice comes at a time the water firms have resisted reforms and attempts to control the water sector by the county government.
