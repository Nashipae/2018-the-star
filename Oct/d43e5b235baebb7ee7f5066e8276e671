All courts will be connected to the internet for speedy proceedings, ICT Principal Secretary Jerome Ochieng has said. Ochieng on Friday said the ministry has partnered with the Judiciary to provide connectivity. He said internet connectivity will help in expediting cases. The courts will have audio and video recordings for all proceedings. The ministry will provide both software and human transcriptions using freelancers through Ajira Digital Programme. The connection will also help the Judiciary integrate into one platform. “The connectivity will enhance dispensation of justice to Kenyans through preparation of court proceedings in a digitalised manner,” Ochieng said. He was speaking in Vihiga after launching the laying of fiber optic cables for internet connectivity in Emuhaya, Luanda, Hamisi and Sabatia subcounties.
