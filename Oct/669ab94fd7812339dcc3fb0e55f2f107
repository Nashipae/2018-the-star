Kenya Airways made history yesterday with its debut Nairobi-New York nonstop flight. Covering a distance of more than 13,713km, and taking 15 hours 25 minutes on the outbound trip, the new flight is not only the first commercially scheduled non-stop service between Kenya and the US, but also ranks as one of the longest flights in the world at seventh place. The route is also KQ’s longest flight. The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner left Nairobi for New York on Sunday night some minutes past 11pm after it was flagged off by President Uhuru Kenyatta and touched down at the JFK International Airport at 2.45pm local time. On board were 234 passengers - 30 in business class and 204 on economy class.

The 15-hour flight further puts KQ on the global air travel map between Kenya and the US, as flights from Kenya to the US took up to 22 hours through a stop over in Europe or Asia.
