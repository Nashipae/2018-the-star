Jackie Nyaminde, whose alter ego is Wilbroda, may no longer be in the hit TV show owned by Royal Media Services, Papa Shirandula. A close source whispered to Word Is that Charles Bukeko removed Wilbroda from the show after she joined Milele FM, which is under Media Max Limited. Bukeko is the lead actor and concept creator of the show. Wilbroda, who is currently doing the mid-morning show at Milele FM, was however cagey on whether she will continue being in the show. "Bado tunaendelea na maisha. Acting is super but I really do not want to talk much about the show (Papa Shirandula). I would rather not talk about it," she said. "Let's talk about my show. Let us talk about Milele, my new place of work, because it is my new blessing and my new beginning." She directed us to the programmes management to "shed more light" on her future with Papa Shirandula. "I chose to concentrate on the good things that are happening in my life," Wilbroda said. "Just be sure you will see me on your TV screen, representing a lot of brands that I am part of. Just know there are more good things lined up for me. There are some things that need to be kept under wraps but once they are cooked, I will let the world know." We reached out to Esther, the programme manager, who said: "Wilbroda is in the show and if she is leaving then maybe she knows that better. But for now she is in the show." Numerous phone calls to Charles Bukeko went unanswered.
