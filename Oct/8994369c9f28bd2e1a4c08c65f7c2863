Human resource managers have a critical role in curbing corruption in public and private sectors, a commission and a professional agency said yesterday. Salaries and Remuneration Commission chairperson Lyn Mengich said HR managers are directly involved in hiring staff in an organisation and should be held to account whenever integrity questions are raised about an employee. She urged HR professionals to recruit people qualified to deliver on their mandate. “We’ve been asking ourselves the question about values and the role of the HR profession in ensuring we have a country driven by values. HR professionals are key in eliminating vices like corruption that have been contributing to wastage in our nation,” she said at Whitesands Hotel, Mombasa. Mengich spoke on the sidelines of the 22nd Annual National Human Resource Managers Conference organised by the Institute of Human Resource Management. More than 1,000 HR managers attended. Institute of Human Resource Management national chairperson Elijah Sitimah said the buck stops with the managers on workplace integrity. “HR managers are the keepers of the standards and policies of an organisation,” he said. Sitimah said they have developed a code of conduct for members and have a committee to deal with indiscipline. “Any HR manager who does not uphold integrity should lose the practising certificate. We’ve gone a notch higher by identifying some of the members caught in graft cases and we’ll soon take action against them,” he said. IHRM executive director Dorcas Wainaina said they have launched an assessment centre where job applicants will have to be vetted before they are employed. They will be required to fill in a form to help ascertain their levels of honesty and integrity.
