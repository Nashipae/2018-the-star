A lawmaker has blasted ODM rebel MPs from the Coast who are supporting Deputy President William Ruto’s 2022 presidential ambitions. Nominated ANC MP Godfrey Osotsi on Sunday said Western Kenya voters will not support the DP. "The region he comes from held power for 24 years under retired President Daniel arap Moi," he said. Osotsi was the chief guest during a fundraising at Family Alter Ministries Church Serengeti in Magarini constituency. The DP Ruto’s ally Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa, her Magarini counterpart Michael Kingi, Kaloleni MP Paul Katana and Jubilee Nominated Senator Christine Zawadi were present. Osotsi said the Coast and Western have common problems of poverty, land injustices, collapsed industries and unemployment.

Ruto allies seemed to have been taken by surprise since they did not expect a guest to criticise their position. Osotsi was the last speaker. He said the presidency should be rotational. "It is not acceptable for only two tribes to produce presidents, other regions should be given a chance," he said. After the fundraising one of the guests was overheard blaming the legislators for allowing Osotsi to speak last. Jumwa had stepped out of the hall to answer a phone call. During the August 8, 2017, General Election, the Coast voted overwhelmingly for ODM and its party leader Raila Odinga.
