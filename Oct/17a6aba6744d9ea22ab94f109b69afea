The government’s failure to license another sugar miller in Busia violates President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda, Mandera South MP Adan Haji has said. The factory has not received a license for its Sh1.3 billion plant despite more than fi ve years of court cases. Haji visited the plant on Saturday and said the long controversy surrounding the factory is a big blow to the residents. "This plant will help Busia residents and Kenyans. It is unfair to the President who is pushing for the Big Four. It appears like the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing in the Kenyan government," Haji said. The legislator is chairman of the parliamentary Agriculture committee. "I appeal to the ministries involved to come here on the ground and try to solve the controversy amicably so that the factory can start operations immediately," he said. He called it “quite unfortunate” that a stakeholder went to court to halt operations of the miller though investors injected large amounts of money. "This is denying jobs to Busia women and youth." Busia Woman Representative Florence Mutua regretted that despite the plant having modern machines, it has not been able to function for two and a half years due to “meaningless” cases from another investor.
