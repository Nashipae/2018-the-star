Wajir East MP Rashid Kassim has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to honour his pledge of connecting the county to the national power grid. Currently, Wajir and Mandera counties are powered by KenGen generators, which is expensive and unstable. The residents have decried frequent power outages which they say lead to widespread loses from damaged electronics to interruptions of business activities. During election campaigns last year, while in Wajir, the President promised the residents that the government would quicken their connection to the national grid. The town has been without power for the last two weeks due to what the engineers say is broken down generators. Wajir power consumption is 2.2MW supplied by three old diesel generators. So bad has the situation been that the area MP staged a protest walk together with members of civil society and residents to the local power plant. Speaking to the press after the visit, Kassim said it was time the government moved with speed and connected the town to the national grid. “We cannot talk of enhancing economic development of the region if we don’t have stable power.It is high time the national government through the ministry of Energy gave the matter the seriousness it deserves. Our people have suffered enough through these constant blackouts that some times goes on for many days,” said Kassim. Early this year, Energy CS Charles Keter said the government was looking for funds for construction of a power line from Garsen to Bura and another from Garissa to Wajir through Habaswein. Keter said feasibility studies for the two lines have already started. The power situation is exposing the area to security lapses. He said Rural Electrification Authority is implementing 25 solar mini-grids to power small towns in Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit and Turkana as it moves towards development of renewable energy sources.
