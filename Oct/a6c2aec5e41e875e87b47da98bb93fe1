The Teachers' Service Commission and KNUT have resorted to dialogue to avert a looming strike. The two parties began a five-day meeting at a Naivasha hotel on Monday with a view to resolving the at-stake issues. Key among issues raised by Knut boss Wilson Sossion was a call to TSC to rescind the delocalisation and appraisal policies. He on August 15 gave these as part of the union's conditions to the commission for it to shelve the strike plan. The union agreed to call off its September 1 strike plan after the commission promised to look into some of the 'unpopular' policies. On August 16, President Uhuru Kenyatta asked the Ministry of Education to review the teacher delocalisation policy. He spoke during a Catholic Schools Principals Conference at the Catholic University of Eastern Africa in Nairobi. The commission and the union are exuding confidence that they would resolve their differences during the meeting at Sawela Lodge. Other issues that will be discussed are the new curriculum, career progression, and promotions among others.
