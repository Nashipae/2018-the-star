DCI detectives on Tuesday raided the home of famous Machakos witch doctor Annah Mutheu and recovered three stolen vehicles as well as 112 IDs. Mutheu was arrested alongside one of her assistants who was found at the home at the time of the raid. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations, in a tweet, said they suspect the vehicles recovered from the home were stolen. "Detectives, following a tip-off from members of the public, recovered one lorry, a Toyota Hilux pick up and a Nissan matatu," DCI tweeted.
