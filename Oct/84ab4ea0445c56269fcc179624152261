National Treasury was yesterday at pain to explain where Sh1.98 billion meant for National Sports Fund is, even as it emerged it is still handling the Fundâ€™s kitty long after. Treasury CAS Nelson Gaichuhie told Parliamentary Finance Committee that Treasury has a balance of Sh396.2 million in a withholding account received as betting and lottery tax since July but is yet to remit another Sh1.98 billion received during same period. He was however hard pressed to explain why Treasury was still handling the cash yet there is a fully fledged Sports Fund board in place to manage the kitty. Pressed by Amani National Congress nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi to explain where the unremitted amount is, Gaichuhie fumbled, forcing the committee chairperson Joseph Limo to call for another session where the ministry is expected provide a detailed account. The committee wondered why Treasury was operating a withholding account when Sports Act gives National Sports Fund mandate to handle all proceeds from betting and lottery The sports fund was established under the Sports Act 2013, and was meant to be a collective pool of financial resources from which all Kenyan athletes and federations could secure funding to adequately prepare and participate in various competitions or qualifiers. According to Treasury, betting and lottery tax imposed in the recently enacted Finance Act 2018 is expected to pull Sh32 billion. There seems to be a contention between Ministry of Sports and Treasury over management of the kitty.
