The government on Thursday issued a directive to all PSVs to comply with all traffic laws by November 12. It said any PSVs, drivers, saccos and transport companies; passengers and relevant parties that fail to comply with the NTSA Act and the Traffic Act will be dealt with. In a joint statement, Cabinet Secretaries James Macharia of Transport and his Interior counterpart Fred Matiang'i attributed the rise of road accidents to failure by PSVs to observe traffic rules. It is estimated that at least 3,000 lives are lost annually in accidents on Kenyan roads. The NTSA Act Cap 403 and Legal Notice 161 of 2003 entails the PSVs be fitted with speed limiters or governors, safety belts (seat belts) and yellow continuous line. The famed 'Michuki rules' requires PSV drivers and conductors to wear uniforms and PSV badges. Their photos are to be displayed prominently in the vehicle. On October 11, the NTSA said it would carry out an age limit review of PSV drivers. This was after investigations revealed the driver of the bus that killed 56 people in the Fort Tenan accident on October 10, was 76 years old. In July last year, NTSA and the Kenya Bureau of Standards introduced new PSV designs. The agencies said PSV buses have poorly designed spaces between the seats.
