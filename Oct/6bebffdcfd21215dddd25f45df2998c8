Kenya Harlequins have appointed Charles Cadovillis as the head coach to replace Joel Ng’ang’a, who left the club at the conclusion of the 2017/18 season in July. Cadovillis, who was previously head coach of Kenya Cup runners up Kabras returns to Quins after being Director of Rugby at the Ngong Road outfit for two seasons between 2015-2017. Cadovillis was sacked by Kabras despite guiding the sugarmillers to a fourth consecutive Kenya Cup final where they lost 29-24 to KCB and also clinched the national sevens circuit. Cadovillis had a long chequered playing career, playing for both Quins and Nondies. His goal at Quins will be to reclaim the Kenya Cup crown they last won in 2012. Quins were bundled out of the 2017/18 Kenya Cup playoffs at the quarterfinal stage by rivals and neighbors Impala in a 34-18 score line. In the 2016/17 season, Quins lost 19-13 to eventual champions KCB in the semifinal. Director of the technical committee Victor Sudi said they will release the rest of the technical bench in the next few days as they seek to bolster the side in their quest to win the league. “We need to get to the playoffs and then start talking about the semifinals and final. Our form has not been that bad but it can be better and with the Cadovillis at the helm, we can go all the way,” said Sudi. The squad has already started their pre-season and will be playing in the season opening Impala Floodlit tournament next month. Quins open the Kenya Cup campaign with tricky home tie against Mwamba followed by matches against newly promoted Oilers, Homeboyz champions KCB and Nondies just before the Christmas break. The club is currently under an interim committee ahead of election in December. The interim committee took charge during a Special General Meeting (SGM) called after an Annual General Meeting (AGM) at the club failed to take off at the close of July. Raphael Nzomo was elected as chair of the interim committee with Herbert Mwachiro as vice chairman.
