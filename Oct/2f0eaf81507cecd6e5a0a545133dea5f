Sugar production increased from 252,415 tonnes to 362,018 tonnes between January and September compared to a similar period last year, a report shows.The September sugar market report released by the Sugar Directorate on Friday attributes the increase to the sector’s recovery from drought.The report says all the millers, with the exception of Muhoroni Sugar Company, recorded improved production.“The production was boosted by operationalisation of Olepito Sugar Company and inclusion of processed bulk sugar imports at West Kenya and Sukari mills,” the report reads.Most factories were still grappling with limited cane supply, which forced them to operate at below 50 per cent of their crushing capacity. About 343,643 tonnes were sold between January and September compared to 250,274 tonnes sold in the same period last year. This represented a 37 per cent increase. The report attributes the increase to improved production and rising demand.
