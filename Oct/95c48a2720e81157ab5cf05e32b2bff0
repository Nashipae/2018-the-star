Tana River county will not join the North Eastern region economic block, governor Dhadho Godhana has said. The county will remain with the Jumuiya ya Kaunti Za Pwani due to what governor termed shared interest. North Eastern region is in the process of forming their economic block that targets counties in the drought-stricken area which includes Tana River. Godhana posted on his official Facebook page on Saturday that he made the decision after consulting leaders, friends and people with similar interests. “We have found that it will only be beneficial to our people if we join the Coast region economic bloc also known as the Jumuiya ya Pwani,’’ he said. The Tana River county boss said residents do not see their interests well addressed by joining the North Eastern region economic block. He said Tana River county shares a lot with the counties of Coast region, adding that they will be glad to be joined with Lamu and Kilifi counties. The governor however proposed that Jumuiya ya Pwani should retain the original English name Coast region economic block. According to him, the Swahili name makes no sense. “In such a case, I can also vie for that regional position, as we are people of equal reasoning,’’ he said. Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani was formed by the six Coast counties in 2015 to forge economic development in the region. The members are Lamu, Kilifi, Mombasa, Tana River, Kwale and Taita Taveta counties. At the time Tana River was under governor Hussein Dhadho who lost to Godhana during the August 8 General Election.
