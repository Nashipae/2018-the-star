ANC has expressed its displeasure that party leader Musalia Mudavadi was not given an opportunity to speak during Mashujaa Day celebrations in Kakamega on Saturday. ANC described the treatment as “inferior and inhumane”. The party linked the “oversight” to 2022. “Deputy president William Ruto was the schemer,” ANC said yesterday. Only host governor Wycliffe Oparanya and ODM boss Raila Odinga spoke besides Ruto and President Uhuru Kenyatta. Oparanya and Raila were brief. Ruto welcomed Uhuru who talked at length. ANC said Mudavadi is a “national leader, Luhya spokesperson and a respected force to reckon within Western Kenya who cannot be ignored”. The party said Mudavadi would have left the nation “more united” were he to address the crowd. “The DP ought to have invited Musalia and (Wiper leader) Kalonzo Musyoka. Ruto wanted to downsize Musalia who is his only threat for the presidency,” ANC national chairman Kelvin Lunani told the Star. ANC Coast region secretary general Jimmy Azangu said there was a potential for chaos because of the “mistreatment”. “But Luhyas proved to be very peaceful,” he said, adding Cotu boss Francis Atwoli was also disrespected. Lunani said Raila should have requested Uhuru to allow Mudavadi, a fellow NASA co-principal, to speak.
