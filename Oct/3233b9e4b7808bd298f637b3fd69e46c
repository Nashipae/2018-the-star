As the National Super League stretches to its penultimate round today, second-placed promotion hopefuls KCB will aim for nothing short of the three points when they play Coast Stima at Mbaraki Stadium. KCB are chasing the second automatic promotion slot alongside third-placed Nairobi Stima with Western Stima already assured of a place in next season’s top flight league. The bankers will approach the encounter knowing too well that a slip up, coupled with a win for Nairobi Stima will put their chances on the back foot, a situation they will want to avoid at all costs. On the other hand Nairobi Stima will be banking on home advantage and KCB to slip when they play champions Western Stima at Karuturi grounds. The Nairobi side are expected to have the upper hand in the encounter now that their opponents for the day have nothing to lose. KCB are on 69 points while Nairobi Stima have 66 and will move to second if the bankers lose, courtesy of a healthy goal difference. Meanwhile, Ushuru will be hoping to get back to the promotion mix, through the play off route, although this will demand for Nairobi Stima to lose both their matches and they, Ushuru, down GFE 105 today at Sudi Stadium. The taxmen are fourth with 62 points. Fresh from humbling Nakuru All Stars 3-1 FC Talanta will be seeking to replicate the same performance when they accost Administration Police at Camp Toyoyo. Talanta are 11th with 44 points while the paramilitary side is ranked 16th with 30 points. Fifth-placed Bidco United host Modern Coast Rangers, five places down the table, at Thika Stadium with an eye on a decent finish. Bidco have 57 points while Rangers have 46. Kibera Black Stars and Kangemi All Stars open the Hope Centre double header when they entertain fans in a ‘slum derby’. Kibera are 12th on the standings with 42 points while Kangemi are two slots down with 39. The match will pave way for a clash between Nairobi City Stars and debutants Kisumu All Stars.
