Trade relations between Kenya and Oman are set to grow after the two countries agreed to hold business expos in Nairobi and Muscat respectively. The expo in Nairobi starts on November 29, 2018. It will have over 80 companies from Oman to exhibit their different products. Oman is a country occupying the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. Speaking on Friday during a meeting with the Oman delegates, Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) chairman Kiprono Kittony said the two countries will focus on the big4 agenda that has been identified by Kenya. “Kenya’s economy has been growing at a fast pace and we hope the partnership with the Sultanate of Oman will lead to increased business between the two countries and expanded trade,” said Kittony. He said Kenya and Oman's relations date back to over 600 years with many Kenyan coastal families in Lamu, Malindi and Mombasa tracing their ancestry to the country. “A total of 11.5 million Euros (Sh1.3 billion) worth of goods are exported from Oman to Kenya and Sh14.2 million Euros from Kenya to Oman which is fairly balanced and we believe we can expand this by over three times," Kittony said. Omani Products Exhibition (OPEX) Chairman Ayman Al Hasani said more than 80 companies from different sectors like agro food, construction materials, pharmaceuticals, carpets, furniture among others will exhibit in Nairobi. The expo will also have business to business sessions where MOU’s will be signed with over 15 companies from Oman expressing interest in setting shop in Kenya. Click here for the latest political news
