The Kenya Revenue Authority has integrated all its 12 scanners stationed at the port of Mombasa, Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Container Freight Stations and at the Nairobi Inland Container Depot to curb infiltration of contraband. The scanners are being monitored and can be controlled from two state-of-the-art command cetres in Mombasa and Nairobi, KRA deputy commissioner in charge of southern region Nicholas Kinoti said. Speaking after a media tour of the scanners at the port of Mombasa, Kinoti said the scanners project real-time images of all the scanned containers at the ports of entry. Kinoti said the project, dubbed the National Integrated Scanners Solution, is expected to improve international and local trade facilitation, improve cargo clearance process at the ports and enable maximum revenue collection. “We have 12 scanners, being controlled and monitored from Nairobi and Mombasa Control Centres. The scanners are non-intrusive verification tools to support the verification process without opening the containers,” said Kinoti. He said the images are analyzed on real-time basis and the customs officials are able to intercept any suspicious cargo for further 100 per cent verification. “Any consignment that does not answer to our standards is taken for further verification,” he said.
