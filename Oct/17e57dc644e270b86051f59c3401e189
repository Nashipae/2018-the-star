Good Morning. Today, Joseph 'Jowie' Irungu and Jacque Maribe are back in court for their bail hearing in the case involving the murder of businesswoman Monica Kimani. The two have been in custody since the last week of September and have been charged with the murder which they have denied with the prosecution seeking to have them held even further. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this Wednesday morning. Hefty reward for whistle-blowers You could become an overnight millionaire by exposing corruption if a proposed bill is enacted into law. The draft bill championed by the Attorney General’s office proposes that whistleblowers be entitled to 10 percent of money or assets recovered from the stolen loot. This means that the whistleblower of the Sh791 million NYS scandal could walk home with a cool Sh79 million if the suspects are convicted and the money recovered. _____________________________________________________ State plans phaseout of all special schools The government plans to close special schools and use their resources to support children living with disability in an integrated school environment. Special needs education director Fredrick Haga on Tuesday said the phaseout will be done in stages. Haga said the current disability support system is underfunded, unfair, fragmented, and inefficient, and gives people with disability little choice and no certainty of access to appropriate support. _____________________________________________________ Charity before death: how Sarova owners spent their last day It was a normal Saturday for Makindu Hope Academy, in Makueni when unexpected visitors surprisingly showed up at lunch time. Four members of the Vohra family, co-owners of Sarova Hotels drove in the school for a surprise lunch. The director Patricia Kanini who was not in the school at the moment said she received a call from one teacher inquiring if they expected any visitors. Kanini said that the visit was impromptu but was not surprised as they tend to get visitors during celebrations at the Sikh temple. _____________________________________________________ Sonko seeks to increase parking fees to Sh400 Backtracking on his campaign pledges, Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko is set to increase parking fees in the City Centre. If a proposal by Sonko’s administration to hike the fees is approved by the county assembly, the fees will take effect next month. The county Treasury, in the county’s 2018-19 Finance Bill, has proposed to increase the fees from Sh300 to Sh400 to finance its Sh34 billion 2018-19 budget. _____________________________________________________ Treasury on spot over Sh1.98 billion sports fund National Treasury was yesterday at pain to explain where Sh1.98 billion meant for National Sports Fund is, even as it emerged it is still handling the Fund’s kitty long after Treasury CAS Nelson Gaichuhie told Parliamentary Finance Committee that Treasury has a balance of Sh396.2 million in a withholding account received as betting and lottery tax since July but is yet to remit another Sh1.98 billion received during same period. He was however hard pressed to explain why Treasury was still handling the cash yet there is a fully fledged Sports Fund board in place to manage the kitty. _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
