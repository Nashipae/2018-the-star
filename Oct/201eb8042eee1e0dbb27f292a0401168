Namibian President Hage Geingob on Saturday invited President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga to the podium to congratulate them for their newfound unity. "Indeed inclusivity spells harmony and exclusivity spells conflict. I am standing here as a proud African to have witnessed how my two brothers here got together," he said. Speaking at Bukhungu Stadium during Masujaa Day celebrations, Geingob said he was not going to read his speech and instead congratulate the two for reconciling Kenyans. "What I have observed here since I came is unique... to see what I have seen on television. To see them say he is my brother and they hugged.. I did not believe it but here it is..I am touched," he said. On March 9, when the country was at the height of political turmoil stretching from the disputed August 2017 election,  Uhuru and Raila in an unexpected and rare show of unity told Kenyans they had set their differences aside and would work to unite the public. Raila, who was first to speak, said ethnic division had finally come to an end and that he and his "brother" (Uhuru) will bridge the existing gap. Uhuru assured Kenyans of a new political beginning following his meeting with Raila - he noted they had an opportunity to extensively discuss matters affecting Kenya.
