Mwea farmers have linked the expensive cost of locally produced rice to the high production costs. The farmers said about 90 per cent of the rice consumed locally is imported mostly from Asia, giving Kenyan rice farmers stiff competition. According to the farmers, production cost of rice on leased land is Sh52 per kilo and Sh30 per kilo on own farm. Mwea Irrigation Scheme covers 24,000 acres with an additional 6,000 acres by private out growers. Last year, they sold rice between Sh62 and Sh72 a kilo after demand picked up. However, farmers say the price of rice skyrocketted because of the high production cost. Chairman of Irrigation Water Users Association Moris Mutugi said imports flooding the market will hurt earnings if not controlled.
