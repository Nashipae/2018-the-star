Gaspo midfielders duo of Christine Nafula and Mary Kinuthia are elated to return to the national team, Harambee Starlets’ ahead of the next month’s Africa women’s Cup of Nations in Ghana. The two last played for the national team during an International friendly match with Division One side, Lynch Burg FC from USA at the Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos in 2017. The two missed the Awcon qualifiers and the Council of East and Central Africa Football Association (Cecafa) event in Kigali, Rwanda last July. The two, who recently returned from Sweden, having featured for Dalhem FC in the Swedish Division 11 league. Critics and pundits in equal measures feel the two have been the missing link in the midfield and it will be interesting to see how their presence will help the team at the biannual event. The soft spoken Kinuthia said: “Well, I’m glad to be in the team ahead of the big task in Ghana. I am fresh from playing in Sweden, where tactically, Sweden are far above Kenya and I hope the experience and exposure I have gained will come in play during the Awcon show,” She added: “The current squad has what it takes to pull surprises at the event and therefore we just have to work towards recording good performance and results will definitely come our way.” Nafula, a sibling to former national team player Doreen Nabwire, echoed Kinuthia’s sentiment saying she was glad to be included in the team. “It has been a while since I featured for the national team and it is always an honour when you get a call up. But now that I’m here, my goal is to work with the rest of the players and hopefully have a good outing in Ghana. We know it is not going to be easy but with hard work, it can be done,” said Nafula. The two will, however, jostle for a place in the midfield alongside Jentrix Shikangwa, Sheril Angachi, Ruth Ingosi, Corazone Aquino, Elizabeth Wambui, Martha Amunyolete, Cynthia Shilwatso, Mercy Achieng and Cheris Avilia.
