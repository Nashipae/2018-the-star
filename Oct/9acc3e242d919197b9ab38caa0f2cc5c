The county government of Mandera will allocate Sh300 million for the development of a Kenya Medical Training College Mandera campus, county governor Ali Roba has said. Roba said they have committed Sh150 million this fi nancial year and a similar amount in the next financial year for the development of the new campus. The county government has already given 100 acres of land where an ultra-modern campus will be built. “We are upgrading the county referral hospital to a state-of-the art facility to support the training of students and serve the people of Mandera better,” the governor said. The county is keen to develop a close working relationship with KMTC to benefit the county through human resource development in the health sector. KMTC board chairman Philip Kaloki assured the governor that college is equal to the task of supporting the county government to improve the health of its people through tailor made courses. “We want to offer nursing and certificate in community health extension workers when the campus opens its doors in March 2019,” Kaloki said. The campus will train students from Somalia and Ethiopia. In an agreement signed between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Somalia’s President Mohammed Farmajo in March last year, KMTC Mandera campus will train 200 students from Somalia every year on full sponsorship from their government, a move that will boost its viability
