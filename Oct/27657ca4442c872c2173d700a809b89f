President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to outline the government’s plans to revive the sugar sector when he visits Kakamega this weekend. Uhuru is expected to lead the nation in celebration Mashujaa Day from Bhukungu Stadium on Saturday. Last week, he met Western leaders at State House to brief him on the issues they want him to address. The meeting was attended by Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa, Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, Governors Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega), Wilbur Otichilo (Vihiga), Wycliffe Wangamati (Bungoma), Patrick Khaemba (Trans Nzoia) and Busia’s Sospeter Ojaamong. Senators and MPs from the five counties were also present. Read: Farmers, staff not paid as sugar firms sag under Sh16.5bn debt “The revival of sugar companies in Western topped the agenda. The President gave a one month deadline to a team working on a revival plan for Mumias and Nzoia sugar mills to complete their assignment and present the way forward,” State House spokesperson Kanze Dena said on Sunday. She spoke at Kakamega State Lodge when she briefed reporters about Mashujaa Day celebrations. Oparanya said Uhuru is set to make major announcements on the ailing sugar sector and mining industry. The sugar sector is the economic mainstay of Western region. Mumias Sugar Company is no longer milling due to accumulated debts ranging from bank loans, KRA remissions and farmers arrears. Sources said Uhuru told the State House meeting the government cannot continue pumping more money to Mumias because the cash goes into “endless pits.” He said the millers need a revival plan that will prioritise prompt payment of farmers arrears to motivate them into cane farming. The President is expected to arrive in Kakamega on Friday evening. It will be his first visit to the county since his reelection on October 26 last year.
