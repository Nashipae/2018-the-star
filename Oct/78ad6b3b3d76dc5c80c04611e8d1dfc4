The hospital said despite the high cost of the intensive care unit, they engage customers who are unable to raise the funds after being discharged. “We continuously engage our patients who may require financial assistance on settling hospital bills and reach a mutually acceptable agreement with them," the statement said. Njeri said she continues to incur daily charges of Sh5,000 as she stays at the hospital. “The respondent continues to levy the petitioner a daily charge of Sh5,000, while she is not receiving any treatment as she was discharged on May 14,” the suit papers read.
