American rapper Kanye West and his wife Kim Kardashian on Monday paid a courtesy visit to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and gave him a pair of autographed sneakers. The musician took time off from recording material for his new album to meet the President at State House. Kanye West arrived in Entebbe on Friday and then flew by helicopter to Chobe Safari Lodge in Murchison Falls National Park in northwest Uganda. "I held fruitful discussions with them. I thank Kanye for the gift of white sneakers. Enjoy your time in Uganda,"  Museveni tweeted. Museveni said they discussed how to promote Uganda's tourism and the arts. Kanye West said he needed to go to Africa after a trip to Chicago where he "felt this energy." The rapper wanted to finish his latest album, Yandhi, in nature and at a location where his children could be with him. He set up a temporary music studio in the wild for next week where he is planning to record a new album. The rapper, who recently changed his name to YE, reactivated his Twitter account on arrival to Uganda. He had deactivated his Twitter and Instagram accounts last week. The visit comes just days after West met President Donald Trump for lunch at the White House. Click here for the latest political news
