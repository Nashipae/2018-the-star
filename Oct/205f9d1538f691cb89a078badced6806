The High Court has released Migori governor Okoth Obado on Sh5million cash bail. The court ordered Obado to provide two sureties of the same amount. "He must deposit his travel documents including passports," Justice Jessie Lessit said when she made the ruling on Wednesday. Lessit also ordered Obado not to intimidate parents or siblings of the deceased Sharon Otieno since the court is at liberty to cancel his bail terms. Obado's co-accused persons Michael Oyamo and Caspal Obiero were denied bail with the judge saying that there is a likelihood that they will interfere with the investigations. Justice Lessit said Obado should not go 20 km away from the boundaries of Migori county. The hearing of the case will be held on May 17 next year. Obado has been in remand at the Industrial Area prison for 33 days after his arrest on September 21 in connection with the murder of Rongo university student Lessit had declined Obado’s first application for bail on September 27. She said that uncertainty of the safety of witnesses in the murder trial led to the denial of bail. Obado is facing two murder charges alongside his personal assistant Michael Oyamo and County Clerk Caspal Obiero. The second charge is that of killing Sharon’s unborn child.
