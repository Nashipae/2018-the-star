TV journalist Jacque Maribe and her fiancÃ© Joseph Irungu alias Jowie will know their fate on whether they will be granted bail or not. The two are this morning expected to appear before Justice James Wakiaga for the ruling. Last week, they were charged afresh over the murder of businesswoman Monica Kimani. Maribe and Jowie denied the charges. The journalist and her fiance's lawyers made an application that the two be granted bail but Wakiaga said the ruling would be made today. Read: Maribe and Jowie charged afresh over Monica's murder Maribe's lawyers had rejected a bid by the DPP to stop the Citizen TV anchor from presenting news. Prosecutor Catherine Mwaniki argued that the anchor should not appear on the screen as she "would influence some of the witnesses in the murder case." The prosecutor argued that Maribe should further be grounded so that she does not mingle with members of the public. "All we are saying is that being a media personality, there is a high possibility that while mingling with the members of the public, she is likely to take advantage to influence the witnesses."

Managing director Wachira Waruru while asking courts to grant her bail said Maribe is still an employee of Royal Media Services despite the murder charge she is facing. "Having engaged her for the last six years, and assessing her performance, we hereby vouch for her character and recommend for her admission to bail," he said.
