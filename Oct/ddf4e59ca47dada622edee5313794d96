The High Court has referred Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu's case seeking to stop her prosecution for fraud to the Chief Justice. The court has asked CJ David Maraga to empanel a bench to hear and determine the matter. Justice Chacha Mwita said the issues raised in an application by the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions raises substantial questions of law. The judge also extended orders staying Mwilu's criminal prosecution saying it will serve greater justice and purpose if the orders are maintained. "Without the orders there will be nothing for the bench to hear and determine, it will be an exercise in futility," Mwita said.
