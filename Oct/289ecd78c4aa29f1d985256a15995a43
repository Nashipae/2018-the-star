The owner of the Kakamega-bound Homeboyz bus that killed 58 passengers two weeks ago has denied charges of allowing the vehicle to operate without a licence. Cleophas Shimanyula was also charged with failing to keep the record of the driver and conductor. He was charged alongside manager Bernard Shitiabayi. Shitiabaya faced an additional charge of allowing the bus to travel at night without a licence. They both denied the charges before Molo chief magistrate Samuel Wahome. They were released on Sh1 million bail or an alternative bond of Sh5 million each. The bus crashed at Fort Tenan along the Londiani-Muhoroni road on October 10.
