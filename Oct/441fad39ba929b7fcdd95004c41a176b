President
Uhuru Kenyatta has asked parents not to pile pressure on students pass national
exams as such moves fuel cheating. Education experts have cited that societal pressure that puts exam as a measure of success as a major cause of cheating. Uhuru said in Sotik on Monday that parents should pray and encourage their children other than compel them to pass. "Let learners get what they deserve. A child who is meant to join
university will do so regardless of passing exams or not," he said. "Let
us reduce pressure of our children as they are all gifted in different ways," Uhuru
said. He said that with the government's assurance of a 100 per cent
transition from primary to
secondary school, parents need not to panic. "Those who do not qualify to join universities will get slots in technical colleges," Uhuru said. The President said the country needs a technical labour force from those who graduate from the technical and vocational colleges.
