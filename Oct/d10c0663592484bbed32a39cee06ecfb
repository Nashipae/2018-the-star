Jimmy Gait is back with a new song, Pokea Sifa. He quit the industry after he was trolled online, but has now reinvented himself. The song is about the hardships he went through and his victories. “It is...[meant] to encourage someone somewhere giving up and to tell them that if God has not blessed you, take your time because He is a God of another chance,” Jimmy told Adelle and Shaffie on Kiss 100. The Huratete singer almost committed suicide due to cyberbullying. So how did he pick himself up? “I had a business idea. I did 59 presentations and all of them were turned down for some reason. Then one day I was in this place taking coffee [when someone saw me and recognised me] from my interview with Larry Madowo and asked me why people were bullying me. “I started talking to them about my business idea and they liked it. They gave me an appointment and in a week’s time, money started coming into my account and that was how I picked myself up.” Jimmy is running the Hisiah campaign to raise awareness on cyberbullying.
