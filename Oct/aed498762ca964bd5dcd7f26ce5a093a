Nurses in Kakamega have given the county two weeks to sign their collective bargaining agreement and implement their scheme of service. They said if the county fails to sign the CBA, they will go on strike. Branch secretary general Robinson Bulunya on Tuesday urged the county government to explain why the nurses’ scheme of service is not being implemented. He condemned the arrest of KNUN national secretary general Seth Panyako at Kenyatta National Hospital on Monday for allegedly inciting nurses at the facility to strike. Panyako was released on Tuesday on Sh50,000 personal bond. He denied the charge of breaching the peace and causing a disturbance. Bulunya said, “The introduction of the universal healthcare by President Uhuru Kenyatta has not gone down well with some individuals who are out to sabotage the programme and insubordinate him. By so doing, they want nurses to keep on running on the streets and leave people dying to ruin the President’s legacy.” Kakamega branch chairman Eliud Molenje said, “We are condemning the intimidation that has been meted out on our nurses. Recently there was a nurse who was assaulted at KNH and nothing has been done.”
