Zambia has lost one of its top female football referees after she succumbed on Wednesday morning to injuries sustained in an accident on Saturday. Leah Namukonda, one of two female Fifa accredited officials, died at Ndola Central Hospital in northern Zambia where she was admitted. She had gone to see a friend hours after officiating a domestic league match and she was involved in a road accident, according to Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) Vice-President Rix Mweemba. “We are devastated as an association because she was one of the few female referees we have... it's very sad because we were one strong family," he said. Before Namukonda’s death, Zambia had two Fifa female referees and two assistants. Gladys Lengwe is now the only female Fifa-accredited referee.
