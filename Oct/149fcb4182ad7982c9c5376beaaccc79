A report by a surveyor hired by Seefar Apartments owners says the buildings are not on riparian land. The tenants hired Kolmans Geomantic consultants to determine the proximity of the apartments to Nairobi Dam. The consultant stated that the shortest distance point on the embankment to Seefar apartments is 42m. The 12-storey building has 288 units of two and three bedrooms. Nema and the Water Resources Authority in a notice dated September 12 to Edermann Property - the developer - said the building is on Nairobi Dam’s riparian reserve. The consultant used survey data from the survey of Kenya Headquarters in Ruaraka. “A topo-cadastral survey was done on LR NO.209/12108 and part of the Nairobi dam adjacent to Seefar apartment,” the consultant Erick Mithamo said.
