The national government is yet to meet its pledge of waiving the Sh479 million debt owed to the government by Meru Dairy Union. President Uhuru Kenyatta announced the waiver when he visited Meru on June 23, last year. The initial loan amount was Sh188 million borrowed from the Finnish government in 1991, but interest accumulated after the collapse of dairy firms, including KCC, in the 1990s. Meru dairy union CEO Kennedy Gitonga said last year said many financial institutions had avoided working with the union, making it difficult to expand and modernise the sector. “With the waiver, the union will be able to acquire the latest technology to modernise operations and make it more competitive, resulting in better returns for dairy farmers and shareholders,” Gitonga said. Union chairman Simon Kiruja on Friday said they are yet receive any official communication from the government. "We hope things are in progress and we will soon get communication from treasury," Kiruja said. The officials spoke at at Meru dairy farmers meeting at Gitoro showground, Imenti North constituency, on September 28, where they attended 5th annual farmers field day. Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri was chief guest. Gitonga said farmers should produce more milk because “the future is promising.” “The profit is in the volume and not in the price. The more they produce, the more money they will make,” Gitonga said. The union processes 140,000 litres per day, but it will be able to produce 300,000 litres and increase to 500,000 if there is demand. Last year before the election, Gitonga said the waiver was made after then Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi lobbied for the union. “We will also support Kiraitu for governor as he has shown he cares about the well-being of dairy farmers,” Gitonga said.
