City life is demanding and fast-paced, so it is important that families find ways to spend time together. One wonderful way to spend a day is to visit the Nairobi National Park. When planning a family day in the park, the following basic tips could make your day really fantastic: 1) Try to pre-plan your food and drinks in advance 2) Use a cooler box with ice packs to keep food and drinks fresh and cold 3) It’s worth waking up very early for a game drive 4) Stop at a picnic site for a meal together 5) Pack a good set of binoculars 6) A map and some basic ID books are useful when seeing various species 7) Stimulate nature interest for young children in the car with fun activities like quizzes and info charts 8) Having a decent camera helps to enhance the experience, as you are able to capture some of your sightings in the form of photos 9) Don’t travel too much. Take time to sit and relax at various dams and treed areas. For example, sitting quietly in some parts of the park, like at a dam or in the forest, can be very therapeutic. I believe God created nature with so much beauty and diversity for us humans to enjoy and appreciate. 10) Don’t worry about finding lions first. Rather, focus on enjoying every species, and then if a lion sighting happens, it will be a special bonus 11) Slow down to the pace of nature, and relax! The tranquil peace in the park is tangible and very real. A day in the park is a real “soul tonic” medicine for the inner being, an escape from the hustle and bustle around us.
