Environment CS Keriako Tobiko yesterday urged those administering KCSE and KCPE exams to ensure integrity of the tests. He said government ministries have a joint responsibility to ensure candidates sit their exams peacefully and in a way that guarantees reliable results. KCPE exam began yesterday. “The integrity of our national exams can’t be overemphasised. Exams affect lives of our children. We all have a stake to ensure we enhance the process,” he said. Tobiko spoke after supervising the distribution of exam papers to 103 centres in Athi River, Machakos. He was at the office of the deputy county commissioner. He opened the exam container at 6am. “I’m impressed with the entire team. I arrived here by 5.30am and found the deputy county commissioner, the county director of education, the Athi River OCPD, Knec officials, centre managers and security personnel. I thought I would wait for them,” Tobiko said.
