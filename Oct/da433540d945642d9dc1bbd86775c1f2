 Retired President Daniel arap Moi has reiterated that Moi Day is not for pomp and colour but an occasion to help the less fortunate in society. Moi said he is happy that the day has been reinstated. It should be a day of refl ection and acknowledgment of God’s blessings, he said in a statement released from his Kabarak home, Nakuru. The High Court reinstated Moi Day as a public holiday last November. “Instead of pomp and colour celebrations, this should be a day of refl ection and acknowledgment of God’s blessings and our feeling to live as per God’s wishes.

The retired President thanked all those who sent him goodwill messages. “My everlasting desire is to see a united country, Kenyans living in unity and harmony as the children of God,” he said. The move by the Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to declare October 10 as a public holiday received mixed reactions from Kenyans. Matiang’i said on Monday, “In Judicial Review No. 292 of 2017, the court affirmed that October 10 remains a public holiday to be observed as such. Going by this decision therefore 10th of October shall be a public holiday.” But despite clearing the air the holiday, Matiang’i said the country would lose nothing by not marking it. As an emerging economy, Kenyans need to “optimally use” their time, the CS said. Click here for the latest political news
