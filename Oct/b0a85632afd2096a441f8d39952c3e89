Ugandan singer-turned-political leader Bobi Wine has spoken out against Kanye West’s meeting with Uganda President Yoweri Museveni at State House, Entebbe, last week. He called the meeting immoral. “West is hobnobbing with a President who has been in power now for 32 years and restricts any freedom, a country where opposition activists are tortured and imprisoned,” Wine said. “It would have been great if he had used his voice for the good of [the] people in Africa. I’m a musician but I am not allowed to stage a show in my own country because I disagree with the President. It is very disappointing.” West and wife Kim Kardashian gave Museveni a pair of Yeezy sneakers and discussed the country’s tourism and arts sectors, according to a statement released by the President. “I held fruitful discussions with the duo on how to promote Uganda’s tourism and the arts,” Museveni posted Wine was arrested in August during a campaign stop and tortured while in prison. About 100 artists, including Damon Albarn and Chris Martin, signed a statement condemning his arrest. He was flown to America for treatment and returned to Uganda in September. West was in Uganda to record his delayed album YANDHI , which is due out in November. West, a Trump supporter, may have chosen the country to record his album due to Museveni’s stand on the US President.
