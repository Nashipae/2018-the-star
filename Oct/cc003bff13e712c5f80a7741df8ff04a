Music duo Navy Kenzo have come out to dismiss claims by Harmonize that they have joined Wasafi Records, managed by Diamond Platinumz. Harmonize took to Instagram to announce that Navy Kenzo had joined Wasafi after Navy and Diamond released a song together, Katika. The collabo has over one million views and is trending number one on YouTube. “Nisaidie kuwakaribisha na Navykenzo Usafini! Mie sipendagi mambo za siri siri kwani Tunamuogopa nani? Welcome to the family WCB4LIFE @nahreel & @aikanavykenzo #Katika is out Dallas, Tx toniht,” wrote Harmonize on Instagram. Navy Kenzo’s Aika confirmed Harmonize’s announcement, saying: "Ni usafi tu." However, Navy Kenzo set the record straight, saying they haven’t joined Wasafi. The duo is being managed by Diamond’s manager Sallam SK, but they are not signed to Wasafi. They responded to the claims while speaking to the press on Sunday night, during the Biko Jibebe Challenge at Mlimani City, Dar es Salaam.
