Education CS Amina Mohammed has warned parents and teachers against aiding their children to cheat in the scheduled national examinations. She told journalists at the Centre for Mathematics, Science and Technology (CEMASTEA) on Monday that anyone found culpable will be arrested on the spot, charged, and prosecuted. Amina said no parent will be allowed to visit their children in boarding schools during the examination period. She further warned that parents will be personally liable for children found with mobile phones while in school. "Such children will be immediately suspended and not allowed to sit for the examination," she said. The CS said only the center managers will be allowed to carry their mobile phones during the exams. At least 1,000,759 KCPE and 664,586 KCSE candidates are expected to write their exams in three-weeks' time. Amina further said 30 centres are under intensive surveillance and anyone found collecting money to compromise the examination and administration will be brought to book. She said they have finalised all preparations and will see 459 containers carrying examination papers flagged off. KCPE will be administered between October 29 and November 1, while KCSE will run from November 5 to November 30. Education PS Belio Kipsang said it was regrettable that the ministry spends a lot of resources to protect exams. "Exams should be done in the best way possible yet we release so much resources to protect our kids from parents, teachers and cheating." KNEC chairman George Magoha noted that in last year's national exams, Sh25 million was used to protect the exams. He warned parents against purchasing fake papers for candidates. "Stop the nonsense and let the children just revise for their exams." Magoha said: "Stop buying fake papers and send the money to mosque or church." Read: Uhuru assures KCPE, KCSE candidates of fair and secure 2018 exams Click here for the latest political news
