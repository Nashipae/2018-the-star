National women’s football team, Harambee Starlets’ forward Esse Akida has landed a six-month renewable contract deal with top flight Israel side, Hapoel Morasha Ramat HaSharon Football Club. Akida, who is a regular national team player, has been away in Israel training for the last two weeks before she put pen on paper on Thursday. Akida moved from Kenya women’s Premier League side, Spedag, to join current league leaders and former champions Thika Queens in June this year. Thika team manager, Fredrick Chege confirmed the development and wished her well at the new club. “She has been away for trials for two weeks and I’m glad she impressed. As much as we will miss her presence in our quest to reclaim the league title, we want to wish her well and hope that her move will open doors for other players,” observed Chege. Akida’s departure from the Thika based side brings to three the number of players who have left the side this year. Faith Kwamboka and Christine Kitaru left for Kansas University in the United States of America having landed a five year scholarship last July. Akida’s move brings to four, the number of national team players who have joined professional ranks. Others are Vihiga Queens’ striker Teresha Engesha and Gaspo duo of forward Mary Kinuthia and midfielder Christine Nafula, who are attached to Swedish Division II side Dalhem Football Club in Sweden. Meanwhile, visiting Thika will be seeking revenge when they battle on form Trans Nzoia Falcons today at the Manour Agricultural Centre as the second leg of the FKF women’s Premier League gathers ground.
