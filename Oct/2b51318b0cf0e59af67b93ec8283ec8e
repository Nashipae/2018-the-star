The murder case in which five people are on trial for the brutal killings of human rights lawyer Willie Kimani, his client and taxi driver failed to take off yesterday as had been scheduled. The suspects turned up in court but they were sent back because the judge was not sitting as she was engaged elsewhere. Justice Jessie Lesiit, who is handling the high-profile murder case that involves four police officers and an informer â€“ was said to be engaged in other official duties. The case began in 2016 and is nearing conclusion with the prosecution having called more than 30 witnesses. Yesterday, the court was expected to hear testimony from an expert and only eight witness are remaining before the prosecution closes its case. Four AP officers, Fredrick Leliman, Stephen Chebulet, Sylvia Wanjiku and Leonard Maina Mwangi, and a police informer Peter Ngugi, have denied murdering Kimani, his client Josephat Mwenda and their taxi driver Joseph Mururi.

They had gone to the court for a case in which Mwenda had accused Leliman of assault. Their bodies were retrieved one week later at Athi River in Ol Donyo Sabuk and they were stashed in gunny bags. One of the witness said the victims hands were tied while their heads were wrapped with supermarket paper bags. The court also heard that two strange cars were seen at night, at a field where the three are said to have been killed before their bodies were transported to Ol Donyo Sabuk.
