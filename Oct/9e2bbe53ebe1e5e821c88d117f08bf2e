Kenyan actress and former radio presenter Neomi Nganga's life is inspired by her rocky background. The 'Style by Neomi' founder says being raised in the slums of Nairobi taught her how to be hardworking. "My background of slums is what keeps me pushing ahead, because it was not easy for me, especially after losing my mum, although my bros were there to support me," Neomi told Massawe on Radio Jambo. "At some time, they (brothers) had to concentrate on their families and I had to pay my rent at the age of 17 years, and I don't share my story for people to sympathise with me but to inspire someone else." Celebrities who have worn her dresses include Krysteen Savane, who wore a gorgeous neon green gown with an African print over-skirt to the Oscars, and Catherine Kamau.
