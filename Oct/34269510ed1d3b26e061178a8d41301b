Two people were arrested and another seriously beaten by a mob for attempting to disrupt a Bunge Mashinani in Kithimani, Machakos, on Wednesday. The arrests were made after angry residents ejected three men from the meeting for attempting to break it up three times. Police rescued the duo from the residents and whisked them away. The three were among a group of people suspected to have been hired by a politician to heckle MCAs during the Machakos County Assembly’s Bunge Mashinani in Kithimani Stadium. They hurled pepper spray in one of the tents where people were seated and later attacked youths who confronted them. This led to a melee and residents ejected them. One man suffered serious injuries and was taken to a health facility. Police intervened, arrested his two accomplices and locked them up at Kithimani police station. Others escaped as residents charged at them. The incident led to the suspension of the proceedings for about an hour. It later resumed as youths kept vigil. The reason for the disruption was not immediately clear. The MCAs debated and passed several motions, including construction of bus parks in market centres such as Mlolongo, Kyumvi, Matuu and Masii. Speaker Florence Mwangangi said Bunge Mashinani brings the assembly closer to the people so they understand house operations, ask questions and interact. “Most residents cannot get to the assembly, so we are holding sessions in the wards. We started in Kithimani but are committed to holding Bunge Mashinani in all the 40 wards,” she said. More than 2,000 residents, MCAs from Makueni county, pupils from nearby schools, Machakos Youth Bunge representatives and the Kajiado speaker attended.
