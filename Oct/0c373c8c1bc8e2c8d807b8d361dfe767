Universities have been asked to stop teaching only theory but instead equip students with skills so they can be prepared for the job market. University Education and Research CAS Collette Suda said only through such initiatives will universities be regarded as engines of opportunities and excellence. “Universities must get away from academic theories and give graduates skills that will help them fit well in the job market and create jobs for themselves and others,” she said. Suda spoke on Friday at the University of Embu during the institution’s third graduation ceremony for more than 500 graduands. Prof Daniel Mugendi was installed as the university’s first vice chancellor. The institution also received two Quality Management Systems Certifications from the Kenya Bureau of Standard. The ceremony was presided over by Florida University lecturer Prof PK Nair, who was hosted by chancellor Musili Wambua. Nair advised the graduands to change peoples’ lives with ideas and skills they learnt at the university and avoid being satisfied with what they have, but advance their training. In June, a new directorate for institutions of higher learning was launched to help the students make informed decisions in university courses. The Office of Career Services directorate targeted 73 universities and constituent colleges as well as 200 public tertiary institutions. Education CS Amina Mohamed said, “The Office of Career Services is expected to play a crucial role in improving the quality of training and enhancing students’ chances of landing a job.” The career office aims to reduce ithe high rate of unemployment.
