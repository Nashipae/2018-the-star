 Machakos governor Alfred Mutua yesterday asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to fast-track lifestyle audits. Mutua said nothing much is heard of the audits nowadays and urged Uhuru to intervene. “I am urging Kenyatta to ensure that the lifestyle audits are done. We started well as a country by calling for lifestyle audits but we no longer hear of [them],” he said. Mutua addressed the press outside his office in Machakos town. “Some prominent people have transferred their stolen title deeds to their househelps so that their family members do not get traced to the properties,” he said. Mutua however said the audit and war on corruption should not be turned into a political witch-hunt. The governor said he was happy to have been cleared by the Director of Public Prosecutions after he was accused of irregularly buying vehicles for his cabinet. “We saved the county a lot of money. It is important that the investigative organs are left to do their work. We spent only Sh35 million out of Sh140 million that had been allocated,” Mutua said. Click here for the latest political news
