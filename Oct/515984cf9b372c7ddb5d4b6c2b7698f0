Murang’a senator Irungu Kang’ata wants his county assembly to impose a 40 per cent levy on revenue generated from water supplied to Nairobi. He said on Sunday that the money will help expand water connections in the county. Governor Mwangi wa Iria had proposed a 25 per cent levy. But Kang’ata said the amount should be raised to 40 per cent because the local community is also expected to conserve the environment to sustain supply. “How are we expected to conserve the forests when we’re not benefitting from it in any way?” the lawmaker asked. Wa Iria said the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company makes more than Sh10 billion every year from the 500 million litres of daily supply. With the completion of the Northern Collector Tunnel next year, about one billion litres of water will be channelled from Murang’a to Nairobi everyday, he said. The county chief said 25 per cent would amount to Sh2 billion every year — enough to connect 60 per cent of residents tot tap water. Kang’ata said he has written to Water CS Simon Chelugui to convene a meeting of all parties — the county government, assembly, water companies and the national government. He expressed concerns that the endless wrangles in the county over water management may scare away investors and hurt residents. “We have to fight for revenue sharing for our water, but I don’t support the fighting we’ve been seeing,” he said. Majority leader Eric Kamande said MCAs will meet residents this week as they draft a bill that seeks to regulate the water sector. Click here for the latest political news
