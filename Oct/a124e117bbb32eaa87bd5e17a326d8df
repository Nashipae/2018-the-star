People travelling between Nyeri and Nairobi will take only 25 minutes one-way if they opt to fly. A private airline has launched flights between Nyaribo Airstrip in Nyeri to Wilson Airport in Nairobi. It takes two and a half hours to travel from Nyeri town to Nairobi by road. A flight will cost Sh3,000. The first commercial aircraft, an 11-seater owned by Bush Air, touched down at Nyaribo Airstrip in the outskirts of Nyeri town at 11.48am on Saturday. On board were ICT Cabinet secretary Joe Mucheru, Nyeri deputy governor Caroline Karugu and Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu. Mucheru asked the county government and local investors to set up eateries, curio shops and businesses that thrive around air travel. Nyeri governor Mutahi Kahiga was at the airstrip to witness the maiden flight. For many years, the idle airstrip was used by local farmers to dry maize and graze cows and goats. The governor lauded the national government for enabling the commercial flights saying it is a major milestone for Nyeri county. The launch of flights will boost trade and tourism in the two counties, Kahiga said. He said commercial flights mean that travellers cut down on time of travel while the tourism industry and businesses will get a huge boost. Those in the maiden flight expressed their excitement saying the flight was safe and enjoyable. The national government has already tarmacked the road leading to Nyaribo Airstrip and installed street lighting.
