The DPP has filed a notice to appeal High court decision to set free widow of slain Muslim cleric Aboud Rogo. Haniya Sagar was sentenced to ten years imprisonment in February by a Magistrate court for terror-related offences. On Friday, High court Judge Dora Chepkwony acquitted her terming the sentence as unfair conviction. Chepkwony said evidence was weak and far-fetched. Sagar was charged in 2016 alongside three others. Through state counsel Ngina Mutua, the DPP today said he was aggrieved by the entire decision to acquit Sagar. Mutua said they will be filing their appeal within 14 days as required by the constitution. Judge Chepkwony had directed that Sagar remains in police custody pending the filing of the appeal by the DPP.
