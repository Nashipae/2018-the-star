A fisherman drowned while casting his nets at Lake Naivasha's Karagita beach on Sunday amid concerns of illegal fishing in the water body. David Kilo, the Boat Owners Association chair, said the man's body was retrieved on Monday after he went missing the previous day. He said the body was discovered by fishers adding that it remained unclear if the fisherman was accompanied by others. In a separate incident, a child fell into a bucket full of water and drowned in Kayole estate. The child's mother was washing clothes outside the house at the time the child, who was pronounced dead on arrival at a nearby hospital, drowned. Emotions ran high as the parents tried to come to terms with the early morning incident. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said the bodies were taken to Naivasha sub-county hospital mortuary.
