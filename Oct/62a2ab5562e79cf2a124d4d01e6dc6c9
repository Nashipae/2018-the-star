Police in Baringo are looking for a man, 30, who reportedly killed his wife at their farm in Biretwonin village, Baringo North on Monday. Laban Kamuren fled after beating Judith Chesang, 22, to death in unclear circumstances. The woman left behind a 1-year-old child. Judith's sister Nancy Chesang said they were harvesting sorghum at the family farm with two other women during the 10am incident. "I watched my in-law hit my sister on the head several times before she collapsed and became unconscious. The other women fled." "As I was trying to help lift up my sister, Laban returned and hacked her with a panga on the neck and head," Nancy said. She said the assailant, having realised he had killed the woman, fled and left the baby crying. Sibilo assistant chief Agnes Keitany said they suspect the attack was occasioned by an unresolved domestic squabble. "The couple separated last month and the woman decided to go live with her parents who hail from the neighborhood," the chief said. Click here for the latest political news
