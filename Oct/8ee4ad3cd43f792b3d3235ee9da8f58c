Police in Konoin, Bomet, are searching for area MP Brighton Yegon to record a statement in connection to the abduction of a man last Sunday. DCIO Felix Mutua told the Star on the phone on Tuesday the MP is yet to respond to the summon. He said 29-year-old Nicholas Ngetich alias Eric Junior is nursing serious injuries after he was assaulted. The MP has denied beating up the man. “Those are totally strange allegations…I am the one who saved him, I had to fix him in my car and in fact he is the one who requested that I should not drop him anywhere around that venue for fear of being attacked and so we had to take some distance away before dropping him,” Yegon told the Star on Tuesday. Mutua said they have started probing the incident and if the MP does not record a statement in the next two days, they will go to court and seek a warrant of arrest. Ng'etich, who is from Kapset village, claims he was picked up by the MP who was in the company of six other people. He said he was bundled into the car and driven to James Finlay tea estate. He said he was beaten up because of political differences with the MP. Ngetich claimed he was driven around the tea plantation for more than three hours and was assaulted before being bundled out of the car. He told journalists on Monday that he was on a boda-boda with two other people heading back home after a football match at Chebangangn when the incident occurred. He recorded a statement at Konoin police station on Monday morning under OB NO. 23/15/10/2018. Ngetich who was accompanied by his parents had a bandaged hand and face. “The MP's driver stopped us and asked me to enter the vehicle. I refused, and he pulled me off the bike and pushed me into the vehicle and sped off,” Ng'etich claimed. Click here for the latest political news
