Cheaper internet is on its way after a 5,400 km cable system linking Djibouti, Mogadishu and Mombasa undersea cable was launched. The Djibouti Africa Regional Express 1(DARE1) will in due course link major coastal towns in the region and will deliver a capacity of up to 30 terabits per second. TE SubCom will be the main supplier in undersea communications technology and marine services. “It will provide an alternative high-capacity and low-latency route,” the companies said in a joint statement. The partnership is projected to improve on productivity and cost advantages of a short-haul cable route while still maintaining the capacity and reliability of a much larger long-haul system using SubCom’s scalable system design. The DARE1 consortium is composed of Djibouti Telecom and Somtel, and is configured as a three fiber pair trunk, with each fiber pair delivering a cross-sectional capacity of 150 channels at 100 Gbps. It will include diversified Points of Presence with options for future connectivity via SubCom’s industry-leading optical reconfigurable add/drop multiplexing (ROADM) product line. Abdirashid Duale, the CEO Dahabshiil Group said the submarine cable will offer affordable internet services and ease congestion across existing systems. “DARE1 will be the first submarine cable to link Mogadishu to the global network.”
