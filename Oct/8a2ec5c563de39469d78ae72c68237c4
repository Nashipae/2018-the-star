Loise Yatich's mother has maintained her daughter will not be buried until her killers are found. The former Kakamega DC's wife was found murdered after a rape ordeal at her house in Eldoret on October 16. The family sought a court injunction stopping the TSC's curriculum support development officer's burial. Her 80-year-old mother Elizabeth Targok said she wants her daughter's stolen property returned and the criminals convicted. Loise was due to be buried at her husband Paul Yatich's home in Talai village, Baringo Central sub-county on Wednesday. "I will not accept anything less than justice," Targok said at her home in Riwo near Kabarbet town on Thursday. She called upon President Uhuru Kenyatta, DP William Ruto, and Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago to intervene. "How can someone be mutilated like a donkey or a dog and some people want to rush to bury just like that?" Targok asked. Loise's brother James Rotich argued that the family was not consulted on the 'rushed' burial plans. "The injunction was informed by the fact that things were rushed without any justice being served," Rotich said. All was set for the Wednesday burial, with friends and relatives in attendance. Reports say the court order was served to MTRH stopping the hospital from releasing Loise's body. Two suspects Laban Cheruiyot and Simon Lumile were arrested at Kabiyet market in Nandi county while driving her vehicle. Police are still pursuing the farmhand who disappeared after the incident.
