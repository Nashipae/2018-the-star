A woman was arrested in Samburu North on Saturday for killing her two-year-old child and injuring another on the neck. County police commander Alfred Agengo told the Star that the injured child was admitted to Samburu county referral hospital in critical condition. The woman, of questionable mental health, reportedly stabbed her first child to death before cutting the others' neck. "She will be taken to court on Monday to face a murder charge," Agengo said. He said the police have launched investigations to establish the motive of the attack. Nachola MCA Lawrence Lorunyei said the suspect was those who had fled from their homes over insecurity in Kawap. "We need counselors to visit the area and talk to the locals as some of them could be suffering from depression." The woman's husband said the wife had a mental problem, saying the same may have contributed to her actions against the kids. "She had gone mad in the past but later became normal. I donâ€™t know if her madness returned," he said at Samburu referral hospital. Click here for the latest political news
