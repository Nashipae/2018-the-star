The Constitution says elections should be held on the second Tuesday in August every five years. Some MPs want to change to the third Monday in December every five years. This is a bad idea. There is no special reason why elections should be held in December, although Kenya used to do so. Most Christian countries find that a December election clashes with the Christmas holiday season. Arguably a Christmas election allows voters to return to their home villages. Conversely it makes difficult for citizens to vote where they work and where they could cast a vote based on policy rather than just adding to the ethnic block vote of their home area. In any case the third Monday of December might not coincide with Christmas. This year it would be December 17, eight days before Christmas. The Judiciary and the IEBC would have to work through the holiday handling the inevitable appeals. And it would not coincide with the holiday season for voters. Let's stick to the Constitution's August date.
