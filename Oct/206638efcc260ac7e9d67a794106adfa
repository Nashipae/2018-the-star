Former Nairobi Town Clerk John Gakuo’s lawyers have said they will seek to clear his name because he was wrongfully convicted for the Sh283 million Mavoko cemetery scandal. Gakuo, 68, died on Tuesday at the Mbagathi District Hospital where he was rushed from nairobi West Prison. He was sentenced to three years in jail in May. Lawyer Assa Nyakundi said Gakuo was not corrupt and he was confident an appeal over his conviction would succeed. “The wrong person was in prison. Gakuo’s record is clean. He brought order to every institution he worked in. It’s a sad thing that such a man should die in prison,” Nyakundi said. His appeal is pending in court.

He said the appeal was to be heard expeditiously and concluded by September. “We are sorry. The delay was not deliberate. His death is unfortunate. No one has control over such situations that is why the appeal can’t proceed today but we will hear it on Thursday next week,” Onyiego said. Defence lawyers said they will file an application to adduce new evidence. On October 4, Onyiego declined to bow out of Gakuo’s appeal case saying an application seeking a judge to disqualify him or herself should be based on real or proven bias, not on perception or hearsay. The Judge also declined to set Gakuo free pending the appeal, saying he failed to provide sufficient reasons. Onyiego said age and a medical condition cited by Gakuo were insufficient because he could get treatment while in prison. Gakuo was convicted alongside former Local Government PS Sammy Kirui.
