The constitutional amendments pushed by Opposition chief Raila Odinga have been criticised by Western leaders. On Saturday, leaders from Western Kenya who converged at Muliro Gardens in Kakamega criticised the opposition leader. Raila wants the country to adopt a three-tier government that would see the formation of 14 regional blocs.This requires constitutional amendment. There is also talk of an enlarged executive and parliamentary system to replace the current winner-take-all presidential system. The leaders said Raila was selfish and his proposals would burden the taxpayer. The leaders included Bungoma senator Moses Wetang’ula, Sports CS Rashid Echesa, MPs Malulu Injendi (Malava), Didmus Baraza (Kimilili), Bishop Titus Khamala, former senator BoniKhalwale and the nurses union boss Seth Panyako. “If someone thinks we’ll go to a referendum to create a position for him, he is mistaken. We can only amend the Constitution to serve the common man andbring money to the counties raising the current 15 per cent to 45 per cent,” Wetang’ula said. Kimilili MP Baraza said leaders should be united for the sake of the people they serve. “We should be united by the problems facing our people every day regardless of our party affiliations. We need to have a Constitution that will provide solutions and not create more problems and add burdens,” Baraza said. The MP said the handshake between Raila and President Uhuru Kenyatta has made life difficult. “A good Father does not drink his children’s milk. Raila’s handshake is making life unbearable for Kenyans. Imagine, he supported the eight per cent levy on petroleum products,” he said.
