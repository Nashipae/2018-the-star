Forty-four inmates including 17 serving life sentence at Naivasha GK prison are among the candidates sitting this year’s KCPE exam. Hours to the exam, the inmates exuded confidence that they would perform better than last year. Prison welfare officer Mose Kodek said the number of candidates this year had risen from 33 to 44. Kodek said that among the group were 17 serving life sentences, another two with the death sentence while the rest were on long sentences. “The perennial challenges of lack of teachers and learning equipment continue to haunt us, but we are optimistic that the inmates shall perform well,” Kodek said. He urged well-wishers to support the education system which had continued to act as one of the main tools for rehabilitation. Principal Alex Ndiba, who is also an inmate, said 20 prisoners would be sitting the KCSE exam and another 44 for KCPE. Candidates received examination materials from the Eric Gichuki Foundation. Officer in charge of the prison Mathews Mutisya said inmates serving life and death sentences accounted for the highest number of students in the learning programme. He said they had been forced to use fellow inmates and a few warders to teach the inmate. “We have around 1,900 inmates and of the number, over 1,000 are on life and death sentences,” he said.
