Coast politicians flirting with DP William Ruto will not win him the region’s support in 2022, Mombasa youth have said. Those working with the DP include Mohamed Ali (Nyali), Ali Mbogo (Kisauni) and Badi Twalib (Jomvu). On Wednesday, the Capital Youth Caucus Association said it has been sidelined despite working hard for Jubilee in the run-up to the last election. The youth said the Jubilee administration promised jobs, youth empowerment and a crackdown on narcotics, but nothing has been done. “As we speak, 70 per cent members have no job,” secretary Evans Momanyi said at Paloma Gardens in Likoni. “We no longer want to be used by politicians. Before 2022, we’ll have changed things.” The group wants 30 per cent of residents hired by state agencies. Shilla Karembo said the region suffers because their leaders are not aggressive. “Why is it that [Garissa Township MP] Aden Duale can push for his people to get opportunities in government and our own cannot?” she asked. Bruce John said politicians accompanying Ruto are interested in handouts and have lost touch with voters. He warned Ruto that he will “lose big time” if he keeps them. “Some of them are very junior in politics and have no grip,” John said.
