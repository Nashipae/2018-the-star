Baringo leaders on Saturday vowed to spearhead peace to end prolonged cross-border banditry and cattle rustling. They spoke at Michuki ground in Chemoling'ot, Tiaty, during Mashujaa Day celebrations. The leaders included MPs William Cheptumo (Baringo North), William Kamket (Tiaty), Charles Kamuren (Baringo South). Others are Governor Stanley Kiptis, Deputy Governor Jacob Chepkwony, Woman Representative Gladwel Cheruiyot, assembly Speaker David Kiplagat and several MCAs. "We need to bold and talk in one voice to end the perennial problem of border disputes," Cheptumo said. Baringo is inhabited by the Tugen, Pokot and Ilchamus pastoral communities. Cheptumo said insecurity has affected the county since independence. Leaders said the county is faced by food and water shortage owing to persistent drought. They said the economy has declined because of insecurity. They appealed for peace to revive tourism in the county. Kamuren urged MCAs to also preach peace and unite bordering communities He said displaced Ilchamus had been resettled in the Mukutani homes last week after living at Eldume IDP camp in Marigat for one and half years. "They are in urgent need of food, shelter and medication," he said He asked the government to deploy more police officers and reservists to patrol the porous borders.
