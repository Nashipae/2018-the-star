Lovers of Afro music will be treated to a night of fun today as James Jozee, director of the renowned Afro-smooth band Gogosimo, unveils his latest solo album, titled 'Hatua', at Alliance Française in Nairobi. The multi-talented musician of Congolese, French, and Kenyan heritage is set to thrill his fans in an action-packed show that will mark the official launch of the 14-track album. In an interview with Word Is, Jozee said ‘Hatua’, meaning ‘a step ahead’, is the culmination of two and a half years of his work that seeks to review his long musical journey. “Hatua is all about my growth in music, from where I was to where I am now,” Jozee said. “The album is for the young and mature. This is now the new me and it is all what I have grown to be. It is inspired by the struggles we have in life, like when I think of how am I gonna raise my four boys, my relationship with God, and all that. I mean, there are a lot of emotions involved when doing my music. I talk about everything." James has performed at high-profile shows, including Fally Ipupa’s Nairobi tour as well as the Safaricom Jazz festivals. The band performed alongside Koffi Olomide at the Koroga Festival in March 2016. He has also worked with the late Congolese Papa Wemba. "Every moment of my performance is very special. Kenyans have now started appreciating Kenyan artistes, and that is so great for us artistes," James said.
