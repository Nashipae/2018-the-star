The High Court in Bungoma has stopped the ongoing vetting of chief officers in the county until the matter is heard and determined. The petition had been filed by People living with disability led by Adrain Mukhebi and Benedict Wanyonyi from the Disability Network empowerment Centre. They said Governor Wycliffe Wangamati failed to consider people living with disability as entrenched in law. The matter had been certified urgent. Judge Stephen Riech on Monday directed all parties to appear before him yesterday. The complainants said the county assembly proceeded with the vetting, despite a previous court direction. Riech directed that the vetting stops immediately and all parties to appear for judgment on November 6. Click here for the latest political news
