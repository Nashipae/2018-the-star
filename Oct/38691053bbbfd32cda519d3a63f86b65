A water AGM ended in disarray in Embu after stakeholder representatives walkednout to protest against what they called secret hiring of new directors. They accused water executive Patrick Waganagwa of illegally hiring the new directors. The Embu Water and Sanitation Company was holding its AGM on Friday. Subcounty stakeholders representatives said Waganagwa unilaterally appointed five directors. They said some of those appointed had forged academic papers and were not in the list of nominees submitted by the selection committee. There was a bitter exchange between Waganagwa and the stakeholders before the walkout. “We reject the inclusion of people who were disqualified by the selection committee,” Manyatta rep Grace Njagi said. Other representatives included Knut secretary Josphat Kathumi, county assembly Health committee chairman Harrison Muturi and Kirimari MCA Morris Collo. They threatened to sue Waganagwa.
