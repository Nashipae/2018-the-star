Governor Granton Samboja has vowed to flush out hundreds of illegal herders from the county. Samboja said he won’t be cowed by threats from livestock owners who have refused to leave. “I'm ready to be arrested while fighting for my people. Be warned that if you don’t leave our farms we shall kick you out," the governor said. Speaking during Mashujaa Day celebrations in Taveta, Samboja said the county government will not allow private landowners to enter into agreements with the grazers. “From today, the county will not issue permits to grazers who have deals with private landowners. We will confiscate animals and arrest illegal grazers,” he said. Last week, hundreds of camels were seized by county officials after being found grazing on private farms in Mariwenyi and Mwatate. Samboja said conflict looms between the herders from Northeastern Kenya and residents of Mwatate. Residents have complained of harassment by herders. Samboja said some of the herders are armed and are endangering residents' lives.” Illegal grazers in the Tsavo National Park and ranches have been blamed for persistent human-wildlife conflict in Taita Taveta County. Taita Taveta County Commissioner Rhonda Onyancha said there are plans to kick out the herders from farms and from the national park. She blamed brokers for signing lease agreements with herders without consulting ranch members. She said illegal herders are suspected to be involved in poaching. Onyancha urged residents to remain calm. Taveta MP Naomi Shabaan urged residents settling in the historical Salaita Hill to protect the land from exploitation. She refuted claims that the National Museum of Kenya would re-possess the land where World War I was fought. Click here for the latest political news
