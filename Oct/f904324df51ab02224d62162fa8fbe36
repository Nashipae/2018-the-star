The much-anticipated vote to change the date for the general election from August to December has been defeated. The bill by Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa needed the support of 233 legislators but only 187 turned up. "Honorable members, the members present electronically are 172 and those manually are 15 making a total of 187, accordingly members the house cannot proceed to vote for the motion for the second reading and therefore the motion is defeated," Speaker Justin Muturi said on Wednesday. Wamalwa had argued that the current election dates interfere with the school calendar under the new curriculum. "Sometimes you may think you are very many by dancing and walking up and down in the chambers. In actual sense, you are very few, therefore, the matter is defeated and that is the end," Muturi added. This was the third time for such a bill to be tabled. "The bill was previously tabled by the late Mutula Kilonzo and David Ochieng. We tabled the public participation report and that of the Justice and Legal Affairs which indicated 80 per cent of Kenyans are in support of changing the date," Wamalwa said earlier.
