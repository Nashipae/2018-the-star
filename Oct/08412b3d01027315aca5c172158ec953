Harambee Stars players and fans can afford a sigh of relief after the government cleared a two month salary debt owed to head coach Sebastien Migne and his assistant Nicholas Bourriquet. The youthful coach had gone for three months (July, August and September) without pay and consequently issued an ultimatum to have his dues cleared by last week. After the 3-0 win over Ethiopia, the government released his salary albeit for two months. The ultimatum by the Frenchman was met with an uproar from fans, who deem him as the force behind Stars revitalisation, and feared he would relinquish his services at the touch line. According to Football Kenya Federation president Nick Mwendwa, Migne and his assistant received their salaries for July and August last week and remained hopeful their September and October remunerations will trickle in soon. “I can confirm the coach and his assistant have received their salaries for two months (July and August). He is happy and ready for the job ahead of him. I am optimistic the government will undertake to have their September and October salaries released soon so that they can focus on their job.” Despite the government intervention during the Ethiopia match where Sh25 million was paid to the federation to cater for preparations, Mwendwa revealed of uncleared debts which were incurred during the Ghana match last month. The cash-strapped federation had tabled a budget of Sh17million to the government for the match but received a paltry Sh4 million, forcing them to get some services on credit.
