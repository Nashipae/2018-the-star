The macabre shooting of six people in Dandora on Sunday by a trigger-happy police officer has yet again exposed the rot within law enforcement. Just when the country is expecting a leap of discipline in the recently announced reforms, police literally ran amok and mowed down four members of a family, in the process of trying to stop a crime. It is also evident they tried to clear any evidence by killing an innocent bystander (page 4-5). Such incidents will naturally draw recriminations from the public. They fly in the face of the much-hyped reforms that are expected to inject professionalism in the service. The Dandora incident continues the rising trend of cold-blooded executions of suspects observed over the past two months. Police have shot dead suspects in circumstances that call into question their judgement. We shudder to imagine that the first job of any gun-holding policemen is to shoot — not to defend himself when life is in danger or deter criminals and apprehend them — to kill. We demand that the police officers involved in this heinous murder be held to account for their action. Ipoa must ensure that the rogue police who committed the dastardly crime do not compromise the evidence to defeat their prosecution. The legacy of extrajudicial executions, from Baby Pendo to the blood-curdling assassination at City Park, calls for strong deterrent measures.
