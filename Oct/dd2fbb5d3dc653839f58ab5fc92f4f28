Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i has confirmed that October 10 is a public holiday. However, he did not make a pronouncement in the manner in which the day will be marked or celebrated by Kenyans. Moi Day was removed from the list of national holidays following the promulgation of the Constitution in August 2010. A court ruling in November 2017 reinstated the day to be marked as a holiday on grounds its removal was in contravention of the Public Holidays Act. "Going by the court's decision, therefore, October 10 shall be a public holiday," Matiang'i said in a statement to the media on Monday. "Owing to the elaborate celebrations lined up for all our heroes on Mashujaa Day (October 20), I make no pronouncement on the manner in which October 10 shall be celebrated." He noted that arising from the aforesaid court ruling, the ministry was in the process of making proposals to Parliament for a comprehensive review of the Public Holidays Act "but was unfortunately caught up with time." "The review will address all outstanding matters with respect to public holidays and embrace the spirit of the Constitution on how our heroes will be celebrated," he said. When he made the ruling last November, Justice George Odunga did not specify how the holiday should be celebrated. He left the matter to Parliament and the Interior Cabinet Secretary.
