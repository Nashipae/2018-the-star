Garissa MCAs have been warned against an alleged plot to weaken the administration and impeach the assembly speaker. Garissa governor Ali Korane yesterday accused lawmakers, whom he did not name, of plotting to destabilise the assembly. He was speaking to the press in Garissa town. He said the MCAs were holding night meetings in Nairobi to divide his administration along ethnic lines. “I can assure you they won’t go far with their plans. They also want to have the speaker to undermine the county assembly,” the governor said. Korane said the clandestine meetings aimed at bringing him down will not succeed. He said he had cultivated a cordial working relationship with the county assembly speaker whom he said ‘was there to stay’. He was accompanied by deputy governor Abdi Dagane, speaker Ahmed Abbas and other county leaders and MCAs Ijara MCA Irshad Hilowle also accused the politicians of planning to divide the MCAs along clan and ethnic lines. “I want to assure the governor that we in the assembly are determined to support his government to deliver on its mandate,” Hilowle said. The governor commissioned four new ambulances to serve health institutions across the county. His comments come just a day after National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale hit out at some “political brokers and opportunists”out to divide his community. He said the recent confusion between his supporters and those of Korane was being fueled by the ‘brokers’ for their selfish personal gains. Speaking in Bura, Fafi sub-county on Monday, Duale hit out at unnamed individuals whom he said were working day and night to cause disharmony in the community.
