Chiefs offices, the police and the Registrar of Persons are the most corrupt in the country, the anti-graft agency has said. The EACC in its 2017 National Ethics and Corruption Survey launched yesterday shows the Interior ministry is the most corrupt. “The chief’s offices, encompassing the village elders, led public offices where bribes were paid evidenced by 17.2 per cent of the respondents polled, followed by the Regular Police ( 16.4 per cent) and the Registrar of persons at 10.5 per cent,” EACC chief executive officer Halakhe Waqo said. Others are county health departments at 7.6 per cent, Ministry of Lands at 6.1 per cent, Health ministry ( 5.4 per cent) and Huduma Centres ( 5.1 per cent). “The average bribe dropped to Sh5,058 from Sh7,081 in 2016 and Sh5,648 in 2015,” the report says. The survey launched at KICC was conducted by the EACC and the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics for September to October last year. “The EACC will lobby for harsher punishments for those found guilty of corruption,” EACC chairman Eliud Wabukala said. However, the number of times a bribe was paid increased from 1.27 times to 1.33 times in 2017.
