A woman has sued Nairobi Women’s Hospital for detaining her over Sh4 million bill.Emma Njeri was admitted to the hospital after she suffered stroke and was discharged on May 14.At the time of her discharge, the bill was Sh3.1 million. She managed to pay Sh1.3 million and offered a proposal to settle the balance, which the hospital rejected.According to her suit papers, the hospital detained her. This, she says, has caused her to incur daily charges of Sh5,000, making the bill to skyrocket. “The respondent continues to levy the petitioner a daily charge of Sh5,000, while she is not receiving any treatment as she was discharged on May 14, 2018,” the suit papers read.

She says due to the detention at the hospital, she is unable to participate in the upbringing of her one-year-old son. Njeri wants the court to intervene and order her immediate release. She wants the court to issue orders for compensation for unlawful detention and loss of earnings, occasioned by “false imprisonment”.Njeri says under the Constitution, she is entitled to dignity and freedom of movement, but this has been infringed by her detention of more than five months.“The respondent is infringing on my constitutional rights by continuing to detain me in the hospital even after I was discharged on May 14,” the suit papers indicate.The hospital is yet to file its response, because the case was filed on Friday.
