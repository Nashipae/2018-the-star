President Donald Trump was personally involved in an effort to prevent adult film actress Stormy Daniels from publicly discussing an alleged sexual encounter with him, CNN reported on Tuesday. Quoting a source with direct knowledge of the matter, the news cable says the President told his then-personal attorney Michael Cohen to seek a restraining order against Daniels. This was over concerns that she was contemplating a media interview. "Don't worry, I'll pay for everything," CNN quotes the source in a rephrase of Trump's instruction to lawyer Cohen. The media report further alludes that Trump's son Eric was involved and a lawyer was directed to sign an arbitration document where Daniels reportedly agreed to remain silent on the matter. "At the end of February, The Wall Street Journal reported, an arbitrator privately issued a restraining order against Daniels," CNN reported adding that the actress ignored the same and held an interview with CBS. Daniels claims she and Trump had an affair in 2006 before he was president. Trump has denied the allegation. "During the 2016 campaign, Cohen paid $130,000 (Sh13.1 million) to Daniels as part of a hush agreement," the CNN report states. Click here for the latest political news
