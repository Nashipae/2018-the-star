Low-cost internet service provider poa! Internet will provide Kawangware users with one week of free unlimited internet following service interruptions in the recent weeks. The internet outages were caused by traffic from increased subscriber base on the primary supplier. The process of introducing a new main supplier in September, and converting the primary supplier to a secondary back-up connection left Kawangware customers without Internet for several hours at a time. poa! Internet connects areas of Kibera, Kawangware, Kiambu and Kangeme for as low as Sh10 an hour and Sh50 a day public Wi-Fi. The service also allows residents connect up to five devices to their home Wi-Fi router at any time. “We are crediting all our Kawangware home customers with a week’s free unlimited internet to say sorry. These customers will therefore see the credit applied to their next month’s invoice,” chief operating officer Chris Rhodes said. Rhodes said the unclear laws regarding internet outages around the world have thickened issues of compensations despite it being an essential utility. In Kenya, however, there is no regulation on consumer refunds on Internet downtime. The service was introduced for the first time in 2016 through a partnership with Liquid Telcom. In july, it introduced a different package, unlimited Internet for Sh1,500 a month for rural areas, as a cheaper alternative to 4G data bundles from major mobile service providers.
