Le Band lead member Fidel has ranted on social media about producer MG. Fidel said MG is a good producer but lacks professionalism. During the recording of their hit song, Number 1, MG took them round and round, he said. They paid him as per the agreed amount but it took more than five months for the song to be released. "We kept calling and calling he did not pick up, and so we decided to shoot the video using a demo just waiting for the song," Fidel said. "When I posted my story on social media, many people came out saying he has done the same thing. What he does is ask for money but he does not perform to the expectations as per the deal." Moreover, Fidel said he once asked for a song from him and MG told him he was not around but rather in Kisumu. As Fidel was going to school, he met MG in town. Fidel was too surprised to talk to him he just said hi and walked away. Later on, MG called Fidel and pleaded for forgiveness, saying the band should come in for studio time. They went but to their surprise, MG still kept them waiting in the house, doing nothing, and this was when Fidel's patience level ran thin. They got into a confrontation and Fidel picked up a microphone stand and hit MG. They fought and eventually, MG sent them half the money they had paid him for studio time, and they left his house clear that they will never work with him again. The other band members are Joel and Ken.
