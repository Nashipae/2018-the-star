Kenya should focus on foreign debt because it is easy to repay, Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung’wa has said. The National Assembly Budget and Appropriations committee chairman said external loans charge lower interest than domestic loans — three per cent against about 14 per cent. “We’re better off with foreign debt than domestic debt,” Ichung’wa said on Friday in Diani, Kwale. He spoke during the fifth Speaker’s Roundtable with the private sector. In 2017-18, Kenya paid only Sh84 billion interests on foreign debts, inclusive of government guarantees, against Sh239 billion in interest on domestic debts, the lawmaker said. “We must have a discussion around this. Is it time to externalise most of our debts so we balance our expenditure?” he asked. An unbalanced budget could be the source of the financial difficulties Kenyans face, he said.
