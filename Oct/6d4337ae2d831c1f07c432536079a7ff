Foreign Affairs Chief Administrative Secretary Ababu Namwamba (pictured) has called upon the East African Community member states to hasten the removal of barriers hindering the free movement of goods and services. Addressing education stakeholders at Port Mixed Primary School in Budalang’i constituency, Busia county, on Thursday, the former area MP said hastening the removal of the trade barriers will promote rapid growth of business. He said the removal of the trade barriers will also enable member states to interact better. Namwamba said he will push for the enactment of a law that will remove the barriers that have been hampering the movement of people, goods and services. Scores of Kenyan fishermen around Migingo and other islands in Lake Victoria have undergone persistent harassment by Ugandan marine security, a situation that has caused ill feelings. The former MP thanked the Slovakia government for funding the rehabilitation of classrooms and the acquisition of 15 digital computers valued at Sh330, 000 he said will empower the pupils to be computer literate. “I want to appreciate the Embassy of the Slovak republic through Ambassador Frantisek Dlhopolcek for funding the rehabilitation of classrooms and the provision of 15 digital computers worth Sh330, 000,” said the CAS. He said the next public primary school in the constituency to get a digital computer lab is Rugunga Primary School in Bunyala south. Frantisek said his government has trained over 50 students from Kenya undertaking medical courses at various medical training institutions. He encouraged more students wishing to undertake medical courses to apply.
