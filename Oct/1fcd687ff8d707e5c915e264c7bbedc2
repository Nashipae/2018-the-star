Nandi County once again burst into celebrations after Abraham Kiptum shattered the World Half Marathon record in Valencia on Sunday. Kitpum, who two weeks ago finished second behind Rhonex Kipruto during Isaiah Kiplagat Memorial Ndalat Gaa cross country, shed off four seconds off Eritrea’s Zersenay Tadese previous record of 58:23 to set a new mark of 58:19. Kiptum won Daegu Marathon in a personal best and course record of 2:06.29 in April this year. Kiptum is expected to take the World Half Marathon record to Nandi County just like Eliud Kipchoge did when he set a new world record of 2:01.39 in Berlin Marathon to erase the previous 2:O2.57 held by another Kenyan Dennis Kimetto. Coach Noah Bushienei was full of praise for Kiptum, a boy he started training five years ago. “He made us proud. Since we started training together five years ago, he has been consistent with his career. He is very competitive and he is always focused. I am not surprise with the latest news of a record,” said Bushienei. The tactician said Kiptum has been training not necessarily to win a race but to improve his time hence the motivation to break the record. “He has always researched on how his opponents are doing around the world including their running styles and consistency. That has made him understand what he wants in his career,” said the tactician. He said if Kenya had many athletes, who understand what they want like Kiptum, then we would be winning all races across the globe. “If you observe, Kiptum runs like Kipchoge (Eliud). If you can get ten athletes of such kind, coaches work will become easy. They know the time to wake up and when to proceed for training. For example on Sunday, he ran almost 16km alone without pace makers, meaning he was running against time, not individuals,” added Bushienei.
