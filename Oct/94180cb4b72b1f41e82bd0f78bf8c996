Two tea factories in Bomet and Kericho counties, located near the South Western Mau forest, have moved to the lands and environment court to stop eviction. Through their advocate Kimutai Bosek, the tea companies —Sinendet and Kericho Rural multi-purpose cooperative societies — said they want threats by Bomet county commissioner Geoffrey Omoding stopped. “This matter is of extreme urgency as the county commissioner has been threatening to evict my clients from their property and this will occasion huge losses in business and render several employees in the two firms jobless, exacerbating the poverty levels,” said Bosek. The tea firms argued that the county commissioner has no basis in law to void a land transaction entered into 22 years ago. The petitioners, who appeared before Judge Mohammed Kullow in Narok, also accused the county commissioner of harassment and chest-thumping. They said if not restrained by order of the court, he will implement his ‘ill-conceived’ intentions. Bosek said the two tea factories occupied an area previously covered by tea plantations bought from the Nyayo Tea Zones Development Corporation. Justice Kullow granted seven days leave to the respondent to file and serve the petition and another seven days to the petitioner to respond. He halted any eviction plans until the matter is determined. The case will be heard on October 11. Click here for the latest political news
