Opposition leader Raila Odinga left the country on Saturday for China in what his communications Director Dennis Onyango described as "a short visit". "Mr Odinga left Nairobi shortly after 5 pm today, October 13, 2018," Onyango said in a brief statement on Saturday. Before his departure, Raila was the chief guest at the 18th graduation ceremony of the Kenya Methodist University in Meru. Onyango said the opposition chief will jet back into the country on Tuesday. He did not, however, reveal the nature of business Raila will have in China. Raila's most recent trip abroad was a week-long tour in Germany on August 24.
