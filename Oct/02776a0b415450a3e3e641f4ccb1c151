A teacher was arraigned in Baringo to answer to charges of vandalism and poisoning a water reservoir. Michael Kandie, deputy headteacher Sumeyon primary school in Baringo North, denied the charges before Kabarnet resident magistrate Neloryn Idagwa. He was accused of disconnecting pipes and spraying some dangerous poison at the Kapkirwok water project, which is near the school, last Thursday. Besides poisoning the water, the suspect is said to have inscribed 'Sumu Kali Sana' - very dangerous poison, on the walls of the reservoir. It is alleged that the suspect committed the criminal act after being denied water. Locals reported he was seeking to divert the water to his home. Kandie told the court that the accusations against him are driven by malice. He was released on Sh50, 000 bond or Sh5,000 bail. A sample of the water was taken to government chemists for analysis. The case will be mentioned on October 31. Click here for the latest political news
