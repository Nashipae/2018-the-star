Coach Godfrey Wakachunga will be part of the Butali Warriors line-up when they face Sikh Union in the Kenya Premier League match tomorrow at City Park. Wakachunga’s move to temporarily abandon his role at the bench has been necessitated by the injuries reported in his camp, where two of his defenders Lawrence Okubasu and Robert Amadi are sidelined. Butali lost 1-0 to Parkroad Badgers in their last match—a result that has seen Police come within three points of the leaders. Butali top the standings with 45 points and will be keen to extend their tally to 48 points when they take on the 2012 champions, who are placed sixth with 20 points. Ahead of the match, Wakachunga is expected to resume his defence duties to cushion the situation. The 2015 champions will also miss the services of Brian Musasia and Tony Nikuri through suspensions. He said: “Our defence has been hit by injuries and I think I have to chip in and play. I am fully fit but we will have to discuss as the technical bench and see how best I will fit in as a player. Amadi and Kubasu are injured while Musasia and Nikuri are suspended thus necessitating my move. It is a must win for us and we have to explore all options available.” Today, relegation candidates Nakuru will rely on home advantage when they battle Parkroad Badgers at their backyard. Nakuru are third from bottom with 16 points—behind their opponents. Defending champions Police will play bottom-placed Western Jaguars at Kakamega and will be hoping Sikh Union beat Butali—a result that will see them go top should they floor the hosts .A fourth placed Greensharks play a second from bottom Parklands tomorrow at City Park.
