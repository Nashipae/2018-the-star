The Jubilee Party is waiting for direction from leader President Uhuru Kenyatta on a proposed constitutional amendment campaign to reduce the number of elected seats, National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale has said. He said Jubilee’s focus is on delivering the Big Four agenda and implementing the party’s manifesto. Duale said Jubilee has no brief on the proposed amendment to the Constitution from Uhuru. He spoke yesterday at Sisters’ Maternity Home in Garissa town during a graduation ceremony for 47 women. “If the proposal comes up during the party parliamentary meeting, then we shall discuss, make recommendations and come up with a party position,” Duale said. “Our main focus for now is on the Big Four that include access to healthcare, building of roads, expanding the economy, extending the SGR to Kisumu and ensuring our country is safe and secure.” Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria in a Facebook post yesterday said the proposed constitutional amendments should focus on reducing the number of elected leaders to ease the financial burden on the taxpayers. Kuria said his Punguza Mzigo campaign will soon become a reality, adding that the constitutional amendment campaign, which he had started a while back, would soon materialise after his and the Raila Odinga-led Okoa Kenya initiatives failed. “We have to reduce representative positions to provide moral leadership for a massive retrenchment of civil servants and rationalisation and optimisation of government functions and processes,” Kuria said. Two governors — Mombasa’s Hassan Joho and his Busia counterpart Sospeter Ojaamong — have backed the calls for a constitutional change for the counties to receive a large allocation of the national budget. The referendum is likely to be a showdown between the Uhuru and ODM leader Raila Odinga’s unity pact and Deputy President William Ruto’s political camp, which has opposed the move.
