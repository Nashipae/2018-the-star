The maize sector is in crisis and the politicians are not helping. The NCPB owes farmers Sh3.5 billion and has Sh3 billion of maize rotting in its stores. Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri wants millers to sell maize at Sh75 for a two kilo packet. Now Nairobi governor Mike Sonko has warned that he will withdraw business licences from shops that sell maize for more than Sh75. Government is losing the battle to control the maize market. Government cannot afford to subsidise NCPB to buy maize at above the local and world market price. And politicians cannot force millers to sell maize at a price where they lose money. It is time for the government to pull out of the maize market. It should not fix prices and it should not buy maize above the market price. Government should instead stabilise the maize market by allowing imports all year around but with a permanent tariff of, say, 25 per cent. This would lift the maize price for farmers inside Kenya and create stability for millers. And it would stop traders from making huge windfall profits when they are allowed to import maize duty free at times of alleged shortage.
