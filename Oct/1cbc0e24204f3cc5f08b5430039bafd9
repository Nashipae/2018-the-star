Ford Kenya youths in Bungoma have lashed out at Kabuchai MP James Mukwe, accusing him of ‘demeaning’ Bungoma deputy governor Charles Ngome (pictured). Ford Kenya party won all the county top seats last year through Senator Moses Wetangula, governor Wycliffe Wangamati and woman rep Catherine Wambilianga. The youths said the escalating rift between Ngome and Mukwe is not healthy for the party. “We know that Mukwe’s fate as Kabuchai MP is still in limbo after the Kisumu high court revoked his win and if he is told to go back to by election he will need the support of Ngome during the by election,” said Robinson Kisunia, who led the youths yesterday in Molo area in Webuye West constituency.
