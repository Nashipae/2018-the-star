Lamu governor Fahim Twaha in a dramatic twist fi red two executives he had reinstated hours after they won a petition challenging his decision. Raphael Munyua, the CEC for Health, and Florence Wairimu in charge of Agriculture and Water, were reinstated on Thursday by the governor himself after the Mombasa Employment and Labor Relations Court directed they be given back their jobs with immediate effect. The court found no compelling reasons for their dismissal six months ago. The announcement to reinstate the two was made in the Lamu county assembly on Thursday afternoon by speaker Abdu Kassim. However, the governor issued the two CECs with termination letters early Friday morning.
