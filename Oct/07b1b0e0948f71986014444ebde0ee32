Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has said he will support the call for a referendum as it will bring down the cost of living. "The new governance came with a cost which Kenyans seem ready to review having tasted and felt how it is," Gideon said in a statement to newsrooms. He said the constitution acknowledges the people as supreme and therefore have a right to decide on how they want to be governed. "It is with this in mind that I feel Kenyans should be given an opportunity to review the constitution bearing in mind what has worked for them, and the country since its adoption," the KANU party Chairman said. He said leaders should listen to the voice of the citizens and let them address issues that suppress them. "If Kenyans, and as is clear in the public debate going on wants a referendum, let leaders create a good environment for sober, informed debate to make Wanjiku choose wisely what exactly she wants in the referendum," he said. Earlier today, Deputy President William Ruto said he will the constitutional reforms through a referendum to help improve Kenyansâ€™ lives but not to burden them more.
