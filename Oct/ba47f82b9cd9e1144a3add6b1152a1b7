Parents of candidates sitting this year’s KCPE and KCSE exams have been cautioned against buying fake papers from conmen. Bunyala subcounty director of Education George Owuoche spoke to parents and pupils during a graduation ceremony at Chawo Star Academy on Friday. He said stern legal action would be taken against parents who will be found buying exams for their children. “I want to warn you to be cautious with conmen out to steal your cash in return for fake exam papers,” Owuoche said. He said his office has put in place measures to ensure exams are done smoothly. The officer said candidates from schools that fall within Bunyala South ward, which can only be accessed by boat, should not be worried because adequate boats have already been hired to ferry the exam and invigilators. He also told private and public primary schools in the subcounty to ensure the PTA teachers they employ are recognised by the Teachers Service Commission. Subcounty TSC officer Lawrence Juma warned teachers from private schools against charging high fees parents cannot afford. The Ministry of Education has threatened to withdraw the certificates of children aided by their parents to cheat by buying them fake KCPE and KCSE papers. Education PS Belio Kipsang has in the past blamed parents for parting with as much as Sh90,000 to buy fake exam papers for their children.
