Mombasa county is set to host the inaugural Aviation and Tourism football Challenge World Series at the end of the month. The showpiece, which will see corporate teams play seven-a-side matches at the Uwanja wa Mbuzi and Bomu stadia, is meant to promote sports tourism. Sports Tourism Limited marketing director, Paul Mutua, yesterday said Mombasa was chosen to host the inaugural event due to its attraction as a tourists destination. “This is an excellent opportunity for Mombasa to market itself and for the local business people to cash in on the event,” said Mutua. He spoke during the media launch of the tournament that will take place from October 31 to November 3. Over 50 including local and international corporates, have been invited and so far 26 have confirmed participation. They include Rwanda Air and Association of Uganda Tour Operators (AUTO) from Uganda. Mutua said the two form part of the 60 per cent of the corporate teams expected from outside Mombasa. The marketing director said they have partnered with Football Kenya Federation and other partners in the aviation industry like Rwanda Air and Coca Cola, among others to ensure the success of the inaugural event, which will be held anually. Uganda has already shown interest in hosting next year’s event. “The main objective is to promote sports tourism in the region and apart from the football tournament, there will be a netball challenge for the ladies due to public demand,” Mutua said. The teams will be treated to excursions to tourist sites including Fort Jesus, Haller Park, Mamba Village and Wasini Island in Kwale county on the last day.
