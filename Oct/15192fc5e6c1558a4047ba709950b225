More than 70 lecturers from Moi University’s Mombasa campus are on strike, demanding salary arrears running into millions from 2015. They have sought the intervention of Education CS Amina Mohamed, the Commission for University Education, the Ombudsman, labour unions, the anti-corruption agency, Mombasa governor Hassan Joho and civil society organisations. Moi University part time lecturers secretary general Vincent Kaingu said lecturers are also demanding appointment letters detailing names of units taught with payment rates. “When the management of Moi University failed to respond to these grievances, the part-time lecturers [first] went on a strike in June 2018,” Kaingu said. Deputy vice chancellor, Finance, Daniel Tarus, then committed to issue the letters and make payments. The first payment was to be made by July 25, second by end of August, third end of September and any outstanding claim by December. Tarus ordered classes to resume on June 25. But Kaingu said the first payment was not made. “Instead, the payment, which was effected in the week of July 27, was inadequate (only for one unit and not the entire academic year as agreed) and based on a payment rate that is below the agreed one,” he said in a protest letter addressed to relevant authorities. The tutors then when on strike on August 8 to-date. Coast campus director Mbwaril Kame said all lecturers have been paid but only some part-time lectuers have not been paid because they have withheld students eresults. “That who were not paid and saw the university was taking long, left. These are part-time lecturers, not full-time. [Furthermore] they are withholding our results. How are we supposed to pay you and you are withholding our results?” he said.
