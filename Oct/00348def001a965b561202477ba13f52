A man has petitioned the Judicial Service Commission seeking the removal of Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu from office. Mogire Mogaka claims Mwilu is corrupt and untrustworthy and has contributed to the collapse of Imperial Bank of Kenya. Mwilu, he says, has demeaned the office of the DCJ as she has used it to improperly enrich herself. Last month, the DCJ was arrested and arraigned on corruption-related charges, including abuse of office, failure to pay stamp tax, improperly obtaining Sh12 million from the troubled Imperial Bank, obtaining security by false pretence, among other counts. She did not take a plea and obtained a court order suspending the criminal trial until October 9, pending determination of weighty issues.
