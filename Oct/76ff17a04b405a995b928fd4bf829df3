Nairobi Regional Coordinator Kang’ethe Thuku has told land grabbers in Makadara to voluntarily surrender and return title deeds before the government swings into action. He said the government will revoke illegal titles and demolish all structures constructed on public land. Speaking to the Star on Friday, Kang’ethe said some private developers have grabbed land belonging to public schools, leaving learners without playing grounds. “Those who grabbed Martin Luther Primary School ground in Makadara should surrender the land voluntarily before we come for them. We cannot continue grabbing public land,” Kang’ethe said. “We are gearing up to revoke illegal title deeds. This impunity must come to an end.” Kang’ethe said demolitions will continue. In August, Nairobi governor Mike Sonko warned that grabbed public lands will be taken back. Last month, several buildings in Nairobi were demolished for either being on road reserves or riparian land. They include the Java in Kileleshwa, Airgate Centre, formerly known as Taj Mall, Southend Mall and Ukay Centre.
