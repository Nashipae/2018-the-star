Good Morning. Weather forecast shows that most parts of the country will warm up this Friday with the skies being mostly cloudy in Nairobi, Central Kenya and Western Kenya while it is expected to be sunny at the Coast. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this Thursday. Mudavadi blocks Raila from shuffling MPs Wrangles resurfaced again within NASA yesterday after Musalia Mudavadi’s ANC blocked Raila Odinga’s ODM party from removing its members from parliamentary committees. Last week, Minority Whip Junet Mohammed wrote to National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi removing 16 MPs from different committees. The changes were rejected by mainly ANC which accused ODM of acting in a dictatorial manner. Yesterday morning, ANC sought and obtained orders from the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal stopping the changes which were lined up for debate and approval by MPs. The tribunal’s Deputy Registrar Kyalo Mbobu directed the matter to be heard between the parties on Friday next week. Despite the order, Junet tabled the proposed changes in the House in the evening. _____________________________________________________ DPP orders investigations into Kericho accident Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji last night ordered a thorough investigation into the Kericho bus tragedy to determine who was responsible for the 58 deaths. He said the investigation will cover all government agencies charged with ensuring road safety, as well as vehicle owners. Haji said it would determine "the persons who may have, through acts of commission or omission, contributed either directly or indirectly" to the deaths on Wednesday. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet yesterday said traffic police manning the route of the overloaded bus will be severely punished. Boinnet said investigations were underway into the Fort Ternan accident and officers who let the bus pass will be disciplined. _____________________________________________________ Kassaine freed, ordered to report to DCI on Thursdays Businessman Brian Kassaine who lent a pistol that the prime suspect in the gruesome murder of Monica Kimani in Kilimani used to shoot himself, has been set free by the police. After 13 days in custody, the Lang’ata businessman was allowed to go on condition he reports to the DCI headquarters every Thursday for the next two months. Police sources yesterday said Kassaine will most likely throw his friend Joseph Irungu, alias Jowie, under the bus. Irungu is the fiance of Citizen TV reporter Jacque Maribe and the prime suspect in the September 19 murder of Monica. _____________________________________________________ Kamaru given a heroic send-off Thousands of musician Joseph Kamaru’s fans thronged Muthithi Secondary School grounds yesterday for his send-off. The fans who started trickling into the school from dawn braved the scorching sun as the tents filled up. There was a gridlock along the Kaharati-Kigumo road as fans continued to pour into the school for the event which President Uhuru Kenyatta, DP William Ruto and ODM chief Raila Odinga attended. Also present were more than 20 MPs, governors and other dignitaries. Scores of musicians, most of who said they were mentored by Kamaru, attended the burial and led mourners in songs. _____________________________________________________ We are what we consume: Ezekiel Mutua proud as tenure ends Throughout his tenure as CEO of the Kenya Film and Classification Board, Ezekiel Mutua has courted controversy. The man with a moustache and thick, properly combed hair is weeks away from finishing his term, but Kenyans will not forget him in a hurry. There are those who have seen him as a moral police. Others as a man punching above his weight. And others still as a petty man obsessed with himself and craving publicity to stay relevant. Mutua, whose term elapses early next month, is keeping his fingers crossed. His continued stay at the helm will be determined by a new board, against opposition from a section of the public who feel he is trying to babysit them, and from filmmakers who accuse him of strangling their trade. But biting more than he can chew is not new to the man. _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
