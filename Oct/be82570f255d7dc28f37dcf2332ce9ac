Former Big Brother Africa star and now Kariokor MCA Millicent Wambui is the newest mum in town after welcoming twin baby girls last Friday. "It feels good and blessed to be a mother. Throughout the nine months I was waiting for that day that I would hold my babies in my arms," Mugadi told Word Is. She said she had respect for women who are expectant but are still on their toes, working and hustling in the city. "With all the morning sickness and mood swings, expectant mothers push on and still go to hustle. I salute all the mothers out there," she said. Mugadi, who is one of the only five elected female MCAs in the Nairobi county assembly, has always been dedicated to her work until she went into labour. As the chairwoman of the assembly's Education committee, Mugadi has a lot to handle, but throughout her pregnancy, she was always dedicated, attending committee meetings and assembly sessions. "Being pregnant and working is tough, especially for a politician. Remember you have to be on the ground with residents, attend to assembly matters and at the same time go for hospital check-ups," Mugadi said. The young MCA said she chose Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko's wife Primrose Mbuvi as the twins' godmother. "Mrs Mbuvi is a very close friend of mine, and she has been with me throughout the period. I respect her for that," Mugadi said. She advised women to embrace motherhood and always be dedicated to their hustle. "Enjoying fruits from your sweat is a good feeling. Hard work will always pay, and women should be proud of their hustle," Mugadi said. "You need to balance between motherhood and work. You need your work to feed your kids and your kids need your presence as they grow up."
