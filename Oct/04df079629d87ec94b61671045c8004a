Former Kenyan Premier League side KCB will be hoping to return to the top flight league after three years in the cold with a win against FC Talanta at Camp Toyoyo today. KCB have 72 points, five ahead of third placed Nairobi Stima and a win will see them join Western Stima in country’s top league come next season, with a match to spare. The bankers have been on a winning trajectory since parting ways with the then head coach John Kamau last month and will aim at nothing short of a victory against the 11th-ranked Talanta to officially announce their return to the elite league. Since Elvis Ayany took over at KCB,the club has had a 100 percent record beating Kisumu All Stars, Kenya Police, Nairobi City Stars, Green Commandos and Coast Stima. Even though Nairobi Stima’s head coach, Ibrahim Shikanda, has admitted to have lost hope in automatic promotion, he will be banking on FC Talanta to beat the bankers and force a win when he leads his charges against Kenya Police, a result which will cut the gap between them and the bankers to just two heading into the final match. Stima and KCB are expected to clash in the final match of the season next weekend and the bankers are hoping to avoid a winner-takes-all situation. Despite being locked out of the automatic promotion race, Ushuru will be gunning to storm to the playoff spot when they play second from bottom Nakuru All Stars at Afraha Stadium, Nakuru. The taxmen have 65 points, two shy of Nairobi Stima and will hope that Kenya Police prevail against the latter to boost their chances of a play-off berth.
