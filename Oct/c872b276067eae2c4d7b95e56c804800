More than 1,000 bandit attack victims living at Mukutani Primary School in Baringo are hungry. They relocated from Eldume IDP camp in Marigat last Monday. The victims lived at Eldume IDP camp for one and a half years after fleeing an attack by bandits on March 14 last year in Mukutani. Nine people were killed, 1,500 livestock stolen, shops looted and 100 houses torched during the attack. Yesterday, Nosawe Lekoroito (pictured), 75, said she slept hungry on Saturday night. “The last meal I ate was a bowl of githeri for lunch,” she told Star. Lekoroito said she doesn’t know when she will get her next meal. Meikoki Lenaeku, 67, said she only has one kilo of maize flour left to feed her and two grandchildren. “Getting vegetables here is not easy. We have to pay Sh10 to buy a few leaves of sukuma wiki or cabbage, which I can’t afford,” Lenaeku said. Mukutani assistant chief Wilson Oletapi said aid must be delivered swiftly to save lives. He said while they were back at Eldume IDP camp, they received aid from the national and county government and the Kenya Red Cross Society. Residents have appealed to the government and well-wishers to assist them with food and cash to purchase vegetable and milk. Among the displaced were 330 pupils of Mukutani Primary School who had studied temporarily at Ol’Samburbur in Marigat. Click here for the latest political news
