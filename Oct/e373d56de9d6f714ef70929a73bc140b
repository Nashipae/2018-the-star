One student was raped at Moi Girls School Nairobi, the National Assembly's Education Committee has said. The team chaired by Tinderet MP Paul Melly has asked DCI George Kinoti to bring the perpetrator to book. They asked Kinoti to expedite investigations to ascertain the circumstances under which the sexual assault happened. The committee also wants DCI to identify the suspects, establish whether there was a cover-up by the school management and recommend prosecution of all individuals found culpable. “One girl was physically and sexually assaulted. Indeed, there was an act of sexual penetration on the victim whose cause and nature could not be established by the committee,” the team's report, seen by the Star, reads.
