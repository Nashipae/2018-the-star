Northeastern regional commissioner Mohamed Birik has urged politicians from the area to stop criticising the government in its war against terror and instead offer solutions. He was reacting to comments by Mandera governor Ali Roba and Garissa senator Yusuf Haji. Birik said the politicians have a role to play in matters security. He spoke on Friday in Garissa Town. Last week in Ijara, Haji and area MP Sophia Abdinoor took issue with alleged disappearances and torture of suspected al Shabaab sympathisers at the hands of government security agencies. Birik said the comments only flare up emotions of residents and compromise the war on terror. “Leaders who have genuine concerns should address them through the right channels and avoid using public forums to pass the message,” Birik said. “As government, we would always ensure we pursue the matters to their logical conclusion. It is not the government to harass its citizens that they depend on to get information on suspects.” Speaking in Mandera town, Roba accused the military of taking out their anger on residents of Daba City in Elwak subcounty after a roadside IED went off moments they had passed the scene.
