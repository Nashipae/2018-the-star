Good Morning. It is a day of clear skies in Nairobi, afternoon showers at the Coast and partly cloudy in Western even as Kenyans anticipate the start of the short rains season. The weatherman has indicated that most parts of the country will likely experience above average rainfall as the short rains season kicks off this week. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this morning. Kibaki used his power to secure scholarships to his grandchildren Former Head of Public Service Francis Muthaura on Monday defended retired President Mwai Kibaki for using his influence to have his two grandchildren acquire scholarships at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia. Muthaura told the National Assembly Public Accounts Committee that Kibaki acted within the law to have the scholarships awarded to the two students. It is not clear how much was paid for the scholarships but Muthaura said he received instruction from the former head of state to have the scholarships approved. Is Ruto plotting to abandon Jubilee? Opposition chief Raila Odinga's lieutenants came out guns blazing yesterday claiming that DP William Ruto is laying the ground to ditch Jubilee. ODM deputy leader Hassan Joho and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed, a key Raila ally, claimed Ruto has an elaborate plan to decamp from the ruling coalition and use Raila as a scapegoat. According to Junet, Ruto's vicious attack on Raila over the weekend was part of the DP's strategy to bolt ahead of the 2022 polls. Ruto, a former Kanu, ODM, UDM and URP member has, according to people close to him, identified a party that he will use, in case Jubilee denies him a presidential ticket. Crisis as youths take charge and shut public toilets in CBD Thousands of residents and visitors were unable to relieve themselves in public toilets at the weekend after youths invaded and closed at least 10 facilities in the CBD. Those closed were in Uhuru Park, Aga Khan Walk, Jevanjee Gardens, Railways Bus Station and Latema Road. Efforts to get comments from county government leaders were unsuccessful as Environment CEC Larry Wambua and director Lawrence Mwangi did not return calls or respond to text messages. But Central police boss Robinson Thuku said the youths invaded the toilets and chased away their operators. Chiefs, Police, Registrar of Persons are the most corrupt in Kenya The Chiefs offices, police and Registrar of persons are the most corrupt in the country, the anti-corruption watchdog has said. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission in its 2017 National Ethics and Corruption Survey states that the Interior Ministry is the most corrupt ministry. Others are County Health Departments (7.6 percent), Ministry of Lands (6.1 percent) Ministry of Health (5.4 percent) and Huduma Centers (5.1 percent). "The average bribe dropped to Sh5,058 from Sh7,081 in 2016 and Sh5,648 in 2015," says the report. The report launched on Monday at KICC was conducted by EACC and the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics from September to October last year. Why hundreds bleed to death in Homa Bay during childbirth When Irene Adhiambo felt some labour pains one afternoon, she left her home in Got Rabuor village for a medical check-up at the Homa Bay County Referral Hospital. Accompanied by her husband Paul Mboya, she walked into the facility with no medical complication, expecting to get hold of their firstborn in a marriage that had already lasted more than 10 years. After a medical examination, the nurses recommended she be admitted so she could deliver safely. Instead, after several hours writhing in pain, Adhiambo was referred to Rachuonyo Subcounty Hospital, 70km away. Sadly, Mboya did not get the chance to hold his long-awaited firstborn. The wife bled to death on the way to the referral hospital for blood transfusion. This is a common occurrence in Homa Bay, where postpartum haemorrhage (excessive bleeding after giving birth) is the leading cause of deaths among delivering women, which is more likely to happen with a caesarean birth. ____________________________________________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
