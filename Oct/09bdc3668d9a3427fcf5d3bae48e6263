The court has overruled an application by the defence for adjournment of the hearing of the case against 37 NYS suspects. The application was filed by lawyer Wandugi Kirathe who is representing two of the suspects. He argued that the defence team had little time to go through evidence statements submitted by the prosecution on Monday. Anti-corruption court chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti, however, dismissed the application on various grounds. Among the citations was that witnesses scheduled to on Wednesday will not rely on the documents submitted on Monday. Ogoti further said the prosecution and the defence agreed on Monday through consultations that a day’s adjournment was sufficient for both sides to study the submitted documents. "The hearing dates in this matter were taken by consent which Wandugi cannot run from," Ogoti said. The magistrate further argued that he could not allow Wandugi’s application to stand since the case was not facing a single suspect. "This court has a duty of guarding against applications that can trample on the rights of others," he said. "Today’s date was agreed by consent. The application by Mr Wandugi through Mr Ogamba does not meet the threshold in this case. This case to proceed," Ogoti ruled. On Monday, the DPP introduced new charges against the suspects including money laundering and dealing with suspect property. The court agreed to adjourn until Wednesday after both parties agreed that a day's leave would be enough for the defence team to study evidence submitted in court by the prosecution on the new charges.
