Eldoret-based Elisha Kiprop and Josephine Metto braved a morning chilly breeze and stiff opposition to emerge winners of the 15th edition of the Nairobi Standard Chartered Marathon. Kiprop clocked 2:14:19 ahead of Julius Kiprono and Patrick Kibet, who timed 2:15:01 and 2:15:09 to finish second and third respectively while Metto timed 2:33:11 to win the women’s marathon ahead of Cynthia Jerop ( 2:34:12 ) and Joy Kemuma ( 2:34:53 ) respectively. It was sweet victory for Kiprop after missing out on the gold medal in the 2011 and 2014 editions, where he finished fifth and second respectively. The Texas Marathon bronze medalist led a quartet of his challengers in breaking from the chasing pack at the 34th kilometre mark before taking the lead and full control at the 39th kilometre mark, where he held on to the tape. The Eldoret-based Kiprop 33, who alleged to have had a podium finish in the four marathons he participated this year, said he haboured no dreams of winning StanChart prior to the race but his body adapted well and was less affected by the harsh climate. He said he finished third in the Texas and Los Angeles Marathons held in January and February before winning the Grandma and Houston Marathons in June and at the start of this month respectively. “When I registered for the marathon, my ambition was to give it a try for the third time but I am happy my body adapted well and I managed to win. The weather was a little bit harsh at the start but it didn’t affect me. It was tough as my opponents pushed me but I kept on pressing on till I crossed the finish line.” In the women’s category, the first three—Metto, Jerop and Kemuma—had a debut to remember as they claimed medals in their inaugural participation in the event and their first ever full marathon in the country. Metto 27, who broke from the rest at the 36th kilometre mark, was glad to have beaten her cousin and second-placed Jerop, who pushed her all the way. She said: “ I am glad to win this year’s marathon on my debut. It was tough especially at the start where the weather worked against my plan but I adapted mid way.” Metto is the 2017 Boulogne Billancourt semi-marathon bronze medalist. Second-placed Jerop, who won the 10k race in the Chemesusu Half Marathon and Kaptagat Half Marathon champion was also elated to scoop a silver medal. “I am happy to finish second behind my cousin. It’s victory for us as a family. It was my first time to run in the Nairobi Marathon and I am contended with the silver medal.”  In the Half Marathon, Valary Jemei successfully defended the ladies title where she timed 1:12:06 while Mathew Kimutai won the men’s race at 1:04:57 Jemei, who won last year’s race in 1:11:04 crossed the finish line ahead of Irene Jepchumba and Sylvia Kibet, who posted 1:13:40 and 1:14:09 respectively. Ruth Langat won the women’s 10k race in 30:21 while Josphat Kiprotich won the men’s race in 27:16.  Marathon (men)  1. Elisha Kiprop 2:14:19 2. Julius Kiprono 2:15:01 3. Patrick Kibet 2:15:09 4.
