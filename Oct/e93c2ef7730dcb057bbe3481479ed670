Gor Mahia hope to field their strongest side against English Premier League side, Everton as they seek to stage a good performance in SportPesa Trophy on November 6 at the Goodison Park in United Kingdom. Unlike last year when champions gave every player a chance against Everton in Tanzania, assistant coach Zedekiah “Zico Otieno said they will be competitive this time round. Gor got a second chance to play Everton after emerging the winner of the second edition of the regional SportPesa Super Cup match held last June in Nakuru. Giants Gor lost to the European side 2-1 at the National Stadium in Dar last year and Otieno vowed not to tinker with the line-up this time but to field a strong side and make good substitutions. Otieno said the players are in the right frame of mind and raring to go even as they plan to conduct their last training session today at Camp Toyoyo ground. The team departs to the host nation tomorrow. “We started training last Thursday ahead of this trip and so far the players have adjusted well and are ready to give a good account of themselves away. During the last encounter, we were able to contain them and managed to score a goal. We intend to carry our local form to UK and push for good performance and results,” said the tactician. “Lucky enough, we have been given a chance by our sponsor to carry the whole squad for the UK trip save for two players who had issues with their documentation.”
