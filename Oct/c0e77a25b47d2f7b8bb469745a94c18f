The talent rich and Korogocho-based football Academy Acakoro yesterday received a massive boost after Sports Cabinet Secretary, Rashid Echesa, committed to give their stadium a face lift. The Academy, renowned for their affinity in tapping and nurturing young talents in the slums, hosted Echesa on their muddy grounds on Tuesday evening, where he was impressed with their football bungling skills and granted them their wish to have the facility improved. The academy, which made history after stunning Barcelona in the Donauauen Cup in 2015, was last year granted another wish after president Uhuru Kenyatta ordered the National Youth Service (NYS) to vacate part of the playing pitch they had occupied. Echesa made the announcement after meeting the administrators of the academy and players and promised to roll his sleeves and have the renovation works kick off soon. He said: “We are going to renovate this playing facility for these kids to practice on safe surface. It is a good way of tapping and nurturing talent and we have to begin work soon. Through the sports fund, I am sure we will have the project completed and handed over to you. I’ll also engage my counterparts and see if such projects can be initiated in all counties to tap talents from grass roots.” Former Harambee Stars coach and National U-20 coach Stanley Okumbi, who serves as a senior coach at the academy, welcomed the move by the ministry to renovate the facility. “It’s a surface which is used by the entire community and for sure grass can not withstand all the activities. I welcome the idea of having an artificial surface which can withstand all the activities in all seasons.We thank him for coming to our aid and also thank the president for ordering the NYS to vacate part of the ground they had occupied. With the ground ready, our job of nurturing talents will be simplified.”
