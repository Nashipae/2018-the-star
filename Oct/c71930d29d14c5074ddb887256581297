Activist Okiya Omtatah has moved to court seeking a declaration that the next election should be held on August 10, 2021, and not in the highly pronounced 2022. While there is a popular assumption that the term of the current elected leaders is five year, a look at the Constitution shows that Omtatah could be right in his argument. However, the matter is also complicated by the fact that there was a repeat Presidential election last year. Omtatah and Wycliffe Gisebe say that holding the elections in 2022 will be unconstitutional as the term of the current elected leaders will have exceeded the “fifth” year term limit. Article 101 of the Constitution states that; "A general election of members of Parliament shall be held on the second Tuesday in August in every fifth year." The two activists could, therefore, be right reading from Article 259 of the Constitution which outlines how the construe the Supreme Law and specifically how to calculate periods between two events. Article 259(5)(c) states that; "In calculating time between two events for any purpose under this Constitution, if the time is expressed— as years, the period of time ends at the beginning of the date of the relevant year that corresponds to the date on which the period began." With elections having been held on August 8, 2017, the fifth year would thus begin on August 8, 2022, and end on midnight August 7, 2022, in accordance to Article 259. This would mean that the fifth year would have two Augusts taking us back to Article 101 to establish which second Tuesday falls within the 5th year.

This will be beyond the fifth year and therefore giving merit to the argument by Omtatah and Gisebe. However, there is also another twist on the poll date following the fact that there was a repeat Presidential election in 2017 on October 26. If this date is taken as the last election date, then the fifth year of the Presidential cycle would end on midnight October 25, 2022. Consequently, August 10, 2022, would fall within the fifth year. Article 136 (2) of the Constitution says that an election of the President shall be held "on the same day as a general election of Members of Parliament, being the second Tuesday in August, in every fifth year." Therefore, while the second Tuesday of August in the fifth year for those elected in August 2017 election falls in 2021 that of President falls in 2022.
