Kenya’s Brigid Kosgei clocked the third fastest time in history of 2:18:35 to win the Chicago Marathon title in windy and wet conditions.

Kenya’s Florence Kiplagat (02:22:15) appeared to be limping slightly and holding her left leg when she crossed the finish line in fourth place. In the men’s category, Great Britain’s Mo Farah claimed his maiden marathon win in only his third race. The 35-year-old, who was secured a new European record with a time of 2:05:11.

American Galen Rupp failed to defend his Chicago Marathon title, falling back from the pack after 23 miles and finishing fifth in 2:06:21. Farah became the first Briton to win the Chicago race since Paul Evans in 1996. Farah, a six-time world champion and double Olympic champion at both 10,000m and 5,000m, retired from the track in August 2017 to focus on road racing. In London in April he clocked 2:06.21 to beat Steve Jones’ 33-ones’ 33-year-old British record. It was great to run with Galen, who won last year, then to be able to come back and win it for myself,” said Farah, who ran 2:08:21 on his marathon debut when finishing eighth in London in 2014. “The conditions weren’t great and everyone was thinking about conditions rather than time, but towards the end we picked it up. “I felt good towards the end of the race. At the beginning I felt a bit sluggish but overall I’m very happy with it.”
