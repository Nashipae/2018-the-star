Governor Kivutha Kibwana has apologised to residents after services at Makueni Level 4 Hospital were paralysed on Friday. Nurses staged demonstrations, protesting against what they referred to as political interference by MCAs. The nurses have demanded an apology from the MCAs after Wote-Nziu ward representative Felix Mateso allegedly stormed the facility and harassed health officers on duty last week. Mateso refused to apologise. Kibwana said, “I apologise on behalf of my entire administration and the assembly for what happened between the nurses and the MCAs.” He spoke to Nziu branch Knut officials on Saturday during their AGM in Emali town. Kibwana urged the Executive and assembly to work in harmony and deliver their promises to the people of Makueni. He directed Health executive Andrew Mulwa to honour assembly summons. MCAs said he was not reachable to help resolve the issue and other matters raised in the assembly. “I have told him to appear before the committee as required to respond to the issues that touch on the department,” Kibwana said. He, however, urged MCAs to be cautious when exercising their oversight role. “Let us work together towards achieving our goal and avoid scenarios that would hurt universal healthcare or slow development,” Kibwana said.
