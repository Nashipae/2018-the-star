The Nyeri government has procured a hydraulic cherry picker for Sh10 million to be used in the maintenance of street lights. The equipment arrived on Thursday and was received by Governor Mutahi Kahiga. It will be used immediately. Kahiga said the government bought it as Kenya Power has only one such machine, which is serving a vast area. He said the county government has been relying on cranes from other organisations in case there is need to repair street lights. “We have contracted Kenya Power, which has only one machine, and anytime we want our electricity repaired, they tell us it is engaged,” Kahiga said. Kahiga said the machine will ease street lighting repairs. The machine will come in handy in repairing lights in major towns of Karatina and Nyeri. A cherry picker is a hydraulic crane with a platform at the end for raising and lowering people. While typically used in building construction and remodeling, cherry pickers also are used in warehouses, utilised in installation, maintenance and repair of warehouse racking, lights, heating units or other mechanical system components at elevated heights. A person stands in and works from the bucket or platform. Some cherry pickers are equipped with a duplicate set of controls that allow operators to manipulate the position of the bucket themselves. Some cherry pickers have telescoping capacity to adjust the reach of the device, usually with automatic safety controls to prevent tipping over.
