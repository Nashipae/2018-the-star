A teenager was burnt to death after allegedly locking himself up in his parents’ house in Gilgil and setting it ablaze on Tuesdayy. Neighbours watched in horror as the house went up in flames with the 19-year-old inside at Kikopey on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. Trouble started when the boy confronted his parents, armed with a machete. He destroyed household goods. Neighbour Paul Matheri said the young man appeared intoxicated as he chased his parents with the weapon. "When the parents questioned his motives, he threatened to kill them. They scampered for safety as the boy locked himself in the house and set it on fire," he said. Matheri said firefighters arrived late. Gilgil police boss Emmanuel Opuru said the incident is being investigated. The boy's charred remains were taken to a local mortuary. "Initial investigations show the young man was under the influence of drugs. Our officers have begun investigations," he said. Elsewhere, the search for a 15-year-old boy who went missing two weeks ago in Ngondi village, Naivasha, has been called off. Rescue teams combed the expansive Oserian sanctuary but did not find him. They have left the matter to the police. Detectives have questioned two guards at the sanctuary where the teenager’s blood-stained clothes were found, two days after he went missing. Naivasha assistant county commissioner John Opondo said DCI officers have taken over the matter. "The search took two weeks, but yielded nothing. We hope the teenager will be found alive," he said.
