Mombasa parents risk arrest if they do not take their children to school. Mombasa county commissioner Evans Achoki gave all chiefs in Likoni subcounty a week’s ultimatum to ensure they have arrested such parents and guardians. Achoki said crime has greatly increased because children who do not go to school find solace in criminal gangs. He further said the children even venture into drug abuse at a tender age and end up destroying their lives for good. “These children are very young hence they are supposed to be in school. So parents should ensure that they take them to school,” he said at a security baraza in Shonda village Likoni sub-county. Achoki said the best solution to reduce crime is to get the children to school. Click here for the latest political news
