Sugarcane farmers want President Uhuru Kenyatta to stop sugar imports to save the industry. Chemelil Sugar Company chairman Zedekiah Bundotich, better known as Buzeki, says Uhuru should stop sugar imports to allow local farmers to benefit. Buzeki, who led the company’s board of directors during a meeting with farmers at Chemelil complex on Friday, said state-owned millers are suffering because of an influx of illegal sugar. He said the state should support factories for more sugar production to benefit both millers and farmers. “Sugar barons in the country should be arrested if we really want to revive local firms. We want action to be taken,” Buzeki said. “The President needs to be firm with unscrupulous traders who are out to kill local sugar industries the same way he stood by maize farmers.” Buzeki said there are a few individuals hell-bent to see government millers collapse so they can enjoy monopoly. He said this must be stopped. Chemelil is said to have more than 21,000 bags of sugar in its warehouse due to unfair competition caused by cheap imports. Buzeki said local sugar industries support the livelihoods of millions of Kenyans and should be protected. He called for the re-introduction of zoning to reduce losses caused by rampant poaching of cane, a proposal that has been opposed by farmers due to its impact on price. Buzeki asked the government to act swiftly and stop private companies from poaching cane they have not supported farmers to grow. Chemelil operations were halted in March due to cane shortage and lack of funds. Buzeki said private millers must stick to their sugar belts, saying cane poaching is one of the firm’s major challenges. He urged the government to gazette new guidelines on cane poaching to streamline operations in the sugar sector.
