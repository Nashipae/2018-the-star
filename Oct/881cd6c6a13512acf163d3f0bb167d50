President Uhuru Kenyatta will open the Sh250 million Karatina market in Nyeri tomorrow. Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua said the new market is complete and well-lit to enable traders work even at night. The President is expected at the facility at 10am, the MP said. “After commissioning the market, the President will address the traders and Mathira people at the Railways grounds,” Gachagua said. The opening of the market is good news for traders who were evicted eight years ago to allow it’s construction.
