Makueni MP Daniel Maanzo wants all Kenya Pipeline Company directors prosecuted for the Thange oil spill. He said on Monday in Wote that the directors, including the MD, should be charged with negligence and causing deaths. He said he plans to write to the ODPP and the IG to demand their arrest and prosecution. The spillage occurred in 2015. “People died of diseases related to the spillage. Animals died and farmers lost their crops, yet no action has been taken by the management. This is denying the victims justice,” Maanzo said. “We’ll not allow the Thange issue to end like the Kenya Pipeline fire that claimed hundreds of lives in Nairobi and no action was taken against KPC.” On Monday, KPC officials met residents over the leakage. Governor Kivutha Kibwana was present. The residents accused the firm of failing to honour its promise to supply clean water. Chairman Kimeu Muindi said they had not received water for the past month. They also accused KPC of short-changing farmers during payouts for livestock and crops and not taking their health seriously. “We need fresh medical tests because we suspect people may have been exposed to dangerous chemicals as they have resorted to fetching water from contaminated wells along River Thange,” Kimeu said. Some residents said they lost relatives to health complications related to the spillage. MD Joe Sang said the firm was not aware of the claims. He said a task force formed by the county had not updated them. But county medical services officer Matthew Matheka, a member of the task force, accused KPC corporate communication manager Jason Nyantino of being noncommittal about the resolutions reached during their meetings.
