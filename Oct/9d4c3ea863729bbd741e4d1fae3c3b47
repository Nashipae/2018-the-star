Deputy President William Ruto is working “very hard” to undermine President Uhuru Kenyatta’s legacy, Siaya Senator James Orengo has said. Orengo (below) said Ruto is satobaging Uhuru’s Big Four Agenda through his “premature” nationwide campaigns. “In a lot of democracies, the DP is surer of gaining office by working on the legacy of the incumbent. The DP by his conduct makes Uhuru a lame duck president,” Orengo said in Mombasa yesterday. He said Ruto’s conduct is a serious issue that Jubilee needs to deal with urgently. “There is dysfunction in Jubilee. You cannot have an agenda different from that of the President,” he said. Orengo said Ruto is also undermining the Building Bridges Initiative. The senator said Ruto’s focus should be uniting the country.
