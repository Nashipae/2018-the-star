Meru governor Kiraitu Murungi has dismissed as untrue, claims that he wants Miraa farmers to uproot their crop in favour of Macadamia nuts and Avocado. He on Friday said that he only advised farmers to inter-crop so that they earn from the nuts and the avocados. Kiraitu asked Trade and Industrialisation CS Peter Munya to help get a market for the farmers. "I am ready to work together with Munya to uplift lives of our people," he said. He said retrogressive politics that is aimed to fight development must be done away with for growth of farmers earnings. The governor spoke at Gitoro ASK Showground in North Imenti constituency. He distributed 200,000 Macadamia and 200,000 Avocado seedlings at the Friday event. The governor asked journalists from the county to pass the correct information to members of the public. "It is you journalists who told people that I want Miraa farmers to uproot their plants so that they can plant Macadamia." "Tell them there is nothing of the sort. Let them plant more but spare a small section of their farm for avocado and Macadamia," Kiraitu said. Miraa was once a key earner for the Meru economy before the UK - a key market, imposed a ban on the crop. Since then, farmers have been recording dismal earnings.
