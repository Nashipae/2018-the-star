Kaloleni MP Paul Katana has refuted claims that he is politicising the Auditor General’s report on unaccounted Sh50 million NG-CDF cash. He told the Star on Monday his call to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to probe the matter should not be seen as a witchhunt against his predecessor Gunga Mwinga. Auditor General Edward Ouko's report in the year ended June 30, 2017, stated that Sh50 million from the Kaloleni National Government Constituency Development Fund cannot be accounted for. The report was released on July 13 this year.

It is a report done by a government agency and it was tabled in Parliament," Katana said. "The money cannot be traced. I have never mentioned the former MP's name anywhere. If he has any information on the cash, he should give it to the commission." On Sunday, Gunga absolved himself from blame. "I have not seen the report. I believe all the documents are available for verification," he said. Gunga further said the management of the NG-CDF is under a fund account manager. "When I was the MP I did not interfere with the constituency cash. The fund manager and the committee are the ones who handled it. The manager who prepares financial reports and can defend his report," Gunga said. Former Kaloleni funds account manager Anthony Munyao said he will respond after reading the report.
