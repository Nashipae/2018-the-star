An advocacy group yesterday raised the alarm over the plan by Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to deploy a large number of police officers to schools during the upcoming examinations. Elimu Yetu Coalition said the move will create fear and interfere with candidates psychologically. Chairman Daniel Wesonga urged that only the necessary number of officers is sent to exam centres. “Schools are not military camps. I urge the Interior CS to stop the plan to deploy more than required security personnel. Even though they will patrol within some radius, their presence will create unnecessary tension to our candidates,” he said. Meanwhile, national coordinator Joseph Wasikhonga urged Education CS Amina Mohamed to intervene and solve the conflict between the Teachers Service Commission and the Kenya National Union of Teachers to avert strike. “We’re aware of negotiations that have been going on over the a number of issues, including delocalisation, teachers transfer and promotion. However, the time we are in requires urgent solution as candidates are awaiting their examinations,” he said. Wasikhonga criticised Knut for threatening to call  for a strike to have their CBA implemented. “We know Knut will call for a teachers strike when their demands on this issues are not me. The CBA does not only encourage harmonious negotiations on the terms and conditions but also encourages structured and constructive dialogue between the two parties. It’s  good to get the solution to this,” he said. Read: Amina to schools: 'Dare you interfere, try to cheat in exams!' Click here for
