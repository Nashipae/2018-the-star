Busia has unveiled a plan to identify and conserve water catchment areas. Water executive Isaac Alukwe on Thursday said the county will also protect dams in its efforts to conserve the environment. “We are expecting an analysis of existing dams and how the sediment transport is likely to affect them,” Alukwe said. He was addressing stakeholders during the launch of the 2015-2030 water master plan at a hotel in Ugunja. He said the plan will address water problems. Alukwe said a ground water map will be drawn to determine areas suitable for drilling to avoid drying up of boreholes. The executive said money has been wasted in drilling boreholes in dry areas. “It should be clear where we expect good yields of the ground water,”Alukwe said. He told contractors to complete their projects in three months or have the tenders terminated. County director of water services Joseph Olubero said there are a lot of resources yet to be been fully exploited.
