Kenya has been identified as among countries that have been hardest hit by Quelea birds, leaving a trail of destruction and loss among farmers. Other countries affected are Ethiopia, Sudan and Tanzania with farmers counting losses running into millions of shillings. The Desert Locust Control Organization for Eastern Africa (DLCO) has indicated plans are underway to fight the pests, which raid farms in millions. The organisation, however, noted inadequate financing from member countries is hindering service delivery and purchase of spraying equipment’s and chemicals to fight the birds. DCLO director Stephen Njoka said the birds had invaded thousands of acres in the region destroying crops ready for harvest. He said it was becoming a challenge for them to contain the pests mainly locust and Quelea birds due to budget constraints and hence the need for members countries to offer support. Njoka said in the last one year alone, an estimated 191 million birds invaded the farms with Kenya and Tanzania being the most affected. Speaking at the end of the annual DCLO meeting in Naivasha, Njoka said despite the hiccups, they are determined to control the birds like other migratory pests. “We managed to control the invasions of the dangerous desert locusts by applying the necessary chemicals, especially in its breeding zones of Eritrea, Somalia and Ethiopia,” he said. He added that they are working with farmers across the member states to ensure the pests are controlled,m and ensure high yields for their produce. Click here for the latest political news
