EAC Cabinet Secretary Adan Mohamed on Wednesday exuded the confidence Kenya will do better in this years' World Bank ease of doing business ranking. He cited the start of textile and steel products accessing Tanzania and Burundi markets respectively as a key pedestal to help the country attain an improved ranking. Adan further cited infrastructures such as the OSBPS (One Stop Border Posts) at Malaba, Busia, Holili, Namanga, and Isebania as key to improving the country's competitiveness. "The installation has subsequently improved the trading across borders, paying taxes amongst other indicators that are monitored by the World Bank." The improvements banked on prior to the ranking include improved agricultural yields, better business environment, and the current ease in political uncertainty. Kenya was ranked position 80 last year in the World Bank’s ease of doing business index. In 2016, the country ranked position 96 among 190 world economies. "The trajectory towards this goal continues to be on track, as competitiveness in EAC and globally heightens as a critical ingredient to attracting investments," Adan told journalists. Kenya is East Africa’s largest trading block and accounts for more than 25 per cent of the region's global trade.
