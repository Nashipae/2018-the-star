Eldoret will for the first time play host to the World Cross Country Championships and World Championship trials next year, according to the 2018/2019 Athletics Kenya calendar. This will, however, be the second time the Home of Champions will play host to an event of such magnitude having successfully hosted the trials for the 2016 Rio Olympics Games. Traditionally, Nyayo Stadium or Moi International Sports Centre (MISC), Kasarani have been used to host the World Championship trials showpiece which brings together the crème de la crème of Kenyan athletics. On the other hand, Uhuru Gardens and Ngong Race Course has always been the AK choice for the national cross country trials for several years and it will be the first time Eldoret will host the trials. The World Cross Country Championships are slated for March next year in Denmark with the World Championships set for Doha, Qatar’s multi purpose Khalifa Stadium between September 27 and October 6. Tentatively, the trials for the World Cross Country Championships will be held in February next year with the World Championships trials slated for July or August. Speaking yesterday, Athletics Kenya (AK) executive committee member, Barnaba Korir observed that there is possibility of counties bidding to host athletic events especially the athletic series in the new calendar. “This is all about competition. From now henceforth, interested counties will now have to compete against one another for this events. We are no longer going to force these events on counties which do not have what it takes to host them. Counties must convince us that they have what it takes to do it and even show us how,” added Korir. He said Athletics Kenya will release the full calendar for the 2018-2019 season tomorrow with the first two to three months of the season covering cross country and the track and field expected to start in April or May.
