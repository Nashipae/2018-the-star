Limo, 68, died on October 16 at the Meridian Equator Hospital in Nairobi where he was admitted for over a month due to kidney failure. He served in the public service as Coast Provincial Commissioner from 1997 until his retirement in April 2003 under retired president Daniel Moi. The late Limo also briefly served under the Presidents Jomo Kenyatta and Mwai Kibaki. After his retirement he was appointed director of Kerio Valley Development Authority (KVDA) and also served as Board of Governors chairman for several secondary schools. Limoâ€™s Widow Sarah Kipchumba told the Star on Wednesday that his condition deteriorated from June this year and he had battled diabetes since 1994.
