Meru Level 5 Hospital is in a pathetic state, Municipality MCA Murega Julius says. The MCA said it was shameful for a section of his colleagues to ask the county government to build or upgrade two hospitals into a Level 4 status in each of the ten Meru subcounties. Murega said he was astonished when he visited the Meru Level 5 Hospital wards and found two patients sharing one bed. The hospital is in his Ward. He said this after Ntunene MCA Jediel Mauta rooted for two Level 5 hospitals in the subcounties while Leader of Minority iclaimed the hospital was already upgraded to a Level 6. “If that is a Level 6, then we are dead,” Murega said.
