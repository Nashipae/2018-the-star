Northeastern residents have been urged to share information on suspicious activity immediately to avert terror attacks. Regional commissioner Mohamed Birik said cooperation between security officers and the public has significantly improved. He spoke yesterday in Kutulo, Tarbaj subcounty, during a security meeting. “Let us all be patriotic and defend our country by sharing information upfront and working with the security apparatus because they are here for your safety,” Birik said. He urged youths who have joined al Shabaab to return, adding that the amnesty given by the government still stands. “The government has been consistent on this mater. That any youth who joined the militia group will be pardoned provided he surrenders voluntarily. There is absolutely no reason to warrant one joining terror groups in the first place,” Birik said. During the meeting, residents denounced the activities of the militia group. Early this year, 11 Administration Police officers died when the vehicle they were travelling in passed over an improvised explosive device. More reservists “We are against the insurgents because we are the first victims as the soldiers who were recently killed are all from Tarbaj subcounty,” elder Gedi Shire said. “We will work with the security apparatus as we have always done, but we urge them to be compassionate in handling members of the public.” Wajir governor Mohamed Abdi said insecurity impedes service delivery from hospitals to schools and called on the public to cooperate with the security apparatus. MP Ahmed Bashane said appointing more KPRs is the best solution to the al Shabaab menace in addition to information sharing by the public. Kutulo is 35 kilometers from the Kenya-Somali border.
