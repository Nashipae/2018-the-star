Zimbabwe upset Kenya 17-5 to win the Africa Cup Sevens crown in Monastir, Tunisia yesterday. The Sables as they are known, took the lead through Tafadzwa Chitokindo with a converted try. Shujaa re-grouped and piled on the pressure and their efforts bore fruit when Cyprian Kuto fed Brian Wahinya to level matters with unconverted try as Zimbabwe led 7-5 at half time. On resumption, the Sables dominated scoring from the restart through Chitokwindo who touched down for unconverted try. Shingira Hlagayo put the icing on the cake for Zimbabwe to win their third Africa cup title. Zimbabwe had eliminated Uganda 24-19 in sudden death extra time in the semis while Kenya hammered Madagascar 36-5 in the second semi. In quarters, Kenya thrashed Zambia 33-7 to advance to the semis. Leonard Mugaisi was the star attraction in this match  with a hat trick as Gramwel Bunyasi and Derrick Keyoga contributed to Kenya’s try tally. Kenya started off the event on positive note, thrashing Botswana 49-0 and Morocco 41-0 in Group ‘A’ preliminaries to advance to quarters. Kenya were seeded top in Pool ‘A’ alongside Morocco and Botswana. Kenya skipped  last year’s event, allowing hosts Uganda to call the shots. Last year’s event doubled up as a World Cup qualification tourney and with their place in San Francisco already assured, the Kenya Rugby Union by-passed the opportunity to send a team.
