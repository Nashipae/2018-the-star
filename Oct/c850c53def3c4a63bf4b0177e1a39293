A KCSE candidate at a school in Trans Nzoia has died after allegedly drinking ethanol during a physics practical lesson. John Murambi, 21, was pronounced dead on arrival at Kiminini Cottage Hospital. The father, Martin Wafula, said his son came home the previous day complaining that he was not feeling well. He refused to be taken to the hospital. “In the morning, we found him unconscious in bed and rushed him to the hospital. He was pronounced dead on arrival," he said. Wafula said some of his son's classmates told him Murambi drank ethanol in the laboratory. He said they are waiting for postmortem results. Efforts to reach the school principal were futile. She did not answer our calls. Trans Nzoia East police boss Jackson Mwenga said investigations are underway. He urged students to be careful as they prepare to write exams.
