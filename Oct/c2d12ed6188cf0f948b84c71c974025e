Kisumu senator Fred Outa and former Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga have succeeded in their petition to shift hearing of their incitement case to Kisumu. Kisumu High Court judge Tripsisa Cherere ordered the case to be heard and dispensed with at the Kisumu chief magistrate courts. The judge ruled the two and four others were not accorded a fair hearing under the Constitution by transferring the case to Busia. Cherere said the petition was based on the grounds that the offences the petitioners were charged with occurred in Kisumu and the respondent never raised any complaint that the petitioners were harassing witnesses or tampering with evidence. The senator, Ruth and four others had sought a permanent injunction restraining the respondents from transferring the case to Busia courts. The witnesses had gone to the High Court, seeking transfer of the case to Busia law courts, citing security issues. They had asked for protection for fear of reprisals for testifying against the leaders.
