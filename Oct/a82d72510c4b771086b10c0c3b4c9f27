Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) will contract 18 players for the 2018-2019 World Sevens series, according to chairman, Richard Omwela. Omwela said the players contracts are based on last season performance, especially the minutes played for the national team as well as the just concluded national Sevens circuit. “This year, we will make the players’ contracts be different. There is no point of giving someone a contract when his contribution is only 10 minutes out of ten tournaments. “We have to assess their playing time and performances from last season and give contracts based on that,” added Omwela. A 21-man squad was selected a fortnight ago following trials conducted by outgoing coach Innocent Simiyu. Senior members of the Kenya 7s including Collins Injera, Andrew Amonde, Willy Ambaka, Eden Agero and Brian Tanga will face a performance review before being handed contracts for the new season Omwela cited finances as the biggest headache facing the union as they prepare for the start of the Sevens series as well as the repechage for the Simbas and the Kenya Lionesses. “We are doing everything we can including talking to the ministry to avail funds for both our national teams,” added Omwela Omwela was satisfied with the appointment of Paul Murunga as coach on a two-year contract. “It provides continuity. He was there two years ago with Benjamin Ayimba— winning in Singapore, qualifying for the Olympic in Rio and I believe he will do a good job,” added Omwela. A 12-man Shujaa squad departed the country yesterday for the Africa Cup Sevens in Tunisia and Omwela is optimistic about their chances of doing the country proud. “This is very much our ‘B’ team and I know training was limited but they are ready to do the country proud. The team held their final training session at the RFUEA,” said Omwela. Kenya are the top seeds in the two-day event and are in Group ‘A’ alongside Morocco and Botswana.
