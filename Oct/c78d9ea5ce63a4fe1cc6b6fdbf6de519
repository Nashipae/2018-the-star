Nairobi governor Mike Sonko had told Murang'a leaders to stop threatening to cut water supply from Ndakaini Dam. He said the government acquired the dam's 1,200 acres in 1988 and locals were compensated. Sonko was reacting to remarks by Murang'a governor Mwangi wa Iria who has demanded 25  per cent revenue from water supplied from the dam. He said Nairobi residents are anxious because of the wrangles over water. "For two weeks, city residents are living in fear of lacking water because some politicians in Central are seeking publicity," Sonko said. He spoke on Thursday at the ASK Nairobi International Trade Fair.

He said other dams such as Sasumua and Ruiru boost the supply. "We receive water from Aberdare in Nyandarua which flows in Chania River, it is pumped to Ngethu for treatment, it then flows to a reservoir in Gigiri for supply in the city," he said. Wa Iria and the Murang'a county assembly have vowed to stop construction of the Sh6.8 billion Northern Collector Tunnel. The county is demanding 25 per cent of revenue from Nairobi and Kiambu. The Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company website shows that Ndakani land was acquired to create space for the construction of the dam that majorly supplies water to Nairobi residents. Demand had increased and could not be sustained by the Chania system alone. Click here for the latest political news
