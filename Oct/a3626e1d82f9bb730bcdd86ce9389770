The album is due to be launched in November at an event sponsored by Songa by Safaricom. Eastlando Royalty is Kaka's fifth album. He performed some of the songs on the album at the Saturday event. The cover, which promotes the art, was done by Pointblank and painted onto a canvas by Eliamin Ink. The proceeds of the auction will go towards the King Kaka Sanitary Bank Campaign that aims to keep 100,000 girls in school. In an interview, King Kaka said he has 18 songs on the album which also features artistes Talib Kweli,Tracy Morgan, Atemi and Steph Kapela. "Having the artists on the album is a dream come true," he said adding that the idea behind the album is that someone can make it in life no matter their origins. King Kaka was named by Remy Martins as the face of a global campaign titled, 'One Life. Live Them.' The campaign, launched in Kenya for the first time, will see him visit different areas in a bid to connect with his fans and to find the King and Queen of Eastlando. The King and Queen who will be chosen will get a record deal with Kaka Empire. Click here for the latest political news
