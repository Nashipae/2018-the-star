Kakamega MCAs have defended their move to remove the speaker and two other assembly officials. The reps are Isukha South MCA Farouk Machanje (ANC), Shieywe’s Joab Mwamto, Kevin Mahelo of Butali-Chegulo (Jubilee), Leyla Muhandale of Lumakanda(independent) and Boniface Akosi of Shinoyi-Esumeiya(ODM). “We had reached our limit. In this assembly, members have not received mortgages, which is a right according to the SRC circular,” Machanje said. “We have tried all the available channels to acquire this right to no avail, so we had no option but to remove those who stand in our way of attaining our right.” MCAs on Tuesday ejected speaker Morris Buluma, clerk Patrick Kamwessar and finance director Laban Atemba over alleged misuse of funds. The MCAs disrupted House business during the afternoon session by blocking the entries used by the speaker and clerk. Armed with hammers, nails and timber, the MCAs blocked the doors to the offices of the three officials then proceeded with the House business. “We are frustrated. People are embezzling public funds while we the elected members are suffering together with those who elected us. We can’t continue like this,” Muhandale said.Member representing Mwamto alleged money had been misappropriated. “This is not a joke. We have a memorandum and evidence enough to have these officials nailed and we are going to present this to the Director of Public Prosecutions with immediate effect. And another memo shall be presented to governor Wycliffe Oparanya who knows the amount of money given to the assembly,” he said. During the melee, the MCAs compelled one of the assembly clerks to carry the mace to the house before swearing in the newly elected acting speaker Kennedy Kiliwake, the Sango MCA. However, Buluma dismissed the swearing-in as drama that should not be taken seriously. He said he was still legally the speaker. “Procedures to remove a speaker are outlined in the law,” Buluma said.
