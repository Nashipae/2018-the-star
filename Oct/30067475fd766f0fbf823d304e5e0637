Talks between the Kenya National Union of Teachers and the Teachers Service Commission on a number of contentious issues have collapsed. Knut is, among others things, opposed to mass transfer of teachers and principals, appraisals and performance contracts and the new promotion policy. The TSC insists it cannot drop these conditions. It is clear neither side is willing to compromise, raising the prospect of national examinations being disrupted if Knut makes good on its strike threat. Those who will be suffer most will be the pupils and students who have worked hard to prepare for their examinations. It is therefore important that both sides return to the negotiating table and hold discussions in good faith. Both should be willing to compromise and commit to reach an amicable solution as soon as possible. Knut should not rush into a strike, especially when it is able to negotiate for its members without disrupting learning. Although striking is a constitutional right, not every labour dispute is best resolved through industrial action. The TSC needs to engage with the unions so that they understand, buy into and own its currently contentious policies, rather than forcing them down their throats.
