West Pokot County Commissioner Apollo Okello has said security has been beefed up in the area to ensure national examinations are done smoothly. He said they are paying attention to areas where insecurity has been experienced recently. Okello spoke on Tuesday in his office in Kapenguria. "We have tight security along the Elgeyo Marakwet, Turkana and West Pokot borders. We want to have credible exams,” he said. Okello told local leaders to support efforts to improve security. "Don’t wait until incidents occur, report early. Let's adopt the Nyumba Kumi initiative. No student should miss the exams because of insecurity," he said.

Okello also told teachers and security officers to be vigilant during the exam period so that students' results are not cancelled like was the case last year. "Two leading schools' results were cancelled. We don't want this to happen again," he said. Lonyangapuo promised to work with the Ministry of Education and other education stakeholders to ensure exams are done without a hitch. "I value education. It is sad for students' results to be cancelled yet parents struggle to pay fees. I don't want to see a repeat of what happened last year. Those invigilating exams should be extra cautious," he said.
