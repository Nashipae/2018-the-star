Mombasa public service vehicles will soon be required to undergo compulsory fumigation three times a month to stop spread and get rid of bedbugs. Health executive Hazel Koitaba yesterday said many PSVs have poor hygiene. “A lot of bedbugs are being carried across the regions into Mombasa and from one place to the other within the county,” he said.  The county government has received complaints through the media and letters from affected residents. Public health chief officer Aisha Abubakar said the county will meet all the PSV owners and operators next week to get their views. Nominated MCA Fatma Kushe said she will present a bill to have the directive is legalised. She said some matatus have lice and cockroaches “that disturb passengers”.
