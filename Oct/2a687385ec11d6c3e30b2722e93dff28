Hundreds of people in Pongwe–Kidimu area in Kwale are likely to be displaced to allow for planting sugarcane by the Kwale International Sugar Company Ltd. The sugar firm needs at least 8,000 acres to increase its sugarcane. At least 700 families will lose their homes when the government gives the land to the company. Residents said they are the legal owners of the land and they were registered for title deeds during President Mwai Kibaki’s time. “We were issued with letters to wait for the processing of title deeds,” resident Mwinyi Pembe, who came to the area in 1982, said. Pembe said the land belongs to their great grandparents and relocating them will be unjust as some have buried their families there. Mbeyu Mapondae, who is among those issued with allotment letters, said the government is discriminating against the poor. Speaking to the Star on the phone on Friday, the company’s corporate affairs manager, Mathius Mutua, said the company will call an official press briefing to discuss the matter in detail.
