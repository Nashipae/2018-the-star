Over 3000 athletes are expected at the season-opening I.F Kiplagat Memorial Ndalat Gaa Cross Country at the Ndalat Gaa High School, Nandi County. Organising committee member in charge of technical, Kennedy Tanui, who is also the Nandi County Sports CEC, said arrangements on the ground are complete, save for the final nitty-gritty and they are hoping that being the 10th anniversary, they will have an even better event. “We have never had less than 3,000 athletes since inception and we dont expect less this being the 19th edition, ” said Tanui. He said the course will remain the same but they have expanded spectator area, going by the numbers expected for the numerous activities. Tanui said that a scheduled two-day medical camp has elicited a lot of interest among the residents coupled with a tarmacked road to the venue. “Previously, people used to negotiate a dusty road to the venue but through the County Government and the Mosop Constituency Development Fund, the road has been tarmacked and this will offer an incentive to both athletes and spectators,” said Nandi County Governor Stephen Sang. Tanui urged on top runners to use the race as part of their build up towards the forthcoming track and field season, which will culminate with the World Championships in Doha next year.
