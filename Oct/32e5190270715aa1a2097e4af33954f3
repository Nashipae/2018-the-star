Flamboyant Kenyan businessman Don Bosco Gichana has been released from a Tanzania prison after five years in pre-trial detention. The 41-year old was released by Tanzanian court on a $149,000 (Sh13.7 million) fine after pleading guilty to charges of conspiracy to launder money and money laundering. The case has witnessed its fair share of drama including endless adjournments, frequent changes to charge sheets and, on at least two occasions, Gichana was acquitted then immediately re-arrested just outside the courtroom. Before his detention, Gichana was a notable figure on the Kenyan political and social scene with luxury cars and a nightclub to his name. He hit the headlines in 2007 when he imported a red Hummer and donated it to opposition politician and presidential challenger Raila Odinga . Gichana also had interests in the construction and real estate industry. Click here for the latest political news
