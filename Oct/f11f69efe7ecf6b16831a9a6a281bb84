Singer Akothee has responded to a photo comparing her and socialite Vera Sidika to chicken on social media. On the photo, Vera has been tagged as a broiler, and Akothee a kuku ya kienyeji. The singer has responded to her critics, saying: "Okey our enemies have arrived before midnight. Someone tell Kenyans to Choose their struggle wisely. Use this brain to fight corruption, Use this brain to improve economy, Pay back Chinese loans and just move on and complete the list with their sister as Kuku bangaiza , kuku mashakura or kuku Boiro," she posted. Adding: "Comparison is a thief of joy. Be you love you the world will adjust." Vera Sidika, who bleached her skin, commented: "Ata mimi I have accepted to be Kuku somer, Ju kuku ni kuku."
