Top employees in Migori are anxious after governor Okoth Obado  indicated plans to make changes in his administration. Sources told the Star Obado read the riot act to executives during a cabinet meeting on Monday. The governor reported to work for the first time after being released from remand where he had stayed for 34 days. Obado was arrested and charged with the murder of girlfriend Sharon Otieno and her unborn child. He denied the charges. On Monday, Obado briefly addressed workers outside his office before chairing the cabinet meeting. “We are in a panic mode because there is news that most workers will be sacked and others may be demoted,” an executive confided to the Star. Obado wants to build his legacy. He complained that staff had let him down on promises made to residents. Most contracts end in December. The governor has since reined in infighting staff. County Public Service Board chairman Peterlis Nyatuga said 11 chief officer positions and those of two directors in veterinary and water departments will become vacant. “All these positions will be vacant by December 5 and will need to be filled,” Nyatuga said.
