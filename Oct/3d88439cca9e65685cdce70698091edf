Wananchi Group, owner of pay and internet TV firm Zuku, plans to exit the Kenyan market after almost two decades of business. The firm, according to Bloomberg, has contracted a US sales consultant Lazard Limited to work on a potential sale plan as top investors with combined shareholding of 85 per cent look to exit the firm currently embroiled in a tax battle with Kenya Revenue Authority. According to reports, the three investors Liberty Global, Altice Europe NV and London-based Helios Investment Partners are keen to sell their stakes in the Kenyan company valued at $500 million (Sh50 billion) including debts. The three firms contributed immensely to $130 million (Sh11.6 billion) fund needed by Wananchi group in 2014, with Helios Investment Partners pumping in $40 million (Sh3.6 billion). Wananchi targets the growing middle class in Sub-Saharan Africa, providing broadband services through fiber and satellite technology in East and Southern Africa.They have experienced increasing competition from mobile service providers who have ventured into fixed data market. Internet distribution statistics released by Communication Authority of Kenya show that although Wananchi Group still control 30 per cent of fixed data in Kenya with 112,155 subscribers, Safaricom has grown its shareholding to 21.2 per cent in just two years. In 2016, appointed Zuku co- owner Richard Bell as a tax representative for his offshore companies based in Mauritius alleged to participate in tax fraud worth Sh3.4 trillion. Last month, the High Court declined to stop Bell’s co-shareholders from participating in the case pending appeal against their enjoinment. High Court Judge John Mativo ruled that Bell’s fear that the shareholders might bring adverse evidence restrained by court in a separate suit is not a ground to warrant their suspension pending appeal. Efforts to reach Wananchi Group for comment hit a snag, with calls and emails unanswered answered by time of going to press.
