This year's Kenya Certificate of Primary Education and Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education candidates are writing their exams and we congratulate them for completing these levels. Close to 1.6 million candidates; 964,119 for KCPE and 631,750 for KCSE will be sitting their class eight and form four exams all with the hope of joining secondary school or proceeding to university or college. Not all will make it, but this does not mean the end of the road for these young minds. Kenyans attach too much premium on exams making, KCPE and KCSE a matter of life and death. The pressure to deliver good grades pushes students and teachers to cheat. In the past three years the Kenya National Examination has cancelled the results of more than 9,000 candidates for cheating. Suicide cases arising from poor scores are often reported after the results are announced. Education is a lifetime process which can not be solely tied down to academic papers. Many have passed their exams with flying colours but ended up being failures in life while others scored the lowest grades, took it in their stride and through hard work and honesty curved their path to success. As the government implements the new curriculum, the Education ministry must debunk the premium attached to exams and shift the focus to imparting life skills. Students, parents and the general citizenry should know that there is more to life than passing exams.
