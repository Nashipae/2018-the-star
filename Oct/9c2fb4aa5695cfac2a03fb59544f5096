Security chiefs in Central have warned of the reemergence of Mungiki and Gaza criminal gangs saying the groups not only extort money from transport operators but also in construction sites. Regional coordinator Wilson Njenga said they are investigating reports of the said gangs' activities with a view to eradicating them. "In the past, they used to be found in the matatu industry but are now trying to get their heads into the construction industry and other businesses," he said. Njenga sounded a stern warning to the groups saying the government will not allow them to regroup regardless of the names they use. He said the Gaza group from Nairobi was also infiltrating the region saying the latter's activities are synonymous with those of the Mungiki sect. The administrator said 11 suspected members of Mungiki sect have been arrested in Nyandarua county, 80 in Kiambu; while on Monday 45 were arrested in Nyeri county. "We have started the operation across the region because we cannot allow people to extort money without working for it." He spoke to journalists after a meeting between Central regional security committee and Nyumba Kumi Initiative team led by chairman Joseph Kaguthi. For his part, Kaguthi called on politicians and religious leaders to pronounce their position on the proliferation of the said gangs. Click here for the latest political news
