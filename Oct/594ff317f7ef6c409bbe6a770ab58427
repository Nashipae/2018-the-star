Kenya Medical Supplies Authority is facing queries over unapproved hiring of 354 staff members gobbling up over Sh695 million annually in salaries. Auditor General Edward Ouko in his 2016-17 report questioned the excess hiring, which he said is irregular and unnecessary. The medical agency, the report says, is only approved to hire 341 officers, not the current 695 employees on its payroll. “That authority has 695 employees against the approved establishment of 341, resulting to unapproved over-employment of 354 officers.No explanation has been provided for the excess employment,” Ouko’s report noted. In the year under review, the report points out that the medical agency spent Sh25 million to pay 47 officers who were employed and eight who were promoted.

Appearing before the National Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee, chaired by Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir last month, Kemsa CEO Jonah Manjari said the extra staff is a combination of Kemsa staff and programme officers. He defended the decision not to attach supporting documents of those employed and promoted, citing sensitivity and bulkiness of the documentation. Manjari said 366 programme officers were contracted to render services to the various programmes the agency is running with other strategic partners. Click here for the latest political news
