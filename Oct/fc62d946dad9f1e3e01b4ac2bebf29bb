Two police officers from Witeithie AP post were on Saturday morning attacked and injured by a group of youths suspected to be touts at Juja stage. The officers were ambushed as they enjoyed a cup of tea at a kiosk. Area AP boss James Dawai said the touts were allegedly revenging recent arrests after Juja deputy commissioner Charles Mureithi ordered them to be removed from matatu stages. Dawai said they are looking for the suspects. A witness said the officers sustained serious head injuries. He said one of the attackers told the officers that he was not afraid of him. “Mark me very well. Am not afraid of you at all. Am a matatu crew here,” he shouted at the bleeding officer. One of the officers lost his phone during the attack. Members of the public claimed the officers were drunk during the attack. Click here for the latest political news
