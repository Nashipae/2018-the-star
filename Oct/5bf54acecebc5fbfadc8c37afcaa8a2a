Former sports CS Hassan Wario has pleaded not guilty to the loss of Sh55m in 2016 Rio Olympics scandal. Wario also denied abuse of office charges when he was arraigned on Friday. He is facing six counts of criminal offences. The Kenya ambassador to Austria appeared before Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti in Milimani Law Courts. Wario and legendary athlete Kipchoge Keino were arrested on Thursday over the scandal. DPP Noordin Haji had earlier said that the two and five others have a case to answer. But on Thursday, it emerged that Keino will not face criminal charges but will instead be a state witness against Wario and the others charged with impropriety in the scam. Keino, 78, is a two-time Olympic champion and an honorary member of the International Olympic Committee.
