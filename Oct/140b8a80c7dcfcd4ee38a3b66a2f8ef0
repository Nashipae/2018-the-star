Chiefs in Meru risk being sacked if cattle are stolen from their locations, county commissioner Wilfred Nyangwanga has said. Two people were killed and livestock stolen from Kamwerine village in Igembe North early this week. Speaking at a security meeting in the area on Friday, Nyangwanga said police and reservists ought to have responded to the incidents. He said the security officers are armed and should use their weapons to repulse bandits. He ordered the officers to shoot to kill bandits. "You have been given all the resources so why should a bandit walk away with livestock yet armed police reservists are in the area? They should pursue, and shoot them dead," Nyangwanga said. He said they who shall fail to use their firearms will be disarmed. The administrator said police reservist have a duty to tame cattle rustling because that is their main role. The other security matters are handled by regular and AP officers. "They [police reservists] should not roam around doing other duties yet livestock are being stolen," Nyangwanga said. He said no camels should be allowed to graze in peoples farms. In August last year, Nyangwanga led an operation to flash out bandits in Buuri constituency. The area borders Isiolo. It was believed herders were hiding in a nearby hill. "We will conduct another tough operation there," he said. He said chiefs who fail to tame cattle rustling will be sacked and replaced with "those willing to work."
