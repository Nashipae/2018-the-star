The Auditor General’s report has unearthed questionable Sh23 million expenditure in Kabuchai and Bumula constituencies, exposing the rot in the usage of NG-CDF money. The 2016-17 report reveals the two constituencies cannot account for the amount they claim to have spent in acquiring new buses and parcels of land. According to Auditor General Edward Ouko, no single document was availed to back the purchase of the three buses and 16 parcels of land. Kabuchai is represented in the National Assembly by James Mukwe while Moses Mabonga is the member for Bumula constituency. In Bumula constituency, Sh15,900,000 was claimed to have been spent in purchasing three 33-seater institutional buses but no justification document was provided to the audit team, raising doubts if the buses were indeed purchased. The buses were all supplied by Kenya Coach Industries and were to be given to St Kizito Mayanja, St Mary Nagdalene and St Stephen Chiliba Secondary Schools, according to the Bumula NG-CDF records. “The procurement documents and payment records were not availed for audit verification. In the circumstances, it was not possible to ascertain propriety and completeness of the acquisition of these buses costing Sh15,900,000 during the year under review,” said Ouko in his report. In the same constituency, Ouko says Sh2,100,000 allegedly used to buy five pieces of land could also not be confirmed as there was no title deed availed for the five pieces. According to the constituency records, the money was spent to buy pieces of land for Nkhwana chief’s office (Sh300,000 ), Kabubero Secondary School (Sh100,000), Manani Secondary School (Sh400,000), Nangata Secondary School (Sh400,000) and St Paul Wamunyinyi Secondary School (Sh600,000 ). “In the circumstances, it was not possible to ascertain the ownership of the parcels of land acquired for the respective institutions.” In Bumula constituency, the situation is almost similar with Ouko questioning Sh5,300,000 allegedly used to acquire 11 parcels of land and whose title documents are still with the original owners despite the constituency paying for the same. The parcels were intended for Chekulo sublocation office (Sh100,000 ), Ngalasia AP camp (Sh300,000 ), assistant chief’s office- Mukhweya (Sh400,000 ), West Nalondo assistant chief’s office (Sh400,000 ), Sirare Secondary School (Sh500,000 ), Pongola Secondary School (Sh600,000 ) and Chebunyinyi Mixed Secondary School (Sh500,000 ). Others include St Kizito Girls Secondary School (Sh600,000 ), Lwanda PEFA Primary School (Sh600,000 ), Namosi Primary School (Sh500,000 ) and Lubembe Primary School (Sh400,000 ). “No title deeds registered in the names of the beneficiary institutions were availed for audit verification and were noted to be still under previous owners,” Ouko said. The reports were tabled by National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale last week. Click here for the latest political news
