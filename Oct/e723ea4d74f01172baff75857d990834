The government has warned people who have encroached on Bungoma public land to vacate immediately. Environment CS Keriako Tobiko yesterday ordered county commissioner James Kianda to evict the grabbers to allow for reclamation and forestation. He launched a tree-planting drive in Sangalo Institute of Science and Technology, Kanduyi. Tobiko later visited Chetambe Hills, Webuye East. He expressed concern over increasing encroachment on the hills. He said no evictee will be compensated.
