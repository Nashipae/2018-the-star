Contrary to rumours that Coke Studio Africa had been cancelled, the show is set to begin shooting next month. “The broadcast period is what was moved from quarter 4 to quarter 1. This decision was made in November 2017. However, there will be many changes in the format of the show,” a source told Word Is. Producer Tim Horwood will be in charge of putting out the new season. Fewer countries will be roped into Coke Studio Africa 2019 “because the show that will be shot in Nairobi will feature stars from East and Central Africa only. The West and Southern African markets will have their own product that suits their market,” the source added. The only sad news is that there is no female Kenyan artiste signed for the show as yet.
