Good Morning. Joseph 'Jowie' Irungu and Citizen TV anchor Jacque Maribe return to the courts today for a mention of their case over the murder of businesswoman Monica Kimani. The two will also be expecting the court to listen to their plea for bail with Maribe saying she is not a flight risk and needs to take care of her son. On another day that the weatherman tells Kenyans to expect rains across the country, here are the stories making headlines in the Star this Wednesday morning. Monica was detained at airport over undeclared money The late Monica Kimani was briefly detained at the airport upon arrival from Juba because she was in possession of undeclared cash. She was, however, let go after a high flying individual called senior KAA officials to secure her release. The incident has been handled with the strictest confidentiality, with no official records showing Monica was at the airport on the material day. Undercover police officers at JKIA, who requested anonymity, told the Star how Monica was briefly detained by customs and immigration officers but the incident didn’t bear much significance until later when they identified her as the same woman who was brutally murdered. _____________________________________________________ MPs want probe into IEBC mess extended to Chebukati, team Electoral commission chairman Wafula Chebukati and his team should shoulder the blame for the mess at the agency, three lawmakers said on Tuesday. “Chebukati should stop hiding behind [sacked CEO Ezra] Chiloba. Everybody should carry his cross. Everyone knows there is a rot in the commission," Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi said at Parliament Buildings. "What we want to see happening is investigative agencies swinging into action with an open mind and investigate everybody.” Chiloba was sacked on Friday after he was found culpable of committing procurement irregularities during the 2017 general election. _____________________________________________________ Counties paying Sh9 billion yearly for idle medical equipment - CRA Tax payers are incurring Sh9 billion every year for non-functional medical equipment in county hospitals, Parliamentary Budget and Appropriations Committee was told yesterday. Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) chairperson Jane Kiringai revealed this when he appeared before the Kimani Ichung’wa led the committee to explain legality around slashing of county budget by Sh9.04 billion from initial Sh314 billion. In September, Treasury slashed Sh55.1 billion in both national and county government expenditure for the current financial year, in a bold move to reduce expenditure in the face of dwindling revenue. _____________________________________________________ Investors raise question of profitability in low cost housing project President Uhuru Kenyatta’s low cost housing project does not make economic sense to investors, according to a leading real estate property expert. Hass Consult research analyst Sakina Hassanali said although it is feasible to construct 500,000 housing units in five years, the project’s profitability to local private investors raises questions. “Developers are not actually able to build low cost housing because it is expensive as they will be taking on a lot of government’s work including infrastructure development,” she said. Hassanali said the local private real estate sector lacks an understanding of what the housing plan actually entails, expected benefits and their role as investors. _____________________________________________________ Inclusion row flopped Uhuru- Artistes meeting Divisions among artistes from Central Kenya thwarted a planned meeting with President Uhuru Kenyatta last wee. The President was set to meet them during the burial of popular benga musician Joseph Kamara, after a plea by nominated MP Maina Kamanda through gospel artiste Ben Githae. On the agenda was how he could help them lift their living standards. Speaking to Word Is, Githae said it is not the first time such divisions have been witnessed amongst them. _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
