Ukambani leaders have sent condolence messages to Wiper chief Kalonzo Musyoka following the death of his father Peter Mairu. They include Kitui governor Charity Ngilu, Mwingi North MP Paul Nzengu, Mwingi Central’s Gideon Mulyungi and Mwingi West’s Charles Nguna. Mairu, 94, died early Sunday at Nairobi Hospital where he was admitted following a long illness. Ngilu tweeted, “My deepest condolences to Hon @skmusyoka on the passing on of his father Mzee Peter Musyoka Mairu. May God comfort you and your family and give you strength to bear the loss. Pole sana Mutongoi (honourable).” Nzengu sent out a condolence message through his personal assistant Kitheka Mundumwiu. He said, “On my own behalf, my family and the people of Mwingi North, I condole with the family of HE Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka, the Mwingi North people, Kitui county and Kenya at large and stand with the family at this very trying moment.” The Wiper MP described the late Mairu as a patriot who was optimistic that Kenya would one day hold a free and fair election and build on the principles of democracy and values of justice for all. He said Mairu had hoped to see his son clinch the presidency one day. “This was the desire of Mzee Musyoka and all of us who believe in the incorruptible character of our party leader,” Nzengu said. Mulyungi said, “We are together in this and we tell our leader to have courage.” Nguna said the fallen hero wasa rock who raised a leader - Kalonzo. “The late (Mairu) Musyoka was a renowned disciplinarian, a Christian and a devoted moralist. Through his hand and parenthood, he produced one of the most incorruptible and respected leaders, Kalonzo Musyoka,” he said. The MP said the death of a parent, at whatever age, is painful. He prayed that God grants the family the energy to get through the season.
