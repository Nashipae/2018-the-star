Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa has said that MPs are determined to change the election date from August to the third week of December. While speaking to KTN on Wednesday, Wamalwa said he was confident that the required 233 MPs will support the bill this afternoon. He said the draft had gone through all the parliamentary procedures in accordance with the standing orders. The MP also dismissed claims that the move was a plot to extend the term of the current Parliament. "It was once tabled by the late Mutula Kilonzo and David Ochieng. This is the third time I am tabling. We tabled the public participation report and that of the Justice and Legal Affairs which indicated 80 per cent of Kenyans are supporting the change," he said.

Too many campaigns affect school activities. Last years election tampered with KCPE and KCSE and as legislators we deem it fit that we change the dates," he said.
