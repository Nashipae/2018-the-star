Governor Mike Sonko has said he will reinstate three top management officials he had suspended at Pumwani Maternity Hospital last month. During an impromptu visit at the facility yesterday at 4.25am, he said the county should expect some changes at the hospital in the next 48 hours. “We can even reinstate the suspended doctors now. I did not have any bad intention, what I wanted was services to the people,” Sonko said. Last month, he suspended Pumwani superintendent Catherine Mutinda, administration officer Zadock Angahya and obstetrician gynaecologist James Kamau for alleged incompetence. He also suspended the entire hospital management board. The governor had on September 17 visited the hospital and found 11 bodies of infants wrapped in polythene bags and packed in three boxes in a store. The suspended officers were given 14 days to explain why disciplinary action should not be taken against them. As a result of the suspensions, the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) threatened to call a doctors’ strike if the suspended officials are not reinstated. Union chairman Samuel Oroko said Sonko acted illegitimately on suspending the officials, because they were not to blame for the death of the infants. At the same time, Sonko promised Sh50,000 cash reward for any security guard who will arrest and report child theft at the hospital. He told the guards working at the facility to be vigilant and report those who steal infants at the hospital. “Be vigilant and if anyone of you gets a child being stolen and reports, then you will get a Sh50,000 reward,” Sonko said. He instructed the guards to ensure anyone leaving the hospital with a child has an ID and a badge confirming the child belongs to them.
