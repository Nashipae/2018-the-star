Twitter will now highlight when it takes an action on a bad tweet - making its over 330 million users understand that the tweet was forcibly taken down and not deleted. "Once we've required a Tweet to be deleted, we will display a notice stating that the Tweet is unavailable because it violated the Twitter Rules," product manager Sam Toizer said on Thursday. The Twitter rules will come along with a link to the Rules and an article that provides more detail on how we enforce our rules. This notice will be displayed on both the account’s profile and the specific Tweet for 14 days after the Tweet is deleted. "You will see this change rolling out to both the app and on Twitter.com in the coming weeks," Toizer added. Toizer said they have also received feedback that users do not want to continue seeing Tweets they have reported. "Starting today, once you've reported a Tweet, it will be hidden behind a notice .. If there’s a need to see the Tweet you reported, you can tap the notice to view it," he said. In August, Twitter started banning a huge amount of accounts, with many users taking to the site to bemoan the loss of hundreds of followers in a single day. The cull had such an impact on numbers that the 'Twitterverse' was swept with the hashtag #TwitterPurge. The firm ruthlessly removed accounts, with those who have been previously suspended or banned most likely to see their account deactivated.
