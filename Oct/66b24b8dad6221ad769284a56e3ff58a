Governor Ferdinand Waititu’s move to merge all water companies in Kiambu has suffered a blow after Water Services Regulatory Board maintained its position against the merger. Wasreb, which sets rules and enforces standards in the water sector, indicated that its stand is still intact as it indicated in a media advert in April this year. The Kiambu county government early this year dissolved the eight water services providers to form the Kiambu Water and Sewerage Company Limited. However, stakeholders at Thika Water and Sewerage Company challenged dissolution of the companies in court. Former Transition Authority chairman Kinuthia Wamwangi, Thika District Business Association and Jumuhuri Ofafa Starehe Welfare Association went to court seeking to block implementation of the legislation that folded the water firms into a single entity. The High Court in Nairobi barred the Kiambu government from merging the eight water firms. But governor Waititu went ahead to preside over a function where the water companies were dissolved to form KWSCL. However, on Tuesday, during a public participation forum organised by Wasreb in Thika, the agency’s CEO Robert Gakubia insisted that the regulator does not recognise Waititu’s new water firm but only acknowledges the original eight licensed water companies within the county. “Just as we had indicated in out advertisement in a local daily on April this year, we only acknowledge the eight registered water firms in Kiambu county and our stand remains the same on the matter,” Gakubia said.
