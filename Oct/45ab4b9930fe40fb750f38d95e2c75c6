Newly-appointed Kenyan Premier League side Thika United head coach Gabriel Kingi has partially blamed poor officiating for their failed bid of remaining among the countries top teams at least for another season. Kingi had a good start in his tenure at the dugout leading his charges to a rare 1-0 win over champions Gor Mahia at Thika Stadium but lost the subsequent three matches which saw them dropp to the National Super League. The former Mathare United coach heavily blamed officials who oversaw his side’s 2-0 defeat to Tusker and similar 1-0 losses to Nzoia Sugar and Chemelil Sugar, which he said killed their hopes of remaining in the top flight. He said: “I have overseen four matches since I was appointed and we have won one and lost three. We would have won all the matches were it not for poor officiating by the officials who handled our matches. We were clearly denied victories against Tusker, Nzoia and Chemelil.” “In Sudi, Nzoia were awarded a penalty incorrectly and we ended up losing the match. Against Chemelil we conceded a goal which the scorer handled before striking. During the Tusker match, all the officials were biased and we stood no chance of winning. After the Gor win the boys were determined to fight to remain in the top flight but they were let down by match officials.”
