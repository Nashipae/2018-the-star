TV journalist Jacque Maribe and her fiance Joseph Irungu alias Jowie have been remanded until October 15. Making the ruling on Tuesday, Justice Jessie Lessit said the two will take plea on that day. Lessit ordered Maribe to be detained at Lang'ata Women'S Prison. She will undergo a mental assessment at Mathare Mental Hospital. Jowie will be detained at Industrial Area Remand Prison. "We are ready to take the plea today and have no objection to the mental assessment being taken later on," Maribe's lawyer Katwa Kigen said. Maribe has been implicated in the gory murder by her conduct and association with prime suspect Jowie. DPP Noordin Haji ordered Maribe and her fiance be charged with the murder of businesswoman Monica Kimani. "I have reviewed the evidence so far on record and I am satisfied that there exists a prima facie case to warrant criminal prosecution against them," Haji said in a statement on Tuesday.
