Can Raila Odinga and William Ruto can work together? Remember the principle, "In politics there are no permanent friends or enemies, only permanent interests." We have seen leaders who don't see eye to eye work together. Remember former President Daniel Moi and Prime Minister Raila Odinga, among others.So when DP Ruto finally discovers that his interest can be well taken care of by Raila, then he will join forces with him. The recent outburst by the Deputy President only points to a man who sees danger ahead. His remarks about Raila suggest a drowning man grasping at anything to clutch. Ruto needs to be reminded that a leader of his repute ought to be slow to believe and act, and should not show fear. Machiavelli would advise him to project calm. In the spirit of handshake, he should not be too confident, reckless and should not be so distrustful that he is always suspicious. However, in today's politics, Ruto does not feel in political fighting form if he is not attacking Raila. He fails to realise that since the handshake, attacks on Raila by those who perceive him as a possible competitor or influencer in 2022 may not yield any serious political capital. That kind of politics is history. Raila is a seasoned politician with vast knowledge of history. He has had many opportunities to examine the causes of victories and defeats, so he is not someone you can wish away. He will pull a surprise on you. He has 10 million-plus registered voters. Ruto has tried to drag Raila into Jubilee's internal wars. Now he wants to shift gears, but which one? Attack Raila Odinga! Why does he even think Raila is trying to push him out of Jubilee? And if there were such a scheme, is Raila acting alone or getting help from Ruto's former cheerleaders? As a politician, I'm reluctant to say Raila and Ruto cannot work together. However, this depends on mutual respect and common interest. The Nominated Senator spoke to the Star Click here for the latest political news
