Jacque Maribe's lawyers on Wednesday rejected a bid by the DPP to stop the Citizen TV anchor from presenting news. State counsel Catherine Mwaniki argued that the anchor should not appear on the screen as she would influence some of the witnesses in the Monica Kimani murder case. The prosecutor argued that Maribe should further be grounded so that she does not mingle with members of the public. "All we are saying is that being a media personality, there is a high possibility that while mingling with the members of the public, she is likely to take advantage to influence the witnesses," the assistant DPP said. Maribe and her fiance Joseph Irungu alias Jowie have denied killing Monica at her apartment in Kilimani on September 19. They were charged afresh on Wednesday after the prosecution was allowed to amend the charge sheet. Maribe's lawyer Katwa kigen said the anchor has demonstrated cooperation saying this should go into informing the judge's discretion. He added that the relationship between a mother and her child cannot be supplemented by the rest of the family. "The mere fact that she has a supportive family is not a reason to deny her bail," Kigen argued. Judge James Wakiaga said Maribe and her fiancé will remain in custody until Tuesday, October 30, the day the court will rule on their bail application. The court will also rule on whether the Citizen TV anchor will be able to present news if released on bond. Wakiaga said he needed time to deliberate on the submissions made by the prosecution and defence lawyers.
