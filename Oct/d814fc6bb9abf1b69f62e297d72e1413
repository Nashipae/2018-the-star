2016 World Half Marathon silver medallist Bedan Karoki is targeting to win his first career marathon when he parades in Chicago on Sunday. Karoki, who took part in half marathon in Buenos Aires in late August and finished second in 59.48, said he is relishing the challenge of competing in the windy city. “I have trained well for the event and I am looking forward to putting my best foot forward and hopefully win my first marathon,” said Karoki. Karoki’s preparations were, however, hampered by a slight ankle injury after the event in Argentina but said he has recovered well from the setback. “For the first two weeks of September, I was recovering from the injury but I am now fit. I have put in the hard work in training and I can’t wait for Sunday to compete against the world’s best,” added Karoki. It will be Karoki’s fourth career marathon, having finished third at 2016 London Marathon on his debut over the distance with a personal best of 2 hours, 07 minutes and 41 seconds. He then settled for fourth place at the Fukuoka Marathon last year, before returning to London this year for a fifth place finish in 2:08:34. Karoki said he has grown in confidence in the 42km event . “I am not afraid of anyone. I will stick to my race tactics and be competitive,” he said, adding that the weather will be ideal with warm conditions expected. Karoki will be up against two-time world marathon champion Abel Kirui and Dickson Chumba.
