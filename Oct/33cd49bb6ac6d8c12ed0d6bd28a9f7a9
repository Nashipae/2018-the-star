More than 2,500 members of the Ilmusakara clan in Kajiado have said they will support Governor Joseph Lenku’s reelection in 2022. They said the governor has initiated many development projects and he deserves a second term in office to do more. The members through their community kingpin and Kaputiei North MCA Joshua Olowuasa said the declaration to support Lenku is historic for they have never supported any leader from outside. Ilmusakara community in Kajiado East Constituency is the most single populous clan that contributes 50 per cent of voters. All elected Kajiado East constituency MCAs come from the clan. They are Kenyewa/Poka’s Henry Kimiti, Paul Matuyia (Kitengela), Francis Kaesha (Oloosirkon/Sholinke), Kaputiei North’s Olowuasa and Imaroro MCA Amos Peshut. “We are pleased to announce to you that we are happy with your work and you have proved to be a unifying factor in a county that had remained divided for many generations because of leaders who fronted clanism,” said Olowuasa. Olowuasa underscored the various projects Governor Lenku has initiated in Kaputiei North Ward. Governor Lenku said his wish is to have a united Kajiado that is bound together away from the spirits of clanism Click here for the latest political news
