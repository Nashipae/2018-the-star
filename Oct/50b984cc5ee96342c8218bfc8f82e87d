State House operative Dennis Itumbi, a close friend of TV presenter Jacque Maribeâ€™s, has termed comedian Eric Omondi's much-trolled post of her baby as a friendly gesture. The Citizen TV anchor is currently in court over the murder of businesswoman Monicah Kimani. She denies the charges. "Eric Omondi is an adult and what people say on social media cannot change his friendship with anyone," Itumbi told Word Is. "If he has expressed his friendship towards Jacque Maribe just like me and many others, it doesn't matter what you write on social media, we will continue being friends. I cannot comment on whether he is the baby daddy or not, but I'm sure Jacque at the appropriate time will address the issue." In a recent interview with the media, Eric denied being the father of Jacque's son, and instead promised to reveal who it is. This has kept many of their fans in the dark, wondering if Eric is the baby daddy and if he is taking care of the child since the TV anchor was incarcerated three weeks ago. Most of Jacque's friends have visited her and even attended court for mention, but Eric Omondi has not been captured in any photo circulating on social media. Itumbi, the digital innovations communications secretary at State House, is one of the friends who have shown solidarity by visiting her in detention. "Friendship is stitched directly to human beings, and those connected by relationship will never be separated, because their stitches lie so deep in their human personality, no matter what happens," he said.
