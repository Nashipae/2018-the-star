Rampant drug abuse, overconsumption of illicit alcohol, bisexuality and watching of pornography are the main causes of mental disorders among the youths across the country. This is according to the nurse in charge of mentally ill patients at Webuye Subcounty Hospital Violet Kwanusu. She spoke on Wednesday during World Mental Health Day celebrations. Kwanusu said the number of people who have mental disorders in Bungoma East has risen over the years. “Our children are engaging in sexual relations that deviate from the norm; boys are getting together with their fellow boys,” she said.
