He said measures, which he did not disclose, are in place to prevent cheating in this year's exams. "I would like to urge that everyone involved in this process makes sure that we don't have early exposure. If we work together, we shall deliver credible examinations." Magoha warned of "tough action against any examination official who will toy around with the process." "The exam centre involved in the same will be closed."
