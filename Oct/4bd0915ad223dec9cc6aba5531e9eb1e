An MCA in Kilifi has asked ODM to dismiss MPs and elected leaders said to have defied the party by supporting Deputy President William Ruto's 2022 bid. Nixon Muramba of Kakuyuni ward said the party leadership should not exercise leniency when dealing with the 'rebellious lot'. He asked ODM leader Raila Odinga and Secretary Edwin Sifuna "not to fear but to nullify the errant politicians' membership for a by-election to fill the respective seats." "The law should take its course equally. We must not favor rebelÂ MPS and be tough on MCAs. If it was me who rebelled, all the laws would have axed me," he said. Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori and his Malindi counterpart Aisha Jumwa have said they will not appear before the ODM disciplinary committee on October 10. They were summoned alongside MPs Owen Baya (Kilifi North), Badi Twalib (Jomvu), and Benjamin Tayari (Kinango) as well as several other MCAs from Kisii and Homa Bay. But the Kakuyuni MCA says the ODM disciplinary committee must not relent to remove the lot from the party should they fail to heed to the summonses. Muramba also dismissed remarks by Ruto to the effect that Raila is plotting his removal from the Jubilee party. "All of us know that the handshake was to cool to political temperatures that soared in the country after the two elections in 2017. It had no aim of removing Ruto."
