Kenya Simbas build up matches against British Army and South African outfit Loftus 2000 are in doubt. The Simbas were due to play the army outfit next week and Loftus 2000 on October 28 at the RFUEA ground. KRU chairman Richard Omwela yesterday said the two teams are yet to confirm on their availability. “As of now, I don’t know if the two games will go ahead. But I can confirm the build-up matches against Namibia on October 21 at home and Romania in Bucharest on November 3 are fully funded and approved by World Rugby and will go ahead,” added Omwela. The Simbas, who halted training last weekend owing to non-payment of allowances, will now resume training tomorrow after part of their dues were paid on Tuesday following intervention by the Ministry of Sports. “The local coaches, who had not been paid their salaries, have also been sorted their July salaries,” he said. Head coach Ian Snook said the build-up matches are key if the Simbas are to have any chance of qualifying for the Rugby World Cup next year in Japan. Of interest to the technical bench is how the Kenya Sevens’ players Sammy Oliech, Collins Injera, Andrew Amonde and Nelson Oyoo will fare in the build up matches. “The Sevens and 15s games are different in several aspects so we want see how they will cope in the build matches,” he noted.
