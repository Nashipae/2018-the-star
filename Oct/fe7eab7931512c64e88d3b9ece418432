The Kenyan shilling is forecast to come under pressure due to end month demand and excess money market liquidity, traders said. Commercial banks quoted the shilling at 101.20/30 compared with 100.95/101.05 at last Thursday’s close. “There is pressure on the local currency explained by excess liquidity in the money market and end month dollar demand,” said a senior trader at one commercial bank. The Uganda shilling is seen trading in a firm position, helped by flat importer demand for dollars and inflows from offshore investors seeking to invest in Ugandan debt. Commercial banks quoted the shilling at 3,755/3,765, same level as last Thursday’s close. “Offshore investors are coming back, so we expect support from their inflows while on other hand appetite is down,” Faisal Bukenya, head of treasury at Exim Bank, said. Tanzania’s shilling will likely appreciate slightly as companies and non-governmental organisations sell dollars to meet their end of the month like salaries. Commercial banks quoted the shilling at 2,286/2,296 to the dollar, compared with last Thursday’s close of 2,292/2,297. “Next week we forecast that the shilling will be stable and even stronger than this week by appreciating for at least a shilling,” said Mohamed Laseko, senior trader at CRDB Bank.
