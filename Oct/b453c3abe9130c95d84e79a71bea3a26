A 13-year-old girl has committed suicide after fighting with her cousin over a remote control in Elemetaita, Gilgil. A witness Ibrahim Wainaina said the two girls were watching soap operas when one changes the channel. “This angered the deceased and a fight ensued before she ran out of the house and committed suicide by hanging herself in another room,” he said. Gilgil OCPD Emmanuel Opuru said police have started investigations. “We had an incident where a 13-year-old girl committed suicide after fighting with her cousin over a remote and the body is in Gilgil sub-county hospital mortuary,” he said. Meanwhile, the eight-year-old boy who was brutally murdered and his body dumped in a Naivasha estate has been identified by the father. Police are looking for the boy's step-mother who was last seen with the class two student in Karagita on Sunday. The body was found on Monday with indications that he had been strangled. Area assistant Chief David Kaviku said the step-mother went into hiding since Sunday when the minor also disappeared. Click here for the latest political news
