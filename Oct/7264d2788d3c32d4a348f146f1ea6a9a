City Hall’s failure to renew contracts of garbage collection firms or hire new ones has been blamed for the heaps of uncollected trash in estates and slums in the city. The county has not renewed contracts of at least 30 firms whose terms expired in February. Currently, there are only nine contractors tasked with collection of garbage in the entire capital. They are overwhelmed. The revelations emerged during a meeting of Environment committee and Environment executive Larry Wambua and chief officer David Makori on Wednesday. “As a sector, we initiated the procurement process in September last year by writing to the county secretary when we realised that most of the contracts were expiring in February,” Makori said. He said they got approval and forwarded the same to the procurement department to continue with the process. “The process stuck there and we have not received any response. So we have nine contractors at the moment who are working on rational basis,” he said. Wambua said the nine firms have capacity to collect garbage in the city since each of them has at least eight trucks. “We move them around because they have enough trucks to do the work. Some of them have up to 30 trucks. We felt that we better have a few firms with capacity than have 30 that will not work for us,” he said. But MCAs complained about the uncollected garbage, adding that they rarely see garbage trucks in their wards.
