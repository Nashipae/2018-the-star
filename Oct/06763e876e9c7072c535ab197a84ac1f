Detectives have questioned Marsabit Governor Ali Mohamud Mohamed and two MPs over the county's ethnic clashes that have left 14 people dead. Saku MP Dido Rasso and his North Horr counterpart Chachu Nganya were separately grilled by DCI officers in Embu on Wednesday. The investigation is led by Eastern region Director of Criminal Investigation John Gacomo. The leaders were summoned amid adverse mentions of their suspected involvement in the skirmishes. However, they accused the security teams of failing to play their role and properly handle the issues related to past and recent conflicts in Marsabit. Three people died on Wednesday in a dawn attack at Jaldesa village. According to residents, the incident was a retaliatory raid targeting women and children who had fled their homes in Qubi Qallo and Dhokatu villages on Tuesday. Hundreds of people have fled their homes since the sporadic clashes erupted in September with more officers being deployed there. The fighting has been linked to politics, with some leaders said to be fanning violence as they position themselves for the 2022 general election.
