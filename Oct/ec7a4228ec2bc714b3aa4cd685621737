A total of 1600 teams have enlisted for the second season of Chapa Dimba na Safaricom tournament starting this weekend with group matches in the Western region. Eighty matches will be played today and tomorrow at different venues in Kakamega and Vihiga while Busia and Butere will host 29 games next weekend. The competition will then move to Nyanza, Rift Valley, Eastern, Coast, Central, North Eastern and Nairobi regions. “We are glad to note that more youth football teams have enlisted for this year’s tournament to make it 1,600 up from 1,520 teams that participated in the first edition. This is due to FKF’s great work of recruiting and using their grassroots network to full effect and also because of the great feedback received from the first season’s success,” said Charles Kare, acting director-consumer business at Safaricom. “In this second season, we will also hold empowerment sessions for players across the country in conjunction with the Safaricom’s youth network, BLAZE,” he said. Each team will comprise of 15 players and 2 officials for the group stages. Just like in the first season, the tourney will target aspiring male and female youth aged between 16-20 years with an aim of developing grassroots football, scouting for talent and propelling gifted players to national glory. The regional champions will play in a national final in 2019 where the winning teams will walk away with Sh1 million. “This season, my team and I are excited by the fact that 32 of the event’s most gifted players will get a chance to play with the best youth sides in Spain due to the partnership with La Liga,” said Nick Mwendwa, FKF President.
