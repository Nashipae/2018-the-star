IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati is blaming everyone but himself for the mess that occurred at the commission last year. Yet it is public knowledge and a statutory requirement that the commission works in a collegial manner. While the CEO/secretary is the officer responsible for the functioning of the organisation, the commissioners set policy and make key decisions. Through plenary meetings, they are appraised of all activities undertaken by the commission and issue directions. In most cases, the secretariat only implements the decisions of the commissioners, which are often put to a vote, especially where big money is involved. Chebukati’s attempts to absolve himself or shift blame to the CEO is tantamount to saying he was not in charge or failed in his oversight. So, why then, should the public entrust him with further stewardship of the important commission and at so much expense? The upheavals that began last year, leading to the resignation of four commissioners and last week’s eventual ejection of CEO Ezra Chiloba, only point to the need for thorough overhaul of the electoral body. Part of the restructuring should include limiting commissioners to a fixed term to oversee only one election. It defies reason how the current commission, whose term expires in 2023, can oversee the boundaries review and imminent constitutional referendum. The IEBC should be restructured now, free of any political contests and partisan interests — an opportunity that is being squandered by Parliament.
