DCI chief George Kinoti and DPP Noordin Haji have pledged to work together to ensure thorough investigation and prosecution of criminal cases. Speaking on Tuesday during the induction of new staff in the DPP's office, Kinoti said the partnership between the two will help deal with the cases swiftly. “The defence has in the past used this as a weakness where the prosecutor meets the investigator in court and asks for the file without prior knowledge of the case,” Kinoti said. He said in the new partnership, both sides will now be interacting from the beginning of the case. Haji said both sides have one main purpose, to ensure justice is served. "Your decisions will have a significant impact," he said. Kinoti also urged the recruits to be sincere and uphold integrity. The event was graced by AG Kariuki Kihara, Court of Appeal Judge Patrick Kiage and Chief Registrar Ann Amadi among others. The 90 inductees include 70 new prosecutors who will be trained and sent to the 47 counties in all court stations. Haji said, unlike previous induction programmes which lasted only two weeks this one is tailored to improve staff efficiency. Kihara congratulated the recruits and encouraged them to be professional in their work. Kinoti emphasised the importance of teamwork between his office and the prosecutors in order to win cases.
