ICT Cabinet secretary Joe Mucheru yesterday defended the Data Protection Bill against claims it seeks to muzzle the media and restrict press freedom. He said there’s no cause for alarm. The proposed law will promote privacy of personal information, he said. “I received a text message in the morning accusing our bill of undermining the freedom of the press. Why don’t the press bring their concerns now?” Mucheru asked in Nairobi during the official launch of public participation on the bill. He said the bill respects human rights and has been formulated in a manner that will protect personal data in manual, electronic and any other form. The Cabinet member urged Kenyans to give their views before the bill is passed by Parliament and signed by the President. Data protection and privacy will not compromise the country’s security, he said. “The proposed law is quite good and there’s no need for alarm. It doesn’t interfere with the national and cross-border security,” Mucheru said. For the past six months, the taskforce on development of policy and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection has been collecting views from the private sector, civil rights organisations and members of the public in some parts of the country. Chairperson Mercy Wanjau yesterday said the views are essential if Kenya is to have a useful law. She urged the country to give input and remain steadfast as it waits for the bill to be taken to the National Assembly.
