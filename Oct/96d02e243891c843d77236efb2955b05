Women have been advised to be good role models and refrain from hurling gender-based insults at their fellow women competitors when seeking elective seats. Narc-Kenya leader Martha Karua said people can respectfully differ. “So be elected on your strength and not on the weakness of the other person,” she said. The former Gichugu MP spoke in Nyeri town on Friday during the launch of Nyeri County Assembly Women Association’s strategic plan for 2018-23. Karua said she made sure she did not, however much provoked she was, hurl insults at her competitor in the last General Election. She ran for Kirinyaga governor against Anne Waiguru, who won the seat. Karua urged women to ignore sexuality during campaigns, saying it is brought up to embarrass them. “How do you go to a meeting to discuss such things? Just go with your agenda and ignore completely things that do not merit any mention,” she said. Karua told women seeking political seats to know they are going places whenever people hurl insults at them.
