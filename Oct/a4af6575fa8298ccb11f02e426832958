The 14-day demolition notice for Seefar apartments at Nyayo Highrise has been extended to 30 days. The National Environment Management Authority said in a statement on Monday it arrived at the decision after the directors of Edermann Property, the developers of the block of flats, presented an Environmental Impact Assessment report. The authority said it needs to consult and conduct investigations first to guide its decision. “As resolved in the meeting of October 15, 2018, morning and your request for a joint inspection, NEMA will organise this and invite your representatives as soon as possible,” read the statement signed by David Ongare. “Please note, the order [to demolition the building] still holds, but however, it is extended to 30 days to allow consultation and investigation to guide the authorities decision."
