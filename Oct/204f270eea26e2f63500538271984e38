A woman was admitted to a Naivasha hospital after she was attacked by a buffalo amid concerns of rising cases of human-wildlife conflict. The victim of the attack was fetching firewood in Eburru village in Gilgil sub-county when the animal attacked her leaving her for the dead on Tuesday. A local leader Lydia Nyota itÂ was not the first time the animals from nearby private conservancies had attacked residents. She said the animals have left a trail of destruction after invading farms wiping out food crops, some ready to be harvested. In the latest case, Nyota said the woman was rescued by a group of youths who were from watching a football match. "It is by grace of God that she survived but was left nursing serious injuries and is admitted in critical condition." She said that despite informing Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) officers to track the animal, nothing has happened. "The Buffalo is still straying into farms and we fear that there could be more attacks especially on our children who go to school early in the morning," she said. Residents of Longonot village called on KWS to contain wild animals that have been straying into their farms. Click here for the latest political news
