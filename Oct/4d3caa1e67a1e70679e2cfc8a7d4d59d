Lake Victoria South Water Service Board is on the spot over Sh77.8 million it spent on five water projects but which Auditor General Edward Ouko says could not be confirmed. Ouko in his 2016-17 report raised alarm over possible loss of taxpayers’ money in Chuboit Water supply, Okwanyoyo Dam, Chebirir Dam, Rangwe Water Project and Kegati and Kajulu water projects. Physical verification showed the contractors abandoned some projects halfway and in some instanceswhat was being implemented was not what was contained in the bill of quantities. For example, at Kegati and Kajulu water projects, the Ouko team found the Sh68,383,494 project abandoned, even after LVSWS had paid Sh65 million, which is 80 per cent of the contract sum. In Chuboit project, which was built at a cost of Sh3.8 million, the audit report reveals non-compliance with the bills of quantities, the same case with the Sh3.5m Okwanyoyo dam and Chebirir dam, which cost Sh1 million. At Rangwe water project, a local company was awarded the tender to construct three water tanks at an exaggerated Sh 4.2 million, which was four times more than what the valuation report indicated.

The report shows the contractor built another 25 meters cubic of masonry tank in Ndiru at exaggerated figure of Sh 711,000, something Ouko noted could cost Sh 171,165. Ouko also questioned the Sh1,089,000 used to put up 50 meters cubic masonry tank at Ndiru. The valuation report estimated the same could have been constructed at Sh 311,935. Even after inflating figures, physical verification by the audit team revealed works in the three tanks stalled and the contractor left the site. “The incomplete works were revalued and fresh bid floated for completion of the works all valued as Sh 1,369,589 during the year 2017/2018,” Ouko noted. The report tabled by National Assembly majority leader Adan Duale on Tuesday also questioned Sh 701,922 claimed to have been spent on travel, accommodation and subsistence of staff and which no supporting document was availed.
