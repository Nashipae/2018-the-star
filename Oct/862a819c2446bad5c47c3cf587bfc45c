Governors want the national government to set a new maize price and reopen the NCPB depots to buy the produce from farmers. Maize prices have dropped to as low as Sh800 per 90kg bag. The National Cereals and Produce Board had been buying maize at Sh3,200 per bag as directed by the government last year. But the governors and farmers want the price raised because of the increased cost of farm inputs. “Farmers are now harvesting in some areas and the government should not abandon them at their hour of need because the current market situation will lead to heavy losses for farmers,” Uasin Gishu governor Jackson Mandago said. He spoke in Eldoret after a Council of Governors (CoG) meeting chaired by chairman Josphat Nanok (Turkana). Others present included Alex Tolgos of Elgeyo Marakwet, his Trans Nzoia counterpart Patrick Khaemba and Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno. The governors said they are looking for alternative markets for farmers’ produce, value addition and diversification. Mandago and Khaemba said they will soon begin talks with investors from Qatar over an animal feeds deal. Nanok said they are concerned that farmers are growing desperate and may stop growing maize from next year after suffering heavy losses. He said the NCPB still has the capacity to take it an extra 2.7 million bags of maize. In the last two weeks the NCPB has paid out Sh1.4 billion to farmers who delivered maize since last year. But Nanok said the board still owes farmers Sh3 billion which should be paid before farmers start delivering the new harvest. The counties want to partner with the national government so they can store maize and distribute subsidised fertiliser to farmers.
