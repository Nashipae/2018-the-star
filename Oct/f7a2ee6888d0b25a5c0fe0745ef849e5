Migori Woman Rep Pamela Odhiambo has been involved in a road accident at Winyo area that claimed the life of her bodyguard Fred Owich. The accident took place at 10 am. Pamela alongside two other passengers Daniel Onyango and David Ouma were rushed to Migori Referral Hospital before being transferred to Aga Khan Hospital in Kisumu. “The vehicle had four occupants and was heading towards Homa Bay town,” Rongo police boss Kibet Kirui said. The accident occurred after the driver swayed the vehicle to avoid hitting a boda boda rider. It then veered off the road and rolled several times. The body of the deceased was taken to Rosewood Hospital mortuary in Rongo. ODM leader Raila Odinga via Twitter wished Pamela quick recovery. "We have received disturbing news about ... the grisly road accident. I wish the MP quick recovery. My deep and sincere condolences to the family of Dr Odhiambo's bodyguard." Odhiambo was heading to Homa Bay for a public function led by Baringo Senator Gideon Moi. In March 2014, the first Migori Women Representative and now nominated MP Dennitah Ghati was also involved in a road accident at Ntulele area, 30 kilometres from Narok Town. Ghati was driving to Nairobi when her car rolled about 200 metres off the road. She sought specialised treatment in India after injuring her backbone and is using a wheelchair to date.
