Siaya senator James Orengo yesterday criticised Deputy President William Ruto, saying he is not sincere in backing the referendum to change the 2010 Constitution. On Saturday, Ruto said he backs the calls to change the Constitution, but maintained he would oppose the change if it was to create a post for ODM leader Raila Odinga. “We have no problem with the referendum. Our problem is hypocrisy and conmanship, to tell us the referendum was agreed during the handshake, you are lying to us,” Ruto said in Tharaka Nithi. In a rejoinder in Mombasa yesterday, Orengo told off Ruto for “spreading lies” that Raila is interested in creating positions for opposition leaders.

He says he supports, but quickly says he does not support if the agenda is about creating position for the opposition. It has nothing to do with position. It is about making the systems better. Ruto is not sincere,” he said. Orengo said Ruto should look at the Okoa Bill, which was drafted by NASA in the run up to last year’s general election which came up with a Bill for a referendum.
