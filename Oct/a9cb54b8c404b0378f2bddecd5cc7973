Police in Kisumu visited Baby Samantha Pendo’s home about three weeks after her assault was reported. Police have said thay failed to secure the crime scene, following the child’s assault and death after last year’s election chaos. Corporal Anthony Egesa, a crime scene officer based at the Kisumu DCI, told the hearing on Friday they visited the place on September 2, 2017. The assault on Baby Pendo by people suspected to be police officers happened on August 12 last year. A report was made at Nyalenda police post by her father Joseph Abanja on August 16 last year, a day after the six-month-old infant succumbed to head injuries at Aga Khan Hospital, Kisumu. Egesa, when asked who was to blame for not securing the crime scene, said the officers who were on duty when the matter was reported. He said the officer on duty at Nyalenda police post should have made arrangements to secure the scene. Egesa was responding to a question from lawyer Richard Onsongo, when he appeared before senior resident magistrate Beryl Omollo on Friday. The officer was in court to produce the 30 photographs he took at Pendo’s home and during the post-mortem to be used as exhibits. Click here for the latest political news
