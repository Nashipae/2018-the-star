Nyeri governor Mutahi Kahiga has defended his plans to tarmac the road leading to Nyeri County Referral Hospital. The county has also expanded the mortuary at the facility for Sh15 million. Senator Ephraim Maina had accused the Kahiga administration of focussing on the mortuary at the expense of medical services. Kahiga on Thursday dismissed the claims. “If you have no other agenda for Nyeri people, stop lecturing us on what to do. That road will be tarmacked,” he said during the launch of two open-air markets in Nyeri town. The markets were recently refurbished. Kahiga said a community can be judged harshly or favourably by the way it handles the dead. “There are people complaining that we are only concentrating on expanding the mortuary,” he said. He said the dead should not be dumped on the floor as they were when he visited the morgue soon after taking office. Some 26 bodies were on the floor, he said. Kahiga promised to ignore politics and focus on development projects. The county will build more markets for another 600 traders and upgrade more roads. The county chief directed Transport and Infrastructure executive Muthui Kariuki to ensure small-scale traders are not evicted from their roadside stalls during the road expansions.
