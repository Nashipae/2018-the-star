Nairobi county has banned Early Childhood Development Education graduation ceremonies, calling them costly and illegal. ECDE education is free. Education executive Janet Ouko yesterday said parents were being blackmailed and told that without the graduation ceremonies, their children would not move to next level. “From the complaints we have gotten, parents are being asked to pay between Sh1,000-1,500 for graduation ceremonies. The parents are being blackedmailed because no one wants their child blocked from the the next level of education,” Ouko said. She said the county government had a free ECDE policy and such activities would not be allowed since they are used as a disguise levies. Ouko said ECDE centres in the city have recorded increased enrollment since the introduction of free milk programme last month. Enrollment has risen by 4,080 children since the centres were made free and the free milk introduced. “Some of the children do not come from well-off families and come to school on empty stomachs. However, the milk has been sustaining the children and the progress in well,” Ouko said. The programme is set to see the delivery of a packet of milk two times a week to each of the 17,000 children in all public ECDE centres in Nairobi. The milk programme is a donation from Brookside Dairies, whichis encourage children to take three packets of milk per day to boost their nutrition,” Ouko said. Recently, Governor Mike Sonko said the free ECDE budget is not an avenue for people to misuse money. “I want to see strict and transparent steps taken to ensure these funds are used for the intended purpose. Anyone who misuses money set aside for ECDE will be arrested and prosecuted,” he warned.
