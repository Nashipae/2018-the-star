The National Assembly Trade and Industry committee has summoned Trade CS Peter Munya to explain the influx of contraband and substandard goods into the country. Also summoned for next Tuesdayâ€™s meeting by the team chaired by Kanini Kega (Kieni) are KRA boss John Njiraini and head of anti-counterfeit agency and deputy Head of Public Service Wanyama Musiambu. The three failed to appear before the MPs yesterday and instead sent their representatives. Njiraini sent KRA customs and border control commissioner Julius Musyoki. In a letter to the MPs, he said the officer was more appropriate to respond. But the MPs rejected the representatives, saying the issue was too weighty to be delegated to junior officers. Aldai MP Cornelly Serem demanded that the trio be compelled to personally appear and respond. He said substandard goods that have been impounded easily find their way into the markets and are sold to unsuspecting customers. Click here for the latest political news
