NCIC chief executive officer Hassan Mohamed yesterday expressed concern over the absence of commissioners, saying it is hurting the work of the agency. He told the Senate National Cohesion committee that the National Cohesion and Integration Commission is unable to prosecute any case since the exit of eight commissioners. He said they have been relying on other government agencies, including the DCI and ODPP, to handle its cases. The term of the eight commissioners ended on August 12. A replacement process has yet to be initiated. Initially, the team headed by former House Speaker Francis ole Kaparo were to leave office in August last year, having served a three-year term, but had their tenure extended by President Uhuru Kenyatta for one more year. “Cases which require prosecutions have been hugely affected, as the secretariat alone cannot take people to court,” Mohamed said. He said, however, that they are having the cases prosecuted in courts even though they are not at the forefront. The NCIC accused the executive of deliberately attempting to create parallel agencies that duplicate their functions. Mohamed singled out the National Steering Committee for Peace Building in the Interior ministry and the Cohesion department in the Office of the President as two bodies giving the commission unnecessary competition.
