Onkar Rai is expected to defend the Chloride Exide Hill Climb title when the next round of the competition set for November 24-25 on the outskirts of Naivasha. The event, the last of the three-round-series, which is organised by Rift Valley Motor Sport Club, will run on a new venue after the cancellation of the previous round. The organisers have secured a new venue at the Malewa Bay, which is situated about 21kms off the Nakuru-Moi Highway on the Moi North Lake Road. Gurvir Bhabra, the race director, said there will be a special venue for the spectators when the next round of the Chloride Exide-sponsored Hill Climb competition takes place. “There will be a Spectators area to be known as “King of Hill”, where results will be relayed and displayed on a notice board. Spectators can come in and out of venue at anytime during event. Spectator access is not in the way of the competition route,” he said. Bhabra added: “The Hill Climb team is eager to show off the latest wireless photocells for jump starts and flying finish. For the new series in 2019, the organisers will be introducing extra photocells to allow results to include split times along the route.” Chloride Exide group managing director, Guy Jack said: “We are honoured to be this year’s title sponsors of the Hill climb in collaboration with the sponsors Chloride Exide.’’ Rai won the opening round of the competition earlier in the year in his Skoda Fabia. Other rally drivers expected to enter the event include Carl Tundo, Baldev Chager, Tejvir Rai among others. Shivam Vinayak, who won the motorcycle category in the first round, is also expected to lead the two-wheel-drive machines.
