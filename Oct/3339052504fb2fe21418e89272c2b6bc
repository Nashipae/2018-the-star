Former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga yesterday took to the dock to defend Muhuri over allegations it was funding al Shabaab activities. Mutunga testified in a suit where Muhuri is demanding damages over the unfair freezing of their bank accounts in 2015. Muhuri has sued the Attorney General, Inspector General, Central Bank of Kenya and Financial Reporting Centre and they are demanding Sh2.2 million damages. In April 2015, Muhuri was among 85 NGOs accused of aiding terror activities in the country. Their bank accounts were frozen for eight months before a Mombasa High Court ordered reopening of the accounts. Mutunga, who at the time of the incident was the sitting CJ, said the news of the organisation being linked to terrorism was “painful” considering he was the founder. Mutunga said he founded Muhuri alongside activist Amin Kimathi 21 years ago and had to hand it over to a board after he was appointed to head another organisation. “It was painful for me considering I had founded the NGO and I had known its chairman Khelef Khalifa for 18 years,” he said. The former CJ said he started having doubts about the organisation and its leadership considering the reports on their activities that came from the Inspector General. “I was yearning to call the IG so that he could confirm the allegations on the Gazette notice but at my position, I knew I would get into trouble as I would be interfering with the duties of another office,”Mutunga said. The former CJ said the effects of such grave allegations levied against the organisation were prudent as it opened it to more scrutiny. Click here for the latest political news
