Police in Kisumu have recovered an AK 47 rifle stolen from an Administration Police officer last week in Kibos area, Kisumu East Sub County. According to area OCPD Ancient Kaloki, the firearm was recovered after police officers from the Quick Response Team (QRT) and the Crime Unit ambushed a gang of three armed with the firearm while trailing a business woman. “After a fierce fire exchange, the three were overwhelmed and escaped to a nearby thicket around Uzima University along the Mamboleo Road leaving behind the rifle loaded with 26 rounds of ammunition”, said Kaloki. Several mobile phones were also recovered by the police during the Sunday night ordeal. Meanwhile, the youthful Administration Police Officer who was attacked and lost his firearm succumbed to his injuries at the Jaramogi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Kisumu later last week. Constable Francis Monte met his tragic death while manning Kenya Bureau of Standards Office at Kibos in Kisumu. Kaloki also confirmed the death saying the officer died while undergoing treatment after being injured during the Saturday night incident. “It’s quite sad we have lost a young brilliant officer who was dedicated to serving the nation”, added the OCPD. Monte was found lying unconscious by a passers-by that night who later informed his colleague with whom they were manning with the government installation. The officer found his colleague lying with injuries suspected to have been inflicted with a sharp object on the head and chest. The attackers escaped with the officer’s firearm loaded with 30 bullets together with his wallet and mobile phone.
