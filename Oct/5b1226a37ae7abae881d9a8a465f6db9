President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday commissioned the Sh200 million New KCC Sotik Factory. It is part of its Sh1 billion modernisation project. The project commenced in 2017 to enhance efficiency, processing and packaging. The Sotik factory is expected to serve farmers from Bomet, Kericho, Kisii, Narok and Molo. Uhuru said the modernisation of New KCC is part of the government’s broader agenda of ensuring food security for all Kenyans. “The benefits of modernisation across the production value chain is evident with increased farmer earnings from Sh2.5 billion to the current Sh4.5 billion per year. It is expected to reach Sh6 billion once the modernisation is complete,” Uhuru said in Bomet. The President said recovered stolen public property will be ploughed back to help farmers and other sectors of the economy. Deputy President William Ruto said the government will provide 35 milk coolers to farmers in Sotik. Bomet governor Joyce Laboso praised the New KCC for supporting farmers for many decades and looking for markets for their milk. “Farmers are for the revival and modernising the New KCC,” she said.
