Two people, one of them a schoolchild, died in two separate accidents on the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu highway on Tuesday. In the first accident, a 13-year-old girl who was heading home from school was hit and killed by a speeding lorry near Muniu trading centre, about two kilometres to Mai Mahiu town. The girl, who was crossing the road, died on the spot. In the second accident a lorry conductor died when two railers collided. Residents called for speed bumps to curb accidents on the road. Resident Joseph Kimani said schoolchildren rush to cross the road without taking precaution, adding that erecting speed bumps will protect them. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru confirmed the accidents. Click here for the latest political
