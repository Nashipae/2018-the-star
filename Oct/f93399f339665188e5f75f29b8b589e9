The Kisii government will in the next two weeks start laying off workers who were sneaked into the payroll. Governor James Ongwae said some individuals colluded to enter names into the payroll when he was busy campaigning to retain his seat. He said a report is out and will be presented to the county assembly for adoption to enable the process start. Ongwae spoke after 17 chief officers signed performance contracts. He said his administration spends a lot resources on recurrent expenditure as opposed to development. Ongwae warned lazy county employees, saying it will not be business as usual. He said they must deliver effective services to the people. “I am reminding all my officers that they were not employed to earn salaries, but provide eff ective services to the people who are our masters,” he said. Present during the ceremony was county commissioner Godff rey Kigochi and speaker David Kombo. The governor said employees will only be promoted based on performance and not years of service. Ongwae said appraisals for employees in job group J and above will start next year. He said development activities in the county stalled because the national government has not released development funds. The county boss, however, assured residents in the 45 wards that development activities will begin next week because the money will be released. In order to achieve their development objectives, Ongwae directed the assembly committee chair on budget Dennis Ombachi to lead MCAs in identifying projects of priority.
