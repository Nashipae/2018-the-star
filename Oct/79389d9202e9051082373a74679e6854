Wazir Chacha, the man accused of extorting money from MPs, says he has been receiving messages from desperate people asking him to hook them up with sugar mummies. He made headlines after releasing intimate photos with former Bomet woman representative Cecilia Ng’etich. “People think there is a short-cut in life but I want to tell them that everyone has to work hard. People text me that they want sugar mummies, but I want them to know that I am not a dating agency,” Chacha told Word is. “And by the way, no rich man will date a broke person. Those MPs have money. The same way you meet poor people is the same way I meet rich people, ask them for dinner, which I can also afford by myself.” It was said he had bedded several women lawmakers, even though some, including Murang’a woman representative Sabina Chege vehemently denied the allegation. “I have dated only two lawmakers and not 13 as claimed,” Chacha said. “I am not a slay king, but I must look well and dress nicely because the first impression is very important. “I am looking for a mature person who will handle the impression that has already been created outside there by the media that I am a con, which I am not. I am still digesting the events that happened to me.” Chacha said he prefers older women to young women.“I don’t think I can handle a young woman. The two women MPs I dated were both divorced, so I did not fear anything, and their children called me uncle.”
