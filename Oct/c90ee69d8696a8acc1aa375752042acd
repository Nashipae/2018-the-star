KDF will not carry out retaliatory attacks on residents of areas where the military has been assaulted. The military has previously been accused of attacking residents in settlements where their vehicles have been destroyed. Brigadier DK Ruto, who heads Northeastern region, yesterday said both civilians and security officers have to be alert to avoid falling prey to traps set by al Shabaab. “The militants are smart. They plant IEDs on the roadside near a village targeting a security vehicle knowing very well that the officers involved will definitely descend on the neighbouring village. What these militants want to achieve is to create mistrust between the security officers and the civilians. That is what we should not allow,” he said. Ruto spoke in Mandera during the final day of a two-day stakeholders’ conference on deradicalisation, prevention and countering violent extremism. SECURITY ASSURANCE “I want to assure you that we have opened a new chapter. You will never see or hear of operations by my officers on civilians and if any, we will have to consult with the leaders and the local elders before carrying out one,” he said. Ruto said the war on terror will only be won through collaboration. He assured Mandera residents of security, adding projects would not stall. Ruto was reacting to governor Ali Roba’s comments that insecurity has slowed down multibillion-shilling projects. He said he had received petitions from development partners, including the World Bank, through the North and Northeastern Development Initiative. The partners raised concerns over insecurity. At risk are road, water and sanitation projects. combined effort “It really pains to hear the governor say that projects worth millions of shillings have failed to kick off because of insecurity. I want to give an assurance that we will not allow this to happen,” Ruto said. “My officers and those from other security departments will ensure no development projects fails to kick off or stalls.”
