A police officer attached to the Rapid Border Patrol Unit was killed by suspected Merille militia in an ambush at Todonyang, Turkana North on Sunday. County police boss Ronald Opili said the officer succumbed to gunshot wounds he sustained during the 4am attack. He said they suspect the attackers were on a mission to recover 25 heads of cattle that reportedly stolen by Turkana herdsmen. "Merille herdsmen were killed on Thursday during a raid. The attack was in retaliation to the recent killing," Opili said. Another officer was admitted to Todonyang mission Hospital for treatment for gunshot wounds. He has urged residents to be calm as the GSU have been dispatched to reinforce the RBPU in Todonyang. Click here for the latest political news
