The country needs a crop monitoring and forecasting mechanism to counter price fluctuations on maize flour, Cereal Millers Association vice chairman Nick Hutchinson has said. The feasibility process will protect farmers and consumers from price volatility. “The project will enable government track harvest from the fields to what will be stored and alert millers when prices are to about to rise,” Hutchinson said during the announcement of the forthcoming international millers conference set for this month. Prices of maize and wheat flour, country’s main staple meals, have been fluctuating mainly depending on the harvest from the local farmers, with a shortage pushing the government to import from countries such as Tanzania and Uganda. This has led to subsequent effect with maize prices rising from Sh90 per two-kilogram packet in December 2017 when the government ended the six-month subsidy to importers, to pick at a high of Sh120 in January. Now, the retail price is set to reduce to as low as Sh75, following a government directive in September. According to a Global Report on Food Crises 2018 by Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) released in March, the hike in food prices experienced in 2017 was influenced by food import bills and higher freight costs.
