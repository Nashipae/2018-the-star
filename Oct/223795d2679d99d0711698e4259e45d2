Capital
Market Authority has flagged suspicious trading in KenolKobil shares moments after French firm Rubis Energie's takeover announcement. CMA has asked the Central Depository
and Settlement Corporation to freeze accounts suspected to have traded
KenolKobil shares irregularly today (Wednesday). The regulator raised the red flag moments after Rubis Energie declared its intention to take over the listed oil marketer. The announcement saw Kenol Kobil close as the highest gainer at NSE, with its share going for Sh19.80 up from Sh15.30 the previous day, a whopping 29 per cent jump. The proposed offer of Sh23 is therefore 20.9 per cent higher to yesterday’s trading. "In connection with these
investigations, the freeze on the suspected accounts is to allow for
the conduct of the necessary inquiries," CMA said in a statement The markets regulator said that although it has received a notice of intention by Rubis
Énergie to make a cash offer to acquire 100 per cent of the ordinary share
capital of KenolKobil Plc, it will have due regard to the maintenance of the
integrity of the market and protection of investors' interests. Rubis Energie, which already owns 25 per cent
stake in the listed oil marketer, had earlier announced a take-over offer of
Sh23 per share for 75.01 per cent of issued ordinary shares of the Pan African downstream oil company. The firm intends to finance the
takeover valued at $353 million (Sh35.3
billion) through group’s cash and or from existing credit facilities. Read: French fuel firm Rubis offers to buy Kenya's KenolKobil Click here for the latest political news
