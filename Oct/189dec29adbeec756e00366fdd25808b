Tui Belgium Charter flight on Friday landed in Mombasa for the first time in five years, with 305 tourists onboard. Belgium is Kenya’s 10th contributor in arrivals from the European market. The charter had stopped following travel advisories. Tourism PS Joe Okudo and officials from Kenya Tourism Board, Tourism Fund, Mombasa county government, Pollman Tours and Safaris, Kenya Tourism Federation received the visitors. Okudo said Sh1.2 billion charter incentive program launched in 2016 has impacted positively. “The number of charters have increased from one to 10 in two years,” Okudo noted. Another two charters are expected by early next year. “It is suffices to point out that the success of the charter incentive programme has greatly helped reposition the Kenyan coast as a tourism hub,” Okudo said. The government targets a 17 per cent growth in tourist number this year. Tourism figures through Mombasa Iinternational Airport currently stands at a 46 per cent growth according to the official. Okudo listed 84,286 visitors up from 57,588 recorded in January-August this year compared to the same period in 2017. “The tourism arrivals to Kenya from Belgium last year posted a growth of 61 per cent with 10,170 visitors up from 6,320 arrivals in 2016,” Okudo said. Kenya Tourism Federation chairman Mohamed Hersi asked the government to extend the incentive period. “It should also reconsider free Visa for children,” he said. Pollman Tours and Safaris MD Khalid Shapi said jobs will be created with increase in guests. “Customer experience should be the selling point,” he said. County tourism executive officer Innocent Mugabe said they are partnering with private sectors to have more adventurous activities. Tui captain Vercaemst Bruno said it felt great to return to Kenya again. Honorary consulate Hendrik Dierick said improved security and varieties of products will attract tourists.
