The term for commissioners of the National Police Service Commission ends today after serving for six years. On September 12, the Commission said it was unable to fully discharge its mandate because President Uhuru Kenyatta usurped its powers. Commission chairman Johnstone Kavuludi singled out the 2014 amendment to the National Police Service Act and the National Police Service Act that snatched its power to recruit the Inspector General and his two deputies. The commission also identified the Judiciary and threats against the commission chairman during the vetting of police among challenges it faced. The commission came to office in 2012 and has vetted more than 10,000 officers. Apart from death threats from anonymous people, a human head was once dumped outside Kavuludi's office as the former teacher started vetting police officers.
