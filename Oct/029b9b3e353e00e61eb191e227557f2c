Meru has digitised its revenue collection systems to achieve the county’s Sh1 billion target, Deputy Governor Titus Ntuchiu has said. He said the manual collecting land rates, parking fees, advert payments and single business permits had been infiltrated by corrupt employees. The corruption led to the suspension of market attendants who were replaced by Meru Youth Service personnel. Ntuchiu said collections have improved since the changes were made. “For instance, the attendants were collecting Sh500,000 per week but that has doubled to Sh1.2 million after the deployment of Meru Youth Service officers,” he said. The target has been raised to Sh2 million every week after the automation. “Last year, we collected a paltry Sh300 million. We target Sh1 billion in annual collections,” Ntichiu said. The county has contracted Jambo Pay to run the system. County Revenue Board general manager John Ntoiti said the digital system is convenient for making payments. He said no market attendant or revenue officer will lose their jobs. “In fact, the digital system will create more employment opportunities. We want to train officers and give them special phones to carry on the exercise,” Ntoiti said. He said the board is committed to working in line with Governor Kiraitu Murungi’s directive to automate payment systems. “The digital system - Meru Pay - will enable residents to pay for parking, licences and land rates without having to walk long distances,” Ntuchiu said. The two spoke at the Meru town main stage during the unveiling of the digital system on Friday. “We are happy so far because we are on the path of making Meru great. One way to do so is to increase our local revenue,” Ntuchiu said. The deputy governor, who is also the Finance executive, said they will ensure prudent use of resources.
