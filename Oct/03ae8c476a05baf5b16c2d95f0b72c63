Small enterprises need to scale up on human capital to attain growth and profitability. Momentum Credit CEO John Muriuki said the strong influence of human capital and working capital can turn around SMEperformance in the country’s resilient business environment. “There is need to shift conversation from financial constraints encountered by businesses to incorporate other critical elements that hinder them from expansion,” Muriuki said. In the face of interest rate caps, the credit crunch from high cost of borrowing has limited cash flow to the sector. Tight budgets have made it difficult for SMEs to incorporate human resource departments or skilled workers, therefore lacking a proper structure to manage acquired loans. A World Bank Flagship Report 2019 on development stated that human capital compliments physical inputs in production process placing a business in a better position for growth in the long-run. Muriuki said other than formal education, businesses needed to invest a lot of time and resources in workforce planning. “If a business does not have the skilled personnel, inefficiencies may end eating up on working capital hence the need for employee training and development,” he said. “To address this issue, governments must seek remedies. However, because of the long time needed for human capital investments to yield economic returns, the political incentives for human capital investments are often missing. The human capital project aims to create not just these incentives, but also the policy guidance for more and better investments in human capital,” part of the report stated.
