The National Assembly got a rare visit when Mary-Georgia Onyango
took the responsibility of Speaker Justin Muturi during The International Day of the Girl Child
that was marked in Parliament. The
form 3 student at St Thaddeus High School in Embakasi chaired the
Departmental Committees on Education, Science & Technology and
Labour and Social Welfare. She not only petitioned the MPs to promote
equal opportunities for girls and boys but to also be champions and role
models of gender equality. "In
issues of gender-based violence, cases should be fast-tracked to ensure
justice is served. It is not safe for girls to live among offenders of
serious crimes like defilement and rape once they are released on bail,"
she said. Her temporary stint as speaker was facilitated by Plan International, which seeks to help build a new generation of young female leadership ready and empowered to create change.
