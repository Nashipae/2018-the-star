A bill being prepared to go before Parliament will reward whistleblowers with 10 percent of the recovered proceeds of corruption. The legislation has been under consideration for three years and is long overdue. It will give huge impetus to the Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission and the present anti-corruption drive. Very often junior officials are aware of fraudulent activities by their superiors or fellow staff but there is no personal benefit to exposing it. There is only risk. You may even lose your job if your boss tries to get rid of you as a 'troublemaker'. And the risk may be even greater if a lot of money and a lot of people are involved. If a whistleblower gets 10 percent of the money recovered or saved, then it becomes worth taking the risk of exposing the racketeers. Government will need to demonstrate good faith by paying whistleblowers without delay or dispute. But if it does start paying whistleblowers promptly, it will dramatically speed up the war on corruption.
