Good Morning. Joseph Irungu alias Jowie is expected to be arraigned at the Milimani law courts this morning to be charged with the murder of Monica Kimani who was found dead with her throat slit and put in a bathtub in her apartment in Kilimani Nairobi. Weather forecast shows that most parts of the country continue to be wet with skies expected to be gloomy and the possibility of rain in Nairobi, Central Kenya, the Coast and Western Kenya. The weatherman has indicated that most parts of the country will likely experience above average rainfall from this week as the short rains season kicks off. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this Monday. WATCH How isolation fear forced Ruto back to the drawing board Fear of isolation by major political players supporting a referendum openly or behind the scenes forced Deputy President William Ruto to abandon his hardline opposition to constitutional changes. The Star has established that for months, Ruto's allies advised him against opposing a strong pro-referendum movement too close to the 2022 general elections. A post-referendum force would trigger major political realignments, they argued, which would likely pose a major hurdle to his presidential bid should he lose the contest. Also complicating matters for the DP were fears that President Uhuru Kenyatta's inner circle is discretely supporting the changes whose public face is Opposition chief Raila Odinga. _____________________________________________________ Double murder charge for Obado over Sharon's killing Fear has engulfed the family of slain university student Sharon Otieno who have said if Migori Governor Okoth Obado is released on bail, their lives will be in danger. In an affidavit, Sharon’s mother Melinda Auma said they are living in fear and the thought of having Obado and his co-accused freed during trial is “chilling”. She wants the court to have Obado and the other suspects remain in remand as the murder trial is expedited. Auma filed the application yesterday as Obado and two others were charged afresh with the murder of Sharon and her unborn baby. The state amended the charges to include the death of the seven months old unborn baby. _____________________________________________________ MPs in fresh move to shift elections date to December Members of the National Assembly are tomorrow  expected to vote on a Bill seeking to change election date from current August to December. The sponsor of the Constitutional (Amendment) Bill Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa was up to last evening lobbying his colleagues to turn out in large numbers and vote to support his Bill. The Bill requires the support of two-thirds of the 349 MPs to sail through to the second stage. “Please, Hon. Members, the Bill pushing election date from August to December, Parliamentary voting 2nd reading is next week Wednesday (tomorrow) morning session. Remember it is two-thirds majority. Please remind your neighbours and friends,” Wamalwa pleaded with his colleagues in a text message circulated on WhatsApp. _____________________________________________________ Financial Reporting Centre faulted on graft money The Financial Reporting Centre arm of Central Bank of Kenya is not dealing with reported suspicious transactions that may be connected to corruption, according to Family Bank’s board of directors chairman Wilfred Kiboro. Commercial banks are required to report deposits or withdrawals of more than Sh1 million to the FRC. In September, KCB Bank said it made 653 reports on suspicious transactions from 2015 to August this year to the CBK, among them relating to National Youth Service (NYS) Sh8 billion money-laundering scandals. However, it did not receive any feedback from the regulator. This was days after CBK penalised KCB Group Sh149.5 million for aiding in the transfer of money. _____________________________________________________ The ongoing police reforms is more than just uniforms When President Uhuru Kenyatta launched plans to transform the National Police Service last month, he was widely misunderstood by Kenyans in general, the police in particular and the media, whose role it is to translate that vision articulately. During the National Security Conference on September 13, the President, who is also the commander-in-chief of Kenya’s Defence Forces, unveiled the Police Framework. This set the pace for the future of police in Kenya, and radically at that. This commentary seeks to clarify aspects that were misinterpreted. _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
