Auditor General Edward Ouko has highlighted the mismanagement of taxpayers’ money in a number of constituencies. The 2016-17 audit report reveals loopholes in the management of the National Government Constituency Development Fund. The mismanagement includes abandoned projects, missing records and unexplained expenditure running into millions of shillings. In Narok North, Sh1,818,000 imprests supposedly issued to constituency staff could not be accounted for. The Ouko team also unearthed Sh15 million unsupported project management committee expenditure which could not be accounted for. The audit report revealed that project committee bank transactions moved from an opening balance of Sh 19,887,800 as at July 2016 to a closing balance of Sh 4,085,949 as at June 30, 2017 occasioning a net withdrawal of Sh 15,801,850 not supported or accounted for by the relevant expenditure returns. “In the circumstances, it was therefore not possible to confirm accuracy, completeness and existence of the cash and cash equivalent balances at the close of the year,” Ouko said. In Loima constituency, Ouko questioned Sh75,480,504 being variance of the statement of receipts and payments to the National Government Constituencies Development Fund Board.

It’s not clear and the management has not provided evidence on how cash at hand balance was expended or accounted for.” The constituency represented by Jeremiah Lomoruka presented to auditors domestic and subsistence vouchers totalling Sh578,500 despite the same reflecting no shilling was spent in the financial statements. The CDF team also did not provide documentation for the Sh 5,115,473 allegedly used for buying goods and services, Sh 1,466,807 committee expenses and Sh 2,151,000 committee allowances. Ouko also red flagged the Sh20 million the constituency set aside for the bursaries – both secondary schools and tertiary institutions – of which the CDF team could not provide the auditors with the list of the beneficiaries and acknowledgement letters by schools and tertiary institutions. The report also revealed Nadapal Girls Secondary School was abandoned allegedly due to lack of students despite CDF injecting Sh5,200,000 for the construction of two classrooms, dormitory, two-door pit latrine and two bathrooms. Turkana South constituency, represented by James Lomenen, could not explain Sh29 million used to purchase three school buses. Ouko team discovered there was no logbook for the vehicles.
