The Kenya Urban Roads Authority has rejected claims that it owes Kenyatta National Hospital Sh1.9 billion in compensation. Kura was responding to an article published on Monday in a local daily claiming the authority was ‘sitting on’ Sh1.9 billion KNH compensation for land acquired. It was attributed to the Auditor General’s report ending June 2017 on the financial statement of the hospital. “ I wish to clarify that Kura is utilising seven acres of KNH land to construct a link road between Kenyatta National Hospital and Mbagathi Way and works are ongoing,” Kura’s director general Silas Kinoti said in a statement on Monday . He said the National Lands Commission advised that KNH is a government institution and a beneficiary of the road. Therefore as a result, the hospital is not eligible for compensation under the Lands Act 2012, Section 148 (2), particularly with regards to compensation for public land held by a public institution. Kura said there was a mutual agreement that in return the authority was to help Kenyatta Hospital fence its perimeter wall to improve security. Kura was also to upgrade 5km roads inside the hospital property as a gesture of goodwill and corporate social responsibility. Kura compulsorily acquired seven acres of KNH land for construction of Hospital Road and Mbagathi Way Link Road in Nairobi’s Upper Hill area, where it has been doing road expansion . KNH had factored the funds into its financial statements.
