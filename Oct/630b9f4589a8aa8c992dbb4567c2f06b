Garissa Muslim clerics have been asked to use their religious services to persuade the faithful to present children for polio vaccination. The second round of vaccination running for five days starts this weekend. Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki last month led IGAD member states in launching a five-day anti-polio regional exercise for the Horn of Africa. Garissa woman representative Anab Gure  said everyone has a responsibility in eradicating polio in the society. Statistics of past vaccination show the number of children in rural areas vaccinated is lower than in urban areas. “Polio is preventable and we cannot afford to lose this opportunity,” Gure said in Garissa town  yesterday. Religious leaders are most trusted in society and should play a leading role in the polio campaign, she said. Gure said the public should be told the importance of immunization a, noting that there has been a lot of misinformation that needs to be corrected. Gure said the county government vaccinated 228,009 children and that their target is to cover all children under five years. “We want to achieve 100 per cent coverage but the only way is through a concerted effort by all stakeholders so as to ensure every child in the county is immunised,” she said. Last month,the legislator dismissed romours that the polio vaccine is unsafe to children and is part of a family planning campaign driven by the West. She said there was a need for the relevant stakeholders to sustain the campaign.
