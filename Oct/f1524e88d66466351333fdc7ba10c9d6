Betting firm Sport Pesa yesterday denied reports that it plans to sell shares to the public and trade at the Nairobi Securities exchange in the first quarter of next year. This followed reports by international news agency Bloomberg that the firm has plans to list in the bourse sparking off speculation and enquiries “SportPesa is a privately-owned company and is constantly exploring opportunities that will create value for our stakeholders...as and when appropriate,we will communicate with each of our stakeholders,” a statement from the company said. In November 2016, SportPesa CEO Ronald Karauri hinted at plans to offload stock at the exchange in two years, a period set to lapse next month. If successful, SportPesa would be the first betting firm in Africa to list in a securities exchange. This may see it rank among 10 largest companies on the bourse. The listing would also be the first since August 2016, when clothing retailer Deacons East Africa began trading ending a two year drought at the bourse. While there is no clear data on the number of betting companies listed globally, top markets like the London Stock Exchange and NASDAQ in the US have listed some. LSE for instance has listed betting firms like 888, Playtech, Rank, Paddy Power, Betfair and William Hill. SportPesa is owned by five Kenyans, three Bulgarians and an American national. Among the top five shareholders is Kenyan Asenath Wachira Maina with a 21 per cent stake and Paul Ndung’u Wanderi who has a 17 per cent stake in the company. Karauri is the third highest Kenyan with a six per cent stake in the firm. Other Kenyans are Robert Wanyoike and Francis Kiarie with three and one per cent share respectively. American shareholder Gene Grand and Bulgarian Guerassim Nikolov top the shareholding structure with 21 per cent stake each. Other foreigners are Valentina Nikolaeva Mineva and Ivan Kalpakchiev who have three and two per cent respectively.
