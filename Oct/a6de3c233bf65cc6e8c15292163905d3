A row is brewing in Uasin Gishu following the county governmentâ€™s auctioning of movable assets valued at more than Sh200 million. MCAs have protested over the way the assets were auctioned on August 8. They said due procedure on disposal of public assets was not followed. The county sold vehicles, plant machinery, equipment, motorcycles, tyres, batteries, scrap metal and furniture. MCAs Gilbert Tenai of Cheptiret /Kipchamo and Sarah Malel of Kimumu have demanded answers on how the public auction of movable assets was carried out. They said the auction was not transparent and the public has demanded proper investigations into the auction. Speaker David Kiplagat ruled that a comprehensive report be tabled within 14 days.
