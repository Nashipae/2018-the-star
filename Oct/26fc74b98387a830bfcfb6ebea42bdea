Deputy President William Ruto has asked Kenyans to oppose the referendum if it is meant to create more positions. “The process should not be about creating more seats. It should be informed by the public interest. That is why we want those agitating for these changes to sit down and harmonise what should or should not be included in the constitution,” said Ruto. He spoke at St Nicholas AIPCA in Central Imenti Constituency on Sunday. Ruto said the ongoing discussions on the referendum would not distract the government from pushing forward its development agenda. “We are intensifying power connectivity in Meru region. Since 2013, more than 95,000 households have benefited from the Last Mile project. We expect another 30,000 to be connected soon,” he said. Speaking at the same event, a group of Mt Kenya leaders warned that the proposed review of the constitution needs to be approached with caution. They said there is a risk of the referendum to divide the country unless a solid plan is laid to guide the process. Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi said any changes in the constitution should be informed by Kenyans and their needs. “Referendum is a dangerous thing. It divides communities. The skirmishes we had in 2007/2008 were the ripples of the 2005 referendum,” said Kiraitu. He observed that with his wealth of experience in constitutional making, huge resources might be consumed without the changes in law having a positive impact on the lives of many Kenyans. The Deputy President was accompanied by MPs Moses Kirima (Central Imenti), Rahim Dawood (North Imenti), Mpuri Aburi (East African Legislative Assembly), Rindikiri Murwethania (Buuri) and Halima Mucheke (Nominated).
