The national union of teachers has called for a fair grading of KCSE exam candidates when tallying results. Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion yesterday said the grading should ensure at least 140,000 qualify for the slots in public universities. He urged examiners and team leaders to exercise moderation to ensure grades are correctly assigned to raw marks. Last year, only 70,073 candidates of the 615,773 got the minimum university entry grade of C+. Sossion attributed the results to unfair grading which he termed a “blunder of monumental proportion.” “This time round, the examination body must ensure fair grading to guarantee candidates achieve their lifetime ambitions and dreams of proceeding for higher learning,” Sossion said. There were only 142 straight As in last year’s exams, a negligible improvement over 141 that scored As in 2016. “It is shameful that only 70,000 candidates can qualify for university education,” Sossion said. Sossion urged the examinations council, Knec, to put in place stringent measures to guard against cheating. “We hope those who will be involved in marking will do a professional job,” Sossion said.
