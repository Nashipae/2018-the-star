Former Kakamega District Commissioner Paul Yatich has said he never divorced his wife Loise, whose burial was stopped after her relarives obtained a court injuction. Loise Yatich was separated from her husband for about 10 years. She was found murdered in her house in Eldoret on October 16 and was to be buried at Yatich’s home in Talai village, Baringo Central subcounty. “We were legally married and we have seven kids. I want to assure my in-laws I am not bitter in any way. I only pray that the court case shall soon conclude so we may come together as families to give madam good send-off,” Yatich said yesterday. Her family has so far refused to comment on the burial.
