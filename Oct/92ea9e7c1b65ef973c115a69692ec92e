A ray of hope lit across Eselenkei Group Ranch in Kajiado County on Saturday after American-based Big Life Foundation pledged to compensate livestock killed by predators. Big Life Foundation founder and CEO Richard Bonham said he has set aside $250,000 (Sh25 million) per annum for compensation of killed livestock by animals in Amboseli ecosystem. The foundation’s announcement comes in the wake of endless squabbles between the Kenya Wildlife Services and residents over unpaid/delayed consolation dues. Some of the claims have taken more than five years before they are settled. The Big Five Foundation says it is financially independent and, therefore, will work closely with KWS in the compensation process. Cases of rising human-wildlife conflicts around Eselenkei Group Ranch and the delay by government to pay consolation money to the affected residents caused Governor Joseph Lenku early in the year to threaten to unleash morans on marauding elephants that stray in to their farms. The CEO also said his foundation has an annual budget of U$200,000 (Sh20 million) for scholarship of local students. Bonham spoke in Eselenkei after signing a pact with the group ranch and residents living on the edges of Amboseli National Park, an area that has experienced fierce human/wildlife conflicts over many years. He said the areas covered by the set amount of money for compensation include Imbirrikani, Kimana and Rombo as well. The CEO they aim at using community based ideas to conserve and protect Africa’s wildlife and wild lands. “Our main objective is to ensure direct benefits to the people living with wildlife through employment and compensation,” Bonham said.
