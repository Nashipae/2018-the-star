Limuru MP Peter Mwathi has asked parents to pray and encourage their children to work hard. “A lot of values are instilled by a parent. They are shaped by teachers at school. It is therefore important for parents to make friendship with their children, since the parents will motivate their children concentrate to teachers, the way they do to them,” he said. Mwathi said children’s dreams fade away for lack of motivation to achieve them. He spoke at Thigio primary school on Tuesday, during prayers for KCPE candidates. An educationist, Rahab Njeri, said parents, pupils, teacher’s as well as guardians also need motivation. “These are the players,” she said.
