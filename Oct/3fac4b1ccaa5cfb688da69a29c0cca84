Raila Odinga’s son Raila Junior, an award-winning producer and filmmaker, would want Idris Elba to play his dad if he were to shoot the political enigma’s biopic. Idris Elba is British actor, producer, musician and DJ known for playing drug trafficker Stringer Bell on the HBO series The Wire. He is also the lead actor in Luther in which he plays a brilliant but emotionally impulsive detective who is tormented by the dark side of humanity while hunting down murderers. Once the self-destructive detective knows the killer’s identity, it becomes a psychological duel between predator and prey. “I love Idris Elba; he is my leading man,” Junior told Word is Junior has been campaigning for the legalisation of marijuana for medicinal purposes. He says it’s one of those taboo subjects in society. “If you look around the world, [some states in] America [as well as] South Africa have legalised recreational marijuana, and they are now [looking into] marijuana farming. Cannabis sativa, which is an Indian variety of cannabis, can be used as a cash crop to earn foreign exchange, which [boosts] the economy,” he said. “We know very well that if marijuana is abused, it can cause drug psychosis. But we are addressing [the issue of] control [by having it] prescribed for medicinal use under supervision of a health profession, because even painkillers such as Panadol, when used wrongly, can kill.” Marijuana is said to ease the effects of chemotherapy on cancer patients. Juja MP Francis Waititu last week said 63 legislators are suffering from cancer. “Another taboo subject in this country is the health of our leaders because a lot of times you don’t hear the leaders saying they are suffering from this disease,” Junior said. Some of the few leaders who have publicly spoken about their battle with cancer include Kisumu governor Anyang’ Nyong’o and former nominated senator Beth Mugo.
