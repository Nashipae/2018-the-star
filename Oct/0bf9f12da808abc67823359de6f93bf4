Kisumu city has allocated Sh1 billion for construction of three modern markets. Jubilee, Kibuye and Otonglo markets are expected to end the hawkers problem in the city. Acting city manager Doris Ombara said the three markets will be expanded to accommodate more traders. Ombara said the markets will have modern toilets, electricity and new stalls under the Sh4.5 billion Kisumu Urban Project funded by the French government. Sh800 million will be used in putting up a four-storey in Jubilee market to serve traders who currently operate on the major streets. The city manager said the construction works will start soon after the completion of the tendering process. She spoke during a tour of the KUP projects by Treasury and donor officials on Friday. “The construction will open roads and improve the drainage system to make it more efficient for users. It will also ease traffic in the city,” Ombara said. Kibuye and Jubilee markets will accommodate more than 1,000 and 700 traders respectively upon completion. Ombara said expansion of Kibuye market will cost Sh150 million. The construction works will include water, lighting, drainage, ablution and access roads. Re-designing the markets will end fire outbreaks attributed to electric faults due to poor or illegal connections. A total of Sh90 million will be spent on Otonglo market located in the outskirts of Kisumu to accommodate traders who have for a long time operated under difficult situations. The county government of Kisumu will also put up a fire station at the market to mitigate cases of frequent fires. More than 10,000 hawkers operate within undesignated streets, causing disorder in the city. Traders complain about unfair competition.
