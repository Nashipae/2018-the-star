Three people have died in a road accident at Kamatira black spot along the Kitale-Lodwar highway. The accident occurred when a lorry that was coming from Kitale heading to Totunyang in Turkana collided with another from Lodwar town. The lorry from Kitale had three passengers and the one from Lodwar had two. It took Kenya Red Cross officials and police more than five hours to remove the bodies from the wreckage. West Pokot Sub County Commander Antony Wanjuu said the two survivors were rushed to hospital with injuries. “They were rushed to Kapenguria County hospital for treatment and one has been discharged,” he said. Wanjuu said the area is a black spot and asked the government to put up road signs to warn motorists. “We want every corner to be marked to help new drivers in the area,” he said. Area chief Stephen Lokato said many accidents have occurred in the area since the road was constructed. “We are asking the government to redesign this road and save lives of Kenyans who use this road daily,” he said. The bodies were taken to Kapenguria County Hospital Mortuary. Click here for the latest political news
