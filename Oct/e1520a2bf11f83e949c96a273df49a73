Jubilee leaders in Bungoma have dismissed Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula as an undecided politician. “He should either chose to vie for the presidency or leave it to somebody else. He has been giving false hopes to other leaders and his supporters since 2007. His name has never been on the presidential ballot paper," Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa said. "We want to support selfless leaders and not political brokers." Barasa told the Bungoma senator to take a major and bold decision that will resuscitate him politically. "Wetang’ula always claims he is the only chosen leader in Luhya land who can finish the work of Bukusu legends, the late Masinde Muliro and the former Vice President Michael Kijana Wamalwa. But his casual approach is disturbing," the MP said. Barasa, Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka and Jubilee youth coordinator Evans criticised Wetang'ula on Friday. They spoke at Makutano village in Kanduyi constituency during the burial of Mama Catherine Naliaka. She was a diehard Jubilee supporter. Naliaka died at Bungoma County Referral Hospital after a short illness. Lusaka said: “We need serious leaders who announce the candidature for the top seat and mean it. We don’t need people who are out to auction us. Let them mean what they say and say what they mean. Luhyas should not be made into a laughing stock." Kakai, a former Kenya Revenue Authority director, told Wetang'ula to be serious about his oversight role on the Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati. "He seems to be taking it easy with Wangamati yet he was tough with Lusaka when he was governor," he said. Kakai said Wangamati has not completed any project, yet Wetang’ ula is silent. Wetang'ula is on record for having said he will not support Deputy President William Ruto, but will be on the ballot in the 2022 election. However, his recent close relations has set tongues wagging.
