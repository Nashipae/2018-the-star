Just
imagine if we understood lion talk! Cleo the little lion cub lay on her back
with her mother in the long, soft green grass, under the tall leafy trees, near
the main gate. As Cleo lay there for some time, a low grumbling noise could be
heard occasionally. “Mama! What is that noise we keep hearing?” Mama
replied in a knowing tone. “Well, my cub, we know them as ‘grumble-shines’. They
shine and have strange rolling legs and seem to be in a mood as they growl
whereever they go. They also do not smell good and are filled with humans.” Cleo
thought for a while and then said, “But Mama, why do so many ‘grumble-shines’
go past us all the time?” Mama
replied, “Well, my cub, there are many theories. The baboons seem to know the
main reason after listening carefully to the humans talking, as I listen to the
baboon jabber-jabber-jabber every day, and my understanding is that the many
humans go through the gate in their “grumble-shines’ to ‘look for lions!’ “They
are known to rumble around for hours in the heat and dust, just to try and find
one of us. Then when they see us, the humans behave very strangely. They point
funny things at us that click and sometimes flash brightly, and some of them
even climb on top of their ‘grumble-shines’.” “Wow,
Mama! That is really crazy!” said little Cleo. “We relax here all day in the
cool shade, while they get so hot in their ‘Grumble-shines’.” Seeing
lion cubs is always a cute moment. However, in reality, very few of them survive
the struggle to grow up to adults.
