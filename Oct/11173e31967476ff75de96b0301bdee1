ERC Director General Pavel Oimeke has warned cartels and operators involved in the illegal transportation of petroleum products. "No cartel is bigger than the government," the Energy Regulatory Commission told journalists on Monday. Oimeke spoke at Industrial Area after three trucks were found ferrying illegal fuel. Four suspects were arrested. "We found about 1,000 litres of petroleum products. It is not clear if it is diesel. We will find out after investigations," Oimeke said. He said the crackdown will continue until all illegal dealers are arrested. Oimeke said better policies are formed to regulate the sector.

We have revoked the licences of some trucks," the ERC boss said. Oimeke said the new regulations will take effect once Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter. He said the commission will have access to tracking data of trucks. "We will be able to monitor the movement of petroleum products. If they there is a diversion we will come and verify the destination of the truck," Oimeke said. He denied claims that ERC officers are working in cohorts with rogue vendors. "There is no collaboration between our staff and the operators. We only have legitimate businesses," he said. Oimeke said his team will continue collaborating with the multi-agency team on counterfeit products and DCI detectives to apprehend culprits. He said truck drivers are the main culprits.
