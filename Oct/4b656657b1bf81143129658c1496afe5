Seven nominees to the Laikipia County Public Service Board were on Thursday vetted by the assembly despite objection from three former board members. Two members of the former board told the assembly they were not given dismissal letters and did not receive salaries for three months. Mohammed Guracha and Petro Santa told the Labour, Social Welfare and Community Service committee they have no personal objections to the nominees. They, however, insisted they are still members of the board since they did not receive any communication indicating they had been sacked. Last week, three board members objected to the vetting of new members. Governor Ndiritu Muriithi forwarded seven names of County Public Service Board nominees to the assembly for vetting. In a sworn affidavit sent to the speaker, leader of majority and the Labour committee, the three claim their term is yet to expire. Geoffrey Maina, Guracha and Santa said they were appointed to the board through a competitive process on July 31, 2013, and their contract will expire on July 30 next year. One member resigned last year while the chairperson and her deputy resigned this year, leaving four members in office. They argued they were serving their final year to qualify for gratuity as per the terms of their contract, which requires them to serve six years. The assembly dismissed the former board members in July this year on account of incompetence and disregard for the rule of law in the way they conduct business. The governor has been at loggerheads with the former board since February this year, urging the members of the assembly to disband and dismiss it. Margaret Mumbi from Ngobit ward was nominated as the board chairperson while Timothy Wamiti from Marmanet was nominated secretary. Other board members are Patricia Wangui (Nanyuki), Moses Wanyoike (Igwamiti), John Ekale (Sossian), Benson Sururu (Mukogodo East) and Christine Kibet from Umande ward.
