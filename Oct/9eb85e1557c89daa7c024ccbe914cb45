The Cabinet meeting was chaired by President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House, Nairobi, and was attended by Cabinet Secretaries as well as Deputy President William Ruto. Once established, EARRAF will provide a platform for the harmonization of road infrastructure in East Africa especially transnational roads in terms of design, standards, and costing.
