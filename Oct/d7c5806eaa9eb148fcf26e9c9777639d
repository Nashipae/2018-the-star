Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja has opposed plans by NEMA and WARMA to demolish Seefar apartments in Nyayo Highrise for allegedly being on a riparian reserve. He said the interests of the people are being overlooked in the name of saving the environment. "It is unfair for the government to approve a building and to come later and demolish the same," Sakaja said on Thursday during a tour of the earmarked building. He was accompanied by several MPs, NEMA and WARMA officials. "It is very hypocritical to push for affordable housing yet the same government is leading a demolition of more than 4,000 units," he said. Sakaja said in as much as the government wants to conserve the environment, the Nairobi regeneration team should come up with better ways that will not hurt property owners. His sentiments were echoed by Kisumu woman representative Rosa Buyu. "We should look for other measures and demolition should be allowed only when it is necessary. Kenyans should not lose their lifetime savings," Buyu said. On Wednesday, Nairobi MCAs expressed outrage at the plans to demolish the apartment.

The county should tell if they approved a building on a dam reserve,” Oyugi said. Oyugi said more than 250 homeowners risk losing their life savings if the authorities demolish the houses without compensation.
