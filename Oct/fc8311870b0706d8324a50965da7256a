Champions KCB romped into the final of the Impala Floodlit final with a 34-10 demolition of Homeboyz on Saturday night at the Impala Club The bankers will face Impala for the third year in a row after the hosts edged Strathmore Leos 20-18 in a nail biting contest. The holders were cagey in the first half, relying on the boot of Kenya Simbas fullback Darwin Mukizda, who slotted home two penalties to give them a 6-0 lead at the interval. On resumption, the bankers exploded into action with Martin Owilah scoring in the 41st minute after sustained play by the KCB forwards. Shaban Ahmed slotted home the conversion for a 13-0 lead. Homeboyz regrouped and dominated possession and territory and were rewarded briefly when Steve Otieno scored an unconverted try to take a 13-5 lead. From the restart, KCB went through the phases and Shaban Ahmed ghosted in between two defenders to score at the centre and converted for a 20-5 lead. The champions intensified the pressure and Stafford Abeka crossed the line for an unconverted try and a 27-5 lead midway through the half. Otieno scored his second try for the Deejays but Peter Kilonzo had the final say of the match when he dotted down at the buzzer with Isaac Njoroge kicking over the conversion. Impala had to survive a late Strathmore onslaught to book their spot in the final. Impala led 15-3 at the interval courtesy of tries by Billy Omondi and Paul Mutsami with Sammy Oliech adding a conversion and penalty. The students replied through Gabriel Makumi via penalty. They looked dead and buried in the early minutes of the second half when Elvis Oroko burst through four tackles to land at the corner for unconverted try and a 20-6 lead. The Leos then piled on the pressure for the remaining 20 minutes of the match with Albert Obura and Alex Maina scoring a try each.
