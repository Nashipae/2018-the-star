Members of the public in Nyamira county have expressed concern over numerous foreign trips made by members of the county assembly. They want the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate the sources of funds used to finance the foreign trips. Youth leaders told the Star that there is a group of MCAs touring Singapore currently which could be followed by another one to Israel next week. This comes at a time when the county is facing a financial crisis after the executive rejected the 2018/19 budget due to alleged anomalies. Residents and youth led by Peter Magare questioned the source of funding for the trips saying they were not factored in the budget. The angry residents termed the foreign trips a waste of public resources because similar trips made in the past have not yielded much fruit in terms of development. They claimed that the same MCAs have failed in their role of over sighting the county executive by protecting those implicated in corruption.Magare who was accompanied by the youth leader from North Mugirango Dennis Marube petitioned the national government to ban such trips which he said were promoting corruption. A source at the county assembly who did not want to be named said the money the MCAs are using is not part of the 2018/19 budget. Nyamira County has been thrown into a financial crisis after the Executive declined to sign the Budget and Appropriations Bill 2018/2019. The control of more than Sh1.9 billion development vote out of the Sh6.5 billion is the bone ofÂ contention.
