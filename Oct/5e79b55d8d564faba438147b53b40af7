Three thugs armed with crude weapons were on Saturday night gunned down in a foiled robbery in Kerugoya town, Kirinyaga county. The five-man gang had tried to break into Fortune Sacco around 1 am. Police on patrol acted swiftly after an alarm was raised and gunned down the three who were armed with crowbars and homemade pistol. "We also have one suspect in custody who is helping us with the investigation while another escaped," a police officer involved in the operation said. The bodies of the three were moved to Kerugoya level four hospital mortuary. Click here for the latest political news
