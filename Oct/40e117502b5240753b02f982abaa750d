Former Nairobi governor Evans Kidero's corruption trial will begin on May 29, 2019. He was charged at the Milimani law court with conspiracy to commit fraud on August 9. He denied the charges. The prosecution has lined up 27 witnesses to testify in the case which also rops in lawyer Maurice Ochieng' as a co-accused. Prosecutor Joseph Riungu on Tuesday said his team has supplied to the defence team, all the relevant statements by the witnesses and documents. The matter before chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti also has five other suspects accused of facilitating the loss of Sh213,327,300 between January 16, 2014, and January 25, 2016. They are former Nairobi officials Lilian Ndegwa (county secretary), Jimmy Kiamba (Finance chief officer), Stephen Osiro (head of county Treasury), Luke Gatimu (acting Finance chief officer) and Gregory Mwakanongo (Finance executive). On September 24, Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission officials raided Kidero's home in Muthaiga and his private office in Westlands. The detectives conducted a search for documents believed to be linked to a criminal case the former gover is facing. Kidero termed the raid as pure harassment, saying the officers were trying to implicate him for a crime he did not commit. He has filed a case seeking to bar the commision from searching and seizing his property. "There was no search warrant that was obtained against any of my properties. So, by searching and seizing my properties without a warrant, the commission acted illegitimately."
