Criminal gangs have started re-emerging in Central region. They extort money from bus operators and workers at construction sites. The gangs include members of the outlawed Mungiki sect and the Gaza group based in Nairobi. Central regional commissioner Wilson Njenga said police have launched a crackdown. He warned the gangs, saying the government will not allow them to regroup. Njenga said 11 members of the Mungiki sect have been arrested in Nyandarua county, 80 in Kiambu while on Monday 45 were arrested in Nyeri county. “We have started the operation across the region because we cannot allow people to extort money from business people without working. That practice which they had in the past cannot be allowed to recur,” he said.
