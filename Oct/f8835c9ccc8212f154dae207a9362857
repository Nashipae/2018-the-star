Busia MCAs have agreed to have all pending and stalled projects completed this financial year. Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi on Saturday said, “We held talks with the MCAs who agreed to Governor Sospeter Ojaamong’s commitment to have all stalled and pending projects dating back to 2014, be completed and all debts cleared before the execution of new ones.” Ojaamong on October 4, said pending bills are a result of unpaid ward development projects. He said his administration would not sanction new projects until the stalled ones were completed and pending bills cleared. The governor said it was a waste of public resources to allocate money to fresh projects when there are numerous incomplete ones. “Let’s do away with stalled projects for the benefit of the public,” Ojaamong said.
