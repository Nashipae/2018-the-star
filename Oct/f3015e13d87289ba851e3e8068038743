Homa Bay MCAs have been summoned to a meeting to end wrangles in the county assembly. The meeting will be chaired by Suba North MP Millie Odhiambo and attended by all MPs from the county. On Friday, ODM leader Raila Odinga directed Millie to lead the meeting. The MCAs have been fighting for the last three months. Two weeks ago, speaker Elizabeth Ayoo suspended the assembly indefinitely after wrangles factions engaged in fistfights. It was thought that a power sharing deal between Kanyidoto MCA Walter Muok and Kwabwai's Richard Ogindo would end the wrangles. The two were leading the faction which were fighting for leadership positions. ODM treasurer Timothy Bosire brokered a deal that saw Ogindo relinquish his Majority leader position to Muok. Ogindo became the Majority whip in the new arrangement. But there have been wrangles even after the deal was struck. “MCAs cannot continue fighting over minor issues and ignore the bigger mandate of development. I want the Homa Bay issue resolved quickly by Millie,” Raila said. He was speaking at the funeral of former South Nyanza county council chairman Akech Chieng in Homa Bay. Raila said physical fights among MCAs as have been witnessed in Kisumu, Homa Bay, Murang'a, Nyeri and Kakamega were an embarrassment.
