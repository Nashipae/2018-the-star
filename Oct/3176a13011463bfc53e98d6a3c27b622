IG Joseph Boinnet yesterday said the police were not to blame for the Fort Ternan bus accident that left 55 people dead. He said they will soon roll out stringent measures to punish drivers, vehicle owners and insurance firms found flouting traffic rules. “We’re working well with the NTSA to come up with stringent measures, which put greater responsibility on drivers, vehicle owners and insurance firms,” Boinnet told the National Assembly Transport committee. The lawmakers demanded that he resigns for sleeping on the job. They heard that the police did not inspect the Kakamega-bound bus, despite the long distance it had to cover. Boinnet admitted it reached Fort Ternan without being flagged for a routine check. “It’s shocking the IG could tell Kenyans that they are doing a good job. We can’t lose 55 lives then you tell us you are doing your best. You should take responsibility,” Kajiado North MP Peris Tobiko said. Nyatike MP Tom Odege questioned why the police chief is yet to take action against officers who were on duty but failed to impound the vehicle. Boinnet said culprits will be held to account.
