Nyeri county dairy farmers earned Sh3.4 billion from milk in 2017-18 financial year while meat production raked in Sh1.3 billion. A total of 112.9 million kilos of milk were produced, out of which 67.2 were sold formally while 41.6 million were sold informally. The milk was sold at between Sh32 to Sh38 per kilo. This was a decline compared from last year ( 2016-17 ) where slightly more than 144 million kilos of milk worth Sh4.3 billion were produced. This is according to the annual report released by the department of Agriculture Livestock and Fisheries. Meat production raked in Sh1.3 billion with an average price of beef being Sh350, mutton Sh380, pork Sh300 and poultry Sh400 a kilo. Farmers sold a total of 2.6 million kilos of beef worth Sh876.6 million, 519, 819 kilos of mutton worth Sh187.2 million, 253.005 kilos of goat meat worth Sh90 million, 202,255 kilos of pork worth Sh62 million and 301, 571 kilos of poultry meat worth Sh118 million. The report noted there was reduced production and a minimal increase in livestock population across all enterprises due to the harsh weather experienced last year. “This resulted in poor to average body condition of most animals translating into reduced birth rates. However, the situation has changed positively and the impacts are expected to be seen in the 2018/2019 financial year if production parameters remain favorable,” stated the report. The year was characterised by two extreme weather seasons that impacted both positively and negatively on the livestock sector. The first half had a dry weather, which was not favourable for livestock keepers particularly for those in the arid and semi arid land. “The dry spell threatened the livestock enterprises due to acute shortage of feeds and pastures especially during the first quarter. This in turn translated to poor economic status especially among households that purely depend on livestock as a livelihood,” stated the report. Availability of fodder in the county ranged from poor to fair, while in some areas the situation was extremely dire.
