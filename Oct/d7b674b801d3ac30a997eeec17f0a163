The government will partner with counties to modernise markets and make them habitable, Deputy President William Ruto has said. He said modern structures will be erected in major markets across the country. The DP said the ambitious plan seeks to attract more youths into entrepreneurship, thereby reducing dependence on formal employment. “That is why we have come up with a solid roadmap that would make them flourish,” he said. The Deputy President spoke on Sunday at the PCEA Ruiru Town Church in Kiambu. Ruto was accompanied by area Governor Ferdinand Waititu, Deputy Governor James Nyoro, MPs Moses Kuria (Gatundu South), Jeremiah Kioni (Ndaragwa), Kimani Ichungwa (Kikuyu), Patrick Wainaina (Thika) and Simon King'ara (Ruiru). Others were Joshua Kandie (Baringo Central), Halima Mucheke (Nominated), Jane Njiru (Woman Rep, Embu County) and Isaac Mwaura (Nominated Senator). Waititu said the modernisation of the Githurai market would attract more players and therefore deepen competition. Meanwhile, Ruto has said Sh100 million has been allocated for the construction of the Ruiru Technical Training Institute to help build capacity for the youths. He noted that the goal of the government is to have at least one technical college in every constituency. Click here for the latest political news
