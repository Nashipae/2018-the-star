Nyeri government plans to use some of the proceeds from the Dr Wahome Gakuru memorial half-marathon to build a ward at the Nyeri County Referral Hospital. Governor Mutahi Kahiga yesterday said the ward will be named after the late governor (pictured). Other funds will go towards the price money and other logistical preparations. The event is being held in memory of the late Wahome Gakuru, the second governor of Nyeri, who died in a grisly road accident along Kenol -Nairobi road on November 13 last year. The athletics event will be held on November 11. “We want to sensitise all the people of Nyeri that this event is important in our calendar. We expect it is going to be an annual event and we pray that in the next two to three years, it will have hit the international standards,” he said. He expressed optimism the vent will attract even international stars. It costs Sh1000 to register for the 21-kilometer race.
