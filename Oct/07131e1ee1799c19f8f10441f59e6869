The IEBC cannot account for the Sh66 million court awards it won in poll petitions, Auditor General Edward Ouko has said. The electoral body received Sh66,300,000 in petitions between 2015 and 2016, but did not disclose to the auditors as is required. The petitions arose from the 2013 General Election. “No evidence has been provided for audit to show that dues have been collected from the respective legal firms,” said Ouko in his 2015-16 report. “Further, the dues have not been disclosed as receivable in the financial statements.” In 2013, a total 188 petitions were lodged in various courts across the country with 24 allowed and 115 dismissed by the courts. Of the 2013 poll petitions, 17 were withdrawn while another 31 cases were struck out on technicalities.

NASA leader Raila Odinga had petitioned Uhuru’s victory claiming the electoral body did not follow the law. According to Ouko’s 2013 report, the commission then led by Issack Hassan paid 68 lawyers Sh2.14 billion as legal fees for the 2013 election petitions both presidential and other elective seats. This was in excess of Sh1 billion IEBC owed to them. Ouko’s revelations come at a time the poll body is grappling with the mass exit of four out of seven commissioners rendering the commission technically paralysed. Commissioners Consolata Nkatha, Margaret Mwachanya and Paul Kurgat resigned in April citing irreconcilable differences with chairman Wafula Chebukati. Commissioner Roselyne Akombe resigned days to the October 26, 2017 repeat presidential poll and fled to the US, saying her life was in danger. Click here for the latest political news
