Kisii traders have been urged to verify the authenticity of their goods before selling them to the public. County commissioner Godffrey Kigochi said the sale of counterfeit and contraband goods was on the rise. He cited entertainment joints which he said were selling counterfeit products. He said police will conduct a crackdown and arrest culprits. "Those arrested will be prosecuted," Kigochi said. He was speaking at the Kisii Cultural Hall during a meeting with the business community. Trade executive Edna Kangwana, KRA official Peter Omondi, Kenya Bureau of Standards officer Wilfred Bosire, Kenya Chamber of Commerce and Industry representative Benjamin Onkoba and county director of public health Melitus Kabar attended.
