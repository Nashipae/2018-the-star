Kisumu governor Anyang’ Nyong’o yesterday lost a family estate battle after a court ordered that his nephews and nieces be included as beneficiaries of his father’s Sh200 million estate. Nyong’o had wanted them excluded. A Kisumu court revoked the letters of administration and certificate of confirmation of the grant of the estate and instead appointed Kenneth Odhiambo Okuthe as a co- administrator of the estate, jointly with Nyong’o and his sister Risper Nyagoy. The governor’s father Hesbon Shimei died on November 10, 2006, without a will. The governor’s two nephews, Okuthe and Geoffrey Omondi, sued him and his sister Risper for leaving out some relatives in the list of beneficiaries of the estate. They said the governor and his sister were made the administrators of the estate after the local chief certified the two and their mother as the true beneficiaries. They accused the two of neglecting the children of Margaret Awuor and Judith Nyong’o, who were daughters of Shimei. Omondi is the eldest son of Judith, now deceased. Upon her death, she left Omondi and another sibling, Fiona Atieno. The applicants are accusing Nyong’o and Nyagoy of concealing important information on confirmation of the grant and not accounting for the estate. However, yesterday justice Tripsisa Cherere said she was satisfied that the applicants were beneficiaries and are entitled to the estate of the deceased. Cherere noted the children of Margaret Awuor and Judith Nyong’o are entitled to inherit their grandfather’s estate as the deceased mothers were daughters of Shimei. Whether the applicant made a case on the revocation of the certificate of grant, the judge said there was overwhelming evidence to revoke the certificate of confirmation of the grant.
