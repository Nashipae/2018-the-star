We first came across Newton Kamau, better known by his stage name Bruz Newton, when he was just a dancer. His journey started in a dance group called The Band that had mastered the art of “Define Movement”, a style of dance that involved moving to the lyricism. Now his contribution to the industry is no longer limited to choreography: he can make music as well as he can move. One big theme of Bruz’s awesomeness is his ability to make a track that comes with a new dance move. As he delivers, it almost appears effortless, but maybe it’s a thing of several attempts before he can get the right move. But just like that, the dance has so far earned him a major role in an advert. His start in the music scene could be viewed as a mere fluke. He is credited with coming up with the Bazokizo dance that was popularised by Collo. The track “Bazokizo” was released several months ago, and somehow it’s managed to stay relevant on the airwaves and charts. With an aim to stay relevant, Bruz has continued to release danceable gospel tracks that draw strength from elements and experiences that define Bruz. Since he started making music, he has teamed up with other artistes, such as Ugandan star Exodus, to keep presenting himself as a force. In an endless quest meant to define urban gospel music, if ever there were ever any doubts of Bruz being one of the genre’s top contributors, then he has already dispelled them with tracks like “Zigwembe” and “Sidonyo”. He has a clearer picture of what he needs to do get his music played on high rotation. Bruz’s conceptual infrastructure is quite inspiring. More often than not his music holds up its end. It is not only memorable but also worth the listen. He has turned his personality and skill into his music that tells his own reality.
