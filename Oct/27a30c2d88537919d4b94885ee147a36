Police on Tuesday arrested three journalists for besmirching Kakamega senator Cleophas Malala. David Ndolo, Stafford Ondego, and  Alex Njue were arrested on Tuesday and taken to KICC police station. According to Malala and the police, they allegedly took the senator's image, cropped the head and placed it on a naked body. The photoshopped image was placed next to a nude woman reportedly under the instruction of a top government official. Malala said there was a demeaning photo of the said official in a lodging with a woman in a compromising position. "When the photo went viral, the official told the journalists to photoshop the image and replace his face with mine," Malala said. "I was tipped about what happened and I got police to arrest the journalists," Malala said at Bunge Media Centre on Wednesday.
