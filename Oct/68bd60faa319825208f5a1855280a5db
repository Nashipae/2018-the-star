Nairobi Stima and Ushuru head coaches have expressed confidence in seizing the chance to play Nakumatt in the promotion/relegation playoff. The two teams will be looking to grab the chance to confront Nakumatt when they play their final National Super League matches this weekend against KCB and Bidco United respectively. The duo were locked out of the automatic promotion last weekend when KCB sealed the final slot, leaving them to jostle for the playoff match which will pit either of them and Nakumatt, who finished third from bottom in the top flight. KCB beat FC Talanta 2-0 to take their tally to 75 points—two off leaders Western Stima who were the first team to gain promotion. Stima are third on the log with 68 points—a tally similar to that of Ushuru although the former have a healthier goal difference. Stima will have themselves to blame after playing Kenya Police to a one-all draw a result which saw them move to level points with Ushuru, who overpowered Nakuru All Stars 3-0. The result also saw All Stars become the first team to be relegated to Division One as they remained at the rock bottom of the standings with 21 points— four shy of second from bottom GFE 105. Ahead of the final matches, coaches from either camps have expressed their confidence in winning their respective encounters to guarantee them a date with the shoppers.
