Over 10,000 boda boda operators from Bungoma and Busia counties will receive training on HIV and Aids prevention National Aids Control Council regional coordinator Steve Kathaka on Wednesday said it would be helpful to have riders from the two counties actively involved in conversations about prevention. He said the organisation has partnered with the Boda boda Safety Association of Kenya to make rounds in the counties. “We noticed that the riders were at high risk of contracting the disease and hence the need to educate them,” Kathaka said. He said women had better access to information because “they visit health facilities more often than men”. The council will also partner with county governments.
