The Cabinet has today approved a Bill seeking to transform the National Youth Service into a corporate body. The Bill contains a raft of measures aimed at strengthening the operations and management of NYS among them the transformation of the department into a corporate body. It further seeks to align NYS to aspirations of the Government’s Big 4 Agenda as well as Kenya’s Vision 2030 development blueprint. The bill also aims at fixing the weaknesses identified in its structure which are a hindrance to the achievement of the agency’s mandate. In August this year, the Cabinet approved the restructuring of the service following a meeting chaired by president Uhuru Kenyatta. This now means the NYS will be led by a CEO as opposed to the current position of the Director-General. President Uhuru Kenyatta had said the restructuring will play a key role in curbing corruption that has engulfed the institution for years.
