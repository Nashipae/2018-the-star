Nairobi county’s annual revenue collection dropped eight per cent in the last financial year to Sh10.1 billion, putting a squeeze on its budget. Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo’s 2017-18 report, however, shows the county generated the most revenue in the country even as its expenses dropped after slashing travel expenses for MCAs and the executive. The collection was a 7.5 per cent decrease compared to Sh10.9 billion generated in 2016-17. The revenue realised was also only 58.7 per cent of the annual internal revenue target. The money was generated from land rates, advertising, parking, single business permits and building approval and other sources. Nairobi was followed by Mombasa and Nakuru at Sh3.1 billion and Sh2.2 billion respectively. Narok generated Sh2.1 billion, Kiambu Sh1.6 billion and Machakos Sh1 billion from its internal revenue sources. Lamu, Tana River and Mandera counties collected the lowest amount at Sh55.2 million, Sh55.6 million and Sh61.8 million respectively. In total, all the 47 devolved units collected Sh32.4 billion from their internal sources against the target of Sh49.2 billion during the year. According to the report, Nairobi spent Sh476.9 million on domestic travel — comprising Sh198.5 million by MCAs and Sh278.4 million by the executive during the year. The expenditure represented a 6.2 per cent reduction on travel compared to Sh639.3 million spent the year before. The report shows that the county registered a 16 per cent drop in expenditure on sitting allowances for its 128 MCAs. It spent Sh73.9 million on sitting allowances for the ward reps against the budget allocation of Sh112.4 million. This was a drop compared to Sh88 million spent in 20160-17. On average, monthly sitting allowance was Sh48,130 per MCA compared to Salary and Renumeration Commission’s monthly ceiling of Sh80,000. Odhiambo raised the red flag on the huge expenditure on personal emoluments which include salaries, allowances, local and foreign travel. All the county governments, according to the report, spent an aggregate of Sh151 billion on personal emoluments, a 15.4 per cent increase compared to 2016-17 financial year. “High expenditure on personnel emoluments is unsustainable and will crowd out spending on development activities. There is therefore, need for county governments to ensure that this expenditure is contained at sustainable levels,” Odhiambo said in the report. It was not immediately clear why revenue collection in the country’s capital went down.
