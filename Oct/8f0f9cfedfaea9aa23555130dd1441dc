The Garissa government will map out all businesses to improve planning and services. Speaking yesterday in Garissa town when he launched the mapping, Trade executive Adow Jubat said the mapping will also help improve the sewerage system and provide social amenities. Jubat said he regretted that providing amenities to the traders has been neglected for too long. “We can only address these problems by putting together all data of businesses in the county. We want businesses to operate in a clean environment with proper sewerage systems,” he added. Jubat said the mapping decision was reached after officials from his department met the business community and the Chamber of Commerce two months ago. “We shall involve all major stakeholders in our programmes to ensure enhanced team work and public participation,” he said. Jubat said the mapping data will be available at the county website and a directorate will be created to provide information to potential investors. The directive comes after the county assembly passed an investment bill to help create a better business environment. “We are requesting traders to cooperate by providing the required information to our staff,” the executive said. Trade chief officer Mahat Salah said the county government had agreed to partner with the Chamber of Commerce to ensure the programme was a success.
