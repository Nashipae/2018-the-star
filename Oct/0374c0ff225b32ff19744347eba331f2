The government has distributed 55,000 seedlings to 22 counties to promote growth and use of underutilised fruits. Director of crop systems at the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation Lusike Wasilwa said the fruit species have potential to contribute to the realisation of the Big Four agenda on food security and and nutrition. She said the fruits will become extinct if not promoted. Wasilwa said Kalro has been working with farmers to promote the growing of the fruits. “Kalro, in partnership with USAid, has distributed over 55,000 guava, gooseberry and jack fruit seedlings in a campaign to entice farmers to take up growing of underutilised fruits for commercialisation,” Wasilwa said. She was speaking at the Nairobi International Trade Fair, which ended yesterday. Of the seedlings, 20,000 are guavas with another 20,000 jackfruits. The rest are gooseberry seedlings. Wasilwa said farmers have been trained on tools, harvesting and marketing procedures. She said the campaign to eradicate negative perception about the fruits started in 2016. Owen Indiya said guava fruits are currently imported from Israel and Egypt, yet Kenyan farmers have the capacity to produce them. “The jackfruit is a rich source of vitamin A and C, readily digestible and can be used to manufacture jam and jelly. The gooseberry fruit is also rich in Vitamin C and A, manganese and dietary fiber and can not only make juice and jam for value addition, but can address problems of appetite, prevent heart diseases and also help in digestion,” Indiya said. He said other fruits such as custard apple are anti-cancer agents and its magnesium can prevent strokes and heart attack while the tamarind fruit has tartaric acid and is an important ingredient in food preparation. “We are currently promoting seven out of the 30 underutilised fruits to farmers. They will be in the market by the time the campaign is over,” Indiya said.
