Raila's swearing-in was a bad idea - Kalonzo Wiper Party Leader Kalonzo Musyoka has for the first time admitted that he was against NASA leader Raila Odinga swearing in disowning his initial stand and exposing himself as a flip flop. Appearing on Citizen TV's news-night show on Tuesday Kalonzo said he didn't believe in the January 30 oath-taking directly contradicting his earlier belief and pronouncements that the swearing was the beginning of the struggle. “We might not have the army like our counterparts in the government but the whole world will know that the people of Kenya have spoken and need their choice to be respected,” Musyoka said on January 26 at a NASA rally at Homa Bay County Stadium charging that it was no tenable to dialogue with Jubilee because time has run out. Nairobi MCAs accuse Muranga leaders of economic sabotage MCAs have condemned the plan to impose a 25 per cent tax on Ndakaini Dam water, saying it amounts to economic sabotage and incitement.

"This is pure politics and incitement. We know that all rivers belong to the government,” Water committee chairman Paul Kados said. Kados said Wairia and Senator Irungu Kang'ata are misleading Murang'a residents and inciting them for selfish political mileage. How boxing promoters kill talent in Kenya Dressed in a blue jeans trouser, black hoodie and white Nike sneakers, Fatuma ‘Iron Fist’ Zarika bounces to our meeting point, hands deep in the pocket. She is accompanied by her manager, former boxer Simon Kibe. A few days earlier, Zarika had beaten her Mexican challenger, Yamileth ‘Yelmi’ Mercado, retaining her World Boxing Council (WBC) Super Bantamweight title. Like a wounded lion, the black scars she attained from the fight are still visible, most of them around her eyes. Despite this, Zarika says that was her best fight in her 44 professional bouts, including 30 wins, 12 losses and two draws. However, it has not been a smooth ride for the 36-year-old. Zarika has lost count of the number of times she has been duped by selfish promoters. “I struggled for long. Promoters took advantage of me and they would refuse to pay me after a fight,” she says. Boxing promoting in Kenya is said to be dominated by a cartel, which is hard to penetrate. ____________________________________________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
