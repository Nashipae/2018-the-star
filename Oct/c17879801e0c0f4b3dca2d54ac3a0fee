Chebukati targets top IEBC managers in grand clean-up Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission Chairman Wafula Chebukati has embarked on a purge of top officials a week after former CEO Ezra Chiloba was sent packing. The commission has written to over 25 staff allegedly implicated in questionable expenditures amounting to Sh4.6 billion during last year’s two elections. They are required to explain their roles in the expenditures queried in a controversial internal audit ordered by Chebukati early this year. According to a separate report by Auditor General Edward Ouko, the commission cannot account for up to Sh9.2 billion for various contracts it awarded in ten months last year. _____________________________________________________ 5000 teachers to report to get new working station as TSC begins third phase of teacher transfer Some 5,000 school heads and teachers will report to new institutions in January as the Teachers Service Commission on Friday commenced third phase of transfers this year.

So vicious are the wrangles that the hypothesis of "water wars" is becoming a reality. Experts had predicted that the third world war will be over water. In Laikipia county, the fights have been over pasture and water. Longer dry seasons and uncertain rains that put pressure on pastoralists have been blamed. Tana River and adjacent counties have not been left out of the fights. Global warming, pollution by human beings and population explosion has often been associated with shortage of such resources. It, however, seems that drums of war have started in various counties. _____________________________________________________ Sonko rubbishes bill seeking to dissolve Nairobi County Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko on Friday waded into the raging debate over the proposal to dissolve his County asking Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot not to abuse constitutional provisions. Sonko said he will not take the proposal lying down. "Article 96 of the constitution empowers senators to have oversight responsibilities over all state officers but again I think the senator did not consider that they are supposed to protect the interest of devolution and interest of all the counties," Sonko said. Sonko said it is within Cheruiyot's democratic right to comment whatever he wants to comment. _____________________________________________________ Suicide spike calls for early diagnosis and care of mental health problems Contemplation over the power of a healthy mental state poured itself all over the globe in the wake of World Mental Health Day on October 10.

Moreover, Lady Gaga marked this year’s observation of the day with an opinion piece terming mental health an emergency. “By the time you finish reading this, at least six people will have killed themselves around the world,” read the article co-written with Tedros Adhanom, director-general of the World Health Organisation. The conversation around mental health care is getting amplified as stakeholders hold forums to dissect and elaborate mental health. However, the need to walk the talk is beckoning, lest we lose more lives. _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
