President Uhuru Kenyatta has warned millers that the government will take action against them if they refuse to lower the price of maize flour. Uhuru said millers should lower the prices to reflect the significant reduction in the price of maize in the country. The President said it is wrong for companies to charge Kenyans exorbitant prices which are not justified. “I want to tell millers that we will take action against them because that is exploitation,” he said. On September 19, millers said they will hike the price of Unga by Sh8 from Sh90 to Sh98 as a result of the 8 per cent VAT on petroleum products.
