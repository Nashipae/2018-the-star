Good Morning. The short rains season seems to be kicking off with a weekend forecast of cloudy and light showers in Nairobi and Central Kenya, showers in the Coastal region and thunderstorms in parts of Western Kenya. The weatherman had indicated that most parts of the country will likely experience above average rainfall from this week as the short rains season kicks off. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this weekend. WATCH Maribe to be charged with Monica Kimani’s murder Citizen TV news anchor Jacque Maribe and her fiance Joseph Irungu will both be charged with the murder of businesswoman Monica Kimani, Police have confirmed. Maribe has been implicated in the gory murder by her conduct and association with prime suspect Irungu aka “Jowie”. Her charges emanate from what Police describe as illegal handling of a firearm after a 9mm live bullet was recovered in her bedroom. The ammo was linked to a gun which belongs to her neighbor, Brian Kasaine, that Jowie allegedly used to shoot himself but later claimed he was shot at by unknown people. DCI George Kinoti told the Star on Friday that evidence gathered by the investigators so far reveals that Maribe was indirectly linked to Monica’s murder. _____________________________________________________ A day in Obado’s life at KNH It's Friday at 12:30pm and friends and relatives are ushered in to see their loved ones admitted at the Kenyatta National Hospital. Everyone is subjected to brief security checks at the entrance by guards from a private firm; a very unusual procedure at the referral hospital. It's lunch hour and the number of visitors is huge. At the elevator area, there’s shoving and pushing as each jostles for space to be the first one in. The area is, again, unusually manned by two armed administration police officers. _____________________________________________________ Uhuru dilemma over Raila Ruto feud President Uhuru Kenyatta is on the horns of a dilemma. He has the difficult, if not impossible role, of refereeing between foe-turned-friend Raila Odinga and his own two-term supporter, Deputy President William Ruto. The ODM boss and the DP who aspires to be president are going at it hammer and tongs. So far, Uhuru has stayed out of the mess and hasn't taken sides. But he repeatedly has said it's too early for 2022 campaigning, which Ruto is doing with a vengeance. The president also has been conspicuously silent of late on Ruto's aspirations and whether he still supports the 'deal' that Jubilee would reign for 20 years, with Ruto wearing the crown for the final 10. _____________________________________________________ Is it time to change the Constitution or reflect on it? The public and the media are showing much interest in the Constitution. To some extent, it may be that people’s expectations of the Constitution have not, or only partially, met. Our Constitution has often been regarded, here and abroad, as one of the most, if not the most, progressive in the world. The enthusiasm with which it was first received is fast evaporating. Raila Odinga, a major architect of the Constitution, is clearly disillusioned and wishes to install the parliamentary system, as well as deeper and more effective form of devolution — positions he took at Bomas, but seems to have abandoned after the 2007 debacle (even though the constitution then was the Moi constitution, which everyone wanted to escape from). _____________________________________________________ Life after politics: Ex-MP thrives in event management A good number of politicians find it hard to make new headways once they lose elections. And considering that elections in Kenya are an expensive affair, some end up broke, frustrated and indebted. But for former Ruiru MP Esther Gathogo, it only took two weeks to pick the pieces and move on. When she lost the Jubilee Party nominations to Simon King’ara in June 2016, her supporters advised her not to hang up her boots and instead defend the seat in the August general election as an independent candidate. The former MP talked to the Star about her moving on from politics during this interview at her Kahawa Sukari home, where she runs Jowath Event Solutions. She initially thought of starting a beauty shop. But then she remembered that back in 2007, when she entered politics as a nominated councillor and later became the deputy mayor of the then Ruiru municipality, she had ventured into the event management business. _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
