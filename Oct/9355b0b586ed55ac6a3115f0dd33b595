Mandera county has embarked on a programme to increase its forest cover to 10 per cent to minimise the effects of climate change. Governor Ali Roba said the environment department will distribute over 60,000 seedlings to households and public institutions such as schools and health centers. It will also create awareness on the importance of environmental conservation. He said his administration has engaged 270 vulnerable and needy casuals, mostly women, who will each be allocated 15 trees to water and look for a modest monthly wage. Speaking on Wednesday in Mandera town while launching the project, Roba asked residents for support. The move is inline with the Kenya government initiative to increase the country’s forest cover to 10 percent. “We have initiated a multi-sector aproach to greening Mandera county and protecting our biodiversity, as well as improving living standards,” Roba said. The programme also aims to support vulnerable persons and improve their living standards. “It’s our duty to protect and conserve the environment for the benefit of the present and future generations. I appeal to residents to plant more trees,” Roba said. The county forest cover is only three per cent, He said the county was reaching out to partners to help plant drought trees and promote agro-forestry. The county’s environment department is also exploring innovative ways of using mathenge weed to produce charcoal. Roba asked the national government to enforce the ban on use of plastic bags, saying they were increasing.
