Kenyan government has slashed revenue collection targets for financial years up to 2021/2022 but raised debt portfolio for the period, this, according to 2018 Budget Review Outlook tabled in Parliament Wednesday. Treasury has for instance cut this year’s revenue projection by Sh96 billion from Sh1.949 trillion to Sh1.853 trillion but raised public debt margin from Sh4.82 trillion to Sh5.09 trillion. The government has revised revenue target for 2019/2020 downward by Sh42 billion to Sh2.074 trillion while that of 2020/2021 has been slashed by Sh42 billion to Sh2.38 trillion. The government is expecting to raise Sh2.73 trillion in revenues in 2021/222. Public debt on the other hand is expected to grow from projected Sh5.097 trillion this year to Sh5.977 trillion by the end of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s tenor. The National Treasury has attributed the downward revision in revenue target for the year to amendments to revenue raising measures in the recently enacted Finance Act 2018 which resulted in reduction in projected revenues by Sh48.6 billion. ‘’To remedy these deviations, revenue projections for 2018/19 have been revised taking into account; revenue shortfall of Sh172.4 billion last year; a lower revenue in first two months of current year and amendments to the Finance Bill,’’ Treasury said. Kenya Revenue Authority will now have to collect Sh1.673 trillion down from a target of Sh1.768 trillion assigned during the national budget reading for 2018/19 in June. On Wednesday the International Monetary Fund downgraded Kenya’s debt default rate from low to moderate risk, citing the country’s high debt levels amid low domestic revenue collection. “The higher level of debt, together with rising reliance on non-concessional borrowing, have raised fiscal vulnerabilities and increased interest payments on public debt to nearly one fifth of revenue, placing Kenya in the top quartile among its peers,” IMF said. The government is expected to spend Sh870 billion to repay debts this financial year, which translates to 52 per cent of the revised revenue target for KRA. Kenya has however defended its debt management strategy, saying projected debt to GDP of 51 per cent is below the internationally accepted threshold of 74 per cent. ‘’This debt performance is attributed to the high level of concessionallity of current external debt and positive outlook in microeconomics indicators,’’ Treasury CS Henry Rotich said. Expected low revenue collection has seen Treasury cut on government expenditure by Sh83 billion from an earlier estimate of Sh2.557 trillion, heavily eating into county transfers and development budget. According to the report, equitable share for county governments has been slashed from Sh314 billion to Sh305 billion. Treasury also chopped equalization fund meant for hardship counties from Sh9 billion to Sh5 billion. Even so, the amount allocated to counties translates to 16 per cent of total national budget, within the constitutional threshold of at least 15 per cent. The cut has also affected development budget whose portion was cut by Sh52 billion to Sh623 billion, defying the Public Finance Management Act, 2012 that requires a minimum 30 per cent of the national budget be allocated to development. Development expenditure for this year has been quoted at 29 per cent of national budget, 100 basis points below the threshold but an improvement compared to 25.6 per cent last financial year. Kenya’s nominal Gross Domestic Product for 2018/19 has been reviewed upwards to Sh9.90 trillion from Sh9.72 trillion.
