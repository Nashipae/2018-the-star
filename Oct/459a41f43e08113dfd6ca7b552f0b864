Renowned gospel singer Betty Bayo has termed her ex-husband Victor Kanyari a "stingy man" who does not fully pay bills for the two children he sired with her. "We are neither enemies nor friends, but we coordinate where it is possible. He is a stingy man who only provides little for his children," Betty said in an interview with Massawe on Radio Jambo. "Don't think he is that man you wake up and ask him for everything. He helps kidogo but I believe as a woman you are not supposed to depend fully on men, so I provide for them. With an attitude like mine, unaumia coz not all men can provide without being reminded." The two apparently separated three years ago, after Betty realised that her husband had been running a false ministry. Asked if she misses her ex-husband, Betty said: "I don't miss Kanyari. I am so occupied with life and I even don't follow up on what he does. I am enjoying the freedom of being single. Every marriage has issues. There are those you can stand but others you can't. Lessons from her former marriage? "It is every woman's dream to have a family, but I learnt that it is good to never cover up for the wrong things just because of love. If it is not working, walk out. Don't die because of what people will say after you walk out," she said. "I persevered so much because of fear, thinking it would work. But it didn't seem to work, and I thank God I came out alive," Betty said. She dismissed rumours that one of her children was not from her former marriage. "It has been three years since I left and when the time comes, I will get married again to a good person, because I don't want to find myself in a similar situation," she said. "I wish there was something I would have done to save the marriage, but I tried my best. All my kids are his but everyone has a right to say what they want. You can't be affected if you know your truth."
