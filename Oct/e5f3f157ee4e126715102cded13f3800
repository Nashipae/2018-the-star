The county assembly yesterday reshuffled members in all the 25 committees to improve services and House business. Majority leader Abdi Guyo urged members to take their work seriously during committee sittings. His Minority counterpart Elias Otieno warned that they will not allow complacency. According to Standing Order 164 (2) mandates the assembly’s select committee to nominate members, save for the Business and Appointments committees. “As a member of the select committee, we’ve balanced all committees based on gender and consulted with the political parties represented in the assembly,” Guyo said. Acting Speaker Chege Mwaura appealed to the members to be active. “Now that we have all the members in the committees, we’re optimistic they will yield good fruit,” he said. The committees are supposed to monitor budget performance of their sectors and ensure transparency and accountability by inquiring and reporting on projects, procedures and other activities. They are also supposed to ensure public participation in their activities, respond to issues raised by the public, prepare legislation and guide debate . Committees are divided into two parts — sectoral and  select.
