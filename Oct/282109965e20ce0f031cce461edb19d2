Africa's youngest billionaire Mohammed Dewji was on Thursday abducted by armed gunmen from a hotel in Dar es Salaam. According to mwananchi.co.tz, the youthful tycoon was kidnapped at around 5am from Collessium Hotel as he worked out in a gym. It quoted an Uber driver who said he witnessed the dawn kidnapping. The driver said the kidnappers shot in the air once to scare people away before whisking away Dewji to a waiting car which sped towards Masaki. "We were approaching the area when we saw four people alighting from a Saloon car. Their faces were masked. They shot in the air once and the hotel’s security guards scampered for safety,” the driver said. "They then got into the hotel and came out with someone whom I identified as Mohammed," he said. Police in Dar es Salaam are investigating the alleged kidnapping. According to Forbes, Dewji has an estimated net worth of US$1.54 billion (Sh1.54 trillion), and is the 17th richest person in Africa. He is Africa's youngest billionaire. Dewji was the first Tanzanian to be featured on the cover of Forbes Magazine in 2013 and has been featured on three separate occasions. He is the president and owner of MeTL Group, a Tanzanian conglomerate founded by his father in the 1970s. He is also a shareholder in the famous Simba Club in Dar es Salaam.
