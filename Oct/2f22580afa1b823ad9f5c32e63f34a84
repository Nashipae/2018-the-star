Prince of Benga Dan Aceda's greatest lesson from the music industry is that hard work is what matters to every artiste, not talent as he thought while starting out. "I wish I knew that talent didn't matter in the music industry," Dan told Adelle and Shaffie on Kiss FM recently. "Everything is hard work because you have to be ready to wake up early and sleep late. It is 95 per cent hard work not talent. I wish someone just told me to just work hard because I would be far." Dan released his fourth album, called "Accelerator", on Friday. The album, which has 11 songs, features both Kenyan and international artistes, including Sage, Red Acapella, Avril and Jamaican reggae star Etana. Dan said working with them was easy, as he has always wanted to work with them earlier. "For an artiste like Avril, whom we do different kinds of music, it was a lot of fun and really top professionalism from her," he said. "The song I did with her is more of urban kind than benga, but it is easy listening to." Adding: "When people say albums don't work, they are speaking a different part, because it is not a must you record and make money, but to me, albums are useful as I have been able to sell and make good cash from them."
