Mbeere South residents have protested against what they called a plan by Deputy President William Ruto to issue titles for disputed land. Ruto is to visit Kiritiri town in the subcounty on Monday next week to open a land registry. There were claims he will also issue title deeds, but this has been met with resistance. On Wednesday, Wachoro, Makima, Karaba and Riakanau held separate demos at Gitaraka and Makima markets, demanding that the DP avoid issuing any title. They want a team appointed to verify the real owners of the parcels. Many parties have staked claims. They accused MP Geoffrey Kingangi of organising the DP’s visit and arranging for issuance of title deeds without proper consultations. Kingangi dismissed the allegations, saying the Lands ministry arranged the function. Embu Lands executive Josphat Kithumbu also said his office had no information that titles will be issued. The residents warned that a bloody conflict could erupt if the DP issues titles before the ownership problem is fixed. “Most of the pieces of land are being disputed. Some of the people who claim ownership have resided there for more than 50 years and their children are adults. If they are evicted, it would be a big loss for them,” Sila Mwaniki said. They said parcels in the four areas had been allocated for farming since 1950 and beneficiaries were required to develop them within six month, or they would be reallocated to others. They want the ‘Tuanga Inquiry’ report made public because it “painted the true picture of ownership”. They also proposed that those who will be displaced be allocated land in the Mwea Settlement Scheme. The Mwea scheme is also disputed and lives have been lost after groups clashed.
