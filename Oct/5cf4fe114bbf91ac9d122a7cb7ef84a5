National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOCK) President Paul Tergat wants athletes participating in field events subjected to specialised training ahead of major competitions. The former world marathon record holder said this after being touched with the plight of Kenyan javelin throwers Leshan Ita Nao and Martha Nthanze Musau, who competed at the recently concluded Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires, Argentina without a coach. “I do believe we have the potential to be world beaters in the event but only if we can do things right,” added Tergat. Ita, who won silver in javelin at the Africa Youth Games in Algiers, finished fourth with a throw of 74.52m and Tergat noted that his performance could have been better if he had a coach. Tergat reiterated his call for the country to expand its scope to other sporting disciplines other than athletics if they hope to get more medals from the Olympics, Commonwealth Games and All Africa Games. Chef de mission to the games and Nock treasurer, Anthony Kariuki applauded the performance of the hockey side. “They showed teamwork and dedicated participation during the entire competition period. With exposure to international events, they can compete against some of the best teams,” added Kariuki. Kenya bagged three gold medals and a silver medal at the Youth Olympics courtesy of Jackson Kavesa Muema in the 3,000m and x-country, Fancy Cherono (2,000M SC/x-country and Edinah Jebitok (1,500m/x-country).
