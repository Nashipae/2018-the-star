A man and his mother have been arrested following the murder of a 25-year-old woman in Nyamira. Nancy Nyarangi's body was found dumped by the door to her house in Bomabacho village. She is suspected to have been killed by her husband during a domestic quarrel the previous night. Neighbours, who called police after discovering the body in the morning, said the couple constantly quarreled. Area assistant chief Joseph Mongare said the man and his mother were arrested after being saved from a lynch mob. "They are assisting the police with the investigation into the killing," the administrator told reporters at the scene. The body was taken to the Nyamira county referral hospital mortuary.
