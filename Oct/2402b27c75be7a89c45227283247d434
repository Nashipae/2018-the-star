A Kilifi MCA wants ODM to dismiss elected leaders who betrayed the party to support Deputy President William Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid. Nixon Muramba, the Kakuyuni ward representative, urged the ODM leadership not to be lenient on “traitors who do not want to follow party rules”. Addressing journalists in Malindi yesterday, the MCA said Raila Odinga, the prty leader, and secretary general Edwin Sifuna should not fear to strike the politicians’ names from the party register for by-elections in their respective constituencies or wards to be called. Among those who have endorsed Ruto’s bid are vocal Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa , Suleiman Dori (Msambweni), Owen Baya (Kilifi North), Badi Twalib (Jomvu) and Benjamin Tayari (Kinango) and several other MCAs from Kisii and Homa Bay counties. Already Jumwa and Dori vowed not to honor the summons by the ODM disciplinary committee. “The law should take its course equally not favour MPS and be tough on the MCAs. If it were me who rebelled, I the law would have applied,’’ he said. The MCA said if those summoned on October 10 will not appear, the ODM disciplinary committee should remove them from the party. Muramba also dismissed statements made by Ruto that Raila plans to remove him from Jubilee. He told the DP to stop mentioning Raila’s name because Raila “is a respected leader and a person who has united the country”.
