Media personality Janet Mbugua had her gallbladder removed after the birth of her secondborn Mali. On her Vlog, the former Citizen TV anchor said she was readmitted in hospital the same day she was discharged after giving birth. “After being discharged from hospital, I started having some strange pains and I had to call my doctor who, after explaining, told me I needed to be re-admitted,” Janet said. “It was very hard for me since I had a newborn but I had to. Mali was brought to me in hospital later and my firstborn had to be with my in-laws. “I started feeling fever that would come and go but the following day it was a whole big issue, I was itching over my whole body and my eyes turned yellow. I had jaundice which went over to the next day. At the same time, pain came around the upper part of my abdomen. “The next day the pain was so bad that I couldn’t breathe and so the doctor said I needed to go for a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) scan to basically figure out what was going on in my abdomen. “I spent like 30 minutes and the doctor said he could see gallstones in my system. I thought those are for old people? He said that was the main reason I had the jaundice and the pain because my system was struggling to comprehend all that.” Janet had to undergo an operation and was advised to have lots of rest.
