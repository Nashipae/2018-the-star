The court last Friday cancelled an arbitral award rendered to World Duty Free company saying it is contrary to public policy. The ruling declared that Kenya Airports Authority is not liable to pay or settle WDF the sum Sh8.5 billion on damages. The ruling further said neither WDF nor Kamlesh Pattni has any right to operate duty free shops, and to advertise at either Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi or the Mombasa based Moi International Airport. The court said the award, given in January 2013, disregarded, ignored and or misinterpreted the legal effect of the 2006 decision by the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) between World Duty Free Company limited and the government of Kenya. The court held that the ICSID decision which had held the agreement dated 27 April 1989 between the government and WDF was illegal, null and void because it was procured through bribery and corruption was binding to Kenyan courts and to all parties. “We are pleased to note that the decision of the Court brings to closure the long outstanding disputes and Court cases between KAA and WDF which dates back 30 years,” said Jonny Andersen, managing director of Kenya Airports Authority in a statement.
