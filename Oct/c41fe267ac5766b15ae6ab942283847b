Pupils in Mandera will have a choice of taking Islamic Madrassa over formal education if a proposed legislation is adopted. Mandera county assembly has welcomed a proposal by the executive to initiate a bill that paves way for an alternative education system. Leader of majority Abdi Adan Ali said the new education structure in the region will allow children in primary school  to pursue the Islamic Madrasa or the formal curriculum. Abdi who spoke to the press in Mandera town on yesterday  said the government does not recognise education offered in Madrassa and Duksi and it is time the county assembly passes a bill that will pave way for the Islamic religious system to be recognized by employers. “A child will be in a position to choose either to pursue formal education or Madrasa and will have an equal opportunity in the job market once the bill is passed, “ said Abdi. On Monday, deputy governor Mohamed Arai while opening a two-day stakeholders’ forum of religious, communal and education leaders said the nomadic and religious lifestyle of residents called for an education system that will blend the curriculum with the informal learning. Arai said it is time that Duksi and Madrasa are integrated into the curriculum.  “Our children are starting the formal education when they are over-age as they first complete the religious education before joining schools.The nomadic lifestyle leaves them at the mercy of religious teachers only as there are no schools in the grazing lands,” Arai said. Under Duksi, a child may take a maximum of five years while Madrasa takes 12 years. The CEO of Nomadic 
Education Harun Yusuf said the literacy level of primary school children is below average. The council will provide linkages between the county government and national level education. The nomadic council targets children from Lamu, Tana river, Garissa, Wajir, Mandera and other Northern Kenya counties.
