The Kisii County Assembly has demanded a report from the agriculture department on measures to protect banana and avocado farmers from exploitation by middlemen. The house said on Wednesday that farmers have not been earning maximum profits because they sell at throwaway prices to middlemen who sell it to other towns and cities for high profits. Chairman of the finance committee Dennis Ombachi asked for a report from agriculture executive Esman Onsarigo about value addition on the two crops and livestock production. He told speaker David Kombo that banana and avocado farmers have not been earning enough and said the house needs to know what’s happening in the two sectors. “We seriously need a report on measures put in place to protect banana, avocado as well as dairy farmers from middlemen,” Ombachi said. Middlemen have exploited farmers by buying their produce cheaply and selling at a huge profit elsewhere. Ombachi wanted to know when and where a processing factory for avocadoes and avocadoes will be built for value-addition.
