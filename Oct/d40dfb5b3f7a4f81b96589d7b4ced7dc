Boxing Association of Kenya (BAK) Kisumu County chairman, Anthony Otieno Omok alias Jamal wants the Registrar of Sports to quickly come up with proper guidelines to be used in the forthcoming elections. The national elections slated for November 16 are currently shrounded in confusion over the format of voting. While some boxers prefer regional delegates to participate in the polls, others want the county delegates to vote. “As things stand at the moment, we don’t know which delegates will be allowed to vote during the election at the national level,” said Jamal. Jamal, who was speaking during the third leg of the National Boxing League held at Uwanja wa Mbuzi in Mombasa, is keen to succeed outgoing BAK president, John Kameta. He will, however, have to square it out with his Nairobi counterpart Kenneth Kentrack Otieno. Jamal said he prefers county delegates as this will give more delegates a say in deciding who takes the reigns in boxing. “The decision to use either regional or county delegates in the elections falls squarely in the hands of the Registrar of Sports,” Jamal said. He called on the Registrar to act fast to save the sport from drifting into a chaos. “Kisumu is a county. If we insist on regional delegates, it will mean denying other counties in the region achance to participate in the polls,” said Jamal. “Let the Registrar of Sports come out with a stand to clear the stalemate,” he said. The candidate has rubbished claims from rivals that he is not a boxer and doesn’t deserve to succeed Kameta. He insisted that he is a former boxer and knows what it means to be one.
