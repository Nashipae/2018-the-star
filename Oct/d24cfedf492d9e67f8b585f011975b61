National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale yesterday urged Garissa county to delay relocating traders from Qorahey and Suq Muqdi open-air markets. Speaking in Garissa town, Duale said most of the traders are poor women. The traders are to be relocated while the markets are upgraded. Garissa governor Ali Korane announced in August they would be relocated to a new site. He was touring the Qorahey open-air market that hosts over 500 traders. Suq Muqdi has more than 1,000 traders. The market has caused congestion along Posta Road. The governor said traders should be shifted “for their own safety”. Korane said the “sensitive exercise” will be done in a procedural manner and traders will have input throughout the process.
