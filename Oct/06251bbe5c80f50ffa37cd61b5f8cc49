Governors in the North Rift are targeting reduction of maize production by 30 per cent within the next three years and instead have farmers grow other crops. A section of the farmers in the region have began crop diversification following challenges in the cereals sector with diminishing returns from maize and wheat, the main crops. The county bosses have been urging farmers to grow alternative crops instead of relying on maize farming which has proved to be problematic with lack of markets and low prices. The farmers in the region produce more than 30 million bags a year. Sugarcane yields in the region have increased from 1,041,780 tonnes to 1,644,395 tonnes in the past two years according to the provincial annual crop production as more farmers diversify to cultivation of the crop riding on better returns. The acreage under cane has increased from 56.8ha ( 140.3 acres ) to 64.2ha ( 158.6 acres ) with production of 2,198 tonnes. “We want to see our farmers venture more into other crops like growing of coffee, fruits and horticultural crops which have better returns,” Governor Jackson Mandago said. H spoke in Eldoret on Thursday. Last month, Mandago launched a campaign on diversification in Uasin Gishu County. More than 10,000 acres have been placed under coffee farming since last year.
