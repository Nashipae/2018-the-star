Kenya Revenue Authority collected Sh329 billion in first quarter ended September compared to Sh317.4 billion same periods last year but missed collection target for the quarter by Sh92.7 billion According to the statement of actual revenue and net exchequer issues, the tax man’s annualized collection stood at Sh1.3 trillion against a target of Sh1.673 trillion recently revised from Sh1.768 trillion. This means that Kenya is likely to miss its domestic revenue collection target by 373 billion if this collection trend persists. Last year, KRA missed revenue collection target by Sh172.4 billion. The tax collector managed Sh1.48 trillion in the year ending June 2018 against a target of Sh1.65 trillion. The shortfall was attributed to tough macroeconomic environment brought about by protracted election period in first half of the year. During the period, Treasury borrowed Sh92 billion domestically pushing annual projection to Sh368 billion budgetary allocation of Sh270 billion. It did not borrow externally during the period under review. ‘’Revenue is stagnant, well below target and spot on my prediction of Sh. 1.3 tr. Domestic borrowing well above target. No significant foreign borrowing yet. National government’s development budget, for all intents frozen, and counties bearing the brunt,’’ Economist David Ndii said on twitter. Consequently, the country lagged behind in repaying debt, managing only Sh154 billion that translates to Sh616 billion for the year, way below a target of Sh870 billion. This slow pace in debt repayment is coming at the time when Kenya is toying with an idea of going for the third Eurobond of Sh250 billion as Treasury PS Kamau Thugge hinted on Monday. Counties received only Sh25 billion during the period under review, translating to annual disbursement of Sh100 billion against Sh314 billion. Low revenue collection greatly hampered development budget, with only Sh22 billion allocated during the quarter, representing annual disbursement of Sh88 billion against budgetary target of Sh411 billion.
