As expected, thousands of fans thronged the Moi Stadium, Kasarani to cheer the national soccer team, Harambee Stars as they took on Ethiopia yesterday in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. Given it was free entry, the lines were long as early as 10am and by mid-day the ground was almost full. Hundreds of fans who had rose early hoping to be the first at the stadium were shocked to find thousands more ahead of them as the queues stretched to the Thika road. While others patiently waited in the long lines to get to the gates, many lost their marbles and turned back in annoyanceâ€”hurrying home to catch the game on television. Security was tight at the stadium with the National Youth Service supporting the National Police Service. The NYS in particular were out to ensure order was followed in the quest to get to the stadium. Woe unto the those who tried to cut their way ahead as when spotted, they were forced back on the que with several opting out after being caught cheating. Nairobians have a way of going around the law and so was the case yesterday. With some deeming their chances of beating the long queues before the gates were shut at 2pm, they squeezed themselves through grills to circumvent security and run their way towards the hordes who had entered through due process. Woe unto those who were caught. Nobody doubts that Kenya is a land blessed with beautiful lasses but Ethiopian ladies are out of this world. Dressed in yellow, green and red dresses or replica jerseys they dazzled even those who have stuck to the biblical ten commandments since birth.
