Women from various constituencies in Nairobi held demonstrations in the CBD on Tuesday demanding that Governor Mike Sonko appoints a woman as a deputy. The women, led by Muthoni Chege, said they appreciate the good job the Governor is doing but he has to appoint a woman to fill the post that has been lying vacant for a year. "A house cannot be complete without a woman and Sonko's house lacks one. We don't have a specific person we want to be appointed but we want those he nominated vetted and whoever comes out strongly to get the job, " Chege said. The women presented their petition to the Governor's office as well as the Office of the President, and that of deputy president.

They were former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru, businesswoman Agnes Kagure, lawyers Karen Nyamu and Jane Weru. Before then, the governor sent NRMKe leader Miguna Miguna's name for consideration. The assembly rejected the nomination. Miguna equally said no to the offer which Sonko later said was because he was under pressure to name a deputy.
