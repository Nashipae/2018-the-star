The High Court has barred the media from reporting on businesswoman Monica Kimani's links before her murder. Judge James Wakiaga, citing sub judice, said he would be upset if the media continues influencing the thinking on the case yet it is still in court. "My attitude towards these people (media) is negative!...Those statements that you keep on telling us about this case, stop writing them from now," he said. "I am an old-school judge... if I am influenced before a case, I get upset." Wakiaga said anybody who shall give information "will find it very difficult" now that he has taken over the matter. "...from now that I am taking this matter.... let us try and be kind to all of us...the information you put out there will put me in difficult position if I acquit these guys," he said.
