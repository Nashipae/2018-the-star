Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has confirmed that tomorrow October 10 will be a public holiday. However government is not organising any official celebrations. Last November Justice George Odunga ruled that technically Moi Day remains a public holiday even though it is not listed as a national day in the Constitution. Government determines whether there should be public holidays in addition to national days. And Moi Day does not qualify to be a public holiday. Even the former Kenyatta Day on October 20 is now known as Mashujaa Day and does not exclusively honour the Founding Father of the nation. If Moi Day remains a public holiday, we would have to create Kibaki Day, Uhuru Day and Days for all future presidents. Moi Day – whatever the pros and cons of Daniel arap Moi’s time as President – is an absurd anachronism. It should be scrapped. Government needs to make certain that the Public Holidays Act is amended as soon as possible to remove Moi Day and all other superfluous holidays.  Quote of the day: "The revolution is not an apple that falls when it is ripe. You have to make it fall."  Revolutionary Ernesto 'Che' Guevara was executed in Bolivia on October 9, 1967.
