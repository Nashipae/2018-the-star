A man was arrested in Bungoma after he allegedly strangled his daughter, 2, to death on Monday. Mike Juma is said to have committed the heinous act at his home in Nzoia village, Webuye East. The child was found with her leg severed and a rope tied around her neck. Juma was arrested as he attempted to flee to Kakamega. He is suspected to have murdered the innocent child after a domestic squabble with his wife. The suspect's father Moses Simiyu, who was living with the young girl, said he received the news of the girls' death while at his farm. He said the child's mother left after she disagreed with Juma about a year ago. "At first, I thought the caller was joking. I asked my wife to go check and she found the child had been strangled," he told reporters. Webuye East OCPD Zacheus Ngeno said the man will be charged with murder. The body was taken to Webuye sub-county hospital morgue.
