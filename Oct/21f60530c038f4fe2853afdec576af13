Transport regulator NTSA has revoked licences for seven matatu saccos citing violation of laws guiding their operations. Molo Shuttle Sacco that operates the Nairobi, Nakuru, Olenguruone, and Kisii route was among the deregistered saccos. NTSA, in a notice published on Tuesday, also named Nairobi Kiruline Services. The sacco has vehicles plying Nairobi, Murang'a, Othaya, Nyeri, and Nyahururu routes. Gakango, which plies the Nyeri, Gataragwa, Ngobit routes is also among the seven. The agency led by Francis Meja also named New Lowland and Newlot saccos. New Lowland operates on the Nakuru, Marigat and Kabarnet route while Newlot plies Nairobi, Machakos, Makueni, Kitui, Mutumo, Kibwezi, Ikutha, Voi, and Mombasa. NTSA has also banned Hannover Commercial Enterprise, which operates the Kikuyu, Waiyaki Way, Westlands, Tom Mboya, Thika Road, and Mwiki routes. Jogoo Road's Peja Travellers Limited was also notified of the deregisteration which was effective September 13. Meja's team invoked Section 5(1) of the NTSA Regulations, 2014, as grounds for the delisting of the said operators. The NTSA revokes licenses for defective and unroadworthy vehicles, largely blamed for increased cases of accidents in the country.
