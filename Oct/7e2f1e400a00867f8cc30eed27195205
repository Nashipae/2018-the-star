Wajir county civil registrar Onesmus Mwanthi has told area residents to collect their birth certificates lying at his office. Noting that there is a large number of uncollected certificates lying at Huduma Centre since July, the county registrar requested the office of the county commissioner through deputy county commissioners (DCCs) and assistant county commissioners (ACCs) and chiefs to upscale sensitisation through barazas so that people can go and collect the documents. Speaking to the press in his office on Friday, the registrar reported that there was still a backlog of 4,500 pending applications for birth certificates “Out of the 4,500, 2000 are unprocessed application forms while the rest are already processed forms awaiting certificate books to be printed”, explained Mwanthi. He further explained that the current application traffic has reduced drastically and they currently receive an average of 50 applications per day compared with over 300 applications they were receiving early this year between February and July.However, the supply of certificate booklets from the headquarters is still low and far from meeting the high demand.
