MPs will tomorrow vote on a bill seeking to move the election date from August to December. Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa who is the sponsor of the Constitutional (Amendment) Bill 2018 was yesterday lobbying colleagues to turn up in large numbers and vote for the bill. At least two thirds of the 349 members must vote in support of the bill to sail through the second stage. Amendments to the proposals will be debated in the third stage before the bill is passed. “Please Hon. Members, the bill pushing the election date from August to December is in the parliamentary voting second reading on Wednesday [tomorrow] morning session.

Please remind your neighbours and friends,” Wamalwa told MPs in a message on their WhatsApp group. The deputy Minority leader is making the second attempt to have the date moved from the second Tuesday of August in every fifth year to the third Monday of December. “The bill seeks to introduce a new date for the General Election which will be more favourable to Kenya’s circumstances,” the bill reads.

Wamalwa says holding elections in August disrupts the school calendar, budget reading and Kenyans’ busy work schedules. MPs say the matter requires a referendum because it extends the term of the President and other elected leaders. “If we are going to alter the term of office of the President, then this is a matter that requires a referendum,” Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma said. Makueni’s Dan Maanzo said the reasons cited for change should be included in the audit of the 2010 Constitution and subjected to a referendum.
