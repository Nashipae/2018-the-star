The Port Workers Welfare group has accused former Kenya Ports Authority managing director Brown Ondego of misleading the government over privatisation. They were reacting to Ondego’s speech on Friday when he said that privatisation of the port is the only way to save it from “collapse”. Ondego said he regrets developing cold feet when he had the opportunity to privatise the facility. He addressed the inaugural East Africa Maritime Awards (EAMA) event where he was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award. However, the Port Workers Welfare and Performance Group (PWWPG) said his comments lower worker morale and lead to poor performance. PWWPG chairman Waweru Kamau, general secretary Ali Khamisi and organising secretary Peter Ouma said Ondego failed in his mandate and that is why he was let go. “He is not in a position to call on the government to privatise port operations. He has hidden agendas,” said the officials in a statement. “He is seeking cheap publicity,” they said. Privatisation of the port has been a thorny subject, with Coast leaders vehemently opposed to the idea. Khamisi said he is the best person to lead the facility, which makes about Sh50 billion a year. Since he took over from immediate former boss Catherine Mturi-Wairi, the port has been setting positive performance records. Khamisi said the government should confirm Manduku. Khamisi pushed for the promotion of the KPA acting managing director Daniel Manduku, saying he can do a good job. “Manduku is one of the best technocrats remaining in President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration. He deserves such an opportunity when it arises,” he said. Khamisi said it will be a waste of funds for the government to advertise for the position after the unceremonial exit Mturi-Wairi . Manduku was appointed in June
