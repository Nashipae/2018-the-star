Former Kakamega DC Paul Yatich's wife was on Tuesday found murdered after a rape ordeal at their house in Kiplombe, Eldoret town. Loice Yatich's partly decomposed body was found after her husband reported her as missing. "We suspect she was murdered last Saturday," Eldoret West OCPD Zachary Bitok said. The late worked with the TSC as a curriculum support development officer in Uasin Gishu county. Bitok said a farmhand, who went missing after the incident, is being treated as the key suspect. The woman's car, which had also been missing, was found abandoned in Kabiyet, Nandi county. "The body had serious cuts on the shoulder. We also suspect she was raped during the attack," Bitok said. The former DC had separated with his wife and currently lives at Pioneer estate in Eldoret. The police boss said: "Yatich accompanied us to Loice's house where we found the decomposing body after breaking in through a window." The DCI took over the investigations with a view to arresting the killer(s) and to establish the motive of the murder. Neighbours said the missing employee was sighted at the home, which is situated near the Eldoret Airstrip, on Monday. Detectives dusted the scene before police collected the body. For his part, Yatich said they were still in touch despite separating. The couple has several children. "I reported to the police after vain attempts to reach her on the phone," he said. Police said they are yet to establish if any items or money was stolen from the house. Click here for the latest political news
