Lugari MP Ayub Savula, his two wives Melody Ringera and Hellen Kemboi on Monday denied charges of forgery, obtaining money by false pretences and conspiracy to steal Sh122,335, 500 from the Ministry of ICT. They appeared before Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi together with former ICT PS Sammy Itemere, former Government Advertising Agency boss Dennis Chebitwey, administrative secretary Dickson Nyandinga and 21 others. They are also accused with attempting to obtain Sh119 million from the State Department of ICT. Savula is the director of the seven firms that were also charged with the same offences including the publishers of Sunday Express, a weekly newspaper that circulates in Nairobi only. The MP was arrested on Friday in connection with the loss of Sh2.5 billion at the Government Advertising Agency (GAA). The agency was established in July 2015 to handle advertisements from all state ministries and departments. Officials told the Star that the DCI targets 23 suspects, among them current and former GAA staff, in the scandal. Savula, Itemere and Chebitwey were released on Sh2 million bond each with sureties of similar amounts and alternative bail of Sh1 million. The other suspects were freed on Sh1million cash. The case will be mentioned on November 12.
