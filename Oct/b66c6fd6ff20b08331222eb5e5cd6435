Philadelphia and Miami Half Marathon winner, Panuel Mkungo, is among top athletes expected at the 13th edition of the Safaricom Madoka Half Marathon slated for October 20. Defending champions Isaac Kipkoech and Nancy Kiprop will also be seeking to retain the titles they won last year. The winners of the 21km race will receive a cash prize of Sh500,000 each, with second and third-placed finishers getting Sh250,000 and Sh100,000 respectively. This makes the half marathon the second highest paying in the country. Over 1500 athletes are expected for the one-day event, which is being sponsored by Safaricom to the tune of Sh2 million. Speaking at the launch at Riadha House yesterday, race founder Major (Rtd) Marsden Madoka said the growth and success of the race has had a positive impact in nurturing athletes in the coast region as well as the country in general. “The race has fulfilled its mission of nurturing local talent in the region as it has elevated a number of local athletes from the region to international heights,” said Madoka, adding that there are plans to organise training and coaching camps starting next year to further help nurture athletic talent. “There is need to continue developing the talents of promising young athletes by having training camps over school holidays. We are stepping up our efforts to raise monies to achieve this goal.” Safaricom’s Charles Kare said: “This is a great platform for nurturing and developing talent. We celebrate Hon. Madoka for being the brainchild behind this race and we are proud to be part of it. We continue to support and nurture grass-root talents by providing platforms that enable both established and upcoming sportsmen and women to improve their skills,” said Kare.
