The tug-of-war between Water CS Simon Chelugui and Murang’a governor Mwangi Wa Iria yesterday deepened over management of the water function in the county. Chelugui told senators his ministry will control the management of the sector in the county and shield it from infiltration by politicians. He told the committee on Land Environment and Natural Resources chaired by Nyandarua senator Mwangi Githiomi that Wa Iria has failed to engage his ministry on the woes facing the sector and instead “lamented publicly”. “It cannot be possible that one county controls its own water resource. The national government is responsible for distribution of water countrywide,” Chelugui said. “I have not been able to diagnose the water crisis in Murang’a because we have just been hearing lamentations but not real issues.” Click here for the latest political news
