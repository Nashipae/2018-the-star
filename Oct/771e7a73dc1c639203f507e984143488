Female KCPE and KCSE candidates have been advised to abstain from sex. Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong’s wife Judy raised concern about girls as young as 12 years missing classes to breastfeed their babies. “I want to urge parents to guide their children and discourage them from engaging in sex at an early age,” she said. Judy spoke to candidates from Nyakhobi primary and secondary schools in Funyula constituency on Wednesday. She wished the candidates well in their exams and promised to sponsor girls who score 365 marks and above.
