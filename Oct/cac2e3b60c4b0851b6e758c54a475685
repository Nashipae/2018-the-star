Murang’a governor Mwangi wa Iria yesterday said the Constitution should be amended to provide equitable sharing of national revenue. He said he will soon launch a movement, the Rasilimali Initiative, to champion the cause. The county chief said most counties in Mt Kenya region get a small share of the national cake, yet they have high populations. He said the country must avert possible clashes over resources. The counties with much lower populations get higher revenues, Iria said. He said Murang’a with a population of 1.5 million people gets Sh6 billion, while some counties with hundreds of thousands of people get more than Sh10 billion. It is Sh4,000 per person in Murang’a against about Sh60,000 per person in those counties, he said. Wa Iria said their natural resources are also used by other counties, in an apparent reference to the water issue that sparked protests by the Nairobi administration.
