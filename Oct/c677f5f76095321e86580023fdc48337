Police have obtained a warrant of arrest against Konoin MP Brighton Yegon who is accused of assaulting a man last Sunday. The MP has been on the run since the incident that occurred at Chebangang in Konoin. Yegon is alleged to have abducted and assaulted Nicholas Ngetich,29, from Kapset village over alleged political differences. Ngetich sustained injuries on his head and right hand. Konoin DCIO Felix Mutua said they sought the warrant after the legislature failed to honour summons to record a statement. “We are looking for him…we have already obtained the warrant of arrest from Court,” said the officer. Yegon has denied the allegations saying he was the one rescuing the man from an angry mob that was baying for his blood after he attempted to disrupt his function after football tournament. Ngetich on his part claims that he was picked up by the MP and bundled into a car before being driven to James Finlay tea estate where he was brutally assaulted before being dropped. He recorded his statement on Monday morning under OB NO. 23/15/10/2018. Read: Cops seek Bomet MP over alleged assault of man Click here for the latest political news
