Wajir county is preparing to evict non-civil servants occupying government built housing units. The county head of housing department Isaac
Hassan has called on national government employees to report any government
built house which is occupied by non-civil servants. “We are carrying out a physical audit to
ascertain vacant and non-vacant government allocated housing units. Anyone who is not a civil servant and is
occupying a government house will have to vacate them forthwith,” reiterated
Hassan on Monday. This is in line with a directive issued by the Housing Principal Secretary that all non-civil servants should vacate government houses. According to a circular from the director estate department in the state department of housing and urban development,
Mrs. Lydia Muraguri, rents collected from government houses are to be ploughed
back to maintain government houses and buildings. “In this respect, we have managed to
install bio-digest latrines to replace bucket toilets in government houses,”
said Hassan, adding that the next phase will be provision of fencing around the
houses.
