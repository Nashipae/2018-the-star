The DCI has summoned Kenya Pipeline Company MD Joe Sang, chairman John Ngumi and five others for probe into the Sh1.8 billion Kisumu oil jetty scandal. The seven have been asked to record statements at the DCI headquarters between this Thursday and Monday next week. Manager, department of infrastructure, is expected to appear at the Kiambu Road offices today at 10am while his Finance counterpart is scheduled to appear at 2pm. Also summoned are Major Neepe Itasayon (chair, Board Technical Committee), Faith Boinett (former chair, Board Finance Committee), and Jerry Simu (former chair, Board Audit). Sang will appear on Friday at 10am while Ngumi, Itasayon, Faith, and Simu are lined up for Monday. Of interest in the case is the wastage and fraud during the construction of the facility which is supposed to help deliver oil to Uganda and Tanzania. The wastage, inside sources earlier indicated, arose from the disposal of materials which had been procured in 2001 for the works. The company is argued to have sold the old ones to the contractor and claimed to have bought new ones. KPC is also facing questions over suspect loss of billions of shillings in 12 projects whose bidding remains a subject of a probe.
