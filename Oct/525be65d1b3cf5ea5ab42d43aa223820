Business was brought to a standstill along Links Road in the affluent Nyali neighbourhood in Mombasa on Wednesday when more than 30 hired people evicted tenants from a property in dispute. They took out property belonging to D J Lowe and Company Limited and security firm Guardforce Security (K) Limited. The property was strewn along Links Road, blocking traffic and causing a huge snarl-up for more than three hours. The hired persons were seen patrolling the compound, carrying pangas and other crude weapons. There was a moment of tension when boda boda riders attempted to break into the compound to confront those who were evicting the tenants. The riders said they “felt the pain” of Farah Noor Abbas, the orphan of one of the directors of D J Lowe and Company Limited, who died years ago when she was a child. Farah, in her early 20s, said she has been living in the premises all her life. “There has been a court case going on which I am aware of. But I don’t think it was right to come and evict people like this without a notice,” she told journalists. However, police said the property had been taken over by Prime Bank after it was used to secure a mortgage loan. The police produced a court order dated July 24, instructing the two tenants to vacate the premises. It took the intervention of Mombasa speaker Aharub Khatri to calm down the irate boda boda riders. “There are better ways to handle such issues,” he said. Khatri was accompanied by acting head of Mombasa County Inspectorate Said Gullet and MCAs Mohamed Abrari (Kongowea), Renson Thoya (Mikindani), Raphael Bwire (Junda), Ahmed Salama (Bofu) and Robert Nyiro (Bamburi) and Bernard Ogutu of Changamwe. Khatri said Mombasa will not allow such actions that threaten to breach peace.
