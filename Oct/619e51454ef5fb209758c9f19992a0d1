Media personality Janet Mbugua has spoken up for the first time after giving birth. During a live session with her fans on Instagram, the former Citizen TV anchor revealed that she had had a health scare after giving birth to her secondborn, whom she named Mali Mwaura Ndichu. "I underwent a surgical procedure next to my newborn, and it was insane. I had multiple meltdowns and I thank my family members (both mine and my hubby's) for being supportive. They were there for me. Most incredible families," she said. Adding: "I was hospitalised for two weeks and have been on a recovery journey for one and a half weeks. It has been really tough, but I'm back getting healthier." The mother of two, who's recuperating at home, has been away from social media for three weeks, and she said: "I needed a minute to get into routine with my newborn baby, and it's faring on well. I thank God for my life because people go through worse during childbirth. Glad to be back, healthier and happy." Mbugua said she will be talking more about her pregnancy journey on her vlog in a four-part series, starting from Monday. The Lifebuoy brand ambassador called on Kenyans to help Njambi Koikai, who has been battling thoracic endometriosis, to help her raise money for her treatment. "Njambi has thoracic endometriosis. She's such a soldier. Let's stand with her and help her raise the remaining Sh2.6 million for her treatment," Mbugua said.
