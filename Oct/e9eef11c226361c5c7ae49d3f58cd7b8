Fire razed four shops and two houses in Garissa town on Friday. Nothing was salvaged. The cause was not immediately established. It began from one shop and spread to the others. Hundreds of onlookers watched helplessly as the raging fire spread to the adjacent houses. Sparks from electrical cables fueled the fire and hampered efforts to salvage property. Residents tried to put out the fire but quickly abandoned the efforts after running out of water. County fire brigade team arrived after the fire had razed the building. Angry residents blamed the county, saying it was slow in responding to distress calls. Daudi Mutea said the Garissa fire brigade personnel lack skills to handle big fires. “They are ill-equipped and should be trained on how to respond to fires,” Mutea said. “It is not the first time the fire brigade is arriving late to the scene. It happened during a fire outbreak at the Garissa market.” The Garissa market was burntd by arsonists in August last year. Phyllis Nyawira said the firefighters often run out of water. “ How do you arrive at a scene and run out of water in less than five minutes? Unless you don’t know what you are doing,” Nyawira said.
