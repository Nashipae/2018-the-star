Migori Governor Okoth Obado has been detained for another 12 days in wait for the ruling of his bail application in his girlfriend Sharon Otieno's murder case. Judge Jessie Lessit made the decision after the defence team made their submissions and urged the court to have the governor and his co-accused released. Obado through lawyers Nicholas Ombija, Rogers Sagana, and Cliff Ombeta, said he is ready to abide by any conditions set by the Court for admission to bail or bond. The governor was charged alongside his Personal Assistants Michael Oyamo and Caspal Obiero following the murder of the 26-year-old Rongo University student. Their case was consolidated. Their lawyers urged the court to release Obado and his co-accused arguing that the state had failed to provide compelling reasons to have them detained further. "I will fully cooperate with the police or the prosecution and not pose any risk to the prosecution witnesses, victims or co-accused when released on bond or bail pending trial," Obado said. Oyamo and Obiero said the State has no evidence to warrant them being denied bail. They also said their security is not a ground to deny them bail. The three argued that neither the investigators, witnesses, the family of the deceased nor any other persons have alleged an attempt to interfere with investigations, witnesses, and evidence. The trio further told the court that none of the parties have complained of intimidation or an action which has in a way affected the investigations, prosecution or trial of the murder case.
