The Football Kenya Federation has introduced new strict rules for foreign coaches in both the Kenya Premier League and National Super League. KPL and NSL clubs will now be required to hire foreign coaches with CAF Class ‘C’ certificate with a mandatory requirement of Sh100,000 non-refundable fee for clearance. The new rules, according to FKF President Nick Mwendwa, takes effect immediately and the documents will have to be submitted to Caf for verification and approval. "We have great coaches in the country who can help in the development of our local football if given a chance," he said. Mwendwa said this while addressing delegates during FKF Annual General Meeting held at the Grand Royal Swiss in Kisumu. Delegates also adopted the Kariobangi Sharks’ proposal for promotion of KPL and NSL youth league players to the national team. Mwendwa said clubs will henceforth not have a limit of fielding the Under-17 and 20 youths in the KPL and NSL, provided they are registered with the club. Previously, the clubs had a limit of five players per match from the youth team but from now henceforth, they are at liberty to field whichever number they deem best. However, Mwendwa reiterated that contracts are a must for the junior players to be fielded. "We need to balance the KPL teams to give youth a chance and to help develop our U-23 national team," added Mwendwa. FKF delegates also resolved to change the calendar from 2019 to match the Fifa schedule. In 2019 season, the league will run from August to coincide with other international leagues. This season’s calendar will, however run from November and end in June next year.
