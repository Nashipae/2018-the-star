Youthful Sofapaka head coach John Baraza has blamed their 3-2 loss to Kariobangi Sharks in the SportPesa Shield final to lack of concentration by his charges in the final ten minutes of the match. The 2014 Shield champions, who were the pre-match favourites, bowed to Sharks in the last 10 minutes. Towering Ugandan forward George Abege had put Sharks ahead in the 30th minute but Stephen Waruru restored parity for Sofapaka in the 43rd minute. After the break, Kevin Kimani doubled Sofapaka’s lead a goal, which seemed to have won the Shield for his side only for Sydney Simale to level matters in the 80th minute.Three minutes later, Abege turned fortunes in favour of Sharks with the third goal to see his side win their maiden Shield title and their first silverware since their elevation to the top flight a year ago. The result left Baraza fuming with his charges for throwing away the lead at crucial stage of the match. He said: “We lost the match due to a lapse in concentration in the last minutes of the game. Those are goals which we were not supposed to have conceded but it’s football. Whoever makes good use of his chances carries the day.” The former striker opened up on his intentions to fix his defence by bringing in two quality defenders to seal the loopholes. The club has already parted ways with Ugandan centre half Rodgers Aloro. “I want to bring in two quality defenders since I feel we have been conceding easy goals. We have no problems with the midfield and the striking front which has performed well in the past season. We have been scoring goals at will but I am worried with the way we are shipping in goals.Out of the top five clubs, we conceded more goals and I think by bringing in two defenders, I will cushion the situation. We are already in negotiations and I hope they will sign for us.”
