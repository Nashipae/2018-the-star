Meru MCAs have demanded that President Kenyatta’s administration reallocates the Sh623 million budgeted two years ago for road projects. The funds budgeted for the construction of roads in the county have since been withdrawn. The minority leader and Abothuguchi central MCA Ayub Bundi and his counterpart for Mwanganthia Julius Mbijiwe issued a 14-day notice failing which they will organise demonstrations with locals. “Two years ago we demonstrated demanding construction of the roads Kithirune-Kaguma to Giaki and Katheri-Equitor to Cottolengo, and the President launched them before the electioneering season and they were budgeted for.” Katheri- Cottolengo road was given Sh623 million to begin but currently they have since been withdrawn from the budget. They said as leaders, they are not satisfied by the national government due to failed promises of several projects given to the residents of Imenti Central and some launched by the head of State two years ago. They wondered why the projects launched a long time ago have not taken off despite being budgeted for and want to know why the funds were withdrawn.
