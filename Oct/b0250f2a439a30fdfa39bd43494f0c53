Former National Land Commission boss Muhammad Swazuri’s corruption case file has been moved to the Anti- Corruption Court. Senior principal magistrate Lawrence Mugambi yesterday said a letter from the High Court deputy registrar in charge of the Anti-Corruption Division requested for the file. Swazuri filed an application before the High Court last week seeking a review of the bail terms and conditions issued to him. Yesterday, he appeared before the trial court for the hearing of the contempt of court case against the EACC, which he accused of refusing to allow him access to his office. The former chairman says the commission has disobeyed court orders that directed him to write to them whenever he wants to access his office.

Mugambi said he could not hear the application because the original file was not before him. He only had “a skeletal file”. He said the High Court is superior to his and he has to wait for them to finish with the file before they proceed with Swazuri’s application. “The High Court has asked for the file. We have to wait until they return the file. What we have here is a skeletal file,” Mugambi said. Swazuri has made several applications in relation to the criminal case before court. Meanwhile, seven NLC commissioners will testify against Swazuri. Swazuri and Kenya Railways Corporation MD Atanas Maina were charged alongside 10 public officers from the Lands ministry and the KRC. It is alleged they conspired to commit crimes, which led to the loss of Sh222,375,000 public funds in payments for three KRC parcels.
