Rapper Prezzo has denied claims he is eyeing a political seat come 2022. The claims emerged after he posted a photo of him meeting Nasa leader Raila Odinga
and captioned it: "Do the math." Word Is reached out to the singer, who said: "I am not joining politics. I
am doing charity work with one of my partners." Two weeks ago, Prezzo and Kompakt Records CEO Steve Oh started a new initiative of putting up proper homes in Kibera slums. The two will upgrade the mud houses and give the residents a feel of solid permanent houses. In one of his recent posts on social media, Prezzo said: "God is great all the time, u don't have to be a politician to make change. We don't need survival for today, we need solutions that are everlasting." The controversial Kenyan rapper also made it clear that they are giving back to the society and urged other popular musicians to give back to the fans. Talking to Word Is, he explained: "It is like a movement,
like you know in Kibera, there are so many houses that are built in mud
and people are not able to live well in those houses. So we have
decided to put up proper houses in Kibera to help them." Five months ago, Prezzo and Starehe MP Jaguar buried the beef they had been waging for years. Jaguar, now a musician-turned-politician, and Prezzo, a comeback
star, were big music rivals four years ago but released a new song
titled Timika.
