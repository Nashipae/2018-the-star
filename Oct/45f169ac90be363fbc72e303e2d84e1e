Embakasi West MP has called for a cledar demarcation of wards in the constituency, saying there is confusion in offering services. The constituency is made up of Mowlem, Kariobangi South, Umoja 1 and Umoja 2 wards. But some parts of the wards fall in other jurisdictions. Theuri said the ministries of Interior and Education were still using boundaries that existed before the inauguration of the new Constitution in 2010. As such, there are conflicts in services. Uhuru estate which mainly falls within Kariobangi South ward has parts in Kamukunji constituency. Theuri said residents do not know where to seek services. "There is a lot of confusion because if you go to Kamukunji CDF office, they direct you to Embakasi West yet those are residents of the other constituency," Theuri said. The MP similar cases have occurred in Mowlem where parts of the ward are indicated to be in Njiru in Kasarani constituency. "The boundaries should be clear so that estates fall within a particular ward," he said. Conflict of Jurisdictions and poor coordination of various offices in Embakasi West Constituency have negatively impacted on the delivery of key services to the residents. Embakasi West Mp George Theuri said that the above is as a result of the Offices of the Ministry of Education and that of Interior and Coordination of National Government still use pre-2010 Constitution to manage and coordinate the affairs in Embakasi West Constituency. " My Constituency is made up of four wards Mowlem, Kariobangi South , Umoja One and Umoja Two Wards.However some sections of the wards fall under different constituencies," Theuri said. It was stated that parts of Karibangi/Uhuru ward which has sections of Uhuru estates under Kamkunji Constituency and sections of Kariobangi South/Mowlem Ward fall under Njiru ward in Kasarani Constituency.
