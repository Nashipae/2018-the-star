Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chairman Wafula Chebukati will today be questioned by MPs over expenditures totalling Sh9.2 billion. Auditor General Edward Ouko raised audit queries about key contracts the commission awarded over 10 months of last year. Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC) chairman Opiyo Wandayi said the committee has set aside two days to question the IEBC team. If necessary, he said, they could extend questioning to Thursday. Wandayi spoke to the Star after he returned from Kisumu where the watchdog agency had retreated over the weekend to write reports on the expenditure by government agencies for 2014-15 and part of 2015-16 financial years. Chebukati is expected along with the two other remaining commissioners, Abdi Guliye and Boya Molu, as well as acting CEO Marjan Hussein. Wandayi said sacked CEO Ezra Chiloba has not been invited but the committee will decide whether to invite him or not. An internal audit report on IEBC had raised questions about the payment of Sh249.3 million for the supply, installation and support of the IEBC primary and secondary data centre equipment. The initial budget was only Sh130 million, meaning the contract amount shot up by 92 per cent.  Click here for the latest political news
