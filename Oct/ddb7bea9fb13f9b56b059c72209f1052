The Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Nakuru county have signed a partnership agreement on the inaugural Nakuru International Investors Conference. KNCCI chairperson Kiprono Kittony and Govenor Lee Kinyanjui signed the agreement on Thursday. The conference is scheduled for November 29 to December 1 in Naivasha. Its theme will be ‘Harnessing our natural resources to spur industrial growth’. Kittony praised Nakuru for having a friendly tax regime and good governance. He said the county has huge potential and promised to mobilise KNCCI members and investors to attend the conference. “We congratulate you for paying back the pending bills and debt that you inherited,” Kittony said. Kinyanjui thanked the KNCCI for their support, saying the chamber has links to local and international investors. “We look forward to the investors conference as it will boost trade and showcase the unlimited opportunities Nakuru has,” he said. He said the county will support the business community. “We are particularly keen to ensure suppliers to the county are paid within two weeks after delivery. They’ll receive communication in case there is any delay in payment,” the county chief said. Nakuru has aligned its development agenda to President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big 4 agenda, with emphasis on manufacturing and value addition in the agricultural sector. The county government has zoned Egerton Agricity and parts of Naivasha for construction of an industrial park.
