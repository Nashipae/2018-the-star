Barely a month to the repechage qualifiers in Marseille, France, all is not well in the Kenya Simbas camp. The players are yet to be paid their August and September training allowances and training was even halted over the weekend, owing to the cash crunch facing the side. The local coaches including Charles Ngovi, who handles the backs; Dominique Habimana, who handles the forwards, alongside team manager Wangila Simiyu and physiotherapist Chris Makachia are yet to be paid their three-month salaries from July while the New Zealand coaches Ian Snook and Murray Roulston have been paid. Sources close to the team have indicated that it has become so bad that players can’t afford bus fare to training. The Kenya Rugby Union are also yet to confirm the build up matches for the Simbas against the British Army on October 17, Namibia (October 21 ) at and Loftus 2000, a semi professional side from South Africa’s Blue Bulls, on October 28. All matches will be played at the RFUEA ground. Kenya are also due to play Romania on November 3 in Bucharest and reports indicate that the hosts are considering fielding an ‘A’ side to face the Simbas. Kenya are due to face Canada on November 11 and play Hong Kong six days later. Kenya will round off the repechage tournament on November 23 against Germany. Efforts to get a comment from Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) acting chief executive officer, Sylvia Kamau or director of rugby, Thomas Odundo, proved futile as they didn’t respond to our queries. Elsewhere, Western Bulls have named Treasure Odundo as their captain for the 2018/19 season. The Kakamega-based side said Odundo will be assisted by former Kakamega RFC half-back Allan Kasiti. The changes have been confirmed by Bulls head coach Howard Okwemba.
