Nyandarua governor Francis Kimemia has warned the county assembly to stop taking residents for granted. He said the current assembly wrangles are well-calculated to derail his development agenda. Kimemia accused speaker Wahome Ndegwa of insigating the chaos. “The war in the county assembly must stop. As the governor, I can no longer afford the luxury to sit and watch as one person destroys the whole county,” he said. Kimemia spoke on Wednesday at Tumaini town, where he donated Sh3 million to 28 residents whose houses burnt down last Monday. He said all the current elected leaders in Nyandarua were chosen to end the perennial wars that hindered economic growth. Previously, Kimemia said, the county was led by “political warlords”. He said the current speaker was elected by ward representatives, who also elected their House leaders. The same MCAs resolved to change the House leadership during a meeting at a Nakuru hotel in September, Kimemia said. A meeting convened by Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju at the party headquarters on October 3 agreed to have the new leaders takes charge. But after the assembly reconvened on Thursday, Ndegwa declined to communicate the change of leadership to the assembly. This caused majority of MCAs, who are in favour of the changes, to bar him from entering the assembly on Wednesday morning. “Tuju chaired a meeting where Jubilee Party MCAs, who must support the government agenda, agreed on leaders who will effectively represent and prosecute the government agenda in the assembly,” Kimemia said. “We are telling the speaker he has no choice but to acknowledge these leaders.” He said the assembly is divided because the speaker and some MCAs have a preferred candidates for governor in 2022 and that is why they are fighting him. “Who told them their preferred governors will be alive by then? Is it not God who gives and takes life?” Kimemia said on Wednesday.
