Human rights activists have unveiled a “radical” citizen-driven movement to champion the fight against bad leadership. The Kenya Tuitakayo Movement yesterday launched its 10-agenda charter, which seeks to help citizens realise the Third Liberation. The movement seeks to ensure every citizen accesses basic rights such as food, healthcare, security, education and enjoys freedoms. The activists warned that violating these rights by the state, security officers, foreigners, businesspeople or individuals will attract severe punishment. They included Kenya Human Rights Commission executive director George Kegoro Transparency International-Kenya executive director Sam Kimeu, Inuka Kenya CEO John Githongo, Greenpeace Africa executive director Njeri Kabeberi, Wandia Njoya (political and environmental activist) and Muthoni Kamau (activist and co-chair Kenya Tuitakayo Movement).
