A Kanu legislator has dismissed Deputy President William Ruto and his allies for giving conditions for the proposed referendum. Tiaty MP William Kamket, reacting to Ruto’s flip flopping on the referendum, said Kenyans are behind the clamour for law change and no conditions would dissuade them from repealing sections of the Constitution. “Why are some people saying we want to give others seats? What is wrong with that? Even if we decide others be Prime Minister, what is the matter?” Kamket posed. On Friday, while in Bungoma, the DP said those agitating for a referendum are engaging in “idle talk”. According to Ruto’s camp, the referendum is part of Raila Odinga’s bag of tricks to gain a foothold in government and scuttle Jubilee’s agenda.

The ongoing rhetoric is idle talk and it should not be allowed to continue. The public is waiting for improved services,” Ruto said. DP’s sentiments were echoed by Bungoma senator Moses Wetang’ula, who said the push for law change should not be hijacked by individuals keen on resurrecting their political lives, a jibe viewed as directed to Raila. But according to Kamket, there is nothing wrong with creating positions, if that is what it will take to hold the country together “There are some sections in that Constitution that are completely unnecessarily and that is why we fight every five years when we go to elections,” he said. On Saturday, the 14-member Building Bridges team unveiled a road map for collecting public views, setting stage for a possible law change. The team led by Garissa senator Yusuf Haji and university don Adams Aloo will hit the ground from next week. Click here for
