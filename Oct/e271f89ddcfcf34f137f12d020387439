The family of a Mnagoni Primary School pupil who died last month after allegedly being caned by his teacher must wait for a second post-mortem. Mohamed Juma’s teacher, David Katama, allegedly beat the Standard 2 pupil on the back and buttocks on September 13. The pupil died on September 20. On September 21, the teacher appeared in a Kilifi court and the prosecution was given 14 days to detain him until October 4. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Kilifi on Thursday criticised a post-mortem performed on September 24 at Kilifi County Hospital. The DPP and Director of Criminal Investigations have expressed concerns over how the autopsy was carried out and asked for a second opinion. The body of Juma, 14, is at the hospital mortuary after the prosecution team recommended a second opinion and a post-mortem performed by a government pathologist. A source at the Kilifi county hospital said the post-mortem was conducted ‘via the phone’. “The pathologist did not come for the post-mortem but doctors at the county hospital did it with the pathologist telling them what to do on the phone,” the source, who sought anonymity, said. Kilifi county DCI chief Said Mohammed on Thursday confirmed he had written to Chief Government Pathologist Johansen Oduor to provide a pathologist to carry out a second post-mortem on the boy. The DCI chief said the family is not satisfied with the first post-mortem.â€‹ Mohamed said they will ask for more time to hold the teacher to allow for another post-mortem. DIDN’T DIE FROM CANING Kilifi Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Vincent Monda said they had requested another autopsy. But speaking in his office, Kilifi county medical superintendent Eddy Nzomo on Thursday said he does not know why police wanted a second opinion while the exercise was done by a qualified doctor.â€‹ Nzomo said the exercise was done by a Mombasa-based pathologist and it was established the pupil had lung problems, which led to asphyxiation —death by air deprivation. He said the brain was not receiving sufficient oxygen.â€‹ “The skull was intact but the lungs were swollen. There was no sign the child was beaten. The specimen was taken for further investigations at the Government Chemist,” he said.â€‹ Nzomo criticised police for having a “fixed mind’ on the cause of the pupil’s death.â€‹ “They came with their minds made up and that is why they did not agree with us,” he said. “We are open and we told them to come with their own pathologist if they are not contented with how the doctor conducted the post-mortem.” Ganze subcounty children’s officer Daniel Mbogo said the boy’s parents were reluctant to report the caning to police because the teacher had agreed to pay for treatment. They were ready to settle the matter with the teacher, the children’s officer said.
