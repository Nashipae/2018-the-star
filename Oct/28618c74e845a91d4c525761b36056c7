Good Morning. It is a public holiday in Kenya as Kenyans mark the now almost forgotten Moi Day which was first marked in 1989 to commemorate 10 years of retired President Daniel Arap Moi's rule. Since the promulgation of the 2010 Constitution, the day stopped being a public holiday but was reinstated by the High Court last year. Moi Day was previously marked as a state function but in the year 2000, two years before his retirement, Moi declared the day a private dedication to the less fortunate. Weather forecast shows that most parts of the country continue to be wet with skies expected to be gloomy in Nairobi, rains in the Rift Valley and Central Kenya, showers at the Coast and thunderstoms in Western Kenya. The weatherman has indicated that most parts of the country will likely experience above average rainfall from this week as the short rains season kicks off. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this Monday. WATCH Why Raila struggled, narrowly won Migori Deputy President William Ruto on Tuesday accused the ODM party of “hate-filled obsession" with him amid claims that he had a hand in the just concluded Migori by-election. Through his spokesman David Mugonyi, Ruto said he did not understand why the party and its leaders were dragging his name into everything. He said the “the anti-Ruto spectacle in ODM is evidence of failure of reason and perspective". “ODM has been driven by a consuming, hate-filled obsession with the Deputy President. They cannot understand it,” he said, adding that as a result, they have let their “worst impulses impel them from one terrible decision to another.” Ruto was reacting to claims by ODM leaders that Eddy Okech, the political novice who narrowly lost the to Ochilo Ayacko in the Migori by-election was his ‘project’. _____________________________________________________ Mwilu not immune from criminal trial, ODPP says as it seeks clarifications The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions on Tuesday said there is no immunity available to Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu since the charges facing her question her conduct as a state officer.
