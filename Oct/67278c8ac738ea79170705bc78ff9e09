How much does it cost to paint 10 schools? Sh40 million? The Kirinyata Central CDF has spent that much, Sh40 million, in repainting classrooms in 10 schools, causing public outrage. Area MP Munene Wambugu yesterday said much of the constituency development money will go to education. Wambugu spoke at Gakoigo Primary School where he officiated at the handing over of the school after the repainting works. “I’m here because my parents took me to school. We should support these children to learn in a good and clean environment,” he said. Resident Jackson Kimani said the MP has misplaced priorities and instead of using the money to repaint the schools he should have done renovations. “A total of Sh40 million is a huge sum of money. It should have been used to upgrade classrooms, but how do you use such an amount to repaint?” Kimani asked. Wambugu, who was on Sunday shouted down at the Kerugoya Catholic church, defended his track record, saying he is not unpopular in the constituency. “You did not elect me to fool around and to make unnecessary noise but to spur development,” he said On the push for a referendum, Wambugu said he is opposed to the move. He said Opposition leader Raila Odinga is out to distract and derail Jubilee from concentrating with its development agenda. Wambugu said Kirinyaga will only supportitif it will ease the burden on Kenyans.
