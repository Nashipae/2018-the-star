Kenya Union of Post Primary Teachers (KUPPET) boss Omboko Milemba on Saturday dismissed claims by KNEC Chairman George Magoha that some teachers are planning to assist candidates to cheat in the national examinations. Milembe termed said the allegations by Magoha are false and not backed by any evidence. “Let Magoha come with tangible and incriminating evidence that could lead to the arrest of such teachers," Milemba said. Last week, Magoha said some teachers were asking for Sh10,000 from parents to assist their children to cheat. He said schools involved in examination irregularities will be closed down and managers held liable. The KNEC boss said the council has delegated the responsibility of exams integrity to principals to reduce the number of people handling test papers. He said the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) and Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exams will begin on October 30 October and November 2, respectively. Addressing members at Anglican Church Conference Centre in Kericho, Milemba defended teachers, saying they are ready to ensure the examinations meet integrity standards. Milemba was the chief guest during Kericho KUPET branch Annual General Meeting. He was accompanied by national vice chairman Julius Korir, Bomet Central MP Julius Tanui and Kericho branch executive secretary Julius Mibei. “Magoha should be busy preparing new examination centres for affected candidates in Narok South where schools were destroyed during the eviction of families allegedly to have encroached into Mau forest,” Milemba said.
