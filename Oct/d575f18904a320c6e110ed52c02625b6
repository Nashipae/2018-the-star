UN Ambassador Nikki Haley has resigned, a person familiar with the situation said on Tuesday, and the White House said she would appear with President Donald Trump at an event later in the morning. Trump said on Tuesday he has accepted Haley's resignation adding that the official will be leaving at the end of the year. He said Haley, who was South Carolina governor when she was tapped for the UN position, told him six months ago that she wanted to take some time off. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, he praised her as having done an incredible job and said he hoped she could come back to the administration in another capacity. It was not immediately clear why Haley quit. The US president earlier wrote on Twitter that there would be a "Big announcement with my friend Ambassador Nikki Haley in the Oval Office" on Tuesday morning. Haley is the latest in a long list of senior staff members to leave the Trump administration, including former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson who was fired in March. Haley, who has been one of Trump's most trusted advisers, would not confirm the report to Reuters when asked about it during a visit to the White House on Tuesday. Earlier this year, Haley, 46, told Reuters that, "Every day I feel like I put body armor on," to protect US interests at the United Nations. Haley was governor of South Carolina when she was tapped by Trump to be the US envoy to the United Nations. Elected as the state's first female governor in 2010, she was in her second four-year term when Trump picked her. Click here for the latest political news
