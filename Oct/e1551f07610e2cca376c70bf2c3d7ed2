Jacque Maribe’s fiance Jowie walked around with a concealed weapon, Word Is has established. Jowie, a suspect in the murder of businesswoman Monica Kimani, is known for his love of guns and has posted several photos in full military gear. Numerous media reports claim that Jowie, real name Joseph Irungu, was a trained security expert and had worked in that field in Afganistan. His love for guns also birthed his love for other weapons that can easily be concealed, such as the Para Claw. This self-defence accessory goes for less than a mere Sh200 and is worn on the wrist. Jowie had it on during his much-publicised proposal to Maribe. He is also spotted with it in a very secure venue, the Citizen TV studios.
