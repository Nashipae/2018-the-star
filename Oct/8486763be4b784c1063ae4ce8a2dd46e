Power couple Janet Mbugua and Eddie Ndichu welcomed their secondborn child last month. The classy couple, whose love life always leave many green with envy, gave their son a unique name, just like the firstborn's. Janet is doing fine. Her husband has shared a first pic of her a few weeks after giving birth, and she looks gorgeous. He said soon his wife will document her motherhood journey on her vlog as she has always done, and hinted that they might be having more children. He captioned the photo: "#WCE Thanking God for bringing back her health and cute goofy self. I guess she will tell you her journey at some point, as she always does. #MamaBoys #MamaHandM #MamaHUMA P.S. I think we should keep having babies to grow her hair and sell it!" The Ndichus are a perfect match made in heaven, and it seems they're here to fulfil God's word to man in Genesis 1:28: Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it."
