Baringo leaders have said those responsible for delaying maize farmers’ pay should be investigated and held responsible. Addressing different functions on Saturday, the leaders led by Baringo Central MP Joshua Kandie and his Baringo North counterpart William Cheptumo said it is immoral for Rift Valley farmers to keep on asking for their unpaid dues running into billions. “Goat farmers in Baringo almost incurred similar challenge initially before the clients embarked on paying in cash after a media exposé,” Kandie said. He spoke while issuing a Sh5 million cheque for the construction of a social hall at AIC Visa-Oshwal Primary School in Kabarnet town.
