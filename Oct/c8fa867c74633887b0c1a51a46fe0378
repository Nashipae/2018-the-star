Good Morning. A Nigerian family is seeking justice over the mysterious murder of their son a fortnight ago allegedly by police at Fourways Junction Estate in Nairobi. Baniyo Ashade, 28, was killed on October 15 by the officers after raiding the house he was living in with two Nigerian friends in the ongoing state crackdown on illegal migrants. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this Monday morning.

In one month, police have carried out 14 extrajudicial killings in Dandora alone, according to a local human rights organization, Dandora Justice Centre.

The proposal was also being crafted as a lifeline for remaining in power by politicians wary of the political future of the central Kenya region after Uhuru’s exit. _____________________________________________________ Court feeezes Lilian Omollo's accounts The court on Tuesday barred former Public Service PS Lilian Omollo from accessing any money from her accounts.
