Truecaller has added a new feature on its platform to help prevent the circulation of fake news. The service was launched to shield against viral messages sent on its instant messaging platform. Truecaller's Sub-Saharan Africa director of partnerships Zakaria Hersi said, "Our IM service will help our users connect and also collaborate to combat the issue of spam." "'Truecaller Chat’ is bundled with interesting features such as, auto-switch between SMS and Chat, which will help users keep conversations in one place."
