On Thursday, Raila said he has received many calls to stand with Obado, but justice should take its course. "So far all indicators are pointing at Obado, let him prove his innocence in court," Raila said. Raila said the murder of a pregnant woman together with her unborn child can be termed as an act of witchcraft.

Inside story of Pumwani Hospital troubles It is the single largest maternity hospital in East and Central Africa, yet Pumwani, the health facility where President Uhuru Kenyatta was born 56 years ago,  remains neglected. Founded in 1926 by a charitable organization called Lady Grigg Welfare League, it was named Lady Grigg Maternity before it was rebranded to Pumwani in 1928, when the first permanent building was put up at the facility. Later on, according to history of the hospital, some extensions were made to give it a bed capacity of 27, and in 1944, it was taken over by the now-defunct Nairobi Municipal Council. Despite the negative publicity about Pumwani, as a one-stop shop for booming baby business, it has remained the pioneer in the provision of maternity care in sub-Saharan Africa. _____________________________________________________ Calls for referendum splits Uhuru's Jubilee in Parliament A sharp division within President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Jubilee party over the push for a referendum to amend the Constitution has escalated and spilt over to Parliament.

A number of Jubilee lawmakers have thrown their weight behind the referendum push, a matter that has prompted Majority Leader Aden Duale to provide a clear stance of the party. _____________________________________________________ Clearing Eurobond debts set to get tougher - WB Kenya is among 14 sub-Saharan countries that will struggle to pay their loans post-2021, World Bank has said.
