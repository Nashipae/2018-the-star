ODM leader Raila Odinga has said he will not support Migori governor Okoth Obado in the murder case against Rongo University student Sharon Otieno. He said he has received many calls to stand with Obado, but justice should take its course. "So far all indicators are pointing at Obado, let him prove his innocence in court," Raila said. Raila said the murder of a pregnant woman together with her unborn child can be termed as an act of witchcraft. Obado is admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital after he reportedly fell sick while in remand at the Industrial Area Prison. "It was unfortunate that a very young woman and her angel were murdered brutally. If the killers didn't need the child or the mother they should have spared their lives," Raila said. The former Prime Minister said according to the Luo culture such an act is in bad faith and would bring a bad omen. He was speaking at Awendo bus park on Thursday during a stopover in a two-day campaign for party candidate Ochillo Ayacko ahead of the October 8 Migori Senate by-election. Siaya governor Cornel Rasanga invited him to speak to the crowd. Rasanga said sticking with Raila is the right thing to do. "When I was in Canada on an errand for Raila, I received news that I was to be arrested at the airport, after calling Baba things were cleared and I majestically walked past in the airport," Rasanga said. Although he did not name Obado directly, Rasanga said his predicament was mirrored by what Obado is going through. Obado publicly fell out with ODM after the party gave a direct nomination to former Cabinet minister Ayacko. The governor refused to support Ayacko. Obado has denied murdering Sharon. The student was abducted and subsequently killed on September 4. The governor returns to the High Court on October 8 for a fresh hearing of his bail application.
