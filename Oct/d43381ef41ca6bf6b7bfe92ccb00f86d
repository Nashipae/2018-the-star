A family in Shinyalu, Kakamega, has every reason to be grateful after two sisters survived the Kericho bus tragedy. Susan Misee, 36, and Linda Misee, 27, were heading for their grandmother’s burial in Burimbuli village. Their father, Alphonce Misee, said the two were expected home at about 8am yesterday, only to get a call from a good Samaritan at around 4am telling him his daughters were involved in a grisly road accident in Kericho. “I got a call from an unknown number. A woman asked me if I knew Linda and when I said yes, she informed me that she had been involved in an accident and that she had a broken limb.

Their sister-in-law Daisy, younger sister Diana and a brother, David, who were also travelling from Mombasa for the funeral, said they were in constant communication throughout the journey and they last talked to Susan when they were in Nakuru. “We kept communicating after every town just to know where my sisters-in-law had reached, but some two hours after we left Nakuru, we got a call from our my mother-in-law informing us that Susan and Linda had been involved in a tragic accident near Kericho,” Daisy said. The father said he is grateful to God for saving his two daughters. “Although my daughters have been seriously injured, I thank God for saving their lives and I want to sincerely send my heartfelt condolences to those who lost their dear ones,” he said.
