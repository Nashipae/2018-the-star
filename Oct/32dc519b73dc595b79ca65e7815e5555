The much hyped merger between ANC and Ford Kenya parties may have run into headwinds. The merger was supposed to culminate in a single political vehicle that would bring the Luhya bloc in one basket in 2022. However, ANC’s Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetang’ula seemed to read from different scripts yesterday, an indication that the merger could have stalled. Speaking during the joint requiem mass for 34 victims of the Fort Ternan bus crash at Amalemba grounds, Wetang’ula sought to assure supporters that the merger was on course. “Just Just give us a little time and we shall give you the answer that will satisfy you. An answer that you have been waiting for,” he said. But Mudavadi, who spoke after him, said the unity of the Luhya community was critical and leaders must remain steadfast. “I am happy that Wetang’ula has said the merger is on course. I want to remind him and he knows that Ruto [Deputy President William] is a competitor,” he said. “We cannot organise ourselves and unite and go to a competitor. What type of science is this? I have spoken,” he said. Former Kakamega senator Boni Khalwale had earlier said that he had united the two [Mudavadi and Wetang’ula].
