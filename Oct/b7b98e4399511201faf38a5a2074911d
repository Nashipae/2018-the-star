Kisumu speaker Onyango Oloo has defended himself against the claims of micro-managing the assembly. The MCAs have accused Oloo of single-handedly running the affairs of the assembly. MCAs said this has undermined legislation and the oversight roles of the assembly. They also accused Oloo of ‘deliberate’ delays in tabling the assembly’s financial report since they were sworn-in office last year. Oloo denied any wrongdoing, saying that what transpired in the assembly last week was a result of themounting differences in the last failed impeachment plot.
