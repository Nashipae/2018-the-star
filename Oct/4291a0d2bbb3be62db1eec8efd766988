Elders from Garissa have been urged to lead in promoting peace. In the recent past, there has been tension between supporters of Governor Ali Korane and National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale. Supporters of Korane have been accusing Duale of working to destabilise the administration. Both Duale and Korane have denied any rivalry. On Monday Woman Representative Anab Gure said elders have an integral role to play in ensuring peace prevails. She had visited Sultan Dekhow Maalim of the Abduwak clan. Two weeks ago Dekhow called a meeting between the leaders to end tension and a possible violence. Gure said the era of dividing residents along religious, tribal and clan lines is long-gone. “There are many more things that unite us than those that divide us. That is what we should focus on,” she said.
