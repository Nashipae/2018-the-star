Residents of Nyamira are furious over the frequent foreign trips by MCAs at a time when the county has a financial crisis. The Controller of Budget rejected the county's 2018/19 budget after detecting anomalies. Residents have petitioned the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate the source of the funds for the trips. They said the trips are a wastage of public resources because similar visits have been made in the past, but they have not benefited people. Locals accused MCAs of failing in their oversight role by protecting people implicated in corruption. An official, who sought anonymity, however, said the foreign trips are attended by specific individuals. Resident Peter Magare said the trips are not factored in the budget and he questioned the sources of the funds. He appealed to the government to ban such trips. Magare said they promote corruption because MCAs are compromised by wrongdoers. Residents criticised an MCAs' trip to Singapore that is underway, and another planned for Israel next week. A source claimed the trips are sponsored by contractors after being given favours in tenders and procurement. Click here for the latest political news
