Two bridges which were swept away by floodwaters in Magarini constituency will be constructed at Sh80 million before the year ends. The Shakahola and Bombi bridges, which are 15 kilometres apart, were destroyed after River Galana broke its banks following heavy rains in April. Public Works PS Paul Maringa said at the site on Monday that engineers are expected to complete the bridges' design in two weeks. He was accompanied by Magarini MP Michael Kingi and area MCA Stanley Kenga. Maringa said the works will go a long way in saving locals from the deadly crocodiles and hippos in river Galana. Locals, including school children, have to wade through the river, a situation that has poses risk of attacks by crocodiles and hippos. "We shall look for funds within the shortest time possible as the situation here needs urgent intervention," the PS said. Last month, Deputy president William Ruto commissioned works on a Sh2.3 billion connecting Langobaya and Baricho. Click here for the latest political news
