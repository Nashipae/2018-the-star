Kenya’s only ice hockey Ice Lions is over the moon after landing a chance of a lifetime to play in Canada. The team's trip was sponsored by Tim Hortons - one of North America's largest restaurant chains. Canada is considered the home of the sport and the Kenyans were excited to play against professionals. They finally faced real opponents - the Mississauga Firefighters - having previously competed among themselves. In a video seen by the Star, the players were given personalised jerseys and new equipment upon arrival. Pittsburgh Penguins' Sidney Crosby and Nathan MacKinnon of the Colorado Avalanche were also on the surprise menu for the Kenyan team. In the video, Kenya's captain Ben Azegere says the team broke new ground by trying a new sport game. "When you are in the ring, the world stops. Nothing else really matters. Canada is famed as the home of hockey. We longed to come here," he said. With tears in his eyes Azegere said, "Seeing our jerseys hanging all over was amazing. When they gave us our branded gear it felt like heaven. It was such an honour for Canada to host us". Azegere said, "The trip is life changing and great motivation for the team," he said. While at home, the team practices twice a week at a 1,400-square metre rink at the Panari Hotel in Nairobi. The rink is rectangular and has no boards. The team is now excited to have equipment. Previously, many players wore soccer shin pads, sofa cushions or nothing at all to protect themselves. "When we first started playing, we didn't have full equipment. But now we do. We've also played a real game with an all-star team," Azegere said. Colorado Avalanche's MacKinnon said it was a good experience to play Lions, and it will not be their last. "The team's genuine passion and excitement for hockey is contagious, they were amazing teammates and it was great to play with them," he said. Click here for the latest political news
