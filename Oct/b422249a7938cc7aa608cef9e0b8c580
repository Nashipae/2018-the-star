The government has been asked to fairly compensate residents to be relocated to make way for the Malaba Water Supply and Sanitation Project. Busia Water executive Isaac Alukwe on Thursday said compensation must be satisfactory in order to avoid resistance. “We need to be very careful on how we handle land compensation. We are calling for fairness, otherwise, the idea might not get full support of residents,” Walukwe said. He was addressing project implementers in his office. They include the Rift Valley Water Services Board. The African Development Bank, which is one of the sponsor of the project, has donated Sh1.3 billion for phase one of the inter-county project.
