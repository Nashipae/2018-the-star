Nine houses in Kaminjeiwa village, Bomet Central, were yesterday torched on suspicion of being illicit alcohol dens. Residents then protested against the murder of a 29-year-old man. The man was stabbed to death after a fight broke out between two others on a drinking spree on Saturday night. The torched houses belonged to members of one family who fled from the scene. Witness Patrick Koskei said the victim was trying to separate the two who were fighting and ended up being killed. “The two who were enjoying their drinks inside the house engaged in an argument. They took it outside the house at around 8pm, where a fist fight started,” he said. “As the fighting continued and it became apparent that the one being targeted in the brawl would be overpowered, a brother emerged and stabbed the one who was trying to separate the duo.” Bomet county police commander Naomi Ichami confirmed the incident and said detectives have launched a manhunt for the suspect. “We would like to appeal to members of the public not to overreact when such incidences occur,” she said.
