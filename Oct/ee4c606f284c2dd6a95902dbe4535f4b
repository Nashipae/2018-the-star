The KCSE exam starts today with practicals. In total, 1.7 million candidates will sit the KCSE and KCPE tests. Some 1,060,703 pupils will sit the KCPE exam in 27,161 centres; 664,585 candidates will sit the KCSE in 10,077 centres. KCPE exams will begin on October 30 and KCSE theory on November 5. In past three years, the government has put in place significant measures to check the widespread cheating that had greatly undermined the exams' integrity. Cartels were slowly taking charge and huge sums were changing hands. Measures by ministries of the Interior and Education should be commended. Extra security measures are rightly being taken to ensure the safety of candidates in areas affected by inter-communal conflicts and in the Northeast, which has been prone to terror attacks. The government should ensure, however, that candidates do not feel intimidated or frightened by the heavy deployment of officers tasked to ensure their security. A frightened candidate can easily perform poorly. The government's planning should also actor in the expected heavy rains and quite possibly flooding that can delay and disrupt exams. The administration of these crucial exams should be smooth from beginning to end.
