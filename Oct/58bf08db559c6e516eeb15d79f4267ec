Two people in Embu county have tested positive for cholera. One patient is admitted at the Embu Level 5 Teaching and Referral Hospital in an isolation room. The other was treated and discharged on Wednesday. Embu Health executive Jamleck Muturi said the two men who tested positive come from Embakasi, Tassia, in Nairobi, where they consumed ‘mutura’ before they travelled to Embu. He said two other patients, a father and daughter from Runyenjes, are being treated for cholera-like symptoms. The executive said the father and daughter are being treated at Kyeni Mission Hospital and Runyenjes Hospital, respectively. Muturi said medics are waiting for the tests of samples from the patients to ascertain if they have cholera. He said the health department is on high alert to prevent spread of the disease. Muturi urged residents to practice good hygiene, boil drinking water and wash their hands after using the toilet. He said public health departments officers have been instructed to inspect all eateries to ensure the food is clean and safe. Muturi said there will be a crackdown on food hawking. He said the county government on Wednesday organised a free medical camp at Embu Municipal stadium to educate residents about cholera and offer free treatment for other illnesses.
