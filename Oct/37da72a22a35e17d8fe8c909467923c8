A woman who was handed a 15-year-jail term for defiling a boy, 16, in Kicomi, Kisumu,will wait two weeks for the hearing of her appeal. High Court judge Fred Ochieng on Thursday granted the accused and the prosecutor two weeks to file written submissions for the hearing to proceed. This was after the appellantâ€™s lawyer, Bruce Odeny, requested the appeal to be prosecuted through written submissions. Judith Wandera 24, had appealed against the judgment delivered on May 23 by principal magistrate Joan Wambilyanga. She argued the wrong principles were used to arrive at the ruling.
