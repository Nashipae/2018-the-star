Bahati MP Ngunjiri Kimani yesterday challenged his colleagues from Mt Kenya to publicly declare their support for Deputy President William Ruto for president in 2022. Ngujiri said the MPs were hypocritical on their support Ruto. “In the presence of Ruto, they claim to be his staunch defenders but in his absence they avoid talk of his presidency. They should stop this hypocrisy and stick to one position,” Ngunjiri.

Mt Kenya MPs on Monday met in Naivasha over President Uhuru Kenyatta’s political future. Ngunjiri said they avoided talk of Ruto succeeding Uhuru. The more than 70 MPs instead talked about development in the region. They said the government has sidelined MT Kenya. Ngunjiri said Rift Valley has already settled on Ruto as their candidate in the 2022 presidential race. He told Mt Kenya MPs to let Uhuru retire when his final term ends. “Uhuru has publicly stated he will be retiring from politics after the end of his term. Mt Kenya leaders should not arm twist him to push for a third term in office,” Ngunjiri said. Click here for the latest political news
