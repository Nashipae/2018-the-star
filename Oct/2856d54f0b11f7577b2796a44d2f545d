The Ilmusakara community in Kajiado has declared support for Governor Joseph Lenku’s reelection. More than 2,500 members of the community said they will support and campaign for Lenku to retain the aseat in 2022. They met at the home of Moses Seet on Saturday. Their self-declared community kingpin and Kaputiei North MCA Joshua Olowuasa, who rallied the members support, said the declaration to support Lenku is historic for they have never supported any leader from outside their own. Olowuasa underscored the various projects Lenku has initiated in Kaputiei North ward. Ilmusakara community in Kajiado East is the most single populous group in the county. It has been contributing to 50 per cent of votes every election year in the past two decades, Olowuasa said. Interestingly, all elected Kajiado East constituency MCAs come from the Ilmusakara section of the Kaputiei. Sarah Lepatei, representing youthful women of the Kaputiei, told Lenku to provide them with opportunities for economic growth. Other residents who spoke included senior members of the community led by Philip Lemein, Samuel Lalaine, Ole Ketere, Timothy Tait and Alice Lesiamo. “What we need are not handouts from leaders. We need our children to get jobs and opportunities to progress their career,” Lemein said. Lenku said his wish is to have a united Kajiado. Click here for the latest political news
