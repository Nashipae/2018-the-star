NIC Bank has signed a Sh1.2 billion leasing agreement with the National Treasury for delivery of 400 Isuzu trucks, buses and double cabs for the national police service. The vehicles will be delivered by Isuzu East Africa. In a statement on Wednesday NIC director Alan Dodd said the vehicles are also to be used by Kenya Prisons. “This is NIC Bank’s first leasing agreement with the national government. Under the agreement, the Government will be paying rental for the vehicles on a quarterly basis,” Dodd said. He was speaking during the 13th edition of the annual Johari awards ceremony attended by over 400 dealers from 46 new motor vehicle and machinery dealerships, as well as many second-hand car dealers in Nairobi. Last month, the Police Service received 800 vehicles from Toyota Kenya under the Government’s pilot lease programme. The programme started in 2013 when the Government through the National Treasury awarded Toyota Kenya the tender.
