Terminal Two of the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport will be closed from 5:30 to 9pm on Thursday. Kenya Airports Authority did not give a reason for the closure but it is likely to do with the arrival of US First Lady Melania Trump. The First Lady's itinerary has not been made public, ostensibly for security reasons. She is expected in Kenya anytime. Melania began her first solo African tour in Ghana and arrived in Malawi shortly after 2pm. She is also scheduled to visit Egypt. In a notice seen by the Star, KAA said the terminal will also be closed on October 6 from midnight to 9am the next day. "During this time, all domestic flight operations handled at terminal two will be handled at JKIA terminal 1D," the authority said. Terminal 1E will be used for international arrivals while Terminal 1B will be international departures. "PassengersÂ are advised to arrive at least three hours before departure time to allow enough time for airport security checks," KAA added. President Donald Trump has not visited Africa since taking office in 2017. Click here for the latest political news
