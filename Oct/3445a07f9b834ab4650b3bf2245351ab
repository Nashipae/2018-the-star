Former Nairobi governor Evans Kidero has identified 58 properties he acquired before becoming county boss that he wants anti-graft detectives barred from investigating. Kidero, in a new notice of motion, says the properties were acquired before 2013 and as such, it cannot be subject to EACC investigations. They are all developed. For instance, he says he bought Gem Apartments in 2011. Further, Kidero wants detectives be barred from probing apartment Number A7, LR number 991/13, and apartment Number B6, LR Number 991/17, arguing he bought them in 1995. Kidero also wants a property situated on Gigiri Road, LR Number 7258/48, not to be probed, as he acquired it 2002. He also wants block 91/156 also in Gigiri sparred from the ongoing investigations, saying he bought it 1991. In Karen, Kidero wants a property on Ndege Road spared as he acquired it in 2007. The former governor further wants flats in Nairobi Dam (LR 209/9841), which he acquired in 2004 exempted from the probe. He also wants a maisonette he got in 1987 near Nairobi dam sparred. The former county boss, who has described himself as a “man of decent means”, also wants two houses in Nyari LR No. 12241/29 and LR No. 12241/31 not to be investigated, since he bought the two properties in 998 and 1995 respectively. Kidero further wants detectives to spare plot 91 LR No. 420/191, LR No.10419/17 and 10419/18, which he acquired them in 2009 and 2010 respectively. The former governor also wants two apartments called Gem sparred. He says that he acquired them 2007 and 2006 respectively. Kidero says his Muthaiga's residential home that he jointly owns with his wife Susan was bought in 2010. Kidero said 16 properties in Korando should not be probed as he bought them 2008. He further wants five properties in Kogony not investigated saying he acquired 2008. Kidero also has five properties in Homabay County. Kidero whose lawyer Tom Ojienda describes “as a classic example of a worker bee,” accuses EACC for overstating the value of properties. He attributes it to "malice and abuse of power by EACC." Through Ojienda, Kidero says EACC's action and conduct has caused distress,havoc and panic amongst tenants,occupants and patrons of all properties and establishments on the properties Kidero is a shareholder or director. He says there is eminent danger that the tenants,occupants and patrons will vacate the properties or avoid the establishments for fear of harassment. "The second respondent's action and conduct amounts to economic sabotage against the first petitioner and is intended to cripple him financially,"Ojienda says.
