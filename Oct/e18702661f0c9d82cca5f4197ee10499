Award-winning gospel singer Papa Dennis has released a new song titled Umeniwasha, featuring former Miss Turkana 2014. It's a love song about a young man who's struck by a woman's beauty. The Nashukuru hitmaker has produced two love songs, leaving many speculating that he had ditched the gospel industry. He has always defended himself, saying: "I'm still a gospel singer. Ignore the rumours that I've switched to secular. A love song is neither secular nor gospel. It's just about love." The artiste, who is signed under Sadat Muhindi's Maliza Umaskinis foundation, has been nominated for this year's Afrimma Awards in the best Gospel Act in Africa category, and is hopeful that he will bring home the trophy. His manager Cannam Vusha told Word Is: "I'm calling on East Africans to rally behind Dennis. Let's support him by voting in large numbers. My prayer is that we bring the award home." She urged artistes to produce quality music "so that you don't give promoters a hard time. Get a mentor who will encourage you, guide you. And to gospel artistes, work closely with the church leadership. Have a spiritual mother and father who will always guide you. Also participate in church activities."
