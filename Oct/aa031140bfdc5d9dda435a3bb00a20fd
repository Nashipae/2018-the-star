Garissa governor Ali Korane has warned against the “monkey business” of recruiting relatives and cronies to the Kazi Mashinani programme intended to employ 900 needy youths. Speaking in Garissa town on Monday, the governor asked those charged with implementation of the programme to be honest and transparent by ensuring that only deserving youth are recruited. “It will defeat the entire purpose of engaging the poorest of the poorest within our midst if we use it to employ our relatives, friends among others,” Korane said. Korane appointed former Garissa county council chairman Dubat Amey to chair the program that he said will address unemployment among the poor at the subcounty level. Korane however expressed optimism that the exercise will succeedbecause the chair, who is living with disability, understands the community’s needs and has a long standing record of public service. Each of the seven subcounties will get 100 slots, except Garissa Township. “I will personally take a lot of interest and closely monitor the programme to ensure that no monkey business takes place. But most important is that the responsibility lies with the chair,” he added. Amey promised to deliver and urged for support from subcounty programme heads. Korane suspended the programme in last October claiming it not only lacked the legal framework to formalize its operations but had no budget. The suspension triggered street protests by workers. Former governor Nathif Jama accused Korane of targeting the less fortunate in the community.
