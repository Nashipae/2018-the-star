Prominent Eldoret farmer Jackson Kibor has been caught up in yet another row after he was yesterday accused of eloping with the wife of a 38-year old man in Uasin Gishu. Isaac Kosgey recorded a statement with the police in Eldoret, saying Kibor eloped with his wife of 17 years. The woman, identified as Mercy Sultan aged 30 went missing with her two children two weeks, Kosgey said. Kibor denied the allegation but admitted that he knows the woman. Kosgey who works at Equator Flower Farm said he believes Kibor has been having an affair with his wife and that Kibor often gave her rides in his (Kibor’s) car. “Kibor’s relationship with my wife started two months ago and I suspect they met at her work place,” Kosgey said. Sultan works at a herbal medicine shop where Kibor is a frequent customer. Kibor, 86, said his age could not allow him to elope with someone’s wife and that he did not know the whereabouts of the woman. “Yes I know her and I once gave her a lift just like any other friends whom I know,” Kibor told the Star on the phone. Kibor has four wives. He told Kosgey to stop tarnishing his name. “I even don’t know him in the first place. He should stop making such claims. Let him search for his wife and children,” Kibor said. Kibor said he gave Mercy a ride because it was raining. “I carried her in my car once and we were many people heading in the same direction,” he said. Kosgey said his wife had lately refused to be dropped at her work place by their motorcycle as was the case. “She suddenly told me my services were no longer needed,” Kosgey said. He asked Kibor to return the children, two girls aged 12 and 6 saying they have missed school since they disappeared.
