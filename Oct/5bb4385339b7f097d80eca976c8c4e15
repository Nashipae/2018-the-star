The Council of Governors has insisted that the recently formed regional economic blocs will have a positive impact on growth ( see P9). Nevertheless, they carry considerable political risks. The benefits of regional coordination are obvious. For instance, one county hospital could have cancer treatment facilities and another could have a specialist paediatric centre. The REBs could avoid unnecessary duplication in the provision of services. The REBs could also coordinate county activities in transport, agriculture, tourism, and power distribution. Their is risk, however, if the REBs start becoming aggressively competitive with each other. Kenya is already a fragmented nation with intense political rivalry between the Coast, Central, Rift Valley, Western and Nyanza. The REBs will create a third level of power between the counties and central government. Potentially Kenya could shift towards a federal system. Would that make Kenya more or less harmonious? Would the REBs exclude outsiders from employment and procurement? A commission to analyse the implications of REBs should be set up before they are recognised by law and supported by government.
