A man has been charged for fraudulently obtaining Sh1.4 million from a nurse to allegedly secure her admission to a Canadian college. Adams Mambeya denied the charge before Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi. The Kijabe hospital nurse Margaret Mutiso said the suspect obtained money from her in a span of three years. She said Mambeya had posted on social media that he was capable of securing admission to Canadian colleges which preceded a job opportunity. She chose Omni College and was advised to pay Sh100, 000 for fees before being admitted and given a Visa. Mutiso paid Sh50, 000 and continued paying different amounts until August 3. The suspect was released on a Sh500,000 bond with a surety of similar amount or an alternative cash bail of Sh300, 000. The hearing of the matter starts on November 20.
