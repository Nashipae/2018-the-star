The anti-corruption agency has criticised Kisumu County Assembly over poor implementation of legislated laws, policies and regulations. A report by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) on Corruption Risk Assessment (CRA) released last week shows the county is not implementing the policies passed the assembly. The assembly’s implementation committee was yet to report on the status of laws and oversight decisions made by the current and the previous county assembly. In its recommendation, the commission told the assembly speaker and the clerk to put to task the implementation committee on the same. They noted that the committee should effectively follow up and implement laws and regulations once they are made. “We noticed that this is a weakness that may stifle the oversight role of the assembly and result to inefficiencies in the operations of the county government,” EACC Vice-chairperson Sophia Lepuchirit said. This comes following an outcry by a section of the MCAs over failure to implement some of the crucial laws approved by the house. Railways Ward MCA David Arao had raised concern and sought to know the number of motions that have been approved by the current assembly since inception and implemented by the executive. Arao said there is need to take the work of the assembly seriously. “There is a tendency of motions adopted by this assembly not being implemented and this is discouraging members on their legislative work,” he said. Manyatta B MCA Pamela Odhiambo observed that most of the approved laws are stalled at the assembly’s various committees. Kolwa East MCA Steve Owiti said that several motions passed and adopted in the house were crucial for the count’sprogress as they could be converted into bills and eventually enacted but they are yet to be implemented.
