The murder case against Migori Governor Okoth Obado, his PAs Michael Oyamo and Caspal Obiero have been consolidated. The three denied the two counts of murder of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno and her unborn child. The charges were read afresh on Monday. High court judge Jessie Lessit ordered the three remanded until Friday, October 12 when their bail application will be heard. The bail application was due to be heard on Monday but the judge indicated that the court was busy and issued a different date. Last Friday, Obado moved to court under a certificate of urgency seeking to have his bail application reviewed on grounds that he needs specialised medical attention. The governor has been in custody since September 21. Click here for the latest political news
