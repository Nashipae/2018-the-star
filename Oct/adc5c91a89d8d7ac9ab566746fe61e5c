The government is expected to pay Sh208.64 billion for domestic bonds maturing in the current financial year, National Treasury’s annual debt management report has shown. The report released on Tuesday shows total stock of Treasury bonds which include floating, fixed rate, special and zero coupon bonds increased by Sh179.46 billion from Sh1.33 trillion in June last year to Sh1.51 trillion in June 2018. Biggest gainers from maturity of the long-term debt facilities will be commercial banks which account for 52 per cent of the outstanding stock of Treasury bonds followed by pension funds (including the National Social Security Fund) at 33.2 per cent. Insurance firms and other retail investors account for 8.8 and six per cent of the total bond stock respectively. “Holdings by all holders increased in nominal terms but as a percentage of the total, pension funds increased to 33.2 per cent from 30.9 per cent while banks declined from 52 per cent from 54.4 per cent the previous fiscal year,” the report states. As at June 2018, Kenya’s total outstanding debt stood at Sh5.05 trillion with external and domestic debt standing at Sh2.57 trillion and Sh2.48 trillion respectively. Kenya has lately been flagged by global players including the World Bank and global ratings firm Moody’s over its poor debt management and inability to follow fiscal policies saying this may negatively impact the country’s ability to access financing moving forward. “Although on paper the Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy provides a framework for prudent debt management, it is not clear that it is being followed, considering the sovereign debt trajectory that has kept increasing at a sustained pace over the past years,” World Bank stated in a report titled Assessing Africa’s Policies and Institutions released last month. Government is also expected to pay off Sh97.71 billion for the five-year tranche of the Sh280 billion Eurobond issued in 2014. This was accounted for under the current budget as part of Sh194 billion principal payments for the tap-sale component of the 2014 sovereign bond, and two syndicated bonds. This year’s debt service is expected to reach Sh870.6 billion. In February, National Treasury announced raising Sh202 billion in a new sovereign bond issue, of 10 and 30 years in annual interest rate of 7.25 per cent and 8.25 per cent respectively. They are expected to mature in 2028 and 2048. In the six months to June, the government which sought to issue Treasury Bonds worth Sh240 billion has accepted bids worth Sh150.31 billion.
