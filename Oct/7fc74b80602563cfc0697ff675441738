Yesterday afternoon the Kenya Airways Dreamliner called ‘Magical Kenya’ landed in New York after a 15-hour non-stop flight. KQ is the seventh African airline to start direct flights to New York and the USA but it has the longest flight path of all them. This is the first direct flight from Nairobi to the USA. In the 1970s Pan Am used to fly to Nairobi twice a week from New York but landed to refuel in West Africa before continuing to East Africa. There are just about 15 scheduled flights in the world that are longer than KQ’s New York route. So this is a rare achievement for KQ. Hongera! But it can also be a game changer for Kenya. Aviation hub cities like Dubai provide a huge boost to their domestic economies. Emirates literally made Dubai. The plan for Kenya Airways to take over management of JKIA now seems to be on hold but their operations still need to be better integrated so that Nairobi continues expands as an aviation hub.
