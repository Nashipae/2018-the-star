Senegalese farmers are in the country to learn how to stock improved kuku kienyeji. The farmers are undergoing training at the Muguga-based Korea Project on International Agriculture (Kopia) in Limuru.Kopia director Choong-Hoe Kim yesterday said the research centre is well equipped to host trainees for a short course. The farmers, mostly from rural areas of Senegal, travelled with an interpreter because they neither speak English nor French which is the official language in the West African country. The interpreter, Couta Camara, said they only understand Wolof. “That has slowed down the learning because the Kenyan farmers are making presentations in English,” Camara said. A majority of Senegal’s 15 million people are farmers. The group that travelled to Kenya are expected to start poultry farming upon return. Most of them are women. ”Most of us are from rural areas where poverty is prevalent. We will acquire the skills to start kuku kienyeji rearing because the breed matures quickly,” team leader Mamadou Bocar said. The team yesterday toured the Mwea Irrigation Scheme in Kirinyaga. They found kuku kienyeji that matures early, has high meat volume and reliable egg production. Kim said farmers from nearby Karai and Ndeiya villages have benefited from the project, including those from Mbiyuni in Machakos county. “This project has economically empowered women through rearing the improved kuku kienyeji breed, which is in high demand. . A rooster retails at Sh1,500 and that is just six months after hatching,” Kim said. Extension officer Hameth Sadji said he accompanied the farmers to ensure whatever is learnt on the trip will be replicated back home. The farmers will return to Senegal next week with eggs for hatching.
