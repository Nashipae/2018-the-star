A Laikipia university student committed suicide in Gilgil town by hanging himself on Tuesday. The student reportedly bought a set of new clothes from one of the shops and wore them before leaving his set of old ones in a bag. Gilgil police Emmanuel Opuru said the student did not leave a suicide note. "We have opened an inquest file following the bizarre incident," he said. Gilgil residents, shocked by the incident, said the student had travelled from his home in Nyahururu only to commit the act. Cases of suicide have been commonplace in Kenya lately. Bestfriends, an NGO, in September said about 40 Kenyans seek help through suicide hotlines daily. The charity, which focuses on suicide prevention, said people with suicidal tendencies prefer making calls to sending emails and text messages. "Most of those who die by suicide suffer from depression and other mental health conditions," Befriends psychotherapist Hiram Chomba said. The World Population Review ranks Kenya at 114 among 175 countries with the highest suicide rates. The WHO global suicide data show that about 800,000 people die by suicide annually, translating to one person every 40 seconds.
