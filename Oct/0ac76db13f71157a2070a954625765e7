Isuzu East Africa has launched two high-capacity buses for the planned bus rapid transit system (BRT) in Nairobi. The buses have a speed limit of 60 kph and will ferry between 62 and 100 passengers. Isuzu said on its Twitter page on Tuesday that the buses are locally assembled and specifically designed for Kenya's BRT system. Matatu owners said they welcome the mass transit system. "This is the future of the transport industry, we have to evolve with time as the concept is good," association chairman Simon Kimutai said. He said the government should fast truck special lanes for such vehicles to reduce congestion. "We know the challenges facing the transport system in the country. The experience we have will see us best suited to implement it," Kimutai said. The MOA chair dismissed claims that the mass transit buses will be a threat to the smaller matatus. "We support BRT as it includes all public service vehicles and must start off with segregating lanes where private vehicles are restricted," Kimutai said. In April 2018, the government unveiled a plan for the Bus Rapid Transport System (BRTS) to ease traffic flow on major city roads. Already, Thika Road has a dedicated lane for public service vehicles (PSVs).
