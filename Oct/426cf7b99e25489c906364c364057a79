There were gunshots at the Kisumu county assembly after MCAs engaged a sergeant-at-arms in a fight. The chaos was occasioned by the adjournment of Tuesday sittings, which some members opposed. The ward representatives argued that temporary speaker Eric Agola adjourned the sittings illegally. Leader of Majority Kenneth Onyango said no motion was moved to that effect. George Amayo - the orderly, was forced to shoot in the air to scare the MCAs who were out to attack him. This was after he called police officers, ostensibly to help him restore peace at the assembly precincts. MCAs shouted at the officers forcing them to retreat to the sentry box at the assembly entrance.  /FAITH MATETE Members of the public, attracted by the commotion, also attempted to attack the sergeant-at-arms. The latter sought refuge at the security officers' room before he was forced to flee as the MCAs hurled stones at him. The Majority leader accused speaker Onyango Oloo of mismanaging the assembly and asked ODM to intervene. It is not the first time the county assembly, like many others across the country, is grabbing headlines for the wrong reasons. In June, the MCAs came to blows over claims of a plot to impeach Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o. This was amid claims some MCA had hired youths to accost the Majority leader at the county government offices.
