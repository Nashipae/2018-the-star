A 26-year-old Murang’a man has allegedly hacked to death his grandfather and great uncle. Kanyuko Wairimu from Kianderi village in Kahuro subcounty, Murang’a county, is said to have killed his grandfather Stephen Kanyuko and granduncle Ephraim Kamau. Kamau is Stephen’s elder brother. Wairimu lived in the same compound with his grandfather. Wairimu’s mother also suffered injuries as she tried to save her father-in-law and uncle-in-law during the Thursday night ordeal. The suspect is in custody at Kahuro police station and investigations are underway. Kahuro deputy county commissioner Wilberforce Kilonzo said he will be charged in court once they have gathered evidence. Neighbours said Wairimu walked into his grandfather’s house at midnight armed with a panga and attacked him. He then turned to his great uncle who had visited his brother and cut him several times in the head.

Kamau received first aid at Muriranjas Hospital and was referred to Kenyatta National Hospital. He died on the way. The bodies were taken to mortuary. Two relatives who tried to stop the suspect are also nursing injuries and were taken to Muriranjas Hospital. They were discharged. Wairimu fled and hid in the neighbourhood but was arrested on Friday morning. Kilonzo said they received calls from villagers and mounted a search that led to the arrest. Neighbour Peter Kago said the suspect had been using marijuana for a long time. He said the killings shocked the entire village. “Kanyuko [suspect] is a known bhang smoker and has tried to commit suicide twice,” Kago said. Kilonzo said the police recovered a weapon from the murder scene. He added, however, that they had yet to establish the motive behind the killings. Click here for the latest political news
