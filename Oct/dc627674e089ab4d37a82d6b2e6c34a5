Kajiado residents want police bosses in the town moved over runaway security. They held demonstrations on Friday to push for the transfers of the officers, singling out area OCS. The demonstration was led by local human rights activist Julius Moiko. They demanded that the OCS be removed from Kajiado for failing to subdue criminals that now rule the town. Activists toldÂ Kajiado county commissioner David Kipkemei that senior office has a tendency of arresting haphazardly. "Those arrested, some as early as 6pm, are asked to part with Sh5,000, failure to which they are charged with possession of hard drugs." Moiko further claimed that a number of the officers they want transferred engage in illegal charcoal businesses. "They sell charcoal confiscated at various roadblocks to hotels in Kajiado town," the activist said. Kipkemei promised to act on the OCS' case adding that he will not work with 'wayward' officers. Kajiado Central OCPD James Kimani told the Star on the phone that he has no official complaint against the OCS. "I am not aware of any complaint about insecurity in this town either," Kimani said.
