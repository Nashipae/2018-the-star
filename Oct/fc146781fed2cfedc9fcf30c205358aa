Cost of power for domestic and small commercial consumer has been reduced by two and five shillings Kilowatts per hour respectively. Energy Regulatory Commission director general Pavel Oimeke said the charge for domestic consumers will now retail at sh 10/KWh down from Sh12KWh. The charges are for consumers who spend 99 units and below within a specific period of time. Charges for 100 units and above have been maintained hence customers in this category will not have any changes in their current bill. This means that for every 99 units bought, consumers will be able to save slightly above Sh400,a move likely to affect Kenya Powers financial books. The new rates take effect today and will be applied until the end of the current financial year which ends in next June. Small consumers will now be charged Sh10 KW/h from Sh15 KW/h.
