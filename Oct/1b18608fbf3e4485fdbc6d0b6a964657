Deputy President William Ruto on Monday issued 12,000 title deeds to residents of three settlement schemes in Mbeere South constituency, Embu County. Ruto said issuance of title deeds remains key to solving the land problems across the country. Speaking in Kiritiri grounds, the Deputy President told residents of Wachoro, Riakina and Gichechie settlement schemes that this was part of the Government efforts to empower the youth. “We pledged to find a lasting solution to the land problem across the country and this is what we are doing. Residents here have been waiting for the titles since 1972,” Ruto said. “We are here because we have to solve land problems. This is our work as a government,” Ruto added Ruto said the government was committed to solving lands problems across the country. He said Jubilee promised Kenyans when it took over in 2013 that it will priorities issues pertaining to land, saying it will continue with the process of issuance of titles as the only way to solving the land problems. Present were MPs Geoffrey Kingangi (Mbeere South), John Muchiri (Manyatta), Charles Kanyi (Starehe), Cecily Mbarire (nominated), Jane Wanjiku (Women Rep, Embu), Njeru Ndwiga (Senator, Embu) and former MP Norman Nyaga The MPs said they would only support a referendum to amend the Constitution so long as it is aimed at reducing the country’s soaring wage bill.
