The National government is partnering with counties to support the Vocational Training Centers. Assistant director of vocational education and training James Onyango said the government is giving more than Sh39 million to each county for purchase of instructional materials for the institutions. Onyango said the initiative is meant to encourage youths to join the VTCs to acquire technical skills to enable them become employees. Onyango was speaking at the Kitale Vocational Training Centre in Mitume estate, Trans Nzoia county on Thursday. He was leading a training on monitoring and evaluation to empower managers of VTCs and board of management in the prudent utilisation of funds. If the funds are successfully utilised, Trans Nzoia County will qualify for another grant of Sh53 million from the national government. Onyango urged the government to develop structures in the VTCs. “If these institutions remain derelict, then the youths shy away from them. That is the reason why the number of trainees is still low,” he said. He also encouraged the youth to venture into skills training to improve their social economic welfare. “We also encourage parents to change their attitude towards skill training so that we move from the believe that skill training is for failed students,” he said.
