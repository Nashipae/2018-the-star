Hoteliers are getting ready for the 18th annual Lamu Cultural Festival. This year’s festival will take place from November 22 to 25. Hoteliers, shop and restaurant owners have been refurbishing and repainting their premises ahead of the festival. Traders are looking forward to making a killing from the thousands of guests expected to flock to historic Lamu Old Town. The town was listed as a heritage site by Unesco in 2001. The festival showcases the culture and heritage of Lamu’s Swahili communities. It is is preceded by the famous donkey race, swimming, dhow races and traditional dances. Lamu Cultural Promotional Group chairperson Ghalib Alwy said this year’s festival will attract at least 50,000 visitors. Traders are optimistic the cultural festival will boost business and tourism than ever before. Hotel owner Omar Abdalla said he has had to add a wing to his hotel to accommodate the increased number of visitors seeking to book rooms. “My hotel rooms are all full. As I was still receiving calls from visitors who want to book rooms, I had to quickly put up extra rooms,” Abdalla said. Residents are refurbishing their homes and turning them into rental rooms to cash in. Trader Abdulrahman Shali, who owns several homes in Lamu town, said he decided to rent out some of his apartments to visitors who did not get bookings in hotels.
