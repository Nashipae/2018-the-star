A form one student was on Tuesday caught sitting the KCPE examinations at Eburi Primary school centre in Kisii. Vera Reuben, 14, was caught by the sub-county security team on a routine monitoring of the ongoing KCPE. She was registered as a candidate at Scania Academy - a private school. Police, in a report on the incident, said the Nyabonge secondary school student was registered by her father without her prior knowledge. Reuben Mogaka, a deputy head teacher at Nyabonge primary, is in police custody. "She was only informed to go and write the examination by the father after she officially closed for December holidays," the police report reads. Vera's uncle is the brother of Charles Mogaka - the Scania Academy proprietor. He was found marking the class eight pupils attendance register at the latter's home. The head teacher of the said academy was also arrested after failing to produce the Standard eight pupils attendance register. Mogaka is, however, still at large. Related: Nonsense!
