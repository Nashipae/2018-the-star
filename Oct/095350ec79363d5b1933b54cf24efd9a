Pharmacists say introducing price control on medicines will not help if the whole distribution system is not relooked. On Wednesday, Health CS Sicily Kariuki said drugs will now be labelled from the manufacturer to cushion Kenyans from high prices imposed by retailers and kiosks. She said they will pursue major reforms. But on Friday, pharmacists said price control alone will not help. They spoke during the closing of Horn of Africa Pharmaceuticals Conference in Nairobi. They said lowering the price is just one aspect want the whole system relooked. “The beginning point is not price control. First, we have to ensure Kenya is corruption-free. Then we have to look at other factors that affect pricing such as stocking and prescription habits of these pharmacists and eliminate those that are not necessary,” Dr Wilberforce Wanyanga said. He is a pharmaceutical expert and the UN Industrial Development Organisation national coordinator. Wanyanga urged the ministry to use locally manufactured drugs as price indicators. “Importers should be made to justify why they should be allowed to charge higher prices for the same local drug being priced at a cheaper cost,” he said. Wanyanga wants wholesalers and retailers to stock only what is needed. He said overstocking leads to wastage and suppliers end up transferring the cost to clients. He called for public awareness to promote generics, saying original drugs are not better. Wanyanga also called for shortening the supply chain, and distributing a list showing the recommended region prices. Dr Wilfred Ochieng told the government to introduce a fee on imported medicines that are also manufactured locally. Click here for the latest political news
