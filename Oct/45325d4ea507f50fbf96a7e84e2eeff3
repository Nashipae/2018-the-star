ODM politicians have rebuffed calls to their party leader Raila Odinga to quit local politics owing to his AU appointment. Raila was named AU High Representative for Infrastructure on October 20, a position he accepted. Politicians allied to Deputy President William Ruto on Sunday asked the ODM leader to quit national politics to concentrate on the new assignment. They argued that Raila’s new job is quite demanding and he should distance himself from local politics.

They are former Embakasi South MP Irshad Sumra, Mathare's Anthony Oluoch, and ODM Nairobi branch vice chair Ochieng' Jerry. Sumra said: "Raila will decide when to retire from politics. As things stand now, he is still the force that dictates the political agenda in this country." The three said during a presser at ODM headquarters in Nairobi that the new position has instead elevated Raila's status in local and international politics. Oluoch said: "Whereas we appreciate everyone’s democratic right to the freedom of speech and expression, it is foolhardy for anyone to think they can use this appointment to force through their ambitions by proxy even when Kenyans have no time for them." "No one asked Raila to join politics and none should ask him to retire," Sumra said. "Let Ruto stop the linking Raila’s appointment to the 2022 politics." The politicians said Raila's appointment will not stop the push for constitutional change through a referendum. Click here for the latest political news
