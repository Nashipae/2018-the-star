Good Morning. The weekend weather forecast shows that most parts of the country will be gloomy with skies being mostly cloudy in Nairobi, Central Kenya and the Coast while it is expected to be rainy in Western Kenya. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this weekend. Referendum is for idlers, says Ruto Deputy President William Ruto on Friday retreated to his hardline stance on constitutional reforms, dismissing the push for a referendum as idle talk. Separately, President Uhuru Kenyatta said leaders should focus on development instead of being preoccupied with succession politics and 2022 elections. Ruto who was on a whirlwind tour of western Kenya said some leaders are more focused on changing the constitution than delivering their election manifestos. _____________________________________________________ ‘Atwoli was broke when I married him’ Trade unionist Francis Atwoli’s third wife Roselinda has for the first time spoken out about her failed marriage. Roselinda Simiyu, 53, said she married Atwoli when she was 30 years old and lived in Kariobangi. The two were mostly broke, she said. He did not reveal to her that he was married but instead told her he was a divorcÃ©e, she claims. “I met Francis in 1996 when I was a chairperson at the Kenya Union of Sugar Plantation Workers. He was 47 years but never told me he was married, instead he said he was divorced,” Roselinda told Radio Jambo. _____________________________________________________ Nairobi Hospital locks out top plastic surgeon Khainga Kenya’s leading plastic surgeon has been barred from practising at the Nairobi Hospital. In an internal memo to staff in wards, theatres, ICT and security, director of medical services and research, the hospital said Prof Stanley Khainga is no longer allowed to carry out his practice at the hospital. The suspension comes after Khainga accused the hospital of negligence leading to the death of June Wanza in June this year. Wanza received breast enlargement surgery at Khainga’s Surgeoderm Clinic in Kilimani, but developed complications days later. She sought help at Nairobi Hospital and died there. _____________________________________________________ Sharon’s funeral to cost Sh1.1m, set for next Friday in Homa Bay The burial committee for the slain Rongo University student Sharon Otieno has prepared a budget of Sh1.1 million. Committee chairman Elijah Opiyo said their budget estimates comprise a mortuary bill of Sh50,000, coffin for Sh50,000, catering personnel Sh360,000 and meals for Sh150,000. Organising secretary Oracha Ochuodho denied social media reports that the budget amounted to Sh2.5 million. The social media tally included Sh100,000 to hire professional mourners and Sh750,000 to feed the mourners. _____________________________________________________ What is Raila’s game plan this time round? In his ever unpredictable and confounding political maneuvers, Raila Odinga has thrown doves among pigeons, as it were, and political feathers are flying all round. And those reeling under Raila’s current political spell include President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto. But what is Raila up to this time round? This is the question on the lips of almost every politician across the board. And Raila seems to enjoy every bid of the unfolding drama that he has singularly staged on both his political friends and foes. In the opposition, Raila has left his so-called co-principals who form the apex of the National Super Alliance devouring themselves. _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
