  To ordinary citizens, government refers to the Executive —
the President, Cabinet and the administrative bureaucracy called Public Service.
But government comprises the Executive, Parliamnet and the Judiciary, all of which
perform interdependent roles. Increasingly, the three arms of government are flexing muscles
against each other. If it is not the Executive trying to emasculate Parliament
and force its legislative agenda, it is the Legislature trying to frustrate the
Executive by re-allocating funds against its priorities. In other
instances, the Judiciary is issuing injunctions against government actions or decisions,
while the Executive is constricting its operations by underfunding its budget.
Or simply disobeying court orders. And do so on. These vintage fights are inherent in the separation of
powers but if not well managed can imperil the conduct of public affairs and
slow down the overall pace of national development. The cost is heavy. Of great
concern now is the pace of administration of justice and its impact
on implementation of government policies, decisions and development plans. Many temporary orders issued by courts against the Executive
are turning out to be everlasting, with far-reaching consequences on delivery of
services promised by the government. Take for instance the order suspending the
night travel ban issued almost eight months ago that’s yet to be adjudicated in
detail. Government should embrace internal consultation to enhance national development.
