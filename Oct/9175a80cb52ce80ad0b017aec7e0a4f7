The 0.52 score means that a child born in Kenya today is 52 per cent of who s/he could be with complete education and full health. Treasury CS Henry Rotich cited the continuous investment in health, education, and support to the vulnerable as contributors to the improved index. He added that Kenya's ranking in the HCI is a clear testimony that government's investment for the past few years is paying off. "Further the priorities on the BIG Four plan, especially on the universal health coverage, food security and nutrition, will continue to push Kenya high up the global ranking." Rotich participated in the Ministerial Round-table meeting of the Early Adopters for the Human Capital Development by the World Bank.
