Good Morning. It is a day of clear skies in Nairobi, afternoon showers at the Coast and partly cloudy in Western even as Kenyans anticipate the start of the short rains season. The weatherman has indicated that most parts of the country will likely experience above average rainfall as the short rains season kicks off this week. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this morning. Deputy President William Ruto yesterday hit out at Nasa leader Raila Odinga accusing him of scheming to have him kicked out of Jubilee. He said Raila and his troops used the handshake to warm themselves into the heart of Jubilee but now want to wreck the party. The DP accused the ODM chief of peddling rumours and propaganda to create confusion in Jubilee and portray him as a stumbling block in the handshake. Sonko neutralises State House, stamps authority at City Hall Nairobi governor Mike Sonko has finally neutralised the influence of State House and stamped his authority at City Hall. Only days after suspending the State House-fronted county secretary Peter Kariuki, Sonko has created a new position ­— deputy county secretary — and filled it with his close ally Leboo Morintat. The position does not exist in law even though the chairman of the county public service board Philip Kung’u approved and defended its creation. Political observers view Sonko’s move as a plot to lock Kariuki out or have Leboo checkmate him in the event State House forces Sonko to reinstate Kariuki. Kariuki worked at the project delivery unit in the Presidency before his appointment as county secretary.
