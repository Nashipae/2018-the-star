President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday criticised young people for crying foul when left out of State jobs yet most of them have failed when given a chance. He asked the youth in the country to get serious after seeking and securing leadership positions saying it is ironic the group keeps demanding for slots yet 'mess up' when accorded one. Uhuru made the remarks during the commissioning of the New KCC milk plant in Sotik, Bomet county on Monday. "Vijana pia inafaa wajifunze, wanalia kila siku wakisema hawana kazi huku wakisema wazee waondoke ili wapate kazi lakini kule vijana wanaongoza tunaona taabu na kule wazee wako tunaona maendeleo," he said. (The youth are supposed to learn. Everyday, they cry saying they don't have employment and that the elderly should pave way for them...but where they have been granted the chance, we have seen trouble unlike the case of older people). His sentiments on youth, however, came amid public outcry over the share of State appointments to the disadvantage of young people. On various occasions, Kenyans have taken issue with Uhuru's appointments saying he seems to be rewarding political loyalists and rejects.
