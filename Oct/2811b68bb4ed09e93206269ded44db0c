Kiss FM presenter Adelle Onyango was among the seven-team youth advisory group chosen to play an important role in shaping the conversation at the Goal Keepers' Conference in New York last month. Adelle told Word Is the conference was attended by Bill and Melinda Gates, among other big personalities, whom they got a chance to interact with. "We spoke about the Global Goals and which ones we were most passionate about and what we were doing through our individual projects. President Macron asked each of us," she said. Asked what she learnt from the whole experience, Adelle said: "Data! It was really eye-opening. The importance of data to track social impact in my projects, how to lobby for policy change, and how to use digital tools to track activity in my programmes." Earlier on, the radio personality had launched an initiative that will equip the youth and prepare them for the job market. Together with an online talent management platform, Fuzu, Adelle unveiled a job apprenticeship initiative that took successful applicants through a two-week shadowing process with executives in over 30 companies. During the Goalkeepers' conference, Adelle met people who will help in expanding the project. "I met potential partners that could expand the scale of opportunities for TeamAdelle. Thatâ€™s quite exciting and they were pretty impressed by what my team, Fuzu, and I have achieved with TeamAdelle."
