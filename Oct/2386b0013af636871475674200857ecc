Devolution is without doubt the best gift the 2010 Constitution endowed on Kenyans. For the first time resources have been brought closer to the people at the grassroots. â€¨â€¨Despite its shortcomings, such as devolved corruption and fostering clannism and nepotism, there are so many positives. Key among them is that hitherto neglected corners now for the first time have roads, health services, water and many other amenities and the country is on the path to achieving equity. â€¨â€¨Devolution has devolved power and enhanced the tenets of democracy. Communities that never thought of ever getting close to power – in a country where tribal politics is glorified rather than ideologies and track record; where tyranny of numbers is better bet than tyranny of policies and real transformative agenda and manifestos – can now exercise democracy within their localities.â€¨â€¨ Counties were grouped according to geographical location, demographics and, more importantly, common economic interests. A pastoralist county such as Narok would not be grouped together with say Kiambu or Kericho.â€¨â€¨ The counties have developed at a different pace, with some such as Makueni being way ahead of the rest and setting the momentum for economic growth. â€¨â€¨This can be attributed to differences in needs, constraints and priorities. Nairobi for instance is grappling with endless problems, including traffic congestion, poor sewer systems and inadequate water and other facilities in the face of a burgeoning population. It is against this backdrop that Kericho senator Aaron Cheruiyot is seeking to disband the Nairobi county government. He proposed to have the county run by the national government, which would appoint a cabinet secretary in charge of Nairobi. Cheruiyot is either ignorant, inept, clueless or is seeking relevance and fame. Ironically, he has neither tabled the alluded bill or even revealed its contents in a draft but has ‘tabled’ it in the media. If he took the time to go through the Constitution, he would discover it does not permit such an amendment. â€¨â€¨The Constitution permits collaboration and cooperation between the national and county governments and that’s the route he should have followed to improve the governance of Nairobi county. In the worst case scenario a county's functions can only be transferred to the national governments when the unit is unable to completely discharge its mandate. Devolution is in serious trouble if elected leaders mandated to be its guardians are ignorant of their role or use it to seek unwarranted attention. Cheruiyot should instead focus on the unsolved issues facing voters who elected him overwhelmingly. For instance, the youths who had lots of expectations and hopes but are now in despair as no effort has been made to empower them.â€¨â€¨ If he is seeking relevance and political mileage then the expansive tea plantations dotting the green highlands provide a perfect opportunity. Tea pickers and farmers are being strangled by low pay and low prices thanks to cartels. He could also be on the forefront lamenting the plight of Mau evictees from his native community. Tabling a bill to dissolve Nairobi county is uncalled for and ill-advised. He should apologise and withdraw the proposition.â€¨â€¨  Youth leader and former Bomet Senate aspirant
