The Meru assembly has passed a motion compelling the executive to introduce a cashless, digital revenue collection for accountability. The motion, sponsored by nominated MCA Ruth Kananu, was unanimously passed. Speaker Joseph Kaberia directed the Implementation Committee to follow up with the executive to ensure it is implemented. During the debate on Tuesday, Kananu said the county government was “losing a lot of money in the absence of a transparent system open to scrutiny”.
