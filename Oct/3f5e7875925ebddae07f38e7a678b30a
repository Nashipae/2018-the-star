The Gusii Water and Sanitation Company has threatened to take legal action against developers who have constructed houses on sewer lines. The company’s managing director, John Moguche, said the locations make it hard for workers to repair the lines in case of blockages. “We have allowed people to put houses on the lines with impunity. It has been a problem for our engineers to repair the lines in case there is a blockage,” Moguche said. He said residents have complained that some landlords were discharging sewage from their building into rivers especially during rainy seasons. “We have dispatched a team of officers to assess the situation and take necessary action against those found discharging into rivers,” he further said. The MD said some developers were claiming that their plans had been approved by authorities. He said they will be compelled to bring down buildings which stand on sewer lines.

John Ombati (Bomorenda), Protus Moindi (Bomariba), Ismael Mosota Bogiakumu) and Vincent Ariemba (Riana) said the national government and the former Suneka town council had agreed to put up the plant at Suneka. “The stench from the sewer plant is threatening health. We are urging the national government to honor its pledge of constructing a sewer factory to process fertiliser from the waste,” Ombati said. The MCAs said residents who use water from the river for household chores have developed ailments due to contaminated water.They urged Gwasco to take action against landlords who pollute rivers with waste from their buildings.
