Kenya Forest Service officers have seized more than 1,300 red cedar posts suspected to have been illegally felled in Loita Forest. Narok county conservator Mwai Muraguri yesterday said the posts valued at Sh260,000 were seized at Naikara in Narok South. The timber was being ferried by a lorry. He said illegal loggers were ferrying the posts at night. “It was about 6pm when we got a tip off that the lorry was ferrying cedar posts. The driver and occupants of the lorry escaped,” Muraguri said in Narok. He said the lorry will be forfeited to the state if no one claimed it within 10 days. Logging was banned in April. Muraguri said more than 126 people have been arrested and 13 vehicles impounded since the ban was imposed.
