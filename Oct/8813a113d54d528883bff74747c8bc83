Newly crowned SportPesa Premier League ‘Golden Boot’ winner and Kariobangi Sharks’ forward, Erick Kapaito has been nominated in four categories in this year’s KPL awards set for Thursday next week. The diminutive forward, who joined Sharks in January from National Super League side FC Talanta, earned recognition in the new player of the year, Fair play, Most Valuable player (MVP) and the Golden Boot award. Kapaito defied odds in his maiden top flight season to score 16 goals—one ahead of Gor Mahia’s Jacques Tuyisenge and Elvis Rupia, who left Nzoia Sugar in July for Zambian side, Power Dynamos. In his bid to claim the Most Valuable player, he faces stiff competition from the reigning holder Michael Madoya (Zoo Kericho), Mathare United winger Cliff Nyakeya and the Bandari duo of Felly Mulumba and Faruk Shikalo. He will square it out with fellow league debutants Marvin Nabwire (Leopards), Pistone Mutamba (Wazito) and Vihiga’s Amos Kigadi and Dennis Ombeva in the new player of the season. The five despite lacking the experience to play in the elite league, depicted a superb show throughout the season where Mutamba and Kapaito earned national team calls. Kapaito is set to battle for the fair play gong alongside Madoya, Mutamba, Mulumba and Ombeva. Madoya leads the midfielder of the year award and is set to face Leopards duo of Whyvonne Isuza and Nabwire for the award with  Elvis Nandwa of Ulinzi Stars and Nyakeya also in contention. The hard tackling Mulumba is a also a nominee in the defender of the year award, where he is pitted against Posta Rangers left back Titus Achesa, Ulinzi Stars centre half Oliver Rutto and Gor’s duo of Harun Shakava and Joash Onyango. After posting the highest number of clean sheets in the recently concluded season, Shikhalo face Harambee Stars and Tusker first choice keeper Patrick Matasi for the ‘Golden Glove’ award.
