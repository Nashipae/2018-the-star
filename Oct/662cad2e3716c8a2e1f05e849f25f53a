This the source said this was geared towards ensuring the upcoming players strive to make it to the first team. The source said: “The teams’ coach Japheth Munala was consulted and he is privy to the arrangement. This is the best approach for us considering other clubs are interested in our players. Other clubs might offer the players jobs but if you look at our terms of contracts, they are far much better.”\ “We have the best side and we want to give them the best playing conditions. We hope the new arrangement will inspire the team to retain the Kenya Volleyball Federation national league title set for next month.” The senior players had earlier requested to be employed on permanent terms but it looks they will have to wait a bit longer.

Salary increment or just the same old terms.” Only celebrity setter Janet Wanja and right attacker Monica Biama are permanent employees at the company.
