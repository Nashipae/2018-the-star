Maize millers have threatened to raise the price of Unga from Sh75 to Sh100 per 2kg packet. They accused maize farmers of hoarding their grains thus creating an artificial shortage. United Trade Millers Association vice-chairman Ken Nyaga on Monday told journalists that they will review the prices upwards because farmers are reluctant to sell their produce. “The farmers are refusing to sell their maize because the government promised to buy at Sh3,000 per 90 kgs bag. So they do not want to sell a 90 kg bag at Sh2,300," he said. Nyaga said the government should now come up with proper ways to streamline the maize industry. "We are between a rock and a hard place. There is no maize available from the farmers, we cannot sustain the current market of Sh75 per 2kg packet,” he said. However, the Consumer Downtown Association (CDA) said the sentiments by the millers are "baseless, malice and meant to bring unnecessary confusion." "Consumers are not ready to accept anything above the current market prices. At least, the current prices are projected to remain constant for at least four months," CDA Executive Director Japheth Ogutu said in a statement. Maize flour has been retailing at Sh75 since a directive was given to millers by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Uhuru on October 4 said the country has a stock of 56 million bags against an annual consumption of 52 million bags.
