Kisii senator Sam Ongeri has urged residents of Gusii to ignore the referendum call by a section of leaders since it is not of help. Ongeri said the country needs to focus on other important issues as it is still healing from the sores of division. He spoke in Nyamira on Friday. The senator said residents should support development agendas and not waste time and resources in on issues of no value to the citizen. “I am not very happy the way some leaders have risen to support the so-called referendum. All we need now is development and that is all. Whoever is having the referendum in mind needs to spare Kenyans because we have not healed from the sores of the division in the country caused by the 2017 General Election,” Ongeri said. Ongeri said leaders should be given time to fulfill the pledges they made to the Kenyans. A referendum cannot change the direction of the country for the better, he said. “As a country, we have now changed direction and we have decided to strictly adhere and fully support the handshake deal between President Uhuru Kenyatta and the ODM leader Raila Odinga.”
