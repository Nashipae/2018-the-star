The Garissa government yesterday signed a long-term joint work plan with Unicef Kenya to build MCAs’ capacity to play their oversight role and improve accountability in the area of children rights. Unicef country director Werner Schultink said the partnership will entail supporting drafting of bills and legislation on children’s rights. He said over Sh1.2 million schoolgoing children aged between six to 13 are out of school despite efforts to retain them in schools, adding 40 per cent of them are from arid and semi-arid counties including Garissa. Gross enrolment ratios stand at 40 per cent for primary and seven per cent for secondary schools. This is extremely low compared to national average which stands at 103 percent for primary schools and 63 p for secondary, Schultink said.
