Kisumu East Member of Parliament Shakeel Shabbir, who has been battling a child maintenance case, has been given access to his child. According to the court, the two and a half-year old boy will be able to see his father on Saturdays for six hours. Resident Magistrate Pauline Mbulika made the ruling following the MPs request through his lawyer Mitchel Menezes that the court grant him access to the child on weekends and public holidays. “Because the child still needs to be close to the mother, I find it fair only to grant the father access on Saturdays, only pending hearing and determination of the case,”the magistrate said. She said the child must be returned to the mother on time. Shabbir had earlier filed a suit on behalf of the minor seeking orders granting him custody and parental responsibility. Regarding shared school holidays, the court did not make a ruling since the child has not started school but ordered that the matter be looked into during the main hearing when the child would have started school. Sh240,000 upkeep The court heard that the two had disagreed on access to the child forcing the magistrate to make a ruling on the application pending the hearing of the case. The magistrate however decided to grant the lawmaker access to his child on Saturdays only for seven hours regarding to the child’s young age. On the other hand the woman wanted the court to dismiss the suit and award her Sh240,000 for the child’s monthly upkeep. From this money, Sh50,000 will go to rent, Sh30,000 for food, Sh10,000 for house help, security, and transport, Sh18,000 for recreational facilities, Sh8,000 for electricity and Sh28,000 for medical insurance. The MP said he was catering for the upkeep but the child’s mother denied this, saying that Shabbir could not even visit to see the child. Hearing and determination of the suit will be set later as lawyers for the two parties were not present to agree on a hearing date.
