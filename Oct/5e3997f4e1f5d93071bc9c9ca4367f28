Kebs has warned importers of base oils, lubricants, and used oils against defying standards set for the said products' entry into the country. The Kenya Bureau of Statistics said they have information of importers who bring in the products with the accompanying laboratory tests. The agency said lubricants shall follow Pre-Export Verification of Conformity (PvoC) route A to be accompanied with a Certificate of Conformity (CoC) and test report. Route A involves testing, inspecting, and issuance of a CoC. The CoC is a mandatory document for customs clearance. It said in a statement on Tuesday that going forward, all test reports will be verified, sampled and released on meeting the required standards. "We have noted that not all importers and manufacturers of the said products are following the set standards," acting MD Moses Ikiara said. Kebs maintained all consignments not inspected at the source will be handled as per the laid down procedure on destination inspection. National Environment Management Authority is tasked with giving clearance to importers and users of used oils. The state authority has raised fears of substandard goods being sold in the country.
