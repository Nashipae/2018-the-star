Ethiopia Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has named a 20 member cabinet with women taking up an equal number of slots with their male colleagues. Aisha Ahmed was named the Minister of Defense, a position held by a woman for the first time in history according to the Ethiopia's Addis Standard. Abiy slimmed down his new cabinet to 20 from 28. With just seven months in office, the PM has been lauded for a string of staggering reforms which include releasing thousands of political prisoners, making peace with the country'sÂ main enemy - Eritrea and promising to open up the economy. However, Ethiopia is not the only African country to employ the 50/50 gender rule as Rwanda has more female cabinet members than men. Women in Rwanda hold 64 per cent of seats making it the largest share in the world. Read: Ethiopia PM Abiy Ahmed does press-ups with protesting soldiers
