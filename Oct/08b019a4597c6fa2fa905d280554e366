More than 300 people from 11 families in Kapsait village have been left homeless after they were evicted from their land due to a long-standing dispute. Families were evicted last week on Monday last week and have been spending nights in the cold. Their houses were demolished by security officers following a court order. Two clans have been tussling over 11.94 acres of land for more than 40 years. The fate of Standard Eight and Form Four candidates from the affected families hangs in the balance. The affected families are now camping at Kapsakar and Murkokoi villages. Those affected said police acted without any court order. “Police came and burned our houses without giving us a notice. We are sleeping under trees and staying in fear,” said Selina Tong’elech, one of the victims. However, Pokot South deputy county commissioner Frederick Kimanga said there was a court order to evict the families.
