A doctor has revealed how he revived a bee with sugar water â€“ saving it from death. Dr Damien Williams, 37, of Mortonhall, Scotland, has recalled the moment he brought a bee back from the brink of death. Whilst on a visit to a nearby garden centre, he noticed a motionless bee sat on a nearby windowsill. Remembering a sugar and water remedy his wife had previously used, the lecturer and volunteer instantly created the remedy to save the bee. He said: 'I poured water onto a teaspoon and proceeded to dissolve some sugar in the water. 'Once I was satisfied, I held the teaspoon at an angle, enabling the bee to feed from it. 'As soon as it started moving more freely, I placed the teaspoon down to give the bee some space to feed. 'After some time, the bee started flying and was trying to get out. 'As there were no open windows nearby, I coaxed the bee onto a paper towel, walked out of the restaurant and released the bee onto a pollinator-friendly plant. 'It flew away immediately.' Sharing the video across social media, his wife, Dr Claire Evans-Williams stated how proud she was. Click here for the latest political news
