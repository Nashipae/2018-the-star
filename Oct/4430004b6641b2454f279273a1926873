Police have arrested seven youths in connection with Saturday’s invasion and closure of at least 10 public toilets in the city centre. Central police boss Robinson Thuku said five were arrested on Monday and two were apprehended yesterday morning. Thuku said police are still hunting for other members of the group. “They will be charged with causing a disturbance because we have established these were goons who forcibly wanted to take over the management of the toilets,” he said. Thuku said they had found out the current operators have running contracts with the county government and thus any move to eject them was illegal. The youths invaded the toilets at the weekend, chased away the operators and closed the facilities. The act left thousands of residents and visitors stranded. Those closed were at Uhuru Park, Aga Khan Walk, Jevanjee Gardens, Railways Bus Station and Latema Road. Yesterday, Thuku said the facilities have been reopened after the police intervened. But Public Toilets Operators’ Association of Kenya chairman Tom Makale alleged the county government was responsible for the invasion.
