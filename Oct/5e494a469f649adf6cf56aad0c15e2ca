Senators on Thursday asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to sack Interior CS Fred Matiang’i and his Transport counterpart James Macharia following the Ternan accident that killed 56 people on Wednesday. They said Inspector General Joseph Boinett should also be reprimanded. The Homeboyz bus crashed at the Fort Ternan black spot in Kericho county. It has been established that it was on an illegal night run. Speaking at the Senate on Thursday, the Senators said those responsible should be charged. “We cannot be talking about the same things over and over again Mr Speaker, it is high time for heads to roll and ensure our roads are secure,” Bungoma Senator Moses Wetangula said. James Orengo asked the government of the day to relook at venturing into railway transport as it is safe and dependable. "Saying prayers for these families is not good enough, the President must seek accountability from the two CS’s in charge and either resign or take account of the loss,” Orengo said. The committee on transport chairman Kimani wa Matangi said most accidents happen due to human error and drink driving. "As we debate on this, all the officers who were manning all the roadblocks before the accident must be fired. We need officers on the roads who can live to expectations of Kenyans,” he said.

A time has come when passengers should even chase those entering matatus that have no seats. Let the citizens take charge because they pay to transport and must be served well,” he said.
