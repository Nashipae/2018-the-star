The government may evict two families in Narok blocking standard gauge railway construction by demanding higher compensation. The families of Luka Punyua and Korei Punyua live in the Olasiti area of Narok East subcounty. Narok county commissioner George Natembeya alleged they are blackmailing the National Land Commission to gain an unjustifiably high compensation for their land. The families are demanding more than Sh36 million each as compensation for their permanent houses on 18.4 acres, where  the Nairobi–Emurtoto SGR line will pass. Speaking when he toured the construction site to assess progress, Natembeya said relevant departments will engage the two families to come up with a solution. If that fails, they will be forcefully removed,he said. “We will not allow two people to cripple government’s efforts to construct the SGR because of hiking land prices to unreasonable levels. SGR has passed all the way from Mombasa to Narok and it is unacceptable for two families to frustrate our efforts,” Natembeya said The Phase 2A of SGR has been stalled at Olasiti area because of the families payout demands. The China Communication Construction Company has already paid them Sh9 million as early entry fees and Sh13 million for the construction of a water pan near their homestead. Though he did not specify the amount the government intends to pay, Natembeya said Sh36 million was too much for the six-room permanent houses. “This is not an opportunity for the residents to extort money from the government,” he said.
