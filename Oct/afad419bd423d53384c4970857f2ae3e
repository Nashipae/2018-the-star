Police fired teargas to disperse unruly football fans who attempted to force their way into Kasarani stadium for the Kenya vs Ethiopia match. Thousands of Kenyans streamed to the 60,000-seating capacity stadium from as early as 6am for the 2019 African Cup of Nations qualifier. Trouble started after the Confederation of African Football (CAF) officials in charge of the match ordered the gates closed. The decision which was met with protest from the fans who had not accessed the facility by that time. Their impatient and relentless quest to have their way to the main stadium forced the security apparatus to disperse them. Countries normally suffer fan ban in case of a security breach. The high turnout followed the government's waiver of gate charges. A number of leaders provided free transport to Kenyan fans to Kasarani. Initially, Caf had ordered Football Kenya Federation to print 50,000 tickets to reserve the remaining space for stewards and other security apparatus. Meanwhile, unlike in past matches where fans are separated to avoid deadly clashes, both Kenyan and Ethiopian fans have been allowed to sit together.
