Meru governor Kiraitu Murungi has defended his Meru healthcare initiative that intends to help residents get affordable services within the county. Kiraitu said his administration targets to register at least 200,000 households by next year whose contribution of Sh2,000 annually will amount to Sh400 million. He said the money will help him equip and upgrade health centres in every subcounty within Meru, adding this will decongest Meru Level 5 hospital. “With Sh400m per year and the central government resources, we will be able to equip and improve our hospitals and reduce congestion. This will equip some Level 4 hospitals to perform some surgeries,” he told the Hernia Society of Kenya surgeons. They had a dinner in Meru town after their three-day annual symposium,. Kiraitu said he is to employ more nurses and specialists in the health sector. The county boss said his administration has plans to establish a cancer centre to reduce the traffic of patients from Meru Level 5 hospital to Kenyatta National Hospital or India. He said he will establish an ICU unit. A section of residents have raised questions on why the governor had in no time changed tune to charge a yearly fee of Sh2,000 for healthcare. Nominated MCA Gacheri Muthuri on Thursday urged the governor to elaborate on the scheme as it duplicates the National Hospital Insurance Fund. She said it will burden the taxpayer if residents will enlist to NHIF and Meru Care. “When you add Sh6,000 per year paid to NHIF and Sh 2,000 , you realise it will take a patient extra costs,” “she said. Municipality MCA Murega Julius lamented that the Meru Level 5 hospital is in pathetic state noting that patients were sharing one bed in the facility. “Governor Murungi’s administration should prioritise on installation of life saving machines and building an ICU to lower medical expenses for patients seeking specialised attent in the area.,” Murega said.
