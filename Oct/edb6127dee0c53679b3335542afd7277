Nyambene MCAs are furious with Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri over plans to use Sh2 billion miraa money to buy avocado and macadamia seedlings instead. The aim is diversification to increase income. Kiunjuri made the remarks on September 28 when he attended Meru dairy farmers field day at Gitoro showground in Meru county. Kiunjuri said he had spoken with Meru governor Kiraitu Murungi and agreed that the Sh2 billion meant to help miraa farmers will buy macadamia and avocado seedlings. “We know it was not the plan by the government when the funds were given by President Uhuru Kenyatta. We know farmers were not consulted,” Kaithia said. He said CS Kiunjuri should come clean on the issue or they will convene a meeting with all elected leaders in Nyambene and Miraa within to weeks to chart the way forward. The 10 MCAs spoke on Tuesday during a press briefing. Governor Kiraitu has denied that he wants miraa farmers to uproot their crop in favour of macadamia and avocado.He says he only advised farmers to diversity so that they earn from the nuts and the avocados.
