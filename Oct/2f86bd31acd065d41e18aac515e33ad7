MCAs and county executive committee members' foreign trips will be approved by the Devolution ministry to curb misuse of public funds. In a circular to county clerks and secretaries, Devolution Principal Secretary Charles Sunkuli said the ministry will not approve foreign workshops that require paying of participation fees. He said payment will only be made to “recognised” international institutions where Kenya is a member. "The travel approval must be accompanied by minutes from respective county assemblies and authenticated by the Speaker,” reads by of the circular dated October 5. Sunkuli said the new guidelines seek to streamline and harmonise foreign trips among all public servants. However, governors are not affected. The circular is copied to Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua, Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa, Foreign Affairs PS Macharia Kamua and Council of Governors CEO Jacqueline Mogeni. "All travel requests shall indicate the total cost of travel for each person," Sunkuli said in the circular. The MCAs will be required to disclose air ticket cost, accommodation and daily expenditures, visa fees, registration fees and other extra expenses. "At the end of an official visit, the delegation shall provide a report as well as the recommendations for implementation. The report should be shared across counties for others to learn from it," Sunkuli says. The new regulations come after Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo raised concern over huge spending by counties on foreign trips. In her 2017-18 budget implementation report released this year, she indicated the county governments spent Sh7 billion on domestic and foreign travel in first nine months. Domestic travels accounted for Sh6.25 billion while foreign trips cost Sh755 million. Click here for the latest political news
