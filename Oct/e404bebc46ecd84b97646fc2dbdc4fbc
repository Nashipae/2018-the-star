Raila Odinga’s son, Raila Junior, has come out to defend his calls for the legalisation of marijuana. In an interview with Adelle and Shaffie on Kiss FM, Junior said the drug should be allowed in the country to benefit patients suffering from various ailments, including HIV-Aids. Junior says cannabis sativa could be used by people suffering from HIV-Aids to improve their appetite while undergoing treatment. "One of the taboo subjects in Kenya is marijuana, but it is the right time to push for this. It was made illegal in Kenya 1994, but before that it was legal. It was used back in the history as a pain reliever during childbirth, among other medicinal purposes. It can be used as a chronic pain reliever for cancer survivors, or a stimulant for appetites that does not need to be smoked. This is what we want to push." A Bill seeking to legalise marijuana farming was recently drafted and presented before National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi by Kibra MP Ken Okoth. Junior said the Bill was purely for medicinal purposes and not for recreational use. "If you look around the world — America, South Africa — they have legalised recreational marijuana, and they are now pushing it to marijuana farming. Cannabis sativa, which is an Indian variety of cannabis, can be used as a cash crop product to earn foreign exchange, which adds to the economy of Kenya. "We know very well that if marijuana is abused, it can cause drug psychosis. But we are addressing control prescribed on medicinal use under supervision of a health profession, because even painkillers like Panadol, when used wrongly, can kill," Junior said. Junior also dismissed claims he is pushing for the campaign to join politics. "Why is it every time someone has something, is having an agenda to join something," he said. "I am performing my civic duty, which I feel we should all do. It is my passion and I was not vocal until something happened and I had to speak out through my social media, and now on radio."
