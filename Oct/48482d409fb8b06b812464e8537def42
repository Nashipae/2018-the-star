The Sh300 million Rupingazi Weru irrigation project has been earmarked for completion. Mbeere horticultural farmers within the vicinity of the mega-irrigation project have been depending on water bowsers. The farmers said they incur huge expenses buying water from vendors. A 3,000-litre water truck sells at Sh6,000. A 6,000-litre truck goes for Sh10,000. Embu governor Martin Wambora (pictured) said his government is working closely with development partners so the project is completed. “Through the county agriculture ministry, we are in close talks with several development partners such as World Bank so our farmers in the lowlands can get water for irrigation,” he told the Star on the phone. Agriculture executive Anne Nyaga yesterday said the project will benefit more than 800 farmers. Click here for the latest political news
