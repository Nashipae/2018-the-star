Newly-appointed Kenya Sevens coach Paul Murunga will be without four key players for the start of the World Sevens series in Dubai in December. Murunga, who was confirmed as coach yesterday by the union, alongside Kenya Lionesses coach Kevin Wambua as his assistant, will be without talisman Collins Injera, Andrew Amonde. speedstar Nelson Oyoo and fly-half Sammy Oliech. The quartet are busy training with the Kenya Simbas for the upcoming repechage qualifiers in France in November. Murunga said the four should be available for the third and fourth legs of the world Sevens circuit in Hamilton and Sydney in the new year. He revealed that the squad will have two build-up tournaments including the Africa Cup Sevens — which will be the final tournament for outgoing coach Innocent Simiyu in Tunisia next week — and the Safari Sevens tournament next month at the RFUEA grounds. Murunga said he intends to field two teams at the Safari Sevens as he seeks to build depth in the playing ranks. “We have had a very competitive Sevens circuit and if we are to match the best teams in the world, we need to have feeder systems and expose players to high level competition,” said Murunga. Murunga was assistant coach to Benjamin Ayimba in the 2015/16 season, where Shujaa bagged their maiden trophy on the world Sevens series after beating Fiji 30-7 in the final in Singapore and qualifying for the Rio Olympics in Brazil later that year. Murunga had a long distinguished career playing for Ulinzi and KCB in the early part of the millennium and coaching the Kenya under 19 team, Chipu, for eight years. Geoffrey Kimani has been retained as the strength and conditioning coach with Lameck Bogonko as physiotherapist. The post of team manager will be announced soon.
