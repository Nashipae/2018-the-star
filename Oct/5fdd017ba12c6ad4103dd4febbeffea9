For a team that won the Kenyan Premier League title in 2008, finishing eighth is not exactly something to write home about for a club of Mathare United stature. But going by their current position, head coach Francis Kimanzi is satisfied with their eighth place finish despite falling short of the initial top five target. Finishing in mid-table was a remarkable improvement for the Slum Boys, who battled relegation for majority of last season and finally survived to finish 13th on the log. “I am happy with what we have done this year. There is some huge development in the playing unit. We have played some good football and the youngsters have shown a lot of maturity. We can only get better,” said Kimanzi. There should be great cause for optimism going forward for the Slum Boys going by their last results of the 2018 campaign, where they drew champions Gor Mahia and Ulinzi Stars. “I look at the 1-1 draw against the soldiers as a point gained because the opponent also wanted to win. We played very well apart from that mistake which cost us a goal. The response in the second half was wonderful given it’s the last game of the season and fatigue tends to creep in. We could have even won it in the latter stages,” assessed Kimanzi. With the new season starting at the end of next month, Kimanzi has little time to beef up his squad if they are to realistically bid to reach the historic heights of Kimanzi’s 2008 champions. With youngsters like Cliff Nyakeya and Francis Omondi showing they have the talent to cut it at the top, it will be imperative for Bob Munro to keep their heads from being turned as they will be crucial for anything they achieve next year.
