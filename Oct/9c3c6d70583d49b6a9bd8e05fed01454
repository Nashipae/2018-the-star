Congestion at Nakuru Level 5 hospital is expected to be a thing of the past after First Lady Margaret Kenyatta officially opened a 250-bed maternity wing at the facility. The Sh450 million Mother-Baby Wing was unveiled in a colourful event on Wednesday. Host Governor Lee Kinyanjui and other dignitaries were present at the launch. The maternity wing is expected to handle patients from Rift Valley counties namely Bomet, Baringo, Narok, Kericho, Samburu, Laikipia, and Nyandarua. The maternity unit is hailed as the second biggest not only in Rift Valley but in the country after Nairobi's Pumwani hospital.

Nakuru Level Five medical superintendent Joseph Mburu earlier said the current maternity wing is overstretched, a situation that forced pregnant mothers to share beds. Children born with complications will get specialised care at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. There are also isolation wards for newborns at the newly-constructed facility. The launch is likely to see the facility upgraded to Level Six like Kenyatta National Hospital and the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. Nakuru has 14 sub-county hospitals. The facilities still face infrastructure, human resource, and drug supplies challenges. Click here for the latest political news
