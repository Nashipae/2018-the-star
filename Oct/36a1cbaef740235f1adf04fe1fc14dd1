Governor Mike Sonko has reiterated that Ndakaini Dam belongs to Nairobi. He said on Thursday that the county had acquired the dam and has documents to prove. "Tuheshiamiane, lakini sina shida na  Wa Iria [Mwangi]. Sisi hatukunywi maji ya Murang'a. ," he said via a live stream video on Facebook. (Let's respect each other. I don't have a problem with Wa Iria. We don't get water from Murang'a). "We have compensated the people near Ndakaini dam and other dams that Nairobi owns. We have genuine documents to prove," Sonko said.

Wa Iria vowed to stop construction of the Sh6.8 billion Northern Collector Tunnel until Murang'a is compensated. However, on October 4 Sonko dismissed the threats. He said Nairobi acquired the dam's 1,200 acres in 1988. The governor said any person or institution has a right of acquiring land anywhere in Kenya. "Article 52 of the Constitution states that all the rivers, lakes and dams are public property," he said. Sonko said Nairobi gets its water from Aberdare Forest in Nyandarua and Ndakaini is used for storage. "We receive water from Aberdare which flows in Chania River, it is pumped to Ngethu for treatment then flows to a reservoir in Gigiri for supply in the city," he said. "We also supply water to Machakos county and we have no issues with them," he added. Click here for the latest political news
