Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua says he will introduce a motion in Parliament to ensure all contracts less than Sh1 billion are given to Kenyans only. The motion if successful, he said, will ensure Chinese can only bid and qualify for contracts exceeding Sh1 billion. Rigathi said this will enable money to circulate in the country and boost the local economy. “We cannot allow the Chinese invasion that is going to impoverish Kenyans. We are saying this without fear of contradiction,” the MP said. Rigathi spoke in his Mathira constituency, Nyeri, on Saturday. He said he will ensure the motion succeeds in Parliament. The legislator said MPs have a responsibility to come up with laws that protect Kenyans from unfair competition and exploitation by foreigners. The MP said the Chinese are behind the lack of money in circulation. He said even after getting contracts in Kenya, they buy everything used in construction sites, including food, from China. They buy nothing locally and instead of spending the money they earn from the contracts here, they take it to China, Rigathi said. He said the country cannot be politically and economically independent as it has been taken over by the Chinese. “This cannot be allowed to happen. These people come even with foodstuff such as rice and chicken, which are preserved in refrigerators for a year. They even plant sukuma wiki where they live instead of buying them from our people,” Rigathi said.
