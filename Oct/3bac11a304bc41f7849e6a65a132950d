Former Thika United captain Denis Lewa will be buried on Saturday at his family’s home in Kaloleni, Kilifi. The footballer died in a grisly accident on October 10, at Fort Ternan in Kericho after the bus he was travelling in veered off the road and rolled, killing 56 people. Lewa left Nairobi for Kakamega aboard the ill-fated Homeboyz bus. He was going to sign a deal with Kakamega Homeboyz Football Club. Ironically, the bus belongs to club owner Cleophas Shimanyula, who was arrested. According to the burial programme, the body will be removed from Jocham Hospital on Friday at 8 am.
