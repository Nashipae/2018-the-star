The Machakos government wants the anti-corruption agency to probe Wiper MCAs for inciting people to demonstrate against Governor Alfred Mutua. On Monday, they led residents in protesting against what they described as skewed development and poor leadership. They were dispersed by a contingent of police officers. Director of communications Mutinda Mwanzia said in a statement the MCAs were working "for their external masters" to undermine the county leadership. He accused the MCAsÂ of paying the demonstrators Sh1,000. Mwanzia said the lawmakers need to be educated on their roles. "Maybe these MCAs need civic education to understand that their role is to legislate and oversight and not to implement. They should not cry foul when the governor delivers development directly to the people," he said. Mwanzia also accused the MCAs of not passing the supplementary budget of Sh1.4 billion.
