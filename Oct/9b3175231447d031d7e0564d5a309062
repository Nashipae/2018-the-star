No hawker will be allowed to trade near the new and renovated markets in Nyeri town, Governor Mutahi Kahiga has said. There have been complaints that people who sell outside the markets prevent buyers from purchasing the same goods from traders inside the markets. Kahiga spoke on Monday when he inspected the two markets in the town. Construction of the Nyeri open-air market and renovation of the Mudavadi Market were recently completed. “Let all people buy inside the market. If you don’t have a slot inside the market, then look for somewhere else to display your goods,” he said. Mudavadi Market, which was constructed in 1957, had been dilapidated. The county government has been renovating it for three months. It was rehabilitated for Sh5.8 million. The open-air market was started by late Governor Nderitu Gachagua but has dragged on for three to four years. Traders, who were moved from the Mudavadi Market to allow for its renovation, moved back on Monday. The new Nyeri open-air market is yet to be occupied. Kahiga said traders are expected to settle in the Sh50 million facility by end of the week. “Rains are just about to start and we do not want to find the traders outside the market. We want the traders to come and operate in here,” he said. The governor threatened to have the market closed if the traders fail to agree after some insisted they must occupy their previous slots in the market.
