Year after year, the plains zebra
faithfully return to the Nairobi Park to seek fine pasture. In recent years,
this feat has become more and more challenging, with the pressures of human
encroachment. So it is with relief that many people hope they return in good
numbers again. It has always been a favourite habit of
mine to approach a herd of zebra, slowly idle and edge the vehicle closer and
closer until virtually in the middle of the herd, and then switch off the
vehicle and observe them. A particularly strange and interesting observation is
when they appear to be laughing as they their raise upper lips to expose their
teeth, revealing a humorous grin-like grimace. Scientific research has revealed that
zebra use their teeth for a number of reasons. Firstly to show aggressive “stay
away from me” body language or “I will bite”, and secondly in what is known as
the Flehmen response (a biological response to smell). They curl back their upper lip to
activate an organ that allows horses to sense chemicals in the air,
particularly pheromones, therefore allowing stallions to sense if mares are
ready for mating. This is a unique method of “smelling” the air. There are two sub-genus of zebra, namely
Hippotigris and Dolichohippus. There are five sub-species across Africa in the
genus Hippotigris, of which the plains zebra in East Africa is part, each with
unique patterns. It is amazing that there is not a single zebra with the same
strip pattern. The name zebra comes from the old
Portuguese word “Zevra”, meaning “wild ass”, and in Kiswahili, they are known
as Punda Milia. They are quite observant and very sensitive regarding predator
awareness. God has created many wonders, and zebra is one of them.
