Auditor General Edward Ouko has questioned ethnic hiring at the Elgeyo Marakwet county assembly after it emerged that 94 per cent of the staff are from one ethnic community. In his 2016-17 report, he reveals that the assemblyâ€™s hiring is hugely dominated by one community, leaving a paltry six per cent to other communities in total disregard of the law. The county assembly has a staff establishment of 67 out of whom 63 are from one tribe. According to records, out of the 67 staff members, seven were recruited during the financial year 2016-17, out of which all the seven were from one ethnic community. Ouko found the county to be in direct breach of Section 65 (1) (e) County Government Act, 2012 and other regulations. Click here for the latest political news
