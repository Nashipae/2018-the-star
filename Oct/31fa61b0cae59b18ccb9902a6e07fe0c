Embu county ward representatives have asked governor Martin Wambora to stop the chain of removals i in the county assembly. Since April this year, two deputy speakers, majority chief whip and chairmen of several committees have been impeached. Former deputy speaker Steve Munene who was also impeached said the impeachments are signs of protests against governor Martin Wambora owing to lack of mutual respect and consultations on matters regarding the executive and the assembly. Noting that he was the first to be impeached in April from the deputy speaker’s office, before his replacement was also shown the door and he returned back, Munene asked Wambora to cultivate mutual respect and consultation with the assembly to end the infighting. Speaker Josiah Thiriku admitted there is a problem in the assembly and that he had discussed it with the governor buthe argued that MCAs know what is ailing them and thus they should be left alone to solve their problems. Owing to the fierce fight the Jubilee party which has the majority ward representative has tried to intervene and stopped the changes and the court has also issued orders restraining them after the victims filed cases there. “Sooner or later we are going to sit down and look at those issues and solve them. And because that house of ours is a political house, I urge that we be left to solve our political problems. We are the ones who know where the shoe is squeezing,” said Thiriku.
