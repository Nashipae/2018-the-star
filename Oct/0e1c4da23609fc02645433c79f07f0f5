Zoo Kericho coach Sammy Okoth has termed the exit of Nicholas Kipkirui and Isaac Kipyegon a big blow ahead of the new SportPesa Premier League season. The duo were lured by Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards respectively after impressing in the past two seasons for Zoo. Kipkirui, who savours a cap in the National U-23 Emerging Stars and who found the back of the net 13 times, surprisingly decamped to Gor two weeks ago, leaving Okoth scratching his head for a replacement. Before Okoth could come to terms with the news of Kipkirui’s exit, his first choice left back Kipyegon followed the suit after Leopards offered a better package. Kipyegon was part of the Harambee Stars squad which won last year’s Cecafa Senior Challenge and his move to Leopards is viewed as a solution to their full back flank which has been marred by injuries to preferred starter Isaac Oduro and his rival Moses Mburu. The exit of the two internationals has left Okoth ruing lack of sufficient finances to tie the two to longer contracts and other priced stars who are reportedly on the radar of other clubs. The 2017 Most Valuable Player, Michael Madoya is also rumoured to be on his way out. Okoth said: “It’s a major blow to me and the entire the team as the two have been instrumental for the years they have been around.The two have been outstanding for the past two seasons and we could not prevent them from being poached by other clubs. It’s their performance which sold them and I believe if we had enough finances we could have extended their contracts with improved terms.”
