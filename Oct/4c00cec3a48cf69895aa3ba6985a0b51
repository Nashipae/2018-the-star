The government will reduce power tariffs so low-income earners can enjoy benefits of the Last Mile Connectivity project, Energy CS Charles Keter has said. He said on Saturday that the new charges will ease the burden on many Kenyans. They will be announced soon and will be more “reasonable” than current rates, the CS said. “The President will be announcing the new rates in the next one week. They’ll be cheaper than even kerosene that most people use,” Keter said at Dam Side Primary School in Bomet East. He launched the connectivity project. Keter said the government is committed to ensuring the project succeeds. Leaders present at the event included Bomet governor Joyce Laboso, Senator Christopher Langat and MP Ronald Tonui.

In the first phase, at least 1.5 million Kenyans were connected. Keter said faulty transformers will be replaced. “We need to have all those transformers returned and replaced immediately because we want the project to continue,” he said. Bomet has one of the lowest connection rates in the country. The ministry has set aside Sh1.3 billion for the project. Keter said another Sh260 million for the next phase of the project in the region has been factored in. The African Development Bank is financing the project. Sh13 billion was used in the first phase and Sh15 billion will be used for the second phase.
