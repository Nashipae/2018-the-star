Joseph Irungu alias Jowie is to be taken for treatment after his hand that was shot got "paralysed". Appearing before Justice Jessie Lesiit on Tuesday, lawyer Cliff Ombeta pleaded with the court that Jowie gets medical attention immediately. "There was a referral for a surgical procedure and it has not been done. his hand is paralysed, numb and is not functioning as we speak," Ombeta said. "...and there is a lot of pus coming out... any delay to take him to the hospital is not advisable... it would be important that he is taken your honour...There is proof for this." Lesiit asked the prison boss to make sure that Jowie receives treatment. "Is the person in charge of the prison here? Make sure that he receives medical attention immediately," she said. DPP Noordin Haji ordered TV journalist Jacque Maribe and her fiance Jowie to be charged with the murder of businesswoman Monica Kimani. During Jowie's arrest, he had a gunshot wound on his arm. According to the suspect, on the night that Kimani was murdered, he spotted three men standing outside his house. He entered the house and came out to inquire why they were hanging around. It was at this point that he was allegedly shot on the left side of the chest. However, preliminary findings show no shooting occurred at the scene. Maribe has been implicated in the gory murder by her conduct and association with prime suspect Jowie. Her charges emanate from what police describe as the illegal handling of a firearm after a 9mm live bullet was recovered in her bedroom.
