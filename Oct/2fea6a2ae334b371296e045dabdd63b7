Nine players have been called up to the Kenya Lionesses squad in preparation for the Dubai Invitational women’s tournament set for November. They include Lorraine Akoth of Barchando Girls, Mwamba duo of Terry Ayesha and Agatha Canary, alongside Phoebe Akinyi and Maureen Otieno from Shamas. Others are Impala’s Stella Wafula, who top-scored at the recent Impala Sevens tourney, her team-mate Judith Auma who was named MVP and Homeboyz duo of Enid Ouma and Leah Njogu. The Lionesses have been inactive since late May when they scooped their historic Africa Cup after knocking out Uganda 29-7 in the final in Gaberone, Botswana. The squad, to be coached by Kevin Wambua, kicked off training on Monday. Wambua was optimistic of Kenya’s chances in the event after competing at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia and after winning the Africa Cup. “We have had reasonably good year and the team is improving. If we get more opportunities to play against higher ranked opposition, we will no doubt get better,” he added. Wambua said he is happy with the talent pool of players at the just concluded Impala tournament. “It’s very encouraging many clubs have women’s teams in their ranks and the pool of talent coming through is good for the national team and it will create competition for places in the side,” added Wambua Elsewhere, versatile centre Kelvin Kioko is one of the four players who have left Nakuru to pursue post secondary education, coach Mitch Ocholla has revealed. Kioko has joined Daystar University, a side which features in the third tier; Nationwide. The Laiser Hill Alma mater, who can plug in both center positions in the back-line has been a seminal figure of the squad since 2016. The other three are former Laiser Hill centre Billy Kipchirchir, Kakamega High School’s alumni Chrissant Ojwang and Bram Kilwake. Ojwang and Kipchirchir were part of the squad that finished fourth at this year’s National Sevens Circuit.
