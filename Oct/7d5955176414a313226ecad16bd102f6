The EACC is asking qualified individuals to apply for the position of Chief Executive Officer which it has advertised. CEO Halakhe Waqo's has served his non-renewable six-year term that is coming to an end. In an advert on Tuesday, Chairman Eliud Wabukala said the applicants must be citizens of Kenya and they should possess a post-graduate degree from a recognised university. Those who wish to fit in the shoes of Waqo must have at least 10 years experience at management level and meet the requirements of Chapter Six of the Constitution. The applicants must obtain clearance certificates from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, the Kenya Revenue Authority, Directorate of Criminal Investigations, the Higher Education Loans Board and the Credit Reference Bureau. The names of shortlisted candidates will be published in the newspaper and on the commission's website. The successful candidate's name will be forwarded to the National Assembly for approval. Waqo formally took office at the commission after being sworn in at the Supreme Court on January 21, 2013. He was the commission’s first CEO since the EACC was established to replace the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission in 2012. Click here for the latest political news
