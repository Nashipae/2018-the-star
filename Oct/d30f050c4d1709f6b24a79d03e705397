Police in Thika yesterday morning shot dead six suspects, among them a 61-year-old, after a robbery mission in a factory in the outskirts of the town failed. The officers from Makongeni police station acted on a tip-off from the public that a gang of 20 thugs armed with crude weapons had invaded Sunveat Foods Ltd, a biscuit processing company in Makongeni. The thugs, believed to be members of a notorious gang that has been terrorising residents, gained access into the factory through a hole they had drilled on the perimeter wall. They tied one of the security guards and proceeded to break into the factory. They ransacked the factory offices but one of the guards, who managed to escape, called for help. The officers led by OCS James Mwita killed six on the spot. Others escaped with gunshot wounds. Kiambu police commander Adiel Nyange said the officers recovered a toy pistol, pangas, nine TV sets and cartons of biscuits. He said they will pursue those who fled. Nyange appealed to all hospitals within the region to notify police of anybody seeking treatment of gunshot wounds. Bodies of the six were taken to General Kago Funeral Home in Thika. Last week on Friday during the requiem mass for Monica Nyawira at Happy Valley Grounds, Kamenu MCA Raphael Chege said crime is on the rise in the area. He said in two months, five residents had been murdered. A recent incident, the MCA said, occurred on September 23 where the body of a man with multiple stab wounds in his chest and neck was found dumped near Kenyatta Primary School in Kamenu. “Things are getting out of hand now. These rampant killings have caused fear among residents,” Chege said. Click here for the latest political news
