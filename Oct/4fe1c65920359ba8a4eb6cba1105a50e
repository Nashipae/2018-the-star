The Nyeri government has bought and distributed 3.6 tonnes of bean seeds worth Sh900,000 to 22 wards. The beans will help improve food insecurity and fight hunger. Governor Mutahi Kahiga flagged off the first batch of the Wairimu Dwarf bean variety on Thursday in Nyeri town. He said the seeds will be given to farmers’ groups. “We urge farmers to follow instructions from extension officers so we can maximise production,” Kahiga said. With proper care, the beans mature in 75 days. One kilo can produce 30 kilos. Kieni will be supplied with the KT 56 Katumani variety, a drought resistant variety capable of maturing in 65 days. They will receive the seeds next week.
