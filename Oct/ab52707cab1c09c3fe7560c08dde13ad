An association has urged the national government to allow saw millers in Mt Kenya Forest to remove the logs they had felled before it imposed a ban. Speaking at Kahurura Forest on Tuesday, Mt Kenya Community Forest Association chairperson Kariuki Mugo said the group is incurring huge losses. He also said the ban imposed by Forestry CS Keriako Tobiko was hindering their planting of seedlings. “Our members are involved in cultivating crops in the forest through the Plantation Establishment and Livelihood Improvement Scheme and at the moment we are stuck,” Mugo said. He said the 600-member association has planted close to 700,000 tree seedlings in four years. “Our main aim in this forest is to conserve it. Let us embrace farming and planting trees to improve our lives and those of generations to come after we are long gone,” Mugo said. The ban was imposed in February and later extended to allow for the the appointment of the new board of the Kenya Forest Service and the interim reform implementations committee. The extension was also meant to allow the government to undertake measures to reform operations of KFS and the management of the forestry sector. Implementation of the recommendations of the task force is ongoing.
