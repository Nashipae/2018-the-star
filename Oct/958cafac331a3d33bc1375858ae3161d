Thousands of motorists and passengers on Saturday were stuck at a two-hour traffic snarl-up between Mlolongo and Kyumbi towns on the Nairobi-Mombasa highway. This was caused by hundreds of participants who turned up for the Cerebral Palsy Awareness Walk 2018. The event was organised by Doors of Hope NGO to mark World Cerebral Palsy Day observed every October 6. Those who participated included provincial administrators, schoolchildren, teachers, NGO officials, corporate communities, hospital representatives, youth groups and residents. The participants were from Nairobi, Kajiado, Machakos, Makueni, Kitui and Kiambu counties. They walked 10km from the NGO’s offices along the Namanga Road to Mavoko Stadium in Athi River, through Mombasa Road. Athi River police helped control traffic. They were led by traffic base commander Moses Kimeli. Several motorists and passengers also joined in the walk. Doors of Hope NGOs programmes director Jacqueline Shibalira said the drive was meant to create awareness of cerebral palsy to fight myths and misconceptions on the condition. “After our sensitisation exercise since last year, we have managed to bring out children locked up in houses. Most of the parents, some of who were among those who had hidden their children, are now happy,” she said. Shibalira spoke after the walk at Mavoko Stadium in Athi River. She said the NGO had established a centre for children living with the condition to offer therapy, nutrition, counselling and education to children and their parents or guardians. Shibalira said the centre located at the NGO’s offices caters for 130 children.
