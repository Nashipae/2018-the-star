An MP has proposed a law to protect Kenyans from unfair competition in the job market and tendering. Kigathi Gachagua (Mathira) yesterday said foreigners should not get jobs and contracts that can be handled by Kenyans. He seeks to amend the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act, 2015, to bar foreign firms from carrying out any contract valued at Sh1 billion or below. “In promoting local industries, which is one of the objectives of the Act, contracts of Sh1 billion and below shall only be awarded to local contractors — being firms which are 100 per cent owned by Kenyans,” the legislator said. He said many foreign firms have taken over local supply business previously run by Kenyans, thereby depriving people jobs and crippling the local capacity. Gachagua also proposes stern action against individuals who will register companies on behalf of foreigners. Click here for the latest political news
