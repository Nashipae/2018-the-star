Internet users and mobile phone subscribers will dig deeper into their pockets to pay for services offered by Airtel, Telkom, and Zuku. Pay TV and internet firm Zuku, as well as the telcos cited the 15 per cent excise duty which followed President Uhuru Kenyatta's assent to the Finance Bill, 2018. "The application of the excise duty by the government has led to an increase in the charges payable for the internet component of Zuku Fiber packages," the firm said in a statement on Monday. Both Telkom and Airtel said they will increase headline voice and data tariffs by 30 cents each and SMS tariff by 10 cents. The changes take effect from October 23. Following the changes off-net calls for Telkom will now cost Sh3.30cts per minute, on-net calls Sh2.30cts per minute and SMS (any-net) will cost Sh1.10cts per SMS. "In addition, our Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) price for mobile data will also be increased by 30 cents per MB; this translates to a new Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) price of Sh4.30cts," Telkom said.
