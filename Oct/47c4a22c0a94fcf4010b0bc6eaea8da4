United States International University–Africa women’s team coach Willis Okeyo is upbeat ahead of their debut at the African Cup of Clubs Championship from December 17-24 in Abuja, Nigeria. Okeyo, who also plays for Kenya Police in the Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) men’s Premier League, said he is aware of what awaits them at the Africa Club Championship but exuded confidence that they will be ready. The students will be making their maiden appearance at the annual event by virtue of finishing second to champions Telkom in the last season’s Premier League. Okeyo said: “It is my first time as a coach to lead an equally first time team to the event and as usual, there are a lot of expectations. Our aim is to expose the players and at the same time try to give a good account of ourselves.” He added: “I’m glad we received a letter from the institution, assuring us of our participation in the event. We have upped our training ahead of the December event since we are keen to go out there and prove our worth. We are currently training at the institution but we hope to move to the City Park Stadium soon.” He promised to give a chance to new signings including striker Naomi Kerubo (Trans Nzioa Secondary School), defender Redempta Wambalambala (St Joseph’s) and mid fielder Harriet Atieno from Chase Amira. “We are currently fourth on the league standing with 10 points from eight matches and we are optimistic of registering good performance going forward to finish among the top teams when the league comes to an end,” said the tactician. Ghana Revenue Authority are the reigning champions after they defeated Telkom 1-0 last year in Ghana.
