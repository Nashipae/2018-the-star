Detectives have recovered 254 laptops acquired from a city resident earlier this month through a fraudulent tender. Idris Ahmed Buro lost millions of shillings after a cartel that allegedly operates within government offices used fake letters and Local Purchase Order to award him false tenders. “Detectives from the @DCI_Kenya have recovered 254 HP Laptops from within #Embakasi area, which are part of the 795 Laptops obtained falsely from a businessman within Nairobi,”DCI tweeted on Thursday. The police did not give the exact number of the laptops recovered. On September 20, three suspects were arrested in connection with the cartel. Jackson Mwondi, David Nabiri, and Geoffrey Odhiambo reportedly promised the directors of the Nairobi based company a direct tender of Sh230 million. DCI boss George Kinoti said the three approached the said directors sometime in July 2018 in the pretext of awarding them an ICT ministry tender. The items are 1,797 laptops, two computer softwares and other computer accessories. Buro was awarded three tenders that amount to Sh230 million. In one tender he was required to supply Panolin Hydraulic Lubricant to the government printer at a cost of Sh74.5 million. In the other two, he was asked to supply 797 laptops to the ICT ministry at Sh125.9 million and software at Sh28.7 million. Read:Three arrested for defrauding Nairobi traders Sh15m in fake tender
