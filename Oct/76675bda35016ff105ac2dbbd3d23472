Singer Viola Karuri’s songs are all inspired by happenings in day-to-day life. Viola is well known for her Swahili rendition of Despacito by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee. “I sing about lives and that is where I get my inspiration,” she told Word Is. In one life experience, Viola was hit on by a cop at a police check, while driving on Mombasa Road. From that experience, she did Nitakungojea. “The cop told me to walk out of the car, and instead of checking my car, he started vibing me. I don’t know if he knew that I sing but what I remember is him asking me if he could wait for me,” Viola said. She is currently promoting her new song Leo, featuring Tanzanian artiste Barnabas. “The song talks about guys who promise things but never fulfil. I have seen guys promising to visit a girl’s parents but fail to fulfil their promises. “I have known Barnabas for a while now. I heard a couple of songs and when we met, he said he would not mind a collabo with me,” she said, adding that music is not for the fainthearted, and that it is challenging, especially for female artistes.
