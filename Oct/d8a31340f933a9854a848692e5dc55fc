Kaloleni MP Paul Katana wants the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate alleged loss of more than Sh50 million CDF cash during his predecessors’ tenure. A 2016-17 report by the Auditor General said more than Sh50 million could not be accounted for. It was released on July 13. It said no documents were produced to justify expenditure. Katana said on Friday that the commission must recover the money. He spoke at Gogo Raruhe Primary School, where he opened four new classrooms and an administration block. “I’m officially welcoming the EACC to investigate how the funds were lost. Those found culpable should face the law. I also want the commission to probe me over the period I’ve been in office and let the public know how their money is being used,” he said. Former MP Gunga Mwinga said he had yet to see or receive the report. He accused Katana of politicising the matter. “According to what I know, the current leadership of the Kaloleni CDF is supposed to respond. I believe all the documents are available for verification. The report usually points at the grey areas for improvement,” he said. “As an MP, I did not meddle in CDF matters as the law requires. There is a committee under the leadership of the fund account manager who prepares the financial reports,” Mwinga said. Katana warned the current CDF committee that they risk prosecution if they misuse public funds. The grey areas highlighted by the Edward Ouko report included committee allowances, routine maintenance of vehicles and other transport equipment and transfer of money to learning institutions. There was also irregular funding of ports and environmental management projects.
