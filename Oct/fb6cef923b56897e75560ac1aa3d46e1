Water rationing is expected to end soon once boreholes are drilled. City director of water services Mario Kainga said 22 boreholes have already been drilled in Embakasi. The boreholes are in Embakasi Primary School, Embakasi Health Centre and Kayole Health Centre. “The drilling is progressing,” Kainga said. Eighteen more will be drilled for a total of 40. The Sh200 million project is a joint initiative of the national government and City Hall. The state will pay Sh100 million and the county government and Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company Sh50 million each. “The project almost stalled because the previous regime did not pay Athi Water Services Board, the implementers,” Kainga said. He said Governor Mike Sonko remitted the money on September 30. “The governor has prioritised water provision to residents,” he said. Last year, NACWSCO managing director Nahashon Muguna said only 14 out of the 40 boreholes had been drilled. The water points were at Kenyatta University, Kibera Primary School, Joseph Kangethe Primary School, Gikomba, and Makongeni areas. Previously, NAWASCO had 74 boreholes, in addition to privately owned wells. But 18 were either dried up or not operational. The drying up raised concerns about the dropping water table. Water executive Larry Wambua said rationing might persist due to “historical failures” but said the county was committed to improving the situation. Muguna blamed persistent rationing on drought in the Aberdare Ranges since 2014 and degradation of catchment areas.
