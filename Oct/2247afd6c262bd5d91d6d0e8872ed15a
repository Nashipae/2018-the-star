Kenya Hockey Union men’s Premier League defending champions Kenya Police seek to move joint top of the standings when they play Kenya College of Accountancy (KCA) University tomorrow at City Park. Police, who have two matches in hand trail league leaders Butali Warriors by three points and will hope to capitalise on the latter’s inactivity this weekend to level their points. However, the law enforcers will have to be content with the second spot as Butali have a massive goal difference of +58 which is 25 higher than that of Police. Ahead of the match, Police assistant coach Fred Masibo remains confident of silencing the students who finished second in last weekend’s Agnelo De Souza tournament. “We know they have prepared to beat us but we also have our plan to scoop the three points. “They played well in the tournament and will bring the same tempo in the match but we are ready to accost them. “We are not under pressure to catch up with Butali. Our focus is to get the three points and prepare for the next game. I am glad I do not have injuries on my side and I am looking forward to the match,” said Masibo In other matches lined up for the weekend will see bottom placed Western Jaguars begin yet another quest to beat the drop in a weekend double. Today, the Kakamega-based club will encounter Unites States International University ‘A’ Mashujaa, who are seventh on the log with 19 points before confronting 2016 champions Strathmore University Gladiators on Sunday. Tenth-ranked Nakuru will play two matches this weekend. They face Parklands today at City Park before entertaining Wazalendo on Sunday at the same venue. Nakuru are currently on 17 points ahead of Parkland who have the same number of points but with an inferior goal aggregate.
