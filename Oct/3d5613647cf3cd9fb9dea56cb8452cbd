Kitui government has sponsored 150 youth to get training in ICT and artisanal mining training at the South Eastern Kenya University. A similar number of youths were sponsored to learn garment-making at Trendy College in Nakuru. On Monday, the governor and the form four leavers who were competitively selected for the ICT and the artisanal mining training met Seku vice chancellor Geoffrey Muluvi. Those training in ICT will be at Seku for eight weeks while the 50 undergoing artisanal mining will be trained for three weeks. The governor said the 50 youth in artisanal mining will be employed in the mining industry expected to soon kick off in the county. Kitui is rich in coal but mining is controversial. About 950 persons will be enrolled for the artisanal training at Seku, Ngilu said. She said the government will sponsor at least 1,000 youths in ICT every year. “As the world becomes digital, the skills that people need to land jobs or grow successful businesses are changing,” the governor said. Ngilu said her government recently launched an ambitious plan to revive the garment-making industry. “The garment-making training programme targets at least 2,000 youths from across the county to guarantee sufficient personnel for 24-hour running of the sector,” she said.
