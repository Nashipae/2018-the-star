Activist Okiya Omtatah wants the court to suspend proceedings before the National Environment Tribunal, arguing that it is unlawfully constituted. In a petition filed at the Milimani law courts, Omtatah further wants the court to prohibit the tribunal from conducting any further hearings. He argues that with the absence of the person appointed by the JSC the Tribunal is not properly constituted. Omtatah says the tribunal is operating illegally with the position of chair being vacant since it requires JSC to appoint a person qualified for the position. “The tribunal is currently operating unlawfully without a substantive chairperson appointed by the JSC in accordance with the law,” the petition reads. Omtatah has sued the JSC, Environment CS Keriako Tobiko, AG and the National Environment Tribunal. He says the tribunal’s mandate is to hear disputes arising from decisions of Nema on issuance, denial or revocation of licences. It also deals with offences from the Kenya Wildlife Management Act and the Kenya Forests Act, the activist says. Click here for latest political news
