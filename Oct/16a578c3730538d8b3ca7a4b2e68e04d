A scientist has named the 36 'longevity' nutrients - found in everything from red meat to noodles - that could 'add a few years to everyone's lives'. Consuming plenty of the three dozen vitamins and minerals prevents disease and the risk of an early death, Dr Bruce Ames claims. However, Dr Ames, of the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute claim that most people are deficient in many of the nutrients. Below, MailOnline names the 36 nutrients, from vitamin K to selenium, and reveals how they benefit your health and the foods richest in them. Dr Ames, who led the study, said: 'Diet is very important for our long-term health. 'This just reinforces that you should try to do what your mother told you: Eat your veggies, eat your fruit, give up sugary soft drinks and empty carbohydrates. 'The low hanging fruit in prolonging healthy ageing lies in optimising vitamin and mineral intake.' He published the list of nutrients in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Dr Ames said around 70 per cent of people in the US are deficient in vitamin D and as many as 60 per cent lack vitamin E. This is despite vitamin D being essential for bone, heart and brain health, and vitamin E protecting against skin and eye damage. Dr Ames made the conclusion by evaluating research conducted by himself and his colleagues, as well as other scientists from around the world. This is based on the theory that when a person lacks certain vitamins and minerals, their body uses the nutrients it does have to ensure their survival. This is rather than investing the nutrients into helping them live longer or preventing disease. For example, a vitamin K deficiency may cause a person's to use the vitamin K it has to ensure blood properly clots, rather than investing it into heart health. While deficiency in 'longevity vitamins' may not put someone at immediate risk of death, it can cause gradual damage that only becomes obvious in later life. Ensuring lifelong health is increasingly important due to people all over the world living longer, Dr Ames said. '[The current review] may be a theoretical paper, but I hope it can add a few years to everyone's lives,' he added. Although factors aside from diet can cause disease, such as infections and genetics, eating well strengthens the immune system so it can then better fight pathogens off. Previous research suggests more than 50 genetic diseases are preventable by taking high-dose supplements. And while some of the damage caused by nutrient deficiencies can be reversed once vitamins and minerals are taken in sufficient amounts, DNA damage can be permanent. 'The prevention of the degenerative diseases of ageing is a different science than curing disease,' Dr Ames said. 'It will involve expertise in metabolism, nutrition, biochemistry, and genetic regulatory elements and polymorphisms. 'This approach is critical for lowering medical costs.' The EU could save €4billion (£3.5bn) from osteoporosis alone if people took vitamin D and calcium supplements, according to Dr Ames.
