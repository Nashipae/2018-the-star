A report by a toxicologist showing former Juja MP George Thuo was poisoned while having a drink at a Thika nightclub has been admitted as evidence in the High Court. The defence had objected to its admissibility on grounds that it may be inconclusive, lacking credibility and that it may not “assist the court to arrive at any conclusion.” However, judge Rosyln Korir upheld a counter argument by prosecutor Alloys Kemo that the report was prepared by an expert whose evidence is admissible in law. “The office of [GovernmentChemist] is within the structure of government and its role clearly defined,” Kemo submitted in response to claims that the Government Chemi st was unqualified to present findings. Prosecution witness Wandera Bideru, a retired chemist with the government, had testified that he found traces of a deadly pesticide in samples he analysed and on clothes the deceased wore on the day he collapsed at Porkies Bar in the company of his friends who are charged with his murder. Club owner Paul Wainaina Boiyo alias Sheki, Thuo’s aide Christopher Andika alias Lumba, DJs Andrew Wainaina and Samuel Ngugi alias Visi, Esther Mulinge, a waiter and a Ruth Irungu alias Atlanta have denied poisoning the former government chief whip at Porkies in Thika Town on November 17, 2013. The six accused were arrested after investigations revealed Thuo swallowed a highly toxic chemical believed to have been mixed with his drink. The judge held that the report “cannot be dismissed as incompetent” and that the witness cannot be barred from testifying about his findings. Defence lawyers had wanted Bideru barred from proceeding to complete his testimony which included the contested report. The judge said “the challenge was premature.” Thuo, according to witnesses, had complained of feeling hot before he removed a jacket and took it to his car across the road.
