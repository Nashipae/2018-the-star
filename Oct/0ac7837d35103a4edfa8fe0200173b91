Governor Mwangi wa Iria wants to impose a 25 per cent levy on revenue from water from the Ndakaini dam (see P10). The Murang'a governor says the water levy could generate Sh2 billion a year. The levy would increase the cost of water in Nairobi but it is not unreasonable. Turkana is getting a share of oil revenues even though oil is a national resource. Shouldn't the same apply to water? However any money raised by this levy should not go to the county. It should go directly to farmers as 'payments for eco-services'. Such services could include planting trees on their land to stabilise the soil and retain water; undertaking contour farming to slow down water run-off; and protecting streams and wetlands draining into the dam. If we spent billions on protecting the water ecology of Murang'a, it would help farmers and ensure that Nairobi did not run out of water during droughts. But this levy should never be used to pay for trips for Murang'a MCAs to Mombasa. Quote of the day: "Where you see wrong or inequality or injustice, speak out, because this is your country.
