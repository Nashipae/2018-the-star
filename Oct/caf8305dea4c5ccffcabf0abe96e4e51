Netizens are puzzled as a Twitter account operating with the same name as Joseph Irungu’s Instagram account is very active, commenting about the ongoing Monicah Kimani murder case. Jowie is the main suspect in the brutal murder of the 28-year-old businesswoman. The account, @JowieJowi, has been in operation since October 2016. On Monday, one post read: “By the look of things, Jacque Maribe is still in love Joseph Irungu ... I mean deeply.” While another post read: “At the moment I am certain myself being framed... I believe I’m innocent!” Jowie and his fiancée, Jacque Maribe, have been in custody for the last three weeks. They will be presented to court today for their bail application.
