The Homa Bay county assembly was on Tuesday adjourned indefinitely following fist fights by ward representatives. Speaker Elizabeth Ayoo cited wrangles pitting members adding that the situation poses a threat to the MCAs' security. "Due to the ongoing wrangles and insecurity of members within the assembly precincts, the assembly stands adjourned indefinitely." Ayoo said she acted under her powers as the speaker of the assembly. Factions in the assembly engaged in physical and verbal fights when the members resumed sittings after a month-long recess. Police fired teargas after a group of youths stormed the assembly. The youths claimed they went to protect the office of the Majority leader. The latter is at the centre of the row. A security guard told the Star in confidence that the youths 'who sought to protect the office' entered the assembly premises by 5am. The factions are allied to Kanyadoto MCA Walter Muok and Kwabwai MCA Richard Ogindo. The two are fighting over who should be the substantive Leader of Majority of the county assembly. Chaos began when a section of MCAs led by Joan Ogada and Monoflorita Ondiek started shouting that they will only allow Ogindo to occupy the office. The MCAs engaged their counterparts allied to Muok resulting in chaos which lasted for more than three hours paralysing the assembly's business. Officers from Kendu-Bay, Rangwe, Ndhiwa, and Mbita police stations were called to help contain the situation. The situation got worse when some MCAs started throwing stones at the assembly staff members who were opposed to the violence. During the chaos, Standard Group journalist James Omoro was attacked and injured. He was caught in the melee. Cops smashed his camera. County police commander Marius Tum said they are investigating the matter and action will be taken against officers who assaulted the journalist. Click here for the latest political news
