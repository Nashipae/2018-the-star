The death of 58 people in the Kericho road accident on Moi day has once again raised questions about road carnage in the country. Government statistics show between January and October this year alone, 2,500 people have died in road accidents. As expected, many people have been quick to blame the National Transport and Safety Authority and the police. This is the easy way out, yet there are many other actors, who should also take responsibility. It is known police take bribes from public transport operators and allow them to break traffic rules. Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission should step up the fight against graft in this sector and charge the givers and takers of bribes. The Kenya National Highways Authority, Kenya Urban Roads Authority and the Transport ministry all have roles to play in ensuring safety on the road. The Police should ensure the Traffic Act is fully enforced and violators charged in court. And with the advancement of technology, we can now know road users' behaviour, the state of the vehicle and the speed at which it is being driven at any given time. Authorities can also use technology to gather a driver’s driving behaviour data — speeding, mileage and harsh harsh acceleration and braking. All these variables will then be reflected in high insurance premium.
