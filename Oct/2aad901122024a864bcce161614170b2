Odongo observed that the tournament will be good build-up for the Dubai Invitational tournament, where the Deejays have been invited. “The Safari Sevens will be a good tournament for us as we prepare for the event in Dubai event,” added Odongo. Spain and Portugal, who had confirmed participation early this month, will be joined by Apache 7s, Red Wailers, Samurai 7s, Uganda, and Burkina Faso. Kenya will field Shujaa and Morans.
