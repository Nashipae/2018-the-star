Renowned UoN Literature don Chris Wanjala has died aged 75, the family said yesterday. His son and family spokesperson Alex Wanjala said his father died at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. “We can’t authoritatively tell what led to his death, but all we can say is that he had complained of severe chest and stomach pains. He was rushed to hospital,” he said. Wanjala’s last public appearance was at a funeral of his childhood friend Julius Sindani in Chesamisi village on Saturday.  He was hailed by many as an icon revered in academic circles. He was one of Kenya’s leading literary critics and historians. Over the years, Prof Wanjala made vast contributions to the nation as a literary scholar, writer, critic and man of culture. His most recent contribution to literature is “Memories We Lost” — an anthology of short stories. Several leaders eulogised Wanjala as a great man. Click here for
