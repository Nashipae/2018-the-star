A mother lost her only two children on Tuesday evening after they were hit by a motorist in Murang’a county. Mercy Wangari’s children, Lewis Karanja, 8, and Abigael Wanjiru, 6, from Mwototo village, were with another child — Said Ngugi — who survived. Ngugi sustained serious injuries and was admitted at Kenyatta National Hospital. The children had been sent to get milk from a neighbour when the accident occurred on the newly tarmacked SabaSaba Kahumbu road. Neighbour Njoki Kamande said she was preparing supper at 6pm when she heard a loud noise from the road near her home. “I rushed out and was shocked to find the lifeless bodies of the two children sprawled on the road,” the teary neighbour said. Boda boda operators who witnessed the accident chased after the motorist and surrounded him, but officers from Maragua police station arrived in time to save him. Area MCA Eric Kamande said numerous accidents have occurred since the road was completed and accused motorists of drink driving. “We want the police to conduct tests on the motorist and establish whether he was driving under the influence of alcohol. I doubt he was sober,” he said. The accident occurred five days after three pupils from Kianderi Primary School in Kahuro subcounty were also hit by a motorist outside the school. One of the pupils died, while the other two sustained serious injuries during the accident that occurred along the Kahuro-Kangema road. Assistant chief Lucy Muthoni said the driver lost control of the car and veered off the road, hitting the students who were walking home. Locals have called it the ‘killer road’ following an increase in the number of accidents. They called for building speed bumps, especially near shopping centres and schools.
