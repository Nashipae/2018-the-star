Good Morning. The Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examination kicks off today with practical examinations. The practicals will end on November 1 with the braille and home science practical test. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this Monday as we wish all the candidates sitting their national examinations from today. How government is wasting your taxes Despite public outcry over the broadening tax burden and President Uhuru Kenyatta's tough talk on graft, a new report has exposed the lavish expenditure of billions by government agencies on non-essential goods and services. Parliament, the presidency and IEBC top the list of profligate expenditure, according to the latest report by Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo. Parliament alone gobbled Sh4.3 billion on both domestic and foreign trips, making it the single largest spender on travels. The presidency, comprising Uhuru's office, DP Ruto and the Cabinet office spent Sh725 million on local travels and a further Sh99.4 million on foreign trips. _____________________________________________________ Audit report unearths possible loss of millions at public Universities Public universities cannot account for millions of taxpayers money,  Auditor General Edward Ouko’s report indicates.

Nairobi county chief security officer Tito Kilonzi said cartels are using children to beg for money in the streets. He spoke before a joint sitting of the assembly's Justice and Legal Affairs and Children, Early Childhood Education committees. "They use children to lure people because they target the emotions aspect and people react by giving them money," Kilonzi said. _____________________________________________________ Suicides rise as economic crunch stresses Kenyans Last year, amid election tensions, Kenya had the highest inflation in five years of eight per cent. This coincided with its highest suicide rate of 421 in every 100,000 people. This year, increased taxation by a government burdened with debt has further raised the cost of living. And as times get harder, more suicides are being reported. With less money in circulation, businesses are crumbling, marriages are shattering and frustration is mounting to lethal levels. For instance, James Nderitu, 40, has attempted suicide three times since last year after his properties were auctioned by two banks for defaulting on loans. He terms financial stress “nerve-racking”.
