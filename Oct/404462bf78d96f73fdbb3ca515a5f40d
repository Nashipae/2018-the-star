Residents of Mutha area in Kitui South constituency Wednesday staged a peaceful demonstration to protest against escalating killings by bandits. About 500 demonstrators who were led by their MCA Antony Maingi and politician Cyrus Musyoka protested against frequent killings by armed camel herders of Somali decent who had encroached into their land from other counties. The street protests followed the hacking to death on Monday of an 80-year-old man at Musenge village in Mutha ward. The killers struck the village at around 10pm and slashed the elderly man to death with a machete. The murder comes less than a month after another villager from the neighboring Endau ward was allegedly killed by herders.
