More than 1,000 job opportunities have been floated by Chinese companies operating in Kenya. Chinese Embassy to Kenya Charge d’Affaires, Li Xuhang on Monday said the companies are looking to employ Kenyans holding solid professional competences with a passion for hard work and diligence. Xuhang noted that building on these critical competencies of both local and Chinese employees, a company such as the CRBC had been able to complete the SGR project well ahead of schedule. "Construction firm AVIC International has also been able to build one floor of the Global Trade Center in just 10 days," he said. He was speaking at the inaugural Kenya-China Economic and Trade Association (KCETA) Career Fair at KICC. “On behalf of the KCETA Career Fair team we are encouraging local students to take advantage of the 1,000 plus jobs offered, including three posts from the Embassy itself,” Xuhang said. Some of the firms offering jobs include China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), Sinohydro Corporation, Huawei Technologies, and AVIC International. Speaking on behalf of all companies present, Wang Yantao from SinoHydro said Chinese companies have always placed great importance on generating local employment opportunities. Chinese ambassador to Kenya Christopher Chika welcomed the Chinese companies’ commitment to deepening bilateral relations through career development opportunities. "In the economic space, more than 400 Chinese companies have been creating quality local jobs and establishing crucial skills transfer linkages for Kenya’s development agenda,” Chika said.
