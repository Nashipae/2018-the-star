Newly crowned Fiba Africa Zone Five Club champions Equity Bank have vowed to live up to expectations during the continental women’s club show this time round. Coach David Maina said he will soon embark on serious training in a bid to raise the standards ahead of the prestigious Africa club show coming up in a few weeks. He said he was satisfied with his team’s performance in the Dar-es-salaam tourney and was convinced that even with the local talent, they are bound to go places. “This time round, I promise you that we will not be going to this championships just to make up the numbers. This time round, we are going out there to make an impact,” he observed. Maina vowed to improve in his final placing in Maputo, Mozambique. Last year in Luanda, Angola, the bankers were eighth out of nine teams. Rivals Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) were fifth. He said he will not recruit any new players into the team but will work to improve the performance of the ones already in his stable so that they can be productive. “Our policy is to work with the ones we have. We have no plans to sign any new player here or outside the country. I will strive to improve the performance of those who did not live up to expectation in Dar,” he added. Maina side thumped reigning national champions KPA 70-54 to take the crown with center Belinda Okoth being named the Most valuable Player. He thanked the bank for believing in him and his players and promised to reciprocate the favour. Equity Bank, who are also unbeaten in the local league, lost to KPA during last year’s finals in Kampala, Uganda.
