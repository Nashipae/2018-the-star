Two judges have withdrawn from a case in which squatters are demanding 25,000 acres in Eldoret town. The land ownership is linked to former MP Mark Too, who died two years ago. The Eldoret International Airport and Moi University are among institutions on the land. It lies along the Eldoret-Kisumu road. Court of Appeal judges Erastus Githinji and Otieno Odek withdrew from the case, saying they had handled an almost similar matter involving the Kenya Airports Authority and squatters in Mombasa. Justice Jamila Mohammed did not withdraw. Two more judges will be appointed to join her. In 2014, Justice Anthony Obwayo of the Lands and Environment Court in Eldoret ruled the land had been allocated to Sirikwa squatters and they deserve to own it. The more than 700 squatters had gone to the court, arguing they had been given the land formerly owned by Lonrho East Africa. But Too, through his Fanikiwa Company, said they bought only 2,000 acres while the rest belongs to companies and individuals. His widows, Sophie and Mary, appealed against the High Court decision and the appeal was to be heard yesterday before the judges pulled out. Squatters who had packed the court were stunned. They have insisted on taking over the farm as ruled by the High Court.
