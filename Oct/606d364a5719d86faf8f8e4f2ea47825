Garissa governor Ali Korane yesterday relaunched the Kazi Mashinani programme in Bura, Fafi subcounty. Korane suspended the programme in October last year, saying it lacked a legal framework and funding. The suspension triggered street protests by casual workers. Former Governor Nathif Jama accused Korane of targeting the less fortunate. Nathif said the programme was meant to engage the youth and women to undertake community service at the subcounty level as one way of creating jobs. Korane said he will initiate community service and seek endorsement from MCAs. Residents cheered as the governor handed letters of appointment to selected individuals. The programme is expected to rejuvenate rural economy.
