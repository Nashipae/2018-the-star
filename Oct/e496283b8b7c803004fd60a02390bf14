Nyamira county assembly deputy speaker Duke Omoti has been reinstated by a court. The Kiabonyoru MCA was kicked out by the county assembly on August 15 after a no-confidence motion introduced by nominated MCA Abel Mokaya as passed. MCAs accused Omoti of incompetence and abuse of office. Twenty-seven out of 36 members voted for Omoti's removal. Only six supported him. On Thursday, however, Industrial and Labour Relations Court judge Mathews Nduma ordered him back in office until his suit is determined. Ekerenyo MCA Thaddeus Nyabaro said when speaker Moffat Teya travelled to Kigali, Omoti went round telling people he was disrespected because Teya appointed him (Nyabaro) acting speaker. "Honorable speaker the deputy speaker should step down because the seat is too hot for him. After all we want competent personnel," Nyabaro said. Nominated MCA Fredrick Mosiori accused Omoti of tainting Teya's name in public. "For sanity to prevail in this honourable House, the deputy speaker must go. To end divisions in this House the deputy speaker must go," he said. Omoti however accused Teya of being dictatorial. "My office has been having several challenges that I cannot mention before this House. At the same time, I want to warn the incoming deputy speaker to be aware of the challenges he will be facing in that office and also to be aware of the dictatorial aspect of our honorable speaker," he said.
