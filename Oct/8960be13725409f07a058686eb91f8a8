NEMA officials have intercepted 1.7 tonnesÂ of banned plastic bags at Mwembe Tayari Market in Mombasa. The plastic bags were impounded on Friday night, but officials released the information on Sunday. The officials confiscated the bags as they were being offloaded from a Tanzania bus at the market. Mombasa NEMA boss Stephen Wambua told the Star the bags were packed in 17 bales. "We suspect this system is the one feeding Mombasa, Kilifi and other Coastal areas," he said. The value of the plastic bags has not yet been established. Wambua urged bus operators to inspect luggage to know what they are transporting. NEMA officials and police are expected to issue a press briefing about the seizure later in the day. Click here for the latest political news
