In a statement on Thursday, Kibaki said through	music,	Kamaru	distinguished	himself	from others. "He	was	a	thought	leader whose	genius	created	multiple	reference	points	for	cultural	reflection	and	social	regeneration	for	close	to	six	decades non-stop," he said. "Kamaru	leaves	behind	a	retinue	of	notable	protégés	whose	prowess	in	creating	music	he	stoked	and	nurtured." Kibaki said Kamaru's commentary	on	social	mores	and	cultural	ethos	defines a	legacy	that	is	hard	to	match. "His grasp	of	folk wisdom, his	thoughtful	lyrics,	sagacious	witticisms and	mastery	of	the	art	of	entertaining	through	music	will	continue	to	inspire	and	impact generations to	come," he added.
