City Hall has rubbished claims of attempting to grab public land belonging to Uhuru Secondary School. Lands executive Charles Kerich said the land claimed to be targeted for grabbing is under the urban project. “Next to Uhuru Secondary School is land that was set aside for construction of houses under the urban regeneration project. The school had asked to be given part of the urban renewal land. Now it wants all the land and has lobbied some people,” he said. “There is that difference between school land and regeneration land but they are adjacent to each other.” Uhuru Estate, in Embakasi West subcounty, is among seven estates under the upgrading project. Others are Pangani, Jeevanjee, Suna Road, Old Ngara Ngong Road Estate Phase I and Ngong Road Phase II. Nairobi woman representative Esther Passaris said on Thursday she was disappointed with Nairobi governor Mike Sonko and his government for not putting a perimeter wall around the school. She said the county government wanted to grab the land. “I’m really disappointed by the county government, which has not moved in to ensure that the title deeds for Uhuru Secondary School are protected. The school had a fire and neither the governor, MP nor MCA came in because they are behind trying to grab the school,” Passaris said. In August, a fire engulfed a dormitory at the school but there were no casualties. The fire destroyed students’ belongings. Kariobangi South MCA Robert Mbatia also dismissed the allegations by Passaris. “A leader accusing other leaders without facts is unfounded,” he said. Mbatia told the Star on Friday that Uhuru Secondary School was built in 1989 on land belonging to Uhuru Primary School. There was adjacent public land used for farming. “In 2008 through then the area councilor [Mbatia himself], we asked for an extension for the school. I have all the records and documents with me,” the MCA said.
