Migori senator-elect Ochilo Ayacko’s victory has reenergised his political rivalry with Governor Okoth Obado. On Tuesday during his celebration parade across the county, Ayacko said fighting corruption in the Obado administration will be his main agenda, giving county officers two months to fix it. He said the war on graft must be devolved. “After two months, I don’t want to hear any corruption dealing in the county. That’s not a plea; it has to end. Going forward we will not allow it,” Ayacko said at Posta Grounds, Migori town. The ODM politician emerged tops in the by-election with 85,234 votes, against 60,555 for his closest challenger Eddy Oketch. The county has 388,633 registered voters, but only 38.02 per cent of that turned out to vote.

Obado has been charged with the muder of his former pregnant lover Sharon Otieno. The EACC is also investigating him over claims he embezzled public fundsand stashed some cash offshore. His accounts and those of his close family members and associates have been frozen. The county chief and his supporters campaigned for Oketch, fearing Ayacko would use the Senate position to ‘sabotage’ his administration. Obado had said Ayacko would offer no oversight. But on Tuesday, Ayacko said he will push for unity and equitable sharing of county resources so all residents can enjoy the benefits of devolution. Click here for the latest political news
