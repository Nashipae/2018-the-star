Kenya’s leading plastic surgeon has been barred from practising at the Nairobi Hospital. In an internal memo to staff in wards, theatres, ICT and security, director of medical services and research, the hospital said Prof Stanley Khainga is no longer allowed to carry out his practice at the hospital. The suspension comes after Khainga accused the hospital of negligence leading to the death of June Wanza in June this year. Wanza received breast enlargement surgery at Khainga’s Surgeoderm Clinic in Kilimani, but developed complications days later. She sought help at Nairobi Hospital and died there.
