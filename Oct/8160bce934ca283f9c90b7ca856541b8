A Vietnamese was yesterday arrested at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport carrying eight lion teeth, three lion claws and two warthog teeth. The illegal wildlife products were concealed inside a thermos flask, wrapped with foil paper in checked-in luggage. Truong Trung Hieu hoped that the luggage would pass undetected by Kenya Wildlife Services sniffer dogs which are part of the canine unit at the airport. Other than the dogs, security personnel at the airport use scanning machines to identify any illegal products. The foreigner was booked at JKIA police station, awaiting arraignment today when the courts will have found an interpreter. Click here for the latest political news
