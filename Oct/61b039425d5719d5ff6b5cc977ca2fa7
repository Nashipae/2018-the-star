A Chadian witchdoctor who allegedly conned former Garsen MP Danson Mungatana of Sh76 million has been charged with fraud and unlawful possession of Sh1 billion USD and Euros notes. Abdoulaye Tamba Kouro was accused of conning Mungatana between April 2011 and April 2013 at Kilimani, Nairobi. He obtained the cash by falsely pretending he was in a position to invest the money in an oil business. Kouro was also charged with obtaining Sh700, 000 from businessman Makau Muteke by falsely pretending he would invest for him in an undisclosed business. The man was also charged with being in possession of papers intended to resemble and pass as currency notes knowing them to be forged. He was arrested at a residential house in Westlands Nairobi by Flying Squad officers on October 1. The officers also found the foreigner with USD 54,000 in denominations of 100 and another 19,000 euros of 100 denominations. They also discovered 3,400 other pieces of Euros of 500 denominations all valued at Sh960,120, 000. Four animal skins and other paraphernalia that Kouro, his son and accomplice Abdalla Tamba used were also recovered. Kouro denied the charges before chief magistrate Francis Andayi.
