Migori county police arrested an impersonator yesterday during the ongoing KCPE exam. Kelvin Odhiambo, 17, was arrested at Matagaro Primary School in Rongo subcounty when he attempted to write the science exam for Tobias Ochieng, a private candidate registered at the school. County CID officer Benedict Kigen said officers and Knec officials noticed something was amiss during the exam. He said officers realised the candidate was different from the one they invigilated the previous day. “When they reported to police officers, Odhiambo tried to escape but was pursued and arrested,” Kigen said. He is being held at Migori police station. He will be arraigned tomorrow for impersonation. The candidate is still at large and police have launched a manhunt for him. Kigen said the arrest shows police are on high alert to end cheating in this national exam and anyone caught will face the law.
