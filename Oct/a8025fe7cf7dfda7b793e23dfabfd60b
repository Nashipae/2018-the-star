Barely three years ago, East Africans celebrated the election of President John Pombe Magufuli in Tanzania. He was acclaimed as a new broom in a region choking with official malfeasance, as he went about tackling corruption and shaking up the instruments of state. His impatience with lethargic state officers made him a legend. In Kenya his name became synonymous with efficiency and intolerance for mediocrity. Children born at the time and reformist politicians acquired his name. Not so anymore. His transformation from a reformer to a despot is now the talk across East Africa. With the harrowing tales of repression filtering out of Tanzania, citizens of the region are worried that the country is soon becoming a bastion of fear. From MPs claiming their lives are in danger to mysterious shootings, kidnappings and disappearances like the current one of Mohammed Dewji — some blamed on government or its hirelings — it is clear that space for expression is shrinking in Tanzania. Visitors to Tanzania say fear is palpable among citizens. You criticise Magufuli at your own peril, they say. East Africans must reject this unhappy turn of events in a member state. There must be basic values, governance and human rights standards to which all members subscribe, otherwise, the notion of a ‘community’ will remain a hollow mantra. These values include freedom of expression, rule of law and the right to political association and affiliation.
