Deputy President William Ruto should seek the blessings of opposition leader Raila Odinga if he ever wants to be the President, ODM has said. “Raila will decide when he retires from politics. As things stand now, he is still the force that dictates the political agenda in this country,” former Embakasi South MP Irshad Sumra said. The politicians spoke at Orange House as they congratulated Raila for his appointment as the African Union High Representative for Infrastructure and Development. “We congratulate Baba and remind noisemakers that the appointment elevated his status in local and international politics,” ODM Nairobi branch vice chairperson Ochieng Jerry said. The MPs were addressing calls by Ruto’s allies who want Raila to retire from local politics and concentrate on his new appointment to the African Union. Jubilee MPs say Raila’s new job is demanding and he should distance himself from local politics. “We are confident that Odinga will take to the continent his expertise and experience to improve infrastructure and make Africa an admirable home even to the outside world,” Mathare MP Anthony Oluoch said.
