The burial of the slain Rongo University student Sharon Otieno has been scheduled for October 19. The burial committee set the date after reaching an agreement with the family on Tuesday. Chairman Elijah Opiyo said they agreed to make arrangements for the burial as the court case continues. He said they fear the burial cost would be high if the same is delayed further. Opiyo spoke to journalists at Sharon’s parents’ home in Magare village in Homa Bay county. The committee called on well-wishers to assist them in meeting the Sh1 million budget in funeral expenses. "The amount includes the mortuary bill, cost of buying a coffin, and the money to be spent on feeding mourners," Opiyo said. The late Sharon will be buried at her grandfather’s home where her foetus' remains were interred on September 14. Sharon’s grandfather Samuel Odege appealed for peace during the burial. The decision to bury the late student at her grandfather's home is in line with Luo customs since she was not officially married. Sharon’s parents Douglas Otieno and Melida Auma reiterated their call for justice over their daughter's gruesome killing. Migori Governor Okoth Obado, his PAs Michael Oyamo, and Caspal Obiero are the key suspects in the case. The three have denied killing the student and are set to argue their bail applications on October 8. Sharon was stabbed eight times by unknown assailants. Her body was found in a thicket near Wire Forest in Oyugis.
