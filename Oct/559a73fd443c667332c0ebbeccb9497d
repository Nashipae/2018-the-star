Two photojournalists and a designer accused of publishing fake nude photos of Kakamega senator Cleopahas Malala to discredit him were yesterday set free. Chief magistrate Francis Andayi released David Ndolo, Stafford Ondego and designer Alex Mulwa after the prosecution withdrew the charges because the law had been suspended by the High Court. The three had been charged with publishing false information on Facebook and WhatsApp contrary to Section 23 of Computer Misuse and Cybercrime Act of 2018 with intent to ruin the senatorâ€™s reputation. They faced a second count of wrongful distribution of obscene and intimate images of Malala. The three, however, did not plead to the charges. On Wednesday, Malala sensationally claimed that the three had been hired by Sports CS Rashid Echesa to manipulate his pictures and portray him in a compromising position. They were arrested on October 23 and locked up at KICC police station but released on police bond on Wednesday.
