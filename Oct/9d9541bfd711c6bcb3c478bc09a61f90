The Kenya Ports Authority on Monday sponsored a Sh1.7 million free medical camp in Magarini where ailments such as cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure were discovered. Hundred of residents were screened at Bomani where 20 women were found to have a precancerous cervical condition and three others with cervical cancer. Dr Jao Majimbo who led the medical team said one patient had lymphoma and others had rheumatic and congenital heart diseases. One case was referred to Mombasa for further tests. Majimbo said a 10-year-old girl was found with dry eye syndrome, a unique but treatable disease. “The girl will require a cornea transplant. She currently uses one eye,” Majimbo said. KPA head of corporate affairs Bernard Osero said the authority spent Sh1.7 million to sponsor the medical camp.
