Scientists in the UK and The Gambia say they have the first evidence that dogs can sniff out malaria. They have trained dogs to recognise tell-tale aromas using clothes from people infected with the disease. It is hoped the animals can be used to stop malaria spreading and eventually help with eradication. Although the research is still at an early stage, experts say the findings may even lead to new ways of testing for the disease. Studies have already shown that being infected with the malaria parasite changes our aroma to make us more attractive to the mosquitoes that spread the disease. Now dogs are on the scent, too. Socks worn overnight by children in the Upper River Region of The Gambia, in West Africa, were packaged and shipped to the UK. Of the 175 pairs sent, 30 had been worn by children infected with the parasite. The smelly footwear arrived at the Medical Detection Dogs charity in Milton Keynes. The supremely talented noses there are already being trained to sniff out cancer and even the early stages of Parkinson's disease. When it came to spotting malaria, the results, presented at the annual conference of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, showed dogs could pick out seven in 10 samples from infected children.
