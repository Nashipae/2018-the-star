A man in Kianderi village in Murang'a has hacked to death his two grandfathers. Kanyuko Wairimu, 26, first attacked Stephen Kanyuko and then proceeded to murder his elder brother Ephraim Kamau. The suspect’s mother also sustained injuries as she tried to save her father in law. The incident took place on Thursday night. Neighbours said Kanyuko walked into his grandfather’s house at midnight armed with a panga and hacked him to death. He then turned to his grandfather’s brother who was visiting and cut him several times on the head. The two victims were to attend a friend’s burial in the neighbouring Iyego village in Kangema sub-county on Friday. Kamau passed away as he was being rushed to Kenyatta National Hospital where he was referred after receiving first aid at Muriranjas hospital. Two other relatives who tried to stop the suspect are nursing injuries at Muriranjas hospital. Police arrested the man on Friday morning after he fled to a neighbouring village. Peter Kago, a neighbour, said the suspect has been using drugs for a long time. “Kanyuko is a known bhang smoker and has tried to commit suicide twice,” Kago said. Kahuro Deputy County Commissioner Wilberforce Kilonzo said after receiving distress calls from the village, they mounted a search that led to the arrest of the suspect. Police also recovered the murder weapon. Click here for the latest political news
