Jubilee leaders in Bungoma have accused Senator Moses Wetang’ula of failing to oversight the executive and double-speak in his quest for the presidency. They included Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa and former Kenya Revenue Authority director Evans Kakai. “We want him to have a stand. He should not just say he will vie for the presidency for the sake of it, knowing very well he will pull out at the last minute,” Barasa said. Barasa said they don’t need people out to “auction” them, but leaders who mean what they say. “We should not become a laughing stock by a self-centred individual,” the MP said. Barasa urged Wetang’ula to make a decision that would revive him politically so he is not seen as an undecided politician. “Wetang’ula should swallow his pride and work with Deputy President William Ruto,” the MP said. He said matters of the presidency are not for the faint-hearted and the senator does not appear to be serious about running for the top seat. Barasa spoke in Makutano village during the burial of a Jubilee supporter Catherine Naliaka. Kakai said Wetang’ula has failed to oversight Governor Wycliffe Wangamati, though he did monitor former Governor Kenneth Lusaka. “Wetang’ula is a bit slow in undertaking his legislative role and oversighting the current governor. He should act tough on Wangamati,” he said. Kakai said Wetang’ula has chosen to “relax” while residents, who expect to get services from the government, suffer. In August, Wetang’ula urged Kenyans to stand with him in his quest for the presidency. “I want to form a government with others or others to form a government with Weta,” he said. “Either way, I must lead my people to greater prosperity to run the country’s affairs in a better fashion.”
