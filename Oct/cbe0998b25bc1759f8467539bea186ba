Loitokitok Nol-Turesh water company is losing Sh3 million every month to pipeline vandalism, Kajiado commissioner David Kipkemei has said. Kipkemei attributed the acute water shortage in the county to vandalism and illegal connection to farms. “We have established that most of those plundering the resource are former sacked workers of the company who were paid their dues and shown the door for various malpractices,” Kipkemei said on the phone. The commissioner said he has instructed directorate of criminal investigations, police and chiefs to arrest and prosecute the known suspects. County Water CEC Florence Waiganjo said Nol-Turesh produces 11,700 cubic metres daily against the required 18,693 cubic meters to supply 5,680 active homes in Makueni and Kajiado. Waiganjo said the company used to collect approximately Sh5 million per month in water rates but the figure has since declined to Sh2 million. Other than the now hard-hitting water shortage that cuts across Makueni and Kajiado counties, Nol-Turesh Water and Sanitation Company has in the past been dogged by embezzlement of funds allegations.
