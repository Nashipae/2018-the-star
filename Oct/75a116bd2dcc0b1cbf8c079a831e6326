Gas drilling on Pate Island in Lamu East has now reached 3,700 metres deep out of the intended 4,500 metres. The drilling by the Zarara Oil and Gas Limited, a subsidiary of Midway Resources International, is worth Sh2.6 billion and the work started in April. Speaking in Lamu on Tuesday, country manager Peter Nduru said they have not faced no major challenges. “We are now at 3,700 metres and progressing well.By end of October, we will have done 4,500 metres. We will then evaluate the quality and quantity of the gas deposits, if any, then decide on whether to proceed to the next well,”said Nduru. He said the drilling of the Pate-2 Well will be complete by end of this month, after which they will decide o whether or not to proceed to drill Pate-3, depending on commercial quality of the gas. He said the arrival of a bigger rig in June this year will enable them drill up to 4,500 metres deep. The rig was imported from Tunisia. The drilling is being done on block L4 and L13, which are  close to the Sh2.5 trillion Lapsset project. Nduru said if found to be adequate, the gas will boost the functioning of the Lapsset through increased power generation.
