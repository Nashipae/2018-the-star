Fresh from finishing Kenya Volleyball Federation regular season unbeaten, champions Kenya Pipeline women’s team have started indoor training sessions in earnest in readiness for the next month’s play-offs at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani. The play-offs return to Kasarani on November 30 to December 2 after years of being staged in Mombasa. The back-to-back champions overpowered rivals Kenya Prisons 3-1 in their last match of the season to seal the regular league with 27 points. Team captain Triza Atuka said they are keen to make it five in a row when the playoffs are staged.  “The best thing is that we have started early training at the same venue where the event will be staged. We have one month to prepare and adapt and we look forward to a good run,” said the reigning Africa best blocker. She added: “We just want to put in our best and play good volleyball. This, I know can only happen when all our departments are in insync.” For the oilers to lift the trophy a fifth time in a row, they have to contend with their bitter rivals Kenya Prisons who finished second on the log with 23 points and league returnees Bungoma County who toppled Kenya Commercial Bank from their traditional third position. Bungoma County finished third with 18 points same as the bankers but the County-funded outfit had a superior set ratio. The matches will be played on a round-robin format and whoever will win all the ties will carry the day. In the men’s category, champions General Service Unit, their local nemesis Kenya Prisons, Kenya Ports Authority and Kenya Defence Forces will battle for the title. KDF makes a return to the play-off having missed last season.
