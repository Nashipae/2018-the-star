The Kenya National Union of Teachers has denied walking out of a Naivasha retreat with the Teachers Service Commission. Knut instead accused the TSC of lying after failing to resolve grievances raised by teachers. “We have been shocked by the TSC statement and we are giving them 14 days to address the teachers’ grievances or they shall face the consequences,” Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion said. The teachers are demanding an immediate end to transfer of teachers away from their home counties, promotion of more than 30,000 others and an immediate stop to ongoing performance appraisals, among others. Sossion, who spoke in Naivasha, denied claims the union walked out of the meeting as alleged by the TSC. He said TSC commissioners asked for more time to review the teachers’ demands afresh. Flanked by senior union officials Sossion said they will not stand down on their demands, which include the cancellation of transfers of several union officials. “The TSC has knowingly and silently transferred 110 union officials from different parts of the country with a view of weakening Knut, but we shall not be cowed,” he said. Sossion accused the commission of ignoring the directive by the head of state to suspend the delocalisation of head teachers. He said the transfers are ongoing and have affected families and teachers’ morale. “We want to tell Kenyans that the commission has failed terribly in addressing this issue and it should be held responsible if teachers decide to take the next move,” Sossion said.
