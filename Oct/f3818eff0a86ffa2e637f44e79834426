The death of 56 people in a horrific accident in Londiani yesterday has put the National Transport and Safety Authority and the Kenya Bureau of Standards on the spot for failing to implement body construction standards. The bus overturned at the Fort Ternan, Kericho county, and its entire roof was ripped off , raising questions about the quality of the body. The Western Cross Express Sacco driver lost control of the vehicle at 5am. NTSA said it had put in place measures to reverse the trend, one of them being the improvement of the quality of PSV bodies. In July last year, NTSA and KEBS introduced new PSV designs, saying PSV buses have poorly designed spaces between the seats. The detailed standards requirements are, however, not adhered to. In 2013, another major accident occurred in Ntulele accident claiming 42 lives. The body of the bus sheared off , while its structure collapsed. A similar tragedy occurred in Kambu in April, taking 27 people. Experts in the transport industry raised an alarm over the quality of PSV bodies, saying a strong body can cut fatalities by up to 70 per cent in an accident. In 2015, transporters raised concern that most PSV buses were fi tted with ‘truck chassis’ by the manufacturers. The chassis consists of the lower frame on which the body is mounted. In 2016, the Kenya Association of Manufacturers cited poor quality of bus bodies and chassis as one cause of road accidents. In 2018, a bus plunged into the Siyabei River, killing 17 people in Narok. Most accidents occur due to poor roads, human error and bad weather. It is estimated that at least 3,000 lives are lost annually in Kenyan road crashes.
