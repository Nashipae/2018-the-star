Central Organization of Trade Unions secretary general Francis Atwoli on Wednesday paid a courtesy call on retired President Daniel arap Moi at his Kabarak home. Mzee Moi held talks with Atwoli for one and half hours which focused on national unity. "Peaceful coexistence among Kenyans is key to social and economic progress," Moi said in a statement to newrooms through his communication handler Alex Chepkoit. Atwoli was accompanied by Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa and Tiaty MP William Kamket. The Cotu boss thanked Moi for leaving the country united and peaceful. He said the organisation is indebted to the former Head of State because of his kindness and support. Atwoli said Cotu will hold to his rallying call of peace, love and unity. On August 25, Mombasa governor Hassan Joho visited the retired leader at Kabarak. He was welcomed by Baringo senator and Moi's son Gideon. What was discussed remains unclear because they held a closed-door meeting. On April 12, ODM leader Raila Odinga also visited Moi. Previously President Uhuru Kenyatta also visited Mzee Moi. However, on May 4, Deputy President William Ruto was unable to see the former President at Kabarak. Moi's family reportedly said it had not received earlier notification of DP Ruto's visit, and that the old man who had a knee injury, was being attended to by his doctors. Ruto has indicated his ambitions to vie for presidency to take over after Uhuru's term ends in 2022. Click here for the latest political news
