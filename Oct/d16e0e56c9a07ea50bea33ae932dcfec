Scramble for grazing grounds, conflict over administrative boundaries and political incitement are the issues fueling clashes in Marsabit county, a bishop has said. There are also reports of displacement of some communities to tilt the forthcoming census results for eventual favourable boundaries review by the electoral commission. The three predominant communities - Borana, Gabra and Rendille - want to occupy Saku, the only tropical area with fertile land for farming and green grass for grazing. Saku constituency hosts the county headquarters but has a desert at North Horr and tropical climate in Saku. Political leaders, peace building NGOs and religious leaders from the county have already formed forums to spearhead peace initiatives as the state cracks the whip on heavyweights seen as inciting communities to violence. A total of 14 people have already been killed since the clashes broke out in September with herds of cattle stolen, hundreds of residents displaced and property destroyed. Read: Marsabit clashes: MPs Chachu Ganya, Ali Rasso released on Sh250,000 bail Yesterday, Marsabit ACK bishop Qampicha Wario confirmed the interclan clashes are largely attributed to scramble for resources, politics and feuds over demarcation of administrative boundaries. The bishop said the three communities are tussling over the location of some resources with either side laying claim to grazing fields and water sources, sparking cyclic deadly clashes. Regarding the state’s decision to arrest and charge MPs Dido Rasso (Saku) and Chachu Nganya (North Horr), Wario said the action came too late when leaders from the warring communities had already reconciled people. “While we want to applaud the government efforts to protect lives and properties, what it did should have happened 50 days ago before the skirmishes started,” he told the Star.
