Nairobi regional commissioner Kang’ethe Thuku has appealed to youths with illegal guns in Eastlands to surrender them to police. He said the government is aware of the rampant criminal activities in the area, caused by youths with illegal guns. Thuku said is those with the guns fail to surrender them, the government will apply force to disarm them. “The government is committed to keeping citizens and their properties safe. We will not allow criminals to terrorise residents here in Eastlands,” he said. The commissioner said those who will hand over their weapons will be rehabilitated and engaged in income-generating activities to earn a living. Thuku also said there is an increase in cases of drug abuse and illegal gambling in the slums, which encourage the youth to engage in crime. He warned drug peddlers and prohibited gambling traders will face the full force of the law. “Betting and use of illegal drugs influence our children into criminal activities and this is unacceptable. We have the responsibility to destroy these gambling machines and shisha apparatus,” Thuku said. He spoke at Camp Toyoyo Grounds in Makadara subcounty on Friday. Thuku was invited to witness the burning of gambling machines and shisha apparatus. Nairobi county security officials seized 324 gambling machines and 239 shisha smoking equipment from 11 subcounties. The machines were set ablaze at the grounds. Thuku urged residents to use the Mulika Uhalifu platform, a location-based crime monitoring and reporting system to improve security. The platform enables the public to report criminal cases through text messages sent to code 22068. The text message is received by all security agents in Nairobi region. Thuku said Mulika Uhalifu is efficient and will help the security team to coordinate operations and respond to emergencies fast. To send the text, residents are required to begin with their county name then proceed to their specific location and give the information.
