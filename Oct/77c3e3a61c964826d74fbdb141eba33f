Leaders from Mandera yesterday joined hundreds of Rhamu residents in Mandera North to celebrate five years of peaceful coexistence between the Garre and the Degodia. In 2013, Rhamu town was the epicentre of bloody clashes, suffering the worst spate of interclan conflict that left several people dead and property destroyed. In the run-up to the 2013 General Election there was a stiff competition between the Garre and Degodia communities for the Mandera North MP seat. Subsequent post-election violence erupted across the subcounty. Yesterday, residents and leaders converged in the town to celebrate peaceful coexistence. During the celebrations, several individuals who played an integral role in bringing peace were honoured. The Sala market that was razed during the skirmishes, but reconstructed by the county, was reopened. The county has built more than 700 houses for families whose homes were burnt during the clashes. Leaders present included Mandera governor Ali Roba, Senator Mohamed Mohamud, MPs Abdi Mude (Lafey), Mohamed Omar (Mandera East), Bashir Abdullahi (Mandera North), Aden Sheikh (Mandera South), EALA legislator Aden Noor and former constitutional adviser to the President, Abdikadir Aden. The leaders emphasised the need to maintain peace, which they said is important for development. Governor Roba said the coexistence between the two communities shows the strides the county has made in peace-building. “We appreciate the effort of all actors. Without them, we would not have reached this far,” Roba said. Lafey MP Abdi Mude urged residents to maintain peace so development can be realised
