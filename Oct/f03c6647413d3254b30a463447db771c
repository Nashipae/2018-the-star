Four Members of Parliament want President Uhuru Kenyatta to crack the whip on individuals delaying payment of Sh1.4 billion owed to maize farmers. They are Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills), Silas Tiren (Moiben), Josh Kandie (Baringo Central), and Sammy Seronei (Nominated). The lawmakers on Wednesday said thatÂ Cabinet Secretaries Mwangi Kiunjuri and his Treasury counterpart Henry Rotich have let down farmers. Speaking at Parliament Buildings, they criticised the CSs for their repeated empty promises. "We are telling the President to take this matter seriously because it will soon turn into a disaster. The real culprits in the maize crisis should be arrested," Tiren said. "Are maize farmers being frustrated because this is the only well-paying sector in agriculture? The President should address this matter urgently."

But farmers have not received any cash. More than 500 farmers are waiting for their dues after supplying maize to the National Cereals and Produce Board. "I think there is a deliberate attempt to sabotage local maize production. The government have borrowed nearly Sh6 trillion yet we are killing local production of maize to attract more foreign aid," Keter said. The lawmakers said small-scale farmers have not paid school fees for their children because of the delayed payment. "Why are the CSs' engaging in a public relation by making empty promises to pay farmers?" Seronei asked. Click here for the latest political news
