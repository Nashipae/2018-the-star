Do you remember the fussing that preceded the imminent arrival of ‘visitors'? The rule remained 'be on your best behaviour'. However, this was not what netizens exhibited after a tweet by top CNN anchor Richard Quest on the non-functioning streelights replaced by police officers. "The roundabouts have new traffic lights; which are usually switched off. Instead, a policeman directs the traffic flow. The jams are extraordinary," Quest tweeted. The tweet came hardly a day after the visiting journalist mounted praise on Nairobi's hospitality. On Wednesday, Quest faced the reality of the Nairobi city traffic menace. In 2017, a study rated it as the second-worst city in the world on traffic congestion. Kenyans, responding to the tweet, urged city dwellers "not to air their dirty linen in public." Other disgruntled netizens blamed Governor Mike Sonko for the long hours spent on traffic while a group took the opportunity to compare Nairobi with other cities. Chahiru Albert Sote, a twitter user, said: "It's okay so a visitor comes into your house and comments about anything that is not in order." Another user, Dan Bickeez‏, said: "The biggest problem now in Kenya is such a mindset that wants to be sugar-coated and praised all the time. Surely, if you come to a country where it takes 1 hour to cover 6kms, wont you be shocked!" Sam Gichuru added: "The shame you feel every time a visitor tweets something that's not working in Kenya then Kenyan children compete to give them a list of other things that are not working. If we visited your shags & made such a comment, would you pour out your family issues?" "We can keep hiding the mediocrity that is some of our systematic failures. However, the reality is that Kenya has lots of opportunities but we must clean our act and hold the government accountable," Shiru Mwangi said. Click here for the latest political news
