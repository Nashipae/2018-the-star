Kajiado county commissioner David Kipkemei on Tuesday night rescued a KCPE candidate hours after she had been married off. The rescue was done at midnight, hours before the 14-year-old girl could sit for her exam. Kipkemei said the pupil, who was expected to be part of rehearsals on Monday was missing and teachers immediately alerted a local chief. “We received a tip-off from the neighbours of her parents. I am happy to report that we managed to secure her and she is now sitting her class 8 examination at the centre,” Kipkemei said. Meanwhile, police in Kajiado on Monday arrested a watchman at Bissil Girls Secondary School as he attempted to sneak in some examination documents. Deputy county commissioner, Charles Wambugu, said the suspect is with the DCI.
