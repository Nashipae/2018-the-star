Flamboyant Kisii politician Don Bosco Gichana who returned home on Friday has kept both friends and foes guessing over his next move. Gichana contested the Kitutu Chache South seat but lost to current MP Richard Onyonka. Speculation is rife that he might again contest the seat in 2022 or go for another post. However, Gichana is playing his cards close to his chest. “This is not time for politics. I want to bond with my children. They would not identify me when I came from Tanzania. I thank my wife for taking good care of my children,” said Gichana during his mother Celine Nyaboke’s memorial mass at their home. Nyaboke died on May 2, 2016, when Gichana was in prison. The service was held at Rikenye in Marani, Kitutu Chache North constituency. Speaking to the Star, Gichana added, “My political foes tried to stop me from accessing Gusii Stadium but i want to ask them not to panic because it’s too early,” he added. Gichana declared that he is now a reformed man. “I will not do the bad things that I used to do. I will now focus on doing only good things,” he said without elaborating. The politician rose to fame when he donated a Hummer to former Prime Minister Raila Odinga. He held a rally at Gusii Stadium accompanied by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi, Arusha Urban MP Godbless Lema and Nyaribari Chache politician Zaheer Jhanda.
