Kenya is moving towards solving perennial land issues with the formation of the National Technical Committee. It is tasked with implementation of the National Land Use Policy. The policy, launched in June, provides legal, administrative, institutional and technical frameworks for optimal and sustainable use of land at county and national levels. It is premised on the philosophy of economic productivity, social responsibility, environmental sustainability and cultural conservation. Despite being the most productive factor of production, land remains an emotive and divisive issue. Rapid urbanisation, inadequate land use planning, unsustainable agricultural and industrial production methods, poor environmental and cultural practices have continued to characterise use of land. Ministry senior physical planner Arthur Mbatia said, “There is the issue of population pressure, massive soil erosion due to poor land use and variability of climatic patterns.” Shortage of water and pasture during drought has also intensified conflict in some areas due to poor land use policy aggravated by the changing climate. On industrial development, Mbatia said there has been incompatibility in land use. “In areas where mining takes place, there is failure to rehabilitate such areas,” he said. Mbatia said the process of land acquisition, relocation and compensation has in most cases resulted in a clash between the resulting land uses, affected people and developers. Conflict between human and wildlife has also escalated. National director of physical planning Augustine Masinde warned that without proper planning, the momentum of attaining the Big Four agenda will be affected.
