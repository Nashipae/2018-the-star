Nairobi county government will inspect food at all entry points to the city to guarantee their safety and quality, Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has said. He said this at an ASK luncheon at the Nairobi International Trade Fair on Wednesday. The Governor said most of the food consumed in Nairobi comes from outside the county as the city lacks adequate agricultural land. Sonko said they are also developing and piloting the Nairobi Food Market Information System to improve the efficiency of the food system. "This aims to make quality and safe food more accessible at an affordable price to all. Using technology, we want to make it easier for consumers to access market information as this would give them more choices when shopping for foodstuff," he said. He added that the county now has a dedicated Directorate of Food Systems and Sector Coordination whose primary responsibility is to drive the agenda of food security. He said the Directorate is in the process of developing a comprehensive Nairobi Food System Strategy as part of the plan. Sonko further said his Administration is adopting an Urban Early Warning and Early Action initiative on food security surveillance. The plan was developed in collaboration with the Kenya Red Cross, Concern Worldwide, and Oxfam to detect the food situation in the city. "This system allows us to predict food shortages early enough to allow the county government to intervene whenever vulnerable members of the population face challenges." Nairobi has also developed and passed the Nairobi City County Urban Agriculture Promotion and Regulation Act. The law is hailed for doing away with the by-laws that were prohibiting agriculture in the city. "This law now allows us to use modern technologies suitable for an urban setting to get maximum yields," Sonko said. Click here for the latest political news
