The state has filed an application to have the bond terms of one of the two suspects charged with the attempted murder of former Garissa Finance executive Idriss Mukhtar reviewed. Assistant DPP Catherine Mwaniki and DCI sergeant Peter Kanagi say there are compelling reasons indicating Mohamud Aden may require protection if not placed under custody pending conclusion of the trial. But Aden’s lawyer Danstan Omari said he is not interested in the state offer. “We presume he is protected. My client isn’t interested,” Omari said. Mwaniki said they have warned Aden to be careful. The prosecutor sought to have the application heard in camera but chief magistrate Francis Andayi declined. He said it is unnecessary because Aden has been informed of the state’s concern, but does not want be taken into custody. Andayi said it is up for the state to stop the threats. Aden and his alleged wife Julliet Njoki are charged with attempting to kill Mukhtar on August 19 in Kileleshwa and conspiring to kill lawyer Charles Kanjama between July 1 and September 27. They have denied the charges and are out on bond.  Click here for the latest political news
