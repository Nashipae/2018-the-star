Kibwezi East MP Jessica Mbalu has urged the government to compensate families whose relatives have been killed by wild animals in Mtito Andei and those whose crops have been destroyed. She said on Thursday that more than 15 families have lost their loved ones to attacks by wild animals in the past three weeks, especially in Subati and near Lukenya University. Mbalu said the animals have also destroyed crops and farmers have suffered huge losses. County KWS warden Constance Mwasho on Friday said they were taking stock of the losses. He said they would also deploy KWS officers to the new police post to contain the animals. Mbalu said past victims were not paid. “Our people have been killed and crops destroyed by wildlife and no compensation has been given. Learning in schools has been disrupted because the animals roam freely,” she said during a baraza attended by county commissioner Mohamed Maalim at Subati market. Maalim opened a new police post in Lukenya University. Lukenya University academic registrar Paul Mwania said the institution has also suffered the brunt of the animals. He said their pawpaw plantation has been left in ruins. Mwania said the animals continue to pose a big threat to students. Maalim said the government has a duty to provide security to communities and investors, and protect their property. He praised the university for building the post and police housing units. “We’re happy with the accommodation the officers have been given. When the government comes closer to wananchi, good things happen and only criminals aren’t happy,” he said.
