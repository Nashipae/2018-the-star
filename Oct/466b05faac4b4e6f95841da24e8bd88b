Activists and University of Nairobi students in Mombasa held a peaceful demonstration on Friday to denounce the killing of Samuel Odemba by a mob. Odemba was a UoN law student. He was lynched on Monday morning in a case of alleged mistaken identity. Mombasa deputy governor William Kingi, Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir, Muslims for Human Rights, Law Society of Kenya, Haki Yetu and student organisations members marched on the streets and asked police to arrest the culprits. They presented their petition to Urban OCPD. Odemba is reported to have been killed by boda boda riders when he was leaving a bar in Kisauni. Kingi said insecurity is on the rise, especially in this constituency. “People appear to have lost trust in police,” he said.

Nassir alleged Sungu Sungu group carried out the killing. “The outfit must be disbanded,” he said. He asked police to act swiftly when distress call is made. “We also appeal to Inspector General of police to deal with indiscipline cops. Not all are bad, but few elements tend to soil their reputation,” the MP said. Muhuri rapid response officer Francis Auma said at least four cases of mob lynching have been reported in the last one week. “The current state of security in Mombasa is wanting. Before Odemba’s death, two high School students were also killed in the same manner and in the same area,” Auma said. “Police must publicly clarify that acts of mob justice are illegal and will be punished.” Click here for the latest political news
