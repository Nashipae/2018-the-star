Two people were killed following fresh bandit attacks in Kapedo on Sunday amid concerns of unending conflict at the border of Baringo and Turkana counties. Ruto Lomerisia and Kanyaria Domokamar were shot dead at Ameyan market while two others were seriously injured. Akoret assistant county commissioner Wycliffe Ochola on Monday said the cause of the attack is unknown. He said bandits ambushed herdsmen from one of the fighting communities. The attacked group was taking their livestock to the market for sale. "There was a fierce exchange of fire. Cheplengin Domokamar and an unidentified bandit were injured," Ochola said. The two were taken to Baringo county referral hospital in Kabarnet and Kapedo hospital in Turkana. Ochola said it took the intervention of the Kenya Defence Forces soldiers at Chesitet camp, police and National Police Reservists to repulse the bandits.
