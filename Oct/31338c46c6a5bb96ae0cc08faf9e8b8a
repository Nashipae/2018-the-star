Kisumu MCAs on Tuesday afternoon disrupted assembly proceedings to protest alleged mistreatment of some members of the speaker’s panel. Nyalenda B MCA Joseph Olale brought the House to a standstill as he shouted at temporary speaker Roy Samo. Olale accused speaker Onyango Oloo of edging out some members of the speaker’s panel from chairing the session. Panel members are Caren Muga (nominated), Victor Rodgers (Migosi) and Erick Agolla (South West Kisumu). Oloo declined to take orders from the temporary speaker, calling him a stranger since he is not in the panel but chairman of the House Implementation committee. The serjeant-at-arms failed to throw out the unruly members. The chaos caught visiting Kiambu MCAs unawares. They were on a benchmarking trip. Olale said nominated MCA Muga was scheduled to chair the session  but her name was allegedly struck out on the speaker’s orders. Muga was unhappy she was not allowed to chair the session. “When I asked why I was not allowed to chair the session, the speaker told me that I was still being watched,” she said. “If there is anything I have done, why can’t it be tabled in this House because I don’t understand this.” Majority leader Kenneth Odhiambo asked the speaker to put his House in order, saying some of the issues raised ought to be solved in the speaker’s office and not in the assembly. Odhiambo advised temporary speaker Samo to leave the chair and allow another member of the speaker’s panel to chair the session. “If I were you I would take leave from the chair to be absolved from the activities that just took place in the assembly before I return,” he said. Last month, chaos hit the assembly following a plan to impeach speaker Onyango Oloo.
