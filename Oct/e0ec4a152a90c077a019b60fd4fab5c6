Suba North MP Millie Odhiambo has called a meeting for Homa Bay ODM lawmakers and wrangling MCAs following a directive by party leader Raila Odinga. The leaders are expected to iron out differences that have engulfed the county assembly. Millie did not give the date and venue. On Tuesday last week, some MCAs assaulted Homa Bay Speaker Elizabeth Ayoo. And on Friday during the burial of former chairman for South Nyanza County Council Akech Chieng’, Raila told MCAs to stop fighting over power. He said the feuding in Homa Bay, Kisumu, Kakamega and Nyeri counties is embarrassing. “MCAs cannot continue fighting over minor issues and ignore development. I want the dispute in Homa Bay solved quickly by Millie,” Raila said. Millie said she is ready for the task. The MP was addressing Homa Bay residents during Mashujaa Day celebrations held at Kamasengre Primary School in her constituency. She said the 2022 politics is to blame for the wrangles. “We should work for our people first before looking for bigger political seats,” the MP said. MCAs are fighting over the Majority leader's position. There are two factions in the assembly, one supporting Kanyadoto MCA Walter Muok and the other backing his Kwabwai counterpart Richard Ogindo. The leaders expected at the meeting are John Mbadi (Suba South),  Adipo Okuome (Karachuonyo), Martine Owino (Ndhiwa), Ong’ondo Were (Kasipul) and Eve Obara (Kabondo Kasipul). Others are Lillian Gogo (Rangwe), Peter Kaluma (Homa Bay Town), Homa Bay woman representative Gladys Wanga and Senator Moses Kajwang’. Millie is one of the senior MPs in Homa Bay county.
