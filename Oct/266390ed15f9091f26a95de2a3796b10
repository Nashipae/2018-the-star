Kenya Red cross Society has begun building houses for 6,654 households in 28 counties that were affected by floods. The agency is using the Sh1 billion allocated by the national government at the height of heavy rains in April. The houses, for the affected 40,000 people, will be put up on higher grounds away from the lower zones which are prone to floods. Secretary General Abbas Gullet said said they identified 28 counties out of the 38 which were affected by the floods. He spoke during the launch in Garashi, Magarini sub-county. Several Kilifi leaders were present at the function. Abbas said out of the Sh1 billion the KRCS set aside Sh600 million for the reconstruction of houses. He said they spent Sh100 million on water while Sh70 million was spent on other issues. "We have begun phase two of the process of assisting the flood victims return to their homes," he said. In Magarini, at least 1,223 households will each get 20 iron sheets, five ridges, and 25 bags of cement. Some of the material was distributed on Thursday. Cement will be delivered in due course. Abbas said the beneficiaries identified land for the works. "Our target is to ensure all houses are completed before the heavy rains expected this season," he said. President Uhuru Kenyatta had earlier asked the implementers to ensure the money reaches those who lost their property in the floods. Click here for the latest political news
