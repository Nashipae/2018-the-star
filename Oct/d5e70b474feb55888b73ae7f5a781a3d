Luhya unity talks dominated the burial of renowned scholar Chris Wanjala on Saturday with leaders promising to front one of their own for president in 2022. ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetang’ula, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa, Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka and MPs Eseli Simiyu (Tongaren) and Didimus Barasa (Kimilili) said Luhya unity must be achieved for the good of the community. They said they will not accept to be used by other communities as voting machines in 2022. Mudavadi said Luhyas have previously supported other communities and parties to ascend to power without benefiting from government. “Our unity is not only about us getting together and then going to submit ourselves to our competitors. This should be about getting our community to power. Let this be understood clearly,” Mudavadi said. Musalia said he, Wetang’ula and Eugene have been subjected to ridicule despite supporting Nasa and Jubilee. “How is it that we can give our best to others and forget to give our best to ourselves?” he said. Wetang’ula said Luhya leaders must walk the talk on unity. “We must define our position in the 2022 politics and move together so that we can be respected by other regions,” Wetang’ula said. Lusaka called for respect and trust for the unity to be achieved. “We should not be busy back-stabbing each other but should be one another’s keeper,” Lusaka said. Professor Wanjala, 74, died after a long battle with diabetes.
