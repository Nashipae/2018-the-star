Journalist Jacque Maribe is still an employee of Royal Media Services despite the murder charge she is facing. The company has written to the High Court saying it supports her release on bail. Maribe and her fiance Joseph 'Jowie' Irungu have denied killing Monica Kimani at her apartment in Kilimani on September 19. On Thursday, RMS Managing Director Wachira Waruru in a statement said Maribe has had a clean record adding that her character over the years is not questionable. “Having engaged her for the last six years, and assessing her performance, we hereby vouch for her character and recommend for her admission to bail,” he said. Waruru said that Maribe has taken leave “to attend to personal issues" and further recommended that she be released as she will not jump bail. "Due to her exceptional performance she has been appointed to the position of Friday's prime time news anchor on the station," he said. "She joined the company as a reporter on Citizen Television and was later promoted to the position of senior reporter on the same station. Arising from the promotion, she was assigned huge national and international events which she undertook successfully." On Wednesday, Maribe's lawyers rejected a bid by the DPP to stop the Citizen TV anchor from presenting news. State counsel Catherine Mwaniki argued that the anchor should not appear on the screen as she would influence some of the witnesses in the murder case. The prosecutor argued that Maribe should further be grounded so that she does not mingle with members of the public. But Maribe's lawyer Katwa Kigen said the anchor has demonstrated cooperation. He said this should go into informing the judge's discretion. The court will rule on the bail application on Tuesday next week.
