Dandora Hip Hop City held Kenya’s first hip hop marathon over the weekend at the Kenya National Archives grounds. Participants included Juliani, Cypher and
several underground artistes. Over 130 artists had registered to participate in the event, with each artiste performing for at least 10 minutes. DHC founder Julius Owino, alias Juliani, said the hip hop marathon
offers the first-ever social entrepreneurship approach for young and
upcoming artistes’ personal development. “We are happy about the marathon. We grew up in the ghetto and found a voice in hip hop. I
believe this platform is ideal for upcoming artistes to showcase their
talent as they kick-start their music career,” he said. “Investing in an artiste’s personal development eventually leads to
their overall career growth and the development of their brand.”
