Failure to repay car loans and mortgages by past Kakamega MCAs has returned to haunt the current county assembly leadership. Out of the Sh440 million given to past MCAs, only Sh190 million has been recovered. The cash is supposed to be part of a revolving fund and defaulters have made it hard for some current MCAs to get loans. On Tuesday, a group of MCAs locked the doors to speaker Morris Buluma, finance director Laban Atemba and clerk Patrick Kamwesser’s offices with wooden planks to protest failure by the assembly leadership to address their welfare. They then ejected Buluma who gained entry into his office under police guard and installed Sango MCA Ken Kilwake in temporary capacity. MCAs Farouk Majanje (Khayega) and Job Mwamto (Sheywe) said the assembly leadership had embezzled the money meant for mortgages. The ward reps further claimed the assembly leadership had refused to produce a bank statement on the revolving fund. But Buluma described his ouster as inconsequential and said he was still in office. “What the members are engaged in is an illegality because they know the process of removing a speaker,” he said. According to the County Government Act, a speaker can only be impeached if a motion is supported by 75 per cent of the whole House membership. Buluma said the assembly was unable to issue mortgages to MCAs because past MCAs defaulted in repaying the loans. “We have so far issued mortgages to 15 MCAs from the amount being repaid,” he said.
