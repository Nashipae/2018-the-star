A union of nurses has threatened to stage nationwide protests against an increment in their retention fee from Sh1,000 to Sh3,000. National Nurses Association of Kenya chairman Alfred Obengo accused the Nursing Council of Kenya of raising the fee without consultations. He said they will not be on strike but will picket in line with the provision of the Constitution. "The council has passed a regulation that is infringing on the rights of nurses. They are sucking our blood, they are injecting us in wrong places." Obengo made the remarks during the associationâ€™s AGM in Machakos on Friday. "Stakeholders must be consulted," he maintained. The union leader said nurses will boycott work starting November 6 midnight if the council fails to reduce the retention fee. The nurses termed the fee as oppressive and autocratic further taking issue with the Nurses Bill pending in Parliament. "We were misrepresented in Parliament when the Bill was crafted," Obengo said, warning that they will paralyse Universal Health Coverage. Click here for the latest political news
