The 2018/2019 Football Federation of Kenya (FKF) National Super League season will kick off on December 1 and conclude on June 9 to conform to the revised calendar. The league will feature 20 teams. Fortune Sacco, Eldoret Youth and Shabana FC were promoted from the Division One League while Wazito FC and Thika United were relegated from the SportPesa Premier League. Former top flight giants Shabana will start their campaign against NSL regulars St Joseph’s Youth at Afraha  Stadium in Nakuru on December1. Shabana secretary general, Kerubo Momanyi, yesterday said they are keen to strengthen the technical bench and playing unit ahead of the league kick off. “Definitely we are going to bolster the squad and technical bench. The club management committee is meeting over the same,” she said. Kisii County Sports Minister, Duke Mainga, said the county executive will meet soon to deliberate on how to support the club. He said reports that the county would sponsor the team are untrue. “Mobilization of Gusii professionals to help in identifying sponsors and a quick fundraiser will be a quick fix before the league starts,” said Mainga.” Fortune Sacco will make their second tier league debut against KenyaPolice at Karuturi grounds while Eldoret Youth will make their NSL bow against Talanta at Camp Toyoyo in the second match of a double header. The first game will pit Ushuru and Migori Youth. Modern Coast Rangers will host Kakamega High School’s Green Commandos at Serani Sports ground in Day 1 final fixture. The second day will see Thika United start their campaign back to the top flight, with a long trip to Mombasa, where they battle Coast Stima at Mbaraki Sports Club while Wazito will be at Hope Center against Nairobi City Stars. Nairobi Stima, under the tutelage of George Owoko and Evans Mafuta, will tackle Bidco United at Thika Municipal Stadium. Kisumu All Stars host Administration Police at Moi Stadium, Kisumu.
