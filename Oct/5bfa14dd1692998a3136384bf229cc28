Kenyans have expressed their frustration over the delays in getting prepaid tokens from the Kenya Power and Lighting Company. The problem has been experienced since Friday. Some of the disgruntled customers took to social media to express their frustrations. "In case you have not received after purchase, please send us the transaction code and meter number for action. Inconvenience regretted. We are still sending your tokens after resolving the system delay problem," KPLC tweeted on Sunday. But some customers accused the company of taking so much time to solve the issue. "Someone needs to sue you to bankruptcy, this company should be shut down," @Jozzyjagatasr tweeted. "Still sorting the problem 24hrs later? Who is your systems admin?" @ Samson Aooko posed. Kanyi Josef said: "Why the same problem for so many times, are you doing the same things expecting different results? Because now that's madness." "You need to be jailed, follow Chumo, we need better and cheap services from KPLC," Doyle Hassan said. Click here for the latest political news
