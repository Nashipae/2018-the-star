Governors will give Kenyans their stand on the call for constitution change after a meeting in Nairobi on Thursday. The council said in a statement on Wednesday that they will make the declaration after reaching an agreement. Whereas some county bosses have backed the calls, others have rejected the same while a section has given conditions.

The meeting will be convened at the CoG’s offices at Delta Towers in Westlands, Nairobi. Calls to change the constitution began when ODM leader Raila Odinga, at the fifth devolution conference, proposed a change of structure of government. The proposal has elicited mixed reactions from not only Kenyans but also leaders as each group attempts to define the form it should take. Some quarters have flatly rejected the proposal saying it is meant to create positions for individuals "who should retire from active politics". Raila, after his handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta on March 9, initially proposed for changes to the Constitution to create a three-tier system of government. However, he later said the changes should follow active consultations between Kenyans and the 14-member Building Bridges team. The latter was formed to spearhead actionable items of the Uhuru-Raila unity agreement. Jubilee and NASA governors have been reading from different scripts on the call with a number saying they want a vote that strengthens devolution.
