Migori governor Okoth Obado reported to work yesterday for the first time after being released on bail last week. Obado (pictured) was arrested and charged with the murder of girlfriend Sharon Otieno and her unborn baby. The governor was detained for 34 days. Yesterday, Obado arrived at his office in a private vehicle. He was wearing a black suit, light blue shirt and a stripped tie.Workers thronged his offices and happily greeted him. Obado asked them to work diligently for residents of Migori. The governor then chaired a cabinet meeting in his boardroom. “We need to work diligently to ensure we spur development for devolution to be felt across the county,” Obado said. The governor thanked workers for standing with him when he was arrested. He urged them to improve services.

The governor steered clear of the murder case, probably because of the strict bail terms issued by Justice Jessy Lessit. Obado was barred from discussing the case in public. On Saturday, Obado worshiped at Upper Hill SDA Church in Migori. He currently stays at his official residence in the town. The house is two kilometers from the governor’s office. He will not go to his palatial home in Rapogi because it is located about 15km from Homa bay borders. The court ordered Obado to remain at least 20km away from Homa Bay borders.
