The issue of maize is a messy thing down here; it is very irritating. The issue of maize is frustrating and is indeed very discouraging to farmers. Farmers have put in lots of resources in terms of fertilizer, seed maize and tilling the land. It has costed the farmer lots of money to produce the crop. It is a shame that certain individuals are allowed to import maize from Uganda, from Mexico name it, and yet farming of maize in Kenya is a possibility, maize farming is a viable business. If you look at it critically, you find it is our own business people who have got the means to do so. They are the ones who are buying maize from outside, we are our own enemies destroying our own farmers. According to me, we are simply pretending on the issue of maize because it is our own sons and daughters who have imported maize to the detriment of our own poor famers. I donâ€™t know what the Deputy President William Ruto has done over the mess to help farmers, I have not seen him talk much in public, maybe he is doing it quietly in the quietness of boardrooms, but have not seen him talk much. I want to assume that he might be doing what we call boardroom negotiations, but even if he is doing so, nothing can bring hope to the dejected farmers. I heard the Government paid money to maize farmers a while ago, then I ask myself, why did the government not prioritise the poor farmers earlier. I am just as irritated as President Uhuru Kenyatta. It looks like the big farmers who were indeed traders were paid and the poor farmers were left out deliberately. Well connected individuals were paid upfront while many poor dejected farmers were left on their own to wait for infinity. The government should investigate traders who brought in thousands bags of maize and were paid in less than a week when our own farmers had to wait for months before they were paid for the maize they supplied. What happened has the potential of impoverishing a community.
