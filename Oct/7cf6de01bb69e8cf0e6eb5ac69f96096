Borabu MP Ben Momanyi has said Nyamira leaders should focus on development because the county has a poor record. Momanyi urged Governor John Nyagarama (pictured) to take the necessary steps to move the county forward. He should remove corrupt county officials, the MP said. “We know governor Nyagarama is able to work and ensure our county shines. We urge him to rise up and fight against any ill-minded individual dragging the county back in terms of development,” the legislator said in Nyamira. North Mugirango MP Joash Nyamoko said the time has come for leaders to give county development the first priority. “We need to be united for a common cause, and sourse, and that is development,” he said.
