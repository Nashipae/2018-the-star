The Ugandan maid accused of killing her employer and her son in Muhoroni, Kisumu, in June has denied murder charges. Jackline Auma on Wednesday appeared at the Kisumu law courts to answer to charges of the murder of Elizabeth Achieng’, 26, and her son Leonne Okoth,3. Dressed in a purple checked shirt with a pink jumper, Auma tried to avoid the cameras as she denied both charges in a low tone. Justice Phillip Ochieng said she is mentally fit to take the plea. The hearing was delayed when the accused requested for the proceedings to continue in Kiganda. She claimed she can neither understand English nor Kiswahili. She later agreed to take plea in Kiswahili after her lawyer’s intervention.

The judge further ordered the prosecution team to provide the suspect's legal team with all copies of the case documents for the hearing to commence on November 6th, 2018. Auma failed to take plea for the second time last week after the state prosecutor requested for more time for a mental test on the accused before she takes plea. The accused will remain remanded at Kodiaga Women Prison where she has been since September 17, 2018 after her extradition by the Uganda police who handed her over to their Kenyan counterparts to undergo psychiatric tests before facing murder charges. She is accused of stabbing Achieng’ to death and strangling her son in Shauri Yako estate after which she fled to Uganda. Click here for the latest political news
