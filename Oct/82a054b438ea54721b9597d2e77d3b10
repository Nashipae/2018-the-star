The sustained purge on graft has brought to the fore a very disturbing scenario in which MPs are now being prosecuted over alleged corrupt activities. And its not just MPs. A sitting governor and most of his colleagues are either on trial or under intense scrutiny over pilferage and plunder of public resources. Top Government officials of the ranks of PS and parastatals chiefs have variously been indicted and charged with graft. In view of the enormity of the trust bestowed on elected leaders by Kenyans, the very act of being dragged in a court of law paints a very gloomy picture of the quality of leaders we elect every five years. Granted they are all innocent until proved guilty. But when 15 MPs from the current Parliament spent their time in police cells and remand homes, we have reason to be very worried as a nation. And we are. But just when did the rain, to quote Chinua Achebe start to beat us? There appears to be a stupid notion out there that being an MP in Kenya is the key to riches. As a result, professionals are burning their hard earned fortunes to get elected, only to realise later that there is little cash in their new jobs. This realisation has made our honourable members to become tenderpreneurs in a bid to make quick cash. Some have succeeded- but have nowhere to hide as the DPP and DCI smoke them out. The problem is not being charged in court or even being jailed like former Town Clerk John Gakuo. The tragedy is that with the advent of social media, these leaders have been exposed for what they are- greedy individuals with little regard for the dire economic situations they expose their electorate to. Whatever the outcome of these cases, Kenyans have taken stock of the moral DNA of their elected leaders. The only problem is that they will elect the same MPs and Governors in 2022. And they will buy the crap that their MPs were fixed by forces that want to impose leaders on them. Mulila comments on topical issues.
