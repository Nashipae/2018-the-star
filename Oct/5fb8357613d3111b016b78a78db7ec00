Nakuru coach Anthony Agesa is confident of evading relegation in the Kenya Hockey Union men’s Premier League after posting mixed result over the weekend. Nakuru disapproved the pre match favourite and third ranked Wazalendo with a 1-0 win on Sunday at City Park. Jacob Githinji scored all the important goal in the 11th minute of the game to hand his side the vital away win which helped them consolidate their tenth rank. Prior to the match, Nakuru were pursuing to avenge their Saturday’s 4-1 loss to Parklands Sports Club, who were orchestrated by a hat-trick from Allan Odongo and a goal by Dan Onyango, which rendered John Rioba’s goal null and void. “The win against Wazalendo is important for us in our quest to remain in the top flight. It brings hope and the hunger to get wins in the subsequent matches. Beating an opponent of Wazalendo’s calibre restores confidence in the squad and serves as a morale booster and we will fight till the final match,” said the coach. At the same venue, bottom placed Western Jaguars suffered a blow in their bid to beat the drop as they fell 4-1 to USIU-A Mashujaa. Their bid to recover from their Saturday’s 3-0 loss to 2016 league champions Strathmore University Gladiators backfired as Mashujaa smashed them 4-1 to deny them victory out of their weekend double. Mashujaa got the opener through Justin Ng’etich in the first minute before Lawrence Makhatsa made it two in the 20th minute. Bryton Nawati halved the deficit for Jaguars in the 44th minute but their efforts to restore parity were put off by Timothy Baraza who netted the third goal for the students in the 52nd minute before Makhatsa completed the rout in the 56th minute.
