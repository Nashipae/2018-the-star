Migori governor Okoth Obado yesterday was moved to the general ward at the Kenyatta National Hospital after being stabilised. The county chief was rushed to the facility on Wednesday morning after he fell sick at an Industrial Area Police cell. Prisons boss Isaya Osugo had said the governor was not receiving special treatment at the Industrial Area remand. Police sources said Obado had complained of severe stomachache and backache. He was admitted to the KNH private wing on Wednesday at 10am. A source at the hospital yesterday said he had stabilised but was not discharged. “Only the personal doctor attending to him can tell if and when he will be discharged,” the source said. Further follow-ups revealed the governor, who is the prime suspect in the murder of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno, had been moved to Ward 6 as doctors monitor his condition. Sharon was abducted in Rongo alongside Nation journalist Barrack Oduor. On September 4, her body later found dumped in a forest near Oyugis, Homa Bay. Obado was charged with the murder. He has denied involvement but was denied bail. He is to be detained at the remand facility until Monday next week. Other suspects, among them Obado’s personal assistant Michael Oyamo, have also been charged. Oyamo is said to have lured Sharon to her killers. Police are still pursuing the killers.
