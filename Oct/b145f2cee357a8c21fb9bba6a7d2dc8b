Thousands of musician Joseph Kamaru’s fans thronged Muthithi Secondary School grounds yesterday for his send-off. The fans who started trickling into the school from dawn braved the scorching sun as the tents filled up. There was a gridlock along the Kaharati-Kigumo road as fans continued to pour into the school for the event which President Uhuru Kenyatta, DP William Ruto and ODM chief Raila Odinga attended. Also present were more than 20 MPs, governors and other dignitaries. Scores of musicians, most of who said they were mentored by Kamaru, attended the burial and led mourners in songs. Kamaru’s sister Catherine Muthoni, popularly known as Celina and who performed the majority of songs with his brother, got to meet the President.

He said he had lost a friend in Kamaru that he had known since childhood. “Even as we mourn him, we are here to celebrate his life and the God-given talent he used to teach us culture, unity and to praise God,” the President said. “We thank God for all he has achieved and for all those that have been mentored by him and are now using their talents to entertain.” Read: Kikuyu music legend Joseph Kamaru in need of medical aid Uhuru assured Kamaru’s family that as the President and friend, he would meet them to discuss ways of ensuring his legacy does not fade away.
