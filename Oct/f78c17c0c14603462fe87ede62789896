The Education ministry has raised concerns over rising suicide among university students. Data released by ministry also indicate suicide rates are significantly higher among male students than among their female peers. University of Nairobi lecturer Gitau Njenga attributed the increase to mental health instability and little efforts made to promote students’ mental wellbeing. He said universities lack proper coordination to address mental challenges. The report covered the past three years. It says public universities record at least five deaths each month. The major causes of deaths are illnesses, accidents and suicide. Of the five, one death is attributed to suicide. Overall, there were at least 60 deaths in those institutions in 2016-17. Helb CEO Charles Ringera said the statistics paint a grim picture on young lives. “The sooner statistics are available, the more opportunity there is to target support and resources at those who may be at risk,” he said.

There were no details of comparisons between age clusters, undergraduate or postgraduate status, or against similar age group for those who did not join higher education. According to WHO, about 800 000 people take their own life annually. It said one in every three individuals in the world suffers from one or another kind of mental health complication. Young adults have the highest number of suicide. In 2016, suicide was the second leading cause of death among 15–29-year-olds globally. Some 79 per cent suicides occurred in low- and middle-income countries. Click here for the latest political news
