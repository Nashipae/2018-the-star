The Nothing to Lose movie shall be screened across Kenya, including in Kajiado and Maili 46, with Kiswahili subtitles. The movie is an inspirational story showing the story of Edir Macedo, who was born with a birth defect and was often mocked as a result. Growing up in his childhood, he was mocked by other children because of his disability simply because he could not climb a tree. To this, Edir’s mother looked at his eyes and told him, “You were not meant to climb trees, you were created to Move Mountains.” Bishop Gerald Nkayi (head of the UCKG Kenya) in a VIP event said, “The movie started in Brazil and went to Argentina, North America, Canada, the UK, Spain, Italy and in Africa, it has been shown in South Africa, Namibia, Zambia and in Kenya specifically, the movie premiered on September 8 at Globe Cinema. “The second screening was shown during our Youth Day on September 15. And today, it is the first time we are showing it to the general public. Reason being, we wanted even those who are not members of our church, those who are not Christians, to find it easy to come and watch it. Because it is not a church, and we wanted them to know about this great history of our church.” Nkayi urged Kenyans to watch the movie because it teaches people the power of determination. “It is not too religious, it is about true life events. Once you watch this movie, you will feel inspired to pursue your goals, no matter who is against you.”
