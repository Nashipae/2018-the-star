Kibabii University non-academic staff have threatened to go on strike accusing top management of taking staff round in circles and failing to implement their CBA. Kenya University Staff Union branch secretary Joseck Alwala said the CBA was negotiated in 2017 and was supposed to run from 2013 to 2017, but none of the issues agreed on has been implemented. Issues listed include increase of salaries and promotions. Alwala said staff would not tolerate the continuous delay. “We as a union are not happy with the continuous procrastination of the implementation of the internal CBA that was successfully agreed upon by the management,” he said. Alwala accused the management of bias in promotions. He said they promoted their relatives and friends. “We know this financial year the university had allocated a vote for the promotions, but there has been some discrimination in the manner in which it has been done and we want it done properly and aboveboard,” Alwala said. Vice chancellor Odeo Ipara urged staff to be patient. He said salary increments had started and what was pending was commuter allowances. Ipura said the increase of commuter allowances needed the approval of the Salaries and Remuneration Commission. We have very little power on that,” he said. Ipara said interviews for staff promotions was ongoing. He said two different interviews had been conducted with the process expected to end next week. .
