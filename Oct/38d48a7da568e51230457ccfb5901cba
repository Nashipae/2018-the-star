The Council of Governors yesterday defended formation of regional economic blocs, saying they are sustainable. CoG said legal measures are being put in place to ensure they are productive. Devolution CAS Hussein Dado said the government is fully behind the blocs and will look at laws that hinder economic growth. Makueni governor Kivutha Kibwana said the council and the national government had agreed to form a joint committee to develop a policy and legal framework for the blocs. They will restructure the existing regional development authorities to avoid duplicating roles. “The national and county governments shall also harmonise regulatory frameworks to improve the ease of doing business,” Kibwana said at Sawela Lodge, Naivasha, at the end of a three-day workshop on harnessing opportunities within the regional economic blocs.

The counties will tap into regional and international markets for resource mobilisation and access to larger markets. “The blocs will position themselves in such a way that development partners can easily approach them for partnership,” Kibwana said. Uasin Gishu deputy governor Daniel Chemno said the North Rift Economic Bloc has identified untapped tourism potential around Lake Turkana. The blocs have the capacity to improve livelihoods and create jobs, he said. Click here for the latest political news
