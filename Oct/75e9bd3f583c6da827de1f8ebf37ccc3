During the year under review, statements of receipts shown to the auditor indicate Sh5,030,114,823 as proceeds from foreign grants and only Sh3.8 billion could be supported with documents. “The supporting schedule and the ledger showed an amount of Sh3,861,475,171 resulting to unexplained difference of Sh1,168,639,652,” Ouko said. The report also revealed the ministry ignored advise from its own engineers and paid Sh6 million over and above the recommended cost of a road. The contract was awarded at a contract price of Sh34,876,995 while engineer’s estimate was Sh28,574,500. The bidder – according to the report – was also the highest of the five. The second ranked bidder in technical evaluation stage, MITS Electrical, had quoted Sh20,995,000. The country would have saved Sh13,881,995 had it considered the second bidder for the road project.
