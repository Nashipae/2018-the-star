Good Morning. A Suspended official from the National Land Commission has sensationally claimed that the commission’s Vice-Chair is behind the legal woes facing Chairman Muhammad Swazuri over the SGR compensation payments. In documents filed in court, Director of Land Valuation and Taxation at the National Land Commission Salome Munubi says that the criminal proceedings were filled to settle personal vendetta between Swazuri and the Vice-Chair Abigael Mukulwe. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this Wednesday morning. DCI to take over corruption cases as EACC loses powers The government plans to take away some powers of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and vest them in the Directorate of Criminal Investigations as part of its strategy to bolster the war against corruption. Government insiders confidentially told the Star yesterday that President Uhuru Kenyatta intends to expand the mandate of the DCI to include corruption cases that have been the mandate of EACC. In his Mashujaa Day speech on Saturday, Uhuru announced plans to streamline the EACC and the DCI to strengthen the fight against corruption. _____________________________________________________ Fake nude designers to be charged this morning Two photojournalists and a designer linked to the fake nude photos in the feud between Sports CS Rashid Echesa and Kakamega senator Cleophas Malala will be charged today.

The interrogation followed a new exposure of major financial and procurement loopholes in the construction of the new Sh50 billion oil pipeline. Auditor General Edward Ouko, in a new report, says the contractor of the Mombasa-Nairobi pipeline wanted an additional Sh24 billion in excess of the Sh48.5 billion which was the contract amount. _____________________________________________________ Overwhelmed contractors blamed for filth in Nairobi City Hall's failure to renew contracts of garbage collection firms or hire new ones has been blamed for the heaps of uncollected trash in estates and slums in the city. The county has not renewed contracts of at least 30 firms whose terms expired in February. Currently, there are only nine contractors that have been tasked with the collection of garbage in the entire capital. They are overwhelmed. _____________________________________________________ Referendum is politics, nothing to do with most Kenyans The current debate on whether to amend the Constitution, either through the referendum or through Parliament, is simply political. A lot of things have been said; a lot of blatant lies have been paraded; and, a lot of half-truths have been told. All in all, it is said that the “donkey is tired” and that we must “reduce the load”, and in many cases, it has been touted that load is being carried by Kenyans. Nothing could be further from the truth. Let us take a short journey of Kenya’s history, where this Commentary will prove that there is nothing to benefit the majority of the people of Kenya; only the power wielders, power brokers and the power puppets. Wisdom tells us that history is the best teacher, and those who do not learn from it, are bound to repeat the same mistakes. Let us take a trip down memory lane. _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
