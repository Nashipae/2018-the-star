The Chloride Exide-sponsored Hill Climb competition is expected to return to action next month after the cancellation of the last round in September. The Rift Valley Motor Sport Club organisers have secured a new venue at the Malewa Bay, situated about 12 kms off the Nakuru-Moi Highway on the Moi North Lake Road. Malewa Bay is a farm dealing in horticultural farming. The new venue will host the last of the three-round series of the Chloride Excide-sponsored competition on the weekend of November 24/25 . Among the big names to tackle the event, will be leading rally drivers from the Kenya National Rally Championship and riders from the National Motocross Championship series respectively. Onkar Rai, who won the opening round of the competition earlier in the year, is expected back to tackle the latest round of the series. Other rally drivers will include Carl Tundo, Baldev Chager and Tejvir Rai among others. Shivam Vinayak, who won the motorcycle category in the first round, is also expected to lead the two-wheel-drive machines. There will be seven different classes including bikes, quads, 4WDs, raids, classics, Buggies and juniors. Jaspal Matharu will be the clerk of the course for the third and final round of the sprint event. Machines varying from ordinary rally cars to buggies and motorcycles will be in action at the hands of some of the most renowned competitors on the local scene. Cars will run at two (2) min intervals in the competitive heats while motorcycles will do one minute intervals. The two-day event will start at 8am on November 24.
