Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya yesterday said Vision 2030 should be updated to cover natural resources. Oparanya said the blueprint needs to be reviewed to include emerging issues, such as community benefits from petroleum in Turkana and gold in Kakamega. “When I was preparing the vision, we only put in one paragraph but it needs to be reviewed to capture the new developments,” he said. The Vision 2030 is a blueprint that spells out economic pillars to turn Kenya into a middle-income economy by 2030. The governor spoke during a mining investment conference in Kakamega. Petroleum and Mining CS John Munyes and Ikolomani MP Bernard Shinali were present. The forum discussed the roles of national and county governments and communities in exploration and mining in Kakamega county and provisions of the new Mining Act. The meeting also discussed artisanal and small-scale mining and mineral dealings. Oparanya announced his government had set aside five acres where the national government will build a a gold refinery. He said President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to make a major announcement on mining in his visit to Kakamega during Mashujaa Day celebrations on October 20. Oparanya said his government would support artisanal miners by setting up a co-operative for them.
