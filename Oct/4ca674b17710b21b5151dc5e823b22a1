Kanyidoto MCA Walter Muok will become the new Majority leader in Homa Bay after a handshake deal reached in Nairobi last week. Wrangles between factions led by Muok and his predecessor Richard Ogindo left the assembly indefinitely deadlocked. The two reached a compromise deal  to share positions during a meeting chaired by ODM treasurer Tomothy Bosire and Senator Moses Kajwang’. Ogindo, the Kwabwai MCA, will become the assembly’s Majority whip. Ogindo ally Joan Ogada (Kojwach) took the deputy Majority leader position while that of deputy Majority whip went to Muok ally Mary Ojala (Arujo). Wrangles between the two factions had hampered sessions for three months. In August, a group of MCAs led by James Ochieng (Kabondo East) held an election whereby they removed Ogindo and Ruth Ombura from the Majority leader and deputy Majority leader positions, respectively. Nominated MCA Sophie Koweje was also removed from her position as Majority whip. The elections were annulled by the party. The wrangles persisted even as the assembly went on recess. On October 2, when sittings resumed, MCAs engaged in fistfights, forcing speaker Elizabeth Ayoo to indefinitely adjourn the assembly. Speaking after the arbitration, Bosire said the party was happy after the two factions agreed to work together. He said the compromise deal will provide a long-term solution. “The ODM leadership appreciates the spirit of give-and-take that the two leaders have shown,” Bosire said. Kajwang’ asked Ayoo to quickly reconvene the assembly.
