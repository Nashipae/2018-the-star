South Africa tourism is riding on expected increase in Kenya Airways flight frequencies to Cape Town to boost growth. Kenya Association of Travel Agents CEO Nicanor Sabula said KQ will launch two more direct flights to Cape Town in November, making it five weekly. In a partnership between KATA and SAT, South Africa will tap into tourists looking to travel to Africa following launch of direct KQ flights to New York. SAT regional trade relations manager Africa Bontle Madiba said the partnership is key to promoting intra-Africa travel especially for shopping and music events, and selling the continent to the globe. There are three non-stop KQ flights from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Cape Town that were introduced in June in line with KQ’s strategy to assert its presence and expand connectivity across Africa, opening up opportunities for tourism, trade and investment. SAT has been successful in marketing South Africa to the rest of continent, but according Madiba, Kenya has not been among their key source of tourists despite their trading relations. Madiba said Kenyan arrivals to SA had declined but forward booking projections show an expected 10.7 per cent growth. “The improved security situation after the new relaxed visa regulations implemented by Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba gives us confidence to move forward with this partnership,” Sabula said. High cost of air travel across African states is slowing tourism.
