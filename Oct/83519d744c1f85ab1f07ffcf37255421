More than 1,000 job opportunities have been floated by Chinese companies operating in Kenya, following the staging of the inaugural Kenya-China Economic and Trade Association (KCETA) Career Fair, at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre yesteday. Prospective job applicants, including university graduates and youth with experiences in various professional disciplines, thronged various stands at the career fair as more than 50 Chinese firms sought to showcase their corporate profiles in the battle for local human talent. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Kenya’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs director of Asia and Australasia affairs Christopher Chika said the companies’ commitment to deepen bilateral relations through career development opportunities was welcome. “Kenya has established strategic relationships with China, testified by the frequency of the interaction of the two countries’ top leadership. In the economic space, more than 400 Chinese companies have been creating quality local jobs and establishing crucial skills transfer linkages for Kenya’s development agenda,” he said.
