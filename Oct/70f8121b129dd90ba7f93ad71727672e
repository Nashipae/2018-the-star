Over 10,000 participants have so far registered for this year’s Standard Chartered Marathon slated for October 28. Standard Chartered chief executive officer, Lamin Manjang, said they are targeting a total of 26,000 participants with last year’s event having attracted 21,000 across the six race categories. Manjang said he expects the numbers to increase in the three weeks and surpass last year’s target. “We are on track and I expect the numbers to grow in the days and weeks to come. This year, we want to make it the biggest marathon ever since inception,” added the StanChart boss. Manjang was speaking when he paid a courtesy call to Radio Africa Group chief executive officer, Patrick Quarcoo at his Lion’s Place offices in Westlands. During the visit, the Stan Chart team presented Quarcoo with the running number and jersey for the event. Quarcoo will be the ambassador for the Chief Executives race which will cover 3.5km. The race, which started in 2015 has always seen the captains of industry compete for the ‘bragging right’. Some of the notable participants from last year’s race include Central Bank of Kenya governor Patrick Njoroge, US Ambassador to Kenya, Bob Godec and former deputy governor of Nairobi Patrick Igathe. Manjang said he expects a 20 CEO’s to run the event this year, up from the 10 who took part last year. “ I expect good turnout from the various chief executive officers and leaders of companies and it’s all for a worthy cause,” added Manjang. Quarcoo said he is delighted and looking forward to the event.
