Pastoralists and fishermen in Turkana were yesterday warned of possible flashfloods. Turkana county commissioner Seif Matata said the meteorological department has issued an advisory for those along Lake Turkana to watch out for heavy rains this week. “A public advisory has been issued for pastoralists and fishermen to avoid grazing along riverbeds and fishing at the lake. Though Turkana rarely experiences heavy rains, the flashfloods are heavy and make roads impassable, as well as killing our people and livestock,” he said. Matata said those found grazing along the dry riverbeds will be arrested. He warned fishermen not to venture out at night. Matata also urged motorists to be watchful while approaching dry riverbeds.
