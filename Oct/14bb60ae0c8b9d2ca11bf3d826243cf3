The death toll from the fatal accident has now risen to 50. This follows an accident involving a PSV bus at Tunnel flyover on the Londiani-Muhoroni highway. The bus was on its way to Kakamega from Nairobi at the time of the accident aÂ few kilometres from Fort Ternan. The area is characterised by winding steep slopes, stretching for kilometres. The bus, with 52 passengers on board, veered off the road and rolled. Its roof was blown off. He said the injured were rushed to Muhoroni sub-county and Kericho hospitals. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinett however says a man hunt for the owner of the bus has been launched. According to the IG, the owner and Sacco officials will be charged for violating traffic regulations. Boinnet said, the bus had no licence to operate at night and thus it is not clear why the Sacco would allow the ill-fated bus travel at such odd hours.
