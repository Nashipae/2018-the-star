Top South Africa side, Golden Lions are the latest side to confirm participation in the next month’s the Safari Sevens tournament. Lions join top ranked sides Spain and Portugal for the event alongside Samurai, University of Jo’burg, Uganda Cranes, Red Wailers and Apache Sevens. Kenya will field two teams— Shujaa and Morans— in the three-day rugby extravaganza. Kenya are the defending champions after winning the 2016 event by beating Samurai 38-21 at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) acting chief executive officer, Sylvia Kamau, said preparations for the event are in top gear and they expect to finalise everything by next week. She said the ticket sales are moderate and expects them to pick them in the next fortnight. “The sales have been sluggish so far and I expect them to pick up as we approach the tournament,” she added. Aside form the clubs category, there will be a age-grade category for under 16 and women’s category which will be played at the Impala Club. Kamau said plans are underway to increase the seating capacity for the tournament. “We will have additional seating to cater for the thousands of fans who are expected to show up for the event,” she added. Kamau said Nairobi Hospital will be the official medical sponsor for the three-day event with Coca Cola the official beverage partner for the event. Leading events and entertainment service provider, Homeboyz are also sponsoring the event. The firm will be tasked with the overall management of the Safari Sevens Village, which has been a popular and integral part of this tournament since it’s inception 22 years ago. The Kenya Broadcasting Corporation will be the official television broadcasters for the event. The event returns to the RFUEA ground after a eight year hiatus
