County governments have been urged to help devolve functions of the Ombudsman. The Commission on Administrative Justice (Office of the Ombudsman) through its chairperson Florence Kajuju asked county governments to help establish offices to ease conciliation on matters affecting administration. Kajuju said the county governments are grappling with a multitude of cases on maladministration which derail services. She said devolved offices are necessary to dissect through the high number of cases at county level. So far, only Kakamega and Mombasa have made strides with Kisumu in line to setting up one soon. “We have a backlog of cases and complaints from public servants who worked in previous regimes,” Kajuju said.
