Counterfeit goods worth Sh7.5 billion have been confiscated since May, the Anti-Counterfeit Agency has said. ACA executive director Elema Halake yesterday said counterfeits are a threat to the already ailing local manufacturing industry. “The multi-agency approach in combating illicit trade has seen a drastic reduction in the importation of the counterfeits,” Halake said. He spoke during the official opening of the multi-agency anti-illicit trade outreach in Mombasa and Kwale counties. The outreach is aimed at sensitising enforcement agencies and the business fraternity in the two counties. Illicit trade is estimated to take away 40 per cent of Kenyan manufacturers marketshare, denying them Sh30 billion in revenue per year while the government loses about Sh6 billion in revenue annually. However, Halake said this is just an estimate. “The government will soon embark on a national survey to determine the actual figures. We cannot state factually what the figures are right now,” he noted. The outreach is focusing on Mombasa and Kwale counties because of the Mombasa port and the Lunga Lunga border entry point. Halake said the counterfeit industry is the biggest threat to the government’s Big Four agenda. “That is why the government has prioritised the war against counterfeits,” he said. Coast regional coordinator Bernard Leparmarai called on the designated agencies and officers to be more patriotic if the fight against illicit trade is to be successful. He said corruption is the biggest impediment to the fight against counterfeit goods. He said there are designated agencies and officers in all entry points including the Mombasa port and the Lunga Lunga border.
