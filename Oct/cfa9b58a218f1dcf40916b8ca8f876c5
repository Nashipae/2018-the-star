A principal's wife was on Saturday found murdered and her body dumped in their house with stab wounds on the back, stomach, and neck. The knife believed to have been used in killing Irene Sifuna, wife of Kanduyi's Namwacha high school principal, was found lying beside her body. Bungoma county commissioner James Kianda said the family's farmhand is treated as the key suspect and is being pursued by the police. Irene's body was discovered by her children who alerted neighbours before police were called. The woman's husband was in school at the time. The farmhand, who has worked for the couple for close to two years, has since gone missing. He was described as a quiet person. Tom Sifuna said his wife's phone was also missing. He asked the police to speed up the investigations into the incident. Also read:Â Migori: Three children burnt to death in house fire Click here for the latest political news
