A legislator is calling for preservation of the position of woman representative in the planned constitutional amendment. Speaking in Nambale on Saturday, Busia Woman Representative Florence Mutua said if there is need for the amendments, her seat should not be scrapped because women encounter many challenges to win political positions. "Whoever is planning to scrap the woman representative seat is an enemy of development who does not mean well for the Kenyan women," Mutua noted. She said the need to amend the Constitution should not be driven by political leaders seeking their own gains but rather the people of Kenya. Mutua said the number of MPs should be reduced instead. "After one or two terms, woman representatives acquire political muscle. We learn a lot and grow in the political field, fight for women, youth and persons living with disabilities," she said. Mutua said her seat is an affirmative position that should be retained in the Constitution. "Women account for 55 per cent of the population in this country and if they mess up, they will be the losers. I call upon women in this country to retain their seat and let others be scrapped," she said. Mandera South MP Adan Haji said the woman rep seat is important. "If we call for a referendum we should only ensure that the burden bestowed upon the common mwananchi is reduced, ” Haji said.
