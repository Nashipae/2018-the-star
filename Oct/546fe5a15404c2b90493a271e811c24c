The death of a high-flying corporate manager shocked the city yesterday. PriceWaterhouseCoopers’s Business Recovery Services manager Stephen Mumbo reportedly jumped off the 17th floor of Delta Corner building in Westlands, Nairobi, in what is thought to have been suicide. Police, however, said they have launched investigations into the mysterious death, which they termed “suspicious”. Kilimani police boss Michael Muchiri yesterday told the Star police were yet to establish the cause of Mumbo’s death. “We cannot tell if this was suicide or if he was pushed. Co-workers have recorded statements with the police and other people who were in the building. This is where we are going to start our investigations from,” Muchiri said. Mumbo died at Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi from injuries after falling from the 17th floor of PWC offices at Delta Corner building in Westlands, Nairobi. Mumbo was found lying motionless at the ledge of the building by his colleagues, who called for an ambulance and rushed him to hospital.
