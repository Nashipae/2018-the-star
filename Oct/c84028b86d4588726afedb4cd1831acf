Twitter has suspended KTN News account days after the company started removing what it termed as fake followers from some accounts. KTN news has two accounts one @KTNKenya and another @KTNNews. They use the two accounts to share news updates. But on Tuesday, when followers tried checking for @KTNNews, they were greeted by the news that the account has been suspended. "Account suspended. This account has been suspended. Learn more about why Twitter suspends accounts, or return to your timeline," read the message. It is not clear why the account was shut down.
