Yesterday Deputy President William Ruto said that Kenyans should prioritise technical education over university education. He is absolutely right. There will always be more blue-collar jobs than white-collar jobs. Construction, manufacturing and service industries always need skilled technicians, especially as the economy grows. In Kenya today there is a shortage of well-trained plumbers, masons, mechanics and carpenters. A trained nurse can get a job immediately, here or anywhere in the world. Yet countless graduates in law, finance, marketing, journalism and administration are looking for work. So a technician in Kenya with proper training probably earns more than a mass-produced university graduate. One reason why Germany is the most powerful economy in Europe is that it gives equal status to universities and technical institutes. It is in Kenyaâ€™s national interest to develop a similar cohort of skilled technicians. Parents should realise their children will be better off if they become technical workers rather than desk workers. They will make more money and always be employed.
