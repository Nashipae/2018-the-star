Murang’a ACK Bishop Timothy Gichere has asked politicians to first seek Kenyans’ views before driving the push for a referendum. The bishop said those pushing for the law review should prioritise the views of Kenyans on whether it is necessary and the areas of the Constitution that require change. The Bishop said the church opposed the Constitution when it was passed in 2010 because it had issues with about 20 per cent of the law. “The push for a referendum should be driven by Kenyans and therefore leaders should first seek their views about it,” Gichere said. Gichere spoke at Wahundura ACK during its 100-year anniversary. He said there is a need for Kenyans to consider the cost of the referendum at a time when the country is experiencing financial challenges. The bishop also asked politicians to ensure they include the church in the process to give the clergy a chance to give its recommendations. Should the referendum be conducted, Gichere said, it should be conducted concurrently with the census to cut costs. Read: Perils of allowing politicians to push Constitution amendment Click here for
