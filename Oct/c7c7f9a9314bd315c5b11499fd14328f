Lately, there has been heated exchange, especially among
politicians, on the tapping and use of natural resources. One that has captured national attention involves Nairobi governor
Mike Sonko and his Murang'a counterpart Mwangi wa Iria over the use of the
Ndakaini Dam waters, the main source of water for the capital. Other battles for resources include the demand by Mombasa county
to control the Mombasa port and by Turkana leaders for a higher
allocation of oil revenue. Elgeyo Marakwet county is demanding compensation from Uasin
Gishu county for water drawn from Chebara dam; Taita Taveta wants a bigger
say in running the Mzima Springs supplying Mombasa City, while Kajiado
is laying claim to the Nolturesh water project that cuts across the
county to Machakos and Makueni counties. While the residents' concerns need to be
addressed to ensure they benefit, this must be done through talks and well-structured agreements, but not threats. Schedule Four of the Constitution clearly states that the national
government is tasked with protecting the environment and natural resources. A good example of a natural resource serving many in Africa is the
Nile, but its use is governed by various treaties to ensure each country
along its course benefits. So Wa Iria and his ilk should stop playing to the gallery and
enter into serious engagement for a win-win situation for everyone.
