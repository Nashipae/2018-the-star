A Tui Belgium Charter flight landed in Mombasa on Friday for the first time in five years. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner had 305 tourists on board. One-hundred-and-fifty visitors disembarked for excursions at the coast. Belgium is Kenya's tenth tourist contributor from the European market. The plane touched down at Moi International Airport Mombasa at 2317 hours stamping the highest confidence international guests have in Kenya's security. The charter had stopped following travel advisories. Present to receive the guests was Tourism PS Joe Okudo. Officials from Kenya Tourism Board, Tourism Fund, Mombasa county government, Pollman Tours and Safaris and Kenya Tourism Federation were also present to welcome the visitors. “The number of charters have increased from one to 10 in two years,” Okudo noted. Another two charters are expected by early next year. The government targets a 17 per cent growth in tourist number this year. “The tourism arrivals to Kenya from Belgium last year posted a growth of 61 per cent with 10,170 visitors up from 6,320 arrivals in 2016,” Okudo said. Kenya Tourism Federation chairman Mohamed Hersi asked the government to extend the incentive period. “It should also reconsider visa-free for children,” he said. Pollman Tours and Safaris MD Khalid Shapi said jobs will be created with the increase in guests. “Customer experience should be the selling point,” he said. Click here for the latest political news
