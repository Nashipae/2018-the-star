Flying Squad detectives are in hot pursuit of two policemen suspected of abducting a motorist in Athi River on Saturday. Corporal Kennedy Ojwang and constable Moses Njagi reportedly abducted Philemon Okelo at a petrol station on Mombasa Road. A police brief on the incident says the two, who were with two other civilians, demanded Sh300,000 from their hostage's wife. Their accomplices, a constable Kelvin Ndosi of Central Police station and a civilian Michael Ochieng, were arrested. Ndosi was found with the police radio after Okelo reported the abduction to Mama Lucy Kibaki AP camp. He told the police that the four forced him in his car (KBP 464Z) and drove him around and abandoned him at a petrol station along the Ruiru Bypass. The cops and two civilians - Richard Ondiek and a fourth man identified only as Ben, escaped arrest. They had been cornered in Ruiru by three undercover AP officers - Kyule Kimanzi, Idris Noor and Mercy Arora. Okelo's car was towed to Ruiru police station and the pocket phone kept as an exhibit. Ndosi and Njagi have a pending case in which they were charged with robbery with violence on September 26. They were charged alongside policeman Mohamed Onjala with robbing a businessman of cash and property worth Sh5,463,000 at an apartment in Kilimani, Nairobi. They are accused of robbing Abdoulaye Bathly of $8000 (Sh83,000) and three watches valued at $15,000 (Sh150,000) each, two mobile phones and credit cards on September 16. The prosecution said they were armed with a pistol during the robbery. They denied the charges before Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi and were released on Sh500,000 bond each with an alternative cash bail of Sh200,000.
