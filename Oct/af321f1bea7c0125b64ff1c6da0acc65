A sizeable reward would be a very strong incentive, if you ask me. Look at the scale of the money we have been talking about. If indeed someone is sure about what is going on and is sure about getting the 10 per cent, then the probability of that person coming forward and volunteering information is high. If for instance someone knows about an issue amounting to Sh1 billion — 10 per cent of that is huge — that itself creates a very strong incentive structure for citizens to volunteer information about corruption. But the information volunteered should not be driven by malice and a vendetta but guided by cogent evidence. For one to blow the whistle, he or she must be sure money is involved in that corruption and there is strong evidence. You can’t allege something without evidence that can lead to not just prosecution but also conviction and recovery of assets. When one is sure that if he or she comes out and flags this matter and is sure of getting the 10 per cent, then getting people to come out should be easy. In the absence of anything else we have tried, there is a huge possibility this would work. This cash incentive is a good example of what is practical. When someone blows the whistle, he or she is not just volunteering information to fight corruption but is certain that something will come of it. If I am talking about Sh1 million and I actually know 10 per cent would come to me, then I would do everything to make sure I go the extra mile to provide details that can sustain prosecution and conviction. The 10 per cent reward must be based on successful prosecution and conviction. Whoever is blowing the whistle must provide substantive evidence that would lead either to recovery of the assets or successful conviction. You can't simply suspect that someone is about to do something and then blow the whistle. The director of the East African Institute spoke to the Star. Click here for the latest political news
