Three people were arrested during an Energy Regulatory Commission crackdown targetting illegal liquid petroleum gas (LPG) filling centres in Embu. The energy regulator conducted the raid together with the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), and the General Service Unit (GSU) officers. The Friday crackdown netted 141 assorted LPG cylinders, an LPG trailer, a canter, a filling line with five filling heads, and five weighing scales. "Three suspects were arrested and held at Embu regional police headquarters pending arraignment," ERC said in a statement.

ERC is checking importation and sale of LPG that does not meet the Kenya standards as well as operation of unlicensed LPG storage and filling plants. Others are filling of LPG cylinders without the authority of the brand owner and filling and sale of LPG cylinders that do not meet the Kenya standards. The commission has called on members of the public to volunteer information on such businesses within their towns. Earlier, ERC announced the arrrest of three dealers who were found selling fuel above ERC prices in Tana River on Friday. "Lukeman Omar Mohammed, Ibrahim Hussein Hassan and Abdallah Bajoh will be arraigned in court," ERC said in a tweet. On October 9, three dealers were arrested over the same in Wajir and were fined Sh100,000 each after pleading guilty to the charge. The energy regulator held that the traders contravened section 4(b) of the Energy Regulations, 2010, as read with section 102(w) of the Energy Act, 2006. Click here for the latest political news
