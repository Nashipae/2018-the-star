Nairobi MCAs have criticised ODM chairman John Mbadi over his plan to replace assembly minority leader Elias Otieno and chief whip Peter Imwatok. At least 37 out of the 58 Nasa MCAs have accused Mbadi of being misled by a ‘few renegades’ to make the decision without consultation. On Thursday, Mbadi unsuccessfully tried to replace Otieno with Highrise MCA Kennedy Oyugi and Imwatok with Lower Savannah ward rep Nicholas Okumu. The changes were immediately rejected by acting Speaker Mwaura Chege on grounds that Mbadi did not follow the laid down procedure and standing orders. The MCAs said they have never held a meeting to either vote out Otieno and Imwatok or discuss their conduct. They said the standing orders require that all members must take a vote and the resolution communicated to the speaker by the whip to replace the leaders. “We are not aware of the said decisions. No internal party conflict resolution mechanism has been deployed,” the MCAs said in a letter to Mbadi. A signed list of 37 members was attached. They said the attempt to change Nasa leadership in the assembly was unconstitutional as it was done without consultation. Addressing a press conference at City Hall on Friday, the MCAs claimed that Mbadi was misled by disgruntled leaders.
