Kenya Sevens have drawn in a tricky Pool ‘B’ for next month’s season-opening Dubai Sevens, where they face powerhouses Fiji, Scotland and France. Kenya open their campaign against Scotland, face France in their second match and complete their preliminary matches against the Olympic champions. Shujaa had a fruitful outing at the Arabian Gulf last year, reaching the Main Cup quarters where they lost to New Zealand 14-12. They had seen off Canada 29-15 and Uganda 29-14 and lost to South Africa 48-5 to book their spot in the last eight. Shujaa will use the upcoming Safari Sevens as build up ahead of the season opener. Head coach Paul Murunga said the Africa Cup Sevens tournament held a fortnight ago in Tunisia was a perfect indicator of where they are in terms of preparations for the Dubai show. “This a very young squad. We want to see the team’s preparedness by playing in the build up tournaments which will also help build confidence for the side,” noted Murunga. Champions South Africa are in Pool ‘A’ and will battle it out with Argentina, Samoa and Zimbabwe. World champions New Zealand will take on USA, Spain and Wales with Australia headlining Pool ‘D’ where England, Canada and Japan await. Elsewhere, winger John Aluda Beda has joined Kenya Harlequin from 2016 Kenya Cup champions, Kabras Sugar. Quins head coach Charles Cardovillis confirmed the signing, saying: “He’s a good finisher, work ethic and competition to a position where I felt we needed more cover.” The former Chavakali High star leaves Kabras after five years with the Western Kenya-based side which he joined in 2013 after a five-month stint at Nationwide outfit, Webuye RFC. Beda becomes the second player, after Dominic Osino, to follow Cardovillis out of Kabras, where he managed during the 2017 national sevens circuit and the Kenya Cup season that followed.
