Lagdera MP Mohamed Hire has demanded
the government to eradicate
militias roaming his constituency
and killing people before disappearing
with livestock. On Saturday, bandits suspected
to be from neighbouring Isiolo ambushed
an elderly man, shot him
dead and stole his flock of goats and
sheep. Muktar Gaab was killed in Barquqe
area in Lagdera subcounty. No one
has been arrested in connection with
the murder. Addressing residents of Modogashe
town during a peace meeting
on Sunday, the furious Lagdera
MP accused police of reluctance to
pursue killers of the old man. "The government must act now
and make sure the assailants are
brought to justice. Human life is
sacred and we cannot tolerate such
incidents. Someone ought to be responsible," he said. "As we speak now, no person has
been arrested in connection with the
incident. The killers are well known
to the authorities. Surely, isn’t it the
government’s responsibility to protect
the lives and properties of its
citizens?" Hire said. He said his constituents are peaceful but some residents of neighbouring
Isiolo are the aggressors. Garissa county commissioner
Joshua Chepcheing described the
incident as unfortunate, saying the
attack and theft happened after government
agencies had ‘successfully’
reconciled the two warring communities. "I want to assure the residents that
the government will not rest until it
brings to book all the bandits who
have been causing havoc in that area.
Tough action will be taken against culprits who are trying to stoke
unnecessary animosity between
communities in the two counties," Chepchieng said. He said tremendous progress has
been made by security offi cers in
Isiolo and Garissa to end banditry. The administrator said police had
recovered some livestock and are
hunting down suspects whom they
suspect fled to Siricho. Chepchieng urged elders to resolve
issues between the two communities. Click here for the latest political news
