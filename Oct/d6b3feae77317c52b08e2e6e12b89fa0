Nairobi county government has banned nursery school 'graduations' as rip-offs and avenues to blackmail and extort from parents. Education CEC Janet Ouko on Tuesday derided the schools for charging parents between Sh1,000 and Sh1,500. She wrote to all public primary school headteachers and managers of the centres against charging the said levies. Ouko said City Hall has received a lot of complaints from parents yet public schools offer Early Childhood Development Education for free. "This is against the spirit of free ECDEs which is being implemented by the governor," Ouko said. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko had directed that all levies in public ECDE centres be scrapped with immediate effect.
