Kabras RFC lock Andrew Chogo has been ruled out of the Simbas’ repechage World Cup qualifiers set for next month in France. Choge underwent knee surgery over the weekend at Kijabe Hospital and joins utility back Biko Adema on the recovery list. Chogo has been a consistent performer for the Simbas since being handed his debut in the match against Uganda in the Africa Gold Cup-cum-Rugby World Cup qualifiers in May. Chogo is expected to return to action in February or March in Kenya Cup matches for Kabras. Speaking yesterday, team manager Wangila Simiyu, said they will have final training session today before unveiling the final 30-man squad tomorrow. Simiyu said training has been intense and the make up of the final 30-man squad is unknown. “Everyone has worked hard for the past one and a half months and they all know what is at stake. This is giving the technical bench a headache in terms of selection to the repechage,” added Simiyu. He said having the players play for their clubs at the ongoing Impala Floodlit Championships will be key because the only confirmed friendly is that against Romania ‘A’ on November 3 in Bucharest. “It’s important for the players to get game time. We only have one build-up match so playing for their respective teams will be good in order to build their confidence and match fitness ahead of the repechage,” added Simiyu. Simiyu expressed confidence in the boys that they can make history and qualify for the Rugby World Cup next year in Japan despite the numerous challenges. “We came very close in 2014 and I think the boys are up for it and have the belief to go all the way,” he added. The coach said having played Germany and Hong Kong in the recent past will be ideal, adding that Canada are unknown quantity. “Canada are ranked higher than us and have very good forward play and have been to the World Cup,” he added. The team is expected to depart at the end of the month.
