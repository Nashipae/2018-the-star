The government is investigating administrators from Uasin Gishu over the maize scandal at the National Cereals and Produce Board, Interior CS Fred Matiang’i said yesterday. Unscrupulous traders benefited from a Sh1.9 billion payout at the expense of farmers. The traders delivered imported maize from neighbouring countries to NCPB. Matiang’i accused the administrators of sleeping on the job. He said chiefs, county commissioners and their assistants ought to have helped in identifying genuine farmers. “If you are the county commissioner in a region where farmers are growing maize, who knows those farmers more than you do?” Matiang’i said. Read: Inside story of the NCPB maize scam “So when street thieves are lining up to bring maize imported from another country to the NCPB, where were you?” He wondered why deputy county commissioners or their bosses failed to report that genuine farmers were not paid. The CS said administrators should safeguard the interest of farmers in their areas of jurisdiction. “They should know when farmers are not paid or when there is an outbreak of a disease and take action,” Matiang’i said. Some eight traders are said to have colluded with top managers of the board to be paid Sh1.9 billion in a month during the 2017-18 season. Former Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe and top NCPB managers were arrested in August and charged. ”Investigation revealed that the NCPB officials, agricultural officers, chiefs and assistant chiefs colluded with the traders to facilitate the fraudulent payments to the detriment of vetted farmers,” Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji said. Charged alongside Lesiyampe was NCPB finance general manager Cornel Kiprotich, former CEO Newton Terer and accounts clerk Caroline Cherono. Click here for
