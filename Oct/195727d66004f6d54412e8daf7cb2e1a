Trouble is brewing at the Kakamega assembly as MCAs accuse leaders of allegedly ignoring their welfare, especially mortgages. Last Thursday, they stalled the passage of the Kakamega County Finance Bill, demanding they first be assured of a trip. They passed the bill in a special sitting on Friday. Some members said they want to replace Majority leader Joel Ongoro and Minority leader David Ndakwa, who serve in the County Assembly Service Board. Ongoro yesterday downplayed the simmering row as normal politicking. “You can’t miss political drama where we have elected leaders,” he said. But MCA Kevin Maelo said the board has ignored MCAs’ plight. “The SRC has given us mortgages, but we’ve not been allowed to access the facility. They keep telling us there is no money,” he said. A board member said assembly operations could halt because of lack of funds. “The executive has given us Sh60 million for August salaries and renewal of expired insurance cover. There’s no money for operations,” the member said in confidence. Isukha West MCA Edward Shivembe said the battle will continue. “Expect more drama on Tuesday [today] until the assembly leadership accedes to the issues we’ve raised,” he said. Ndakwa said they will ensure members receive their mortgage. Each MCA is entitled to a Sh3 million mortgage facility and Sh2 million car loan payable in five years.
