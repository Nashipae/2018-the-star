Kenya Broadcasting Corporation has dismissed claims of slashing its staff salaries. The national broadcaster has also rebuffed claims of embezzlement asking those with evidence of the same to present to the authorities. The media entity's unionised staff have issued a 14-day strike warning citing slashed salaries, non-remittance of statutory deductions, and non-renewal of insurance scheme. Corporate Affairs manager Evelyne Mwakina said on Tuesday that the issues were resolved with the main official union representing the staff. "We confirm that salaries of staff have not been slashed nor does the corporation intend to review salaries downwards," Mwakina said. This followed calls by Kenya Union of Journalists to its members to withdraw their labour if the issues are not addressed. The official said KBC has put in place plans to clear all outstanding payments of statutory deductions with the relevant bodies. Mwakina further noted that the staff's previous medical insurance scheme lapsed and NHIF already identified as the new insurance provider. "The contract with NHIF has been signed and in the process of implementation," she said in the statement. She pledged that the broadcaster is in the path to finalising its transformation strategy with a view to revamping its services. The House Committee on ICT had at some point summoned the national broadcaster's top officials to shed more light on the financial crisis at the media house. This followed instances where workers, moreso stringers went without pay for months, to an extent of some being blacklisted by financial lenders.
