A shortage of sisal and aloe vera has hit players in the beauty industry in Embu county, heightening demand. Director of Wanjau Technical and Vocational training College Agnes Wawira Ireri said sisal and aloe vera are in acute shortage in Embu. Sisal is needed for hair extensions and aloe vera for other beauty products. Wawira spoke to the press at the Embu Moi stadium where her college exhibited products used in beauty, hairdressing and other courses. She said farmers will also get a market since they are planning to start manufacturing of beauty products from them. She called on farmers, particularly in Mbeere North and Mbeere South subcounties, to start growing the two crops, assuring them they fetch good money. The two semi-arid subcounties have a good climate required for the growth of the two crops. Wawira also said avocado and macadamia are used in cosmetics.
