Fishermen in Kalokolo on the shores of Lake Turkana are living in fear of an outbreak of ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo that may affect their business. Turkana deputy governor Peter Lotethiro has raised the alarm over an outbreak of the disease in DRC that may spread. “Fisherfolk from DRC are flocking in at the shores of Lake Turkana yet there is an outbreak of ebola in their country. We need to be keen while conducting business. We might have cases of ebola at Lake Turkana if measures are not put in place,” he said. The government of DRC through WHO confirmed the outbreak of ebola disease on Tuesday that has killed 17 people in the last five weeks. Lotethiro urged the relevant authorities, including security officers, the county government and the Ministry of Health to ensure fishermen coming from the DRC do not have Ebola before they enter. Turkana fishermen have also decried the decline in prices as they have lost market for their goods due to fear of an outbreak of Ebola in the DRC. Peter Aleper, a fisherman in Kalokolo, said the price of fish has gown down as the demand has depreciated. “DRC is our main external market for fish. The outbreak of ebola has scared away fisher folk,” he said. Aleper said they are now selling fish at a throwaway price of Sh200 from Sh500. Click here for the latest political news
