The owner of the demolished Airgate Centre, formerly Taj Mall, has been appointed the acting leader of the National Vision Party of Kenya. Ramesh Gorasia (pictured) fills the void left by the later Nicholas Biwott. The former powerful politician died last year. He joined the party after ditching Kanu. During the last election, Gorasia ran unsuccessfully for Nairobi senator on the ANC ticket. “The vision party has a great vision to help Kenyans,” Gorasia said. “There’s no opposition in Kenya as the handshake has diluted everything. It’s time for our party to take over this mandate to prevent the country from some injustices.” Secretary general Marere wa Mwachai said they have seen leadership quality in Gorasia. He expressed confidence that the new leader will deliver on his mandate to members and the entire country. “Ramesh has not joined our party because of financial status. We’ll work together for the benefit of the party and Kenyans,” he said. Chairman Johnson Sadera handed Gorasia the leadership certificate.
