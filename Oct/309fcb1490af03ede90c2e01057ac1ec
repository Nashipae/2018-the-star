A former aide of Embu governor Martin Wambora has criticised developers who dishonestly sell houses built on riparian land and road reserves. Bosco Kiura, who is now in the real estate business, said many homeowners have lost millions of shillings by buying houses on riparian land and road reserves, which are later demolished by the government. He said various developers dishonestly and through underhand dealings with government officers obtain land in such prohibited areas while knowing they have committed offences. Kiura said owners of such houses constructed on riverbeds,wetlands and grabbed road reserves are suffering, especially in Nairobi, after the properties were pulled down without any compensation. Kiura is the managing director of Mulberry Holdings Limited. He said the company is selling affordable houses on undisputed and secure areas. They will not be demolished due to ecroachment, he said.
