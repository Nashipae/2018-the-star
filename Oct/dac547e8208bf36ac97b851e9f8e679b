Former town clerk John Gakuo is dead. He passed on while being treated at Mbagathi subcounty hospital. The body was taken to the city mortuary on Tuesday. Prison boss Isaya Osugo told the Star that Gakuo fell sick on Monday morning and was rushed to the hospital. The late was serving a three-year jail term for abuse of office and failure to comply with procurement laws. This was in respect to the Sh238 million Mavoko land scam. He was jailed in May alongside former Local Government PS Sammy Kirui. "It is unfortunate that we have lost him. We are still waiting for the autopsy report to ascertain the cause of his death," Osugo said. Gakuo was ordered to pay Sh1 million fine after he was found guilty. Chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti said this was in respect to his role in the defunct Nairobi city council's purchase of the Mavoko land.
