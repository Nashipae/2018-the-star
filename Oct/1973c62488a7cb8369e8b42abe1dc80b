A fisherman who has been trapped by water hyacinth in Lake Victoria for three days yesterday appealed to be rescued. David Ouma, 34, from Kisumu county, was stuck in his boat near Obaria beach in Karachuonyo. He said he left Nanga beach in Seme for a fishing expedition on Monday morning, but he was unable to navigate through the weed. Yesterday Ouma said strong waves hit his boat, driving it amid the hyacinth. “The weed has surrounded my boat and I can’t move,” he said. The fisherman asked for help when he called a local radio station yesterday morning. “I’m near Obaria beach. I’m appealing to relevant authorities and well-wishers to come to my aid,” he said. Homa Bay director of disaster management Eliud Onyango said they have contacted the Kenya Maritime Authority officials in Kisumu to rescue Ouma. “We’re already at the beach and rescue will start soon the officials arrive,” Onyango said.
