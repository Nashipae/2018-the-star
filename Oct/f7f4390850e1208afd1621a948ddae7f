Two people including a Seychelles busiessman have been sentenced to 15 years in prison after they were convicted of trafficking Sh22 million heroin.  Seychelles national Clement Sege and Kenyan Ahmed Said were convicted of trafficking drugs on a luxury yacht, the Baby Iris. It was blown up in August 2015, along with the heroin, on orders from President Uhuru Kenyatta. The duo were also fined Sh5 million each for the offences, and failure to pay the fine, they will serve 12 months each in prison. Said was fined extra Sh3 million for an extra offence of being in possession of a bag that contained Sh6 million worth of heroin and failure to pay the fine, he will serve an additional 12 months in prison. Chief magistrate Julius Nange’a said the sentence will run consecutively. Nange’a said he had considered the fact that Sege, had spent three years in prison while the trials proceeded as he had been denied bail. The magistrate said the prosecution which was led by senior state counsel Yamina Jami had proven their case beyond reasonable doubt. He said the evidence was sufficient to warrant conviction.He added that it was evident that Sege was to sail the vessel to Mauritius where they were destined after leaving Kilifi. The magistrate said the accused were present when the narcotics were recovered.
