Several local destinations received recognition at the 25th continental edition of the World Travel Awards last weekend in South Africa. The Maasai Mara National Reserve and Diani Beach were named Africa’s Leading National Park and Leading Beach Destination respectively during the ceremony in Durban. It is the sixth time that the reserve has been crowned, having beaten five other national parks across Africa. Diani Beach received the award for five consecutive years, having outmatched five other beach destinations. Nanyuki’s based Ol Pejeta Conservancy, home to the world’s two remaining northern white rhinos, was recognised as Africa’s leading Conservation Company. Kenya Tourism Board chief executive officer Betty Radier said the awards are a confirmation of Kenya’s unrivalled top position as a beach and safari destination. “We are honoured as a destination to receive these awards. The awards truly attest to the fact that Kenya offers an unrivalled beach and safari product experience that is second to none in Africa,” Radier said. National carrier, Kenya Airways was named Africa’s leading airline in the business class service for the sixth year in a row and in the economy class category for a second time. Hotels and tented camps that won awards include Diani Reef Beach Resort and Spa, Fairmont Mount Kenya Safari Club, Aberdare Country Club, and Villa Rosa Kempinski, Nairobi. Bonfire Adventures was named Africa’s Leading Travel Agency for the third year running. In 2017, Kenya was named the world’s Leading Safari Destination.
