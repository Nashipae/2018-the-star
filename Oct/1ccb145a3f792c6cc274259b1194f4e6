Chemelil Sugar made yet another statement about their desire to remain among the country’s top clubs when they beat Kakamega Homeboyz 2-0 in a SportPesa premier League match at Chemelil Sports Complex yesterday. Fresh from beating Thika United 1-0 four days ago, Francis Baraza’s charges, who were 16th with 35 points before kick off, scaled three places on the standings toppling Nzoia Sugar, Nakumatt and Posta Rangers on their wake. Felix Olouch gave the millers a 19th minute lead after Edwin Omondi had teed him up to calmly slot the ball past David Juma. Omondi, who scored the lone goal in their previous win against Thika, thought he had doubled the scores seven minutes later but was correctly denied for offside. Despite leading, Baraza surprisingly made a first half substitution hauling off the goal scorer for a more defensive Usama Adams as he sought to stop Homeboyz from coming back into the cencounter. Homeboyz resumed for the second half with vigour but could not break Chemelil’s back line. Their hopes of levelling matters faded further when Lucas Waitere nodded home Elvis Omondi’s cross in the 79th minute for a 2-0 cushion, a result which stood till the final whistle. The win piles more pressure on Posta Rangers who are 16th with 37 points and leaves them in a must-win situation in their final match to avoid a playoff which will pit them and the second runners up in the National Super League. Similarly, Nakumatt (at 15th) will have to win their final match and hope Rangers falter to fully seal their place in the forthcoming season.
