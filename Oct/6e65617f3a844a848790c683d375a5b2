Kwale security agencies are to train boda boda riders in community policing. Msambweni deputy commissioner Ronald Enyakasi yesterday said they will also equip the riders with skills on security because they are exposed to criminals. “The training is one way of providing riders with relevant skills on handling criminals before police reach the scene. It’ll enhance a mutual relationship between them and security officers,” he said. He said the riders know many routes and would help police to tackle crime. Matuga deputy commissioner Isaac Keter said some riders are used to abet crime, hence the need to have the initiative. Kwale peace committee chairman Shariff Hajj said they had engaged Matuga and Msambweni riders.
