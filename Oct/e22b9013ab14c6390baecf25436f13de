Harambee Starlets will now feature at the 2018 Africa Women Cup of Nations after Equatorial Guinea was disqualified from the competition. The national women's football team had lost 3-2 on aggregate to the West Africa nation in the final qualifying round but the Football Kenya Federation lodged an appeal. FKF filed a  protest on June 9 in which the association questioned the eligibility of six players who played a part in the qualifier. On Wednesday, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) in a letter to FKF general secretary Robert Muthomi said the appeal has been upheld. The decision follows a disciplinary board hearing held at the CAF headquarters in Cairo, Egypt. Kenya initially protested the eligibility of six players, but it maintained its protest regarding one player; Anette Jacky Messomo. "The player who is alleged to be of Cameroonian nationality had played for several European based clubs,” the letter said. Equatorial Guinea was disqualified based on CAF statutes and regulations. "A sanction of $10,000 (Sh1,000,000) was imposed on the Equatorial Guinea FA, and Equatorial Guinea’s team is disqualified from the African Women’s Cup of Nations 2018,” the letter said. This year's AFCON championship will be played in Ghana between November 17 and December 1. Starlets will be making a second appearance at the continental tournament following their maiden appearance in 2016. The tournament also doubles as the African qualifier to the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. The top three teams will qualify. Eight teams, including hosts Ghana who qualified automatically, will participate in the competition.
