Dozens of Kirinyaga residents on Friday held protests in Kutus town demanding the arrest of Josephine Kabura. The latter shot in the limelight with her affidavit implicating Governor Anne Waiguru - then Devolution Cabinet Secretary, as a beneficiary of the Sh791m scam. In 2015, NYS lost money in phoney deals and questionable tenders. EACC told Parliament that Sh1.8 billion was lost at the agency. Kabura declared in an affidavit that she knew of the dealings, and adversely mentioned Waiguru as a party to the sleaze. Waiguru later resigned.

She wrote to EACC for fresh investigations into the document with a view to identifying the sponsors of the same. Her supporters marched in major streets of the town threatening to stage a sit-in at the DPP's office if Kabura is not arrested in 14 days. They burnt her effigy and vowed to continue piling pressure on the authorities to act on the matter, adding that Waiguru is vindicated following the issues arising from the affidavit. The group's chairman Charles Kariuki said they wondered why Kabura was still a free person even after EACC admitted her affidavit was erratic. ''We are going to take the battle to the DPP's doorstep if Kabura will not be arrested and charged for lying under oath,'' Kariuki said. The residents further called on investigating agencies to unravel the people behind Kabura's affidavit. They claimed some powerful people in government were behind the accusations 'to soil Waiguru's name.'
