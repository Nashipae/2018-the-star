Rainfall is expected to continue over several parts of the country until Saturday, the meteorological department has said. In a forecast issued on Monday, the department said areas to be affected include Lake Victoria Basin, highlands West of the Rift Valley, Central and South Rift Valley. It said rains will be experienced during morning hours followed by showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon in Siaya, Kisumu, Homabay, Kisii, Nyamira and Migori and in the neighbouring counties of Baringo, Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu, Bomet, Kericho and Elgeyo Marakwet. Bungoma, Vihiga, Kakamega, and Busia residents will also experience similar weather patterns. According to the weatherman, residents in Nairobi, Nyandarua, Laikipia, Nyeri, Murangâ€™a, Kiambu and the neighbouring central Kenya counties, including Embu and Tharaka Nithi, will experience rains over few places during morning hours and showers in the afternoon. Temperatures will deep as low as 7 degrees in some areas on Tuesday and peak at 25 degrees in the afternoon. The forecast released by acting director Stella Aura said the pattern will remain the same in North Eastern in the counties of Marsabit, Mandera, Wajir, Isiolo and Garissa where temperatures will peak 35 degrees Celsius. The Coastal strip will, however, experience sunny intervals the whole day all through to Saturday save for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday where showers will be experienced in the afternoon. The counties are still reeling from a heavy downpour that kicked off on Wednesday last week leading to heavy flooding. The rains intensified progressively over the coming days to a high of 40mm on Thursday and Friday leading to flash floods particularly in the South Coast region. The rains were accompanied by strong winds and waves leading to the met department to issue a warning for people to keep off the shores of the Indian Ocean. Click here for the latest political news
