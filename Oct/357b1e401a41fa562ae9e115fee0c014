A team of auditors has been deployed to Nyamira county following claims of rampant corruptions in the last four months. The six auditors will look into books of accounts in ten departments. They will also audit books of accounts in the county assembly. There has been complaints from local leaders and members of the public that the tendering and procurement of the assembly administration block worth Sh379 Million was wrongly awarded. â€œOurs is to make sure we have exposed how public funds sent to and collected from the county are being utilized," one of the auditors told journalists on Tuesday. County treasury officer Lawrence Nyangena said the auditors were doing their routine work and denied that they had been compromised. Click here for the latest political news
