deejays will be playing alongside top sides like Samurai, international
select sides featuring current and former players as well as Franchise

will handle the side in Dubai following the departure of head coach Paul
Murunga, who was recently appointed the Kenya Sevens head coach.Odongo
expressed confidence that his side will be competitive in
the two-day tournament. “We have a good crop of players who will be
playing in the event in Dubai as we rub shoulders with some of the best
teams in the world,” said Odongo.The deejays last played at the
tournament in 2010 and Odongo said selecting a squad will be tough. “At
the moment, it’s quite competitive. We have a big squad. We are also
focusing on the start of the Kenya Cup by playing at the Impala floodlit
and therefore selecting the team to Dubai will be quite tough,” added
Odongo.Odongo said playing in the Dubai invitational tournament will
boost their chances of winning the Kenya Cup, which starts next month.
“Playing in the event will expose our boys to very intense and physical
tournament and aid them as we seek to win the Kenya Cup crown for the
first time,” said Odongo.Elsewhere, Kelvin Omiyo has returned to
Nakuru RFC after a one-year stint at Kabras Sugar. He joins Dominic
Osino, Ivan Kirabo, Pius Ogena and Joseph Amalemba on the list of key
players, who have signed for the sugar millers.The centre’s
availability is a boost to the side that lost the likes of Henry Ayah,
Monate Akwei, Billy Kipchirchir and Kelvin Kioko. Head coach Mitch
Ocholla said the return of Omiyo will boost the side’s chances of
getting to the Kenya Cup playoffs.
