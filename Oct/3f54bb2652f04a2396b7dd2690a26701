President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday reiterated his commitment to achieving Universal Health Coverage in the country. The Head of State said since health services are devolved, county governments ought to partner and work closely with the national government to make affordable healthcare a reality. "The two levels of government can work together on aspects of staffing, equipment and structural development,” President Kenyatta said. Uhuru spoke during a tour of the Kakamega County Referral Hospital to assess services. He was accompanied by First Lady Margaret Kenyatta, Deputy President William Ruto, Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya and Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki. The President also toured the new Sh6.3 billion 750-bed capacity Kakamega County Teaching and Referral Hospital that is under construction. He said once fully operational, the hospital will employ 5,000 health professionals. The President lauded governor Oparanya over the hospital. He told other governors to follow suit and leave a lasting legacy that will benefit the people. “Governor Oparanya has started major projects like the rehabilitation of Bukhungu Stadium, construction of this referral hospital from scratch and modernisation of the road network. The people of Kakamega will pride themselves in this projects,” the President said. Oparanya said he fully supports the President's Big Four agenda. He said the referral hospital in Kakamega will decongest the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret. “This hospital will be constructed in three phases. Phase one is underway, phase two will be launched next year while phase three will be done in 2020,” Oparanya said. He requested the government to help equip the hospital. Oparanya said the Kakamega government is also building two new Level 4 hospitals in Mumias and Shinyalu at a cost of Sh200 million each. Click here for the latest political news
