Parliament will appropriate funds from its budget to hire adequate sign language interpreters to help in smooth operations in various departments. National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale yesterday told the Labour and Social Welfare Committee that, once hired, the experts will be obliged to interpret during various committee sessions of the two Houses. “We will ensure there are enough sign language interpreters in Parliament so that our committees engage effectively with witnesses during their sessions,” the Garissa Town MP said. He told the committee session chaired by Bomet woman rep Joyce Korir that enough interpreters will be posted in hospitals, the Judiciary and other government institutions to ensure issues regarding the deaf are well articulated. Duale presented before the committee a petition from members of the Kenya Deaf Community seeking for their proper presentation in government, Parliament and other top positions in leadership. The petitioners want Parliament to amend the Persons with Disabilities Act, 2013 to provide for establishment of a special fund to facilitate research in Kenya Sign Language development and training. They also want Parliament to amend the Election Act, 2011 to provide that political parties nominate deaf and hard of hearing persons to elective bodies. “Appropriate adequate funds to support the promotion and development of sign language, training of health workers on sign language and for hiring of sign language interpreters in Judiciary,” the petitioners say.
