Kanbis reclaimed the Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association (NPCA) Super Elite league title after maintaining unbeaten run. Skipper Rajesh Bhudia hit a superb century to steer Kanbis to a convincing 52 runs win over Cutchi Leva on Sunday at Samaj School to finally seal their league title with 10 wins out of 10. After winning the toss, the opener thumped 122 from 104 balls, his highest score in the league to lead his side to 277 in 46.1 overs. Veteran Ramesh Mepani then bagged 4 for 55 to bowl out the home team for 255 with 10 balls to spare. Kanbis were dethroned by Stray Lions in 2016 and were third last year after a number of their matches were washed out. With none of this year’s matches having been called off or washed out, Kanbis put on a good show in all the league to secure the title with two matches to spare. Swamibapa, who beat Stray Lions at home on Sunday, finished second with 28 point—12 behind Kanbis. Bhudia’s innings included 19 fours and a three sixes and joined the Kanbis list of 2018 league centurions. Bhudia, who promoted himself to the top order this season, roared with satisfaction after he stroke through the covers to reach his maiden league century. The skipper shared a fifth wicket stand of 101 runs with Mepani (31) to get their side to 208. Dhiren Gondaria had scored 46 in an opening stand with Bhudia
