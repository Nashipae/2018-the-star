Earlier this year, political analyst Mutahi Ngunyi predicted that Opposition leader Raila Odinga's daughter Winnie would be the first Luo and Kenyan woman president. And now her brother Raila Junior has thrown his weight behind her, saying it is what she is passionate about. "She will become president after William Ruto. You can take that prediction to the BANK and use it as collateral to borrow a loan," Ngunyi said via Twitter on Tuesday. In a recent interview with Word Is, Raila Junior said he is not interested in politics but is hopeful his sister would be a great president for Kenyans. "I really hope Winnie is going to be the first president of Kenya because she is really passionate about politics and I really encourage her to do as much as she can," he said. "The fact that she is a woman does not restrict her from doing what she loves because she is so determined, and I really wish the rest of Kenyans will see that determination as well." In one incident, Raila Junior, 39, and Winnie, 28, were caught in the crossfire and tear gas as police battled NASA supporters.
