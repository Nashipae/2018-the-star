A driver was yesterday charged with obtaining Sh35,000 by false pretences. Ellam Lifede, alias Mapengo, was accused of trying to defraud Bright Ombisa of Sh35,000 by pretending he was in a position to facilitate enrolment of his son Edwin Ombisa to the Kenya Medical Training College. The 58-year-old allegedly approached Ombisa and informed him there was a facilitation fee required, which was paid using cash and M-Pesa. Lifede later failed to honour his promise and avoided him. Ombisa later confirmed from KMTC there were no facilitation fee required. He denied the charge before Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi and was released on Sh50,000 bail. The case will be heardÂ  on November 22. Click here for the latest political
