Ford Kenya secretary general Eseli Simiyu on Saturday dismissed claims the party is on the verge of folding up and working with Jubilee. “You must ignore rumours doing rounds claiming Ford Kenya has joined and is working with Jubilee,” he said. Eseli said the claims on county’s social media platforms and a section of media were “baseless rumours meant to taint the image of the lion’s party”. He spoke in Milima ward in his Tongaren constituency during the annual general meeting of Bungoma North Knut branch. “I was shocked to watch on TV that Ford Kenya party leaders had resolved to join and work with the Jubilee Party. Ford Kenya is still intact in Nasa and we are yet to start thinking of leaving,” Eseli said. The legislator noted that despite accompanying Deputy President William Ruto on Friday during his tour of Bungoma county, talk of Ford Kenya joining the government is baseless. “We purely discussed development issues. At no time did we discuss about parties working together,” Eseli said. Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati expressed his shock on reading and watching news that Ford Kenya had endorsed Ruto for presidency, just because they were seen together in a fundraiser.
