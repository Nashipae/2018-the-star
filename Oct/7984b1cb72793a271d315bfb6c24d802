The Constitution should be amended so that no two men or women are on the same ticket in the race for President or governor, Narc Kenya chairperson Martha Karua has said. Karua said it should be made mandatory that a man and a woman face each other in presidential and gubernatorial elections. Karua also said it should be made a requirement in law that whenever a man or a woman is running for the governor’s or president’s seat, their running mates should be of the opposite sex. The former Gichugu MP spoke in Nyeri town on Friday during the launch of a strategic plan for Nyeri county assembly women’s association.

She said all the times she has run for the presidency and governor, she picked a man as her running mate. Karua unsuccessfully ran for presidency in 2013 and governorship last year.“Mostly, you will see men running together. The day two women will run together, you will hear men and even some women complain and ask, what are these two doing running together?” Kenya should be inclusive society where men and women share equal space in positions of leadership and decision making, she said. Women have unsuccessfully been pushing for a constitutional amendment to have a section similar to Article 177, which allows nomination of gender top-up in the county assembly. Karua said the same should apply to the National Assembly and the Senate. “But now that it is not there and they have mentioned constitutional review, as women we must start thinking of how we can take advantage,” she said.
