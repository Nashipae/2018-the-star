At least 800 Ilchamus banditry attack victims on Tuesday begin the journey back to their homes in Mukutani, Baringo South, uncertain about their security. They woke up early in the money and dismantled their structures, but there were no security officers in sight. The residents, among them 300 schoolchildren, have for the last one and half years been camping in dilapidated structures in Eldume near Marigat town. They fled after an attack at Mukutani Full Gospel Churches of Kenya in March last year. Nine people were killed, 1,500 livestock stolen, shops looted and 100 houses torched. As the people return home, they are on their own. There are no security arrangments and neither have their attackers been caught and punished. Baringo County Commissioner Henry Wafula is unaware of plans for the people to return then home. "Who said there is such a resettlement plan? I'm not aware. You can ask the area Member of Parliament Charles Kamuren if he is the one who issued the orders, not me," he told the Star. 'I was not consulted. I am in a security meeting in Nairobi." The IDPs' chairman Jones Olechurai said they expected 10 lorries to help them ferry their property home, but only five had arrived. "We are not sure of our security. We have only 10 National Police Reservists with us," he said. On Monday, Kamuren said the people had decided to return home. The MP criticised the county government of not being supportive on security matters. "My people have suffered enough in the tents, they must go back to their homes. But I am begging the government to provide security," Kamuren said. Resident Willy Olesupen said they can no longer cope with the challenges in the camp. "We held talks with leaders and resolved to return home. We want to go and take care of our farms, businesses and livestock. Our children need to go back to school," he said.
