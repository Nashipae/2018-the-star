It will be a different ball game all together when the ‘Home of Champions’, synonymous with celebrated Kenyan middle and long-distance runners, hosts 2018 edition of Kabras Eldoret Rally on October 13. The hills around Uasin Gishu and Elgeyo Marakwet counties will reverberate with the roar of turbo-charged and normally-aspirated machines when the seventh and penultimate round of the Kenya National Rally Championship goes down. The Eldoret Rally will revisit the high-altitude terrain used by Western Kenya Motor Club last year. The designated spectator stage will be based at Chemweno Farm, where a 5.5km stretch is being earmarked for hair-raising thrills. The event will be flagged off at Sikh Union Club in Eldoret from 8am on October 13 after which the rally traffic will tackle a 37Km transport road section through to the opening stage at Chemweno. Ceremonial finish will take place at Chemweno Farm, which is also the venue for the service park and rally headquarters. Scrutineering and reconnaissance will take place a day prior at Sikh Union Club. Three stages, Chemweno, Farm and Forest will be repeated to compete a 142km competitive loop and a 36% liaison distance totalling 83.10km. The shortest stage is the 5.5km Chemweno spectator run with the longest being the 34km Forest segment. This year’s rally has attracted a good chunk of top drivers including current leader Carl ‘Flash’ Tundo. Onkar Rai, Manvir Baryan and Baldev Chager. The KNRC Two Wheel Drive class is expected to feature the likes of Sarit Shah and Daren Miranda while the S Class welcomes back former champion Chandrakhant Chandu Devji up against Nikhil Sachania.
