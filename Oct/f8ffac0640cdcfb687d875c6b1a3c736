The dream of the Star journalist Joseph Jamenya has become a reality following the launch of a Sh8 million cardiac unit at Vihiga County Referral Hospital. Jamenya started efforts to have the unit in the area after he lost his father to heart-related complications. He embarked on a 400km run between March 5 and April 9 this year to raise funds to buy equipment for a cardiac centre in Vihiga. Jamenya said he is happy his dream has come true. “My ailing mother and many other heart patients can be assured of treatment at the cardiac unit,” he said On Saturday, the Vihiga government marked this year’s World Heart Day by launching the Sh8 million cardiac unit. Governor Wilber Ottichilo launched the unit in Mbale, giving hope to patients suffering from heart diseases and non-communicable diseases. Ottichilo said the unit will offer heart treatment at a subsidised fee. He said the unit will be run by a cardiac specialist from Canada and will be upgraded into a cardiac and training centre by January next year at a cost of Sh40 million.
