Tatu City’s main investor Stephen Jennings has claimed that cartels are using fake news and courts to frustrate the project. He wants the Director of Criminal Investigations to speed up the probe into alleged corruption involving the directors to pave way for investors to add cash into the investment. Speaking to the press on Friday in a Nairobi hotel, Jennings said already schools, roads and estates have been constructed. “We have already constructed 5,000 houses, five schools that accommodate 1,500 students.This project on completion will better the lives of Kenyans,” he said. He cautioned on the effect of fake news and dismissed reports in the media about arrears he allegedly owes the Kenya Revenue Authority. “We have complied a hundred percent with KRA. We don’t owe them any debt concerning how our taxes are paid. KRA itself has assured us that all is well and the letter as we observed it was a hundred per cent forgery” he said. He said that his firm has used a lot of money in courts, thereby undermining their development plan. The project has languished in court for years. Click here for the latest political news
