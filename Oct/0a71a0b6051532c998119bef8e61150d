More than 200 people in Motosiet village of Emurua Dikirr subcounty, Narok, have been sleeping out in the cold after their houses were demolished on Friday in a land dispute. The 40 houses were brought down by youths hired by auctioneers and supervised by police. Environment and Land Court in Kericho granted the eviction order of illegal settlers in the 35 acres land in favour of Richard Chepkwony. Chumek Keter said the family has been living on the land all their lives and even buried their kin there. “I have been here for more than 50 years and I am wondering why a person is claiming the land. During the sub-division we had agreed with him to process one title deed and even gave money,” Keter said. Reginah Moloti said she lost all her property and stocks of food during the demolition.
