Let us sort out the IEBC first then we can go to a referendum with more objectivity, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has said. "We need to get our priorities right, let us sort out the economy, let us fight corruption, let us sort out the IEBC... I support the church's request for reform through an all-inclusive dialogue," he said. Via Twitter on Wednesday, Mudavadi said leaders cannot subject Kenyans to a referendum when they are at their most vulnerable point. "...this shall not be objective. We must first address the issues ailing the country then we can go into a referendum to amend clauses of the Constitution that need to be changed," he said. The political class is split on NASA leader Raila Odinga’s call for a referendum next year. At the weekend, the ODM supremo proposed a referendum after the 14-member Building Bridges Initiative team has submitted its report. Some politicians across the divide have supported the call. In April, Raila proposed radical constitutional changes to create a three-tier system of government. The third structure provincial would be a bridge between the national and county governments to ensure a seamless relationship between the two and equitable development across the country. The proposals are similar to the provisions in the 2005 Bomas Draft Constitution that proposed 14 regional governments. ODM backs a referendum to reintroduce the position of executive Prime Minister. Raila said the third structure will boost development in the 47 counties. More on this: Raila builds momentum for Constitution change Click here for the latest political news
