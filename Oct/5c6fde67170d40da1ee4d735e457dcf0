Education CAS Simon Kachapin has rejected claims he implemented Sh1.6 billion ‘white elephant projects during his tenure as West Pokot governor. He faulted the Senate committee that recommended that the anti-corruption agency investigate him and his staff over stalled projects. On Thursday last week during Senate sittings in Eldoret, the Public Accounts and Investments Committee grilled governor John Lonyangapuo over the projects listed in the Auditor General’s 20114-15 report. The senators said Kachapin is unfit to hold public office. Lonyangapuo said many projects initiated by his predecessor were implemented unprocedurally and had stalled. But yesterday Kachapin accused Lonyangapuo of being malicious and playing politics with public affairs. “The governor misled the committee. We have no white elephant projects. I initiated many projects and served as one of the best governors,” he said. Kachapin said most of the listed projects were to be completed in phases, but Lonyangapuo’s administration had abandoned them.
