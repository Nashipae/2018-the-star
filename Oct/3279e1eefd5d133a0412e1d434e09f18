Maize farmers have asked the government not to allow importation of extra maize because they are about to start harvesting this year’s produce. At the same time, Lugari MP Ayub Savula says he will table a bill in Parliament to regulate importation of maize. Savula says importation of maize has adversely affected local farmers, who are yet to be paid for last year’s maize. The MP says local farmers require support from the state to ensure the country is food secure. “Our farmers have extensively suffered because of maize importation. They have not even been paid for maize delivered last year yet they are about to start harvesting again,” Savula said yesterday. Farmers, led by former Keiyo North MP Lucas Chepkittony, met in Eldoret and demanded the government reviews its policies in agriculture sector to protect them. Maize prices have dropped to as low as Sh800 a bag as the government faces yet another crisis with farmers because money has not been set aside to buy maize from next month. The farmers are currently owed more than Sh2.1 billion by the National Cereals and Produce Board and are demanding that the government should buy their maize at the Sh3,200 per bag paid this year.
