The owner and manager of the bus which killed 58 people in Fort Ternan on October 10 were on Monday freed on Sh5 million bond. Bernard Shitiabayi and Western Crossroads Sacco manager Cleophas Shimanyula denied various charges related to the crash. Shitiabayi was charged with permitting an unroadworthy vehicle to operate as a public service vehicle (PSV) at night. The bus was on its way to Kakamega from Nairobi at the time of the accident few kilometres from Fort Ternan. He was also booked for allowing the bus to travel at night without NTSA licence as well as failure to keep records of the driver and his conductor. Molo chief magistrate Samuel Wahome granted them an alternative Sh1 million bail. The case will be mentioned on November 5.
