 I congratulate Ochillo Ayacko for having won the senatorial by-election. It was a democratic process and that's why the youthful candidate, Eddy Oketch of the Federal Party of Kenya, garnered 60,555 votes. This shows the county is democratic. For the record, I want to be clear that the contest was not about former Prime Minister Raila Odinga. No. It was about the issues and the development agendas the two candidates proposed for the people of Migori county. They picked Ayako because maybe he had a better agenda. Therefore, it is totally wrong to say or imagine that Baba is losing his grip on national politics, let alone Nyanza politics. Raila still commands a lot of respect,not just in Nyanza but also countrywide and his supporters still follow his directives. I should also point out that ODM, the oldest democratic party in the region, is popular and so it was during the election. That's why Ayacko emerged victorious. But we need to appreciate that Oketch was also strong and should be nurtured as a young leader with a bright future. If you study Nyanza and areas where Raila enjoys massive support, his word has always been final. Candidates who've had his blessings have always emerged the winners. Odinga-ism is still the order of the day, especially among Luos, and that's why they want him to run for President. They love him, they adore him and we listen to him because he has a place in our hearts. There are rare situations where those who have opposed Baba have succeeded; also  those who opposed or failed to listen to him have been cast into oblivion — this is a clear indication of how much his supporters love and heed him. Lastly, let me point out that if you want to test whether Raila is still the man of the moment, just speak ill of him in public or private — you will face the reaction. He may not old office but he is untouchable. The Embakasi East MP spoke to the Star
