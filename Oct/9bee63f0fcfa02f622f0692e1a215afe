MPs yesterday urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to crack the whip on individuals derailing payment of Sh1.4 billion to maize farmers. Alfred Keter of Nandi Hills, Silas Tiren of Moiben, Joshua Kandie of Baringo Central and Sammy Seronei (nominated) faulted Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri and his national Treasury counterpart Henry Rotich for not honouring their promise in paying the farmers their dues. The MPs spoke to the media at Parliament Buildings. Rotich and Kiunjuri had promised to have the farmers paid starting Monday this week but the money has not reflected into their bank accounts. “We are telling the President to take this matter seriously because it will soon turn to be a serious disaster. We need to see the real culprits behind this delay arrested,” Tiren said. “Are maize farmers being frustrated because this is the only well-paying agricultural sector?” Read: Uhuru urged to intervene so maize farmers are paid Over 500 farmers are waiting to receive their dues after supplying maize to the National Cereals and Produce Board last year. “I think there is a deliberate attempt to sabotage local production. We have borrowed up to Sh6 trillion, yet we are killing local production to attract foreign aid,” Keter said. The MP said small-scale farmers have been unable to clear school fees for their children and cater for their families due to delay of disbursement of the funds by the government. “Why are the two CSs playing PR with this sector by promising to pay farmers? The government should set its priorities right and recognise agriculture as the backbone of our nation,” Seronei said. NCPB officials in Kitale, Mois Bridge, Eldoret and elsewhere said they were waiting for cash and farmers would be paid immediately the money is sent to the depots.
