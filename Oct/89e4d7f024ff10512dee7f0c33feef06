In a gesture unlikely to be followed by many players, Mathare United’s Cliff Nyakeya, the 2018 midfielder of the year, has credited his achievement in the past season to former Gor Mahia secretary general, Chris Omondi for backing him up at a time he mulled of hanging his boots.The youthful Nyakeya was voted the midfielder of the year ahead of Ulinzi Stars Elvis Nandwa and Zoo Kericho’s Mike Madoya, a feat he believes would not have fallen on his way were it not for Omondi who breathed life into his football career at a time he wanted to call it quits at a tender age. The diminutive player launched his football career at Gor Mahia Youth in 2014 and after impressing for two years, landed his first professional contract with the slum boys in 2016 where he hastily established himself as a regular starter at the Francis Kimanzi-coached club. He admits the period between 2014 and 2016 was the most difficult in his career but an intervention by Omondi who provided basic necessities and support saved it. An emotional Nyakeya opened up on his life during his stint at Gor Youth where he was forced to gamble between sticking with the Youth team which had no provisions for salaries and allowances and pursuing further studies at his backyard in Kisii. But it was Omondi, who encouraged him to hold on football besides providing for his basic needs. He said: “Honestly, were it not for Omondi I would have given up on football long ago. He played the role of a parent to me while I was at Gor Youth and offered me the comfort which matched that of my parents. We had no salaries but he took me in and provided everything I needed despite knowing each other for a short period.” He added: “Until Mathare knocked on my door, Omondi cleared my bills and I dedicate this feat to him, my teammates and my family.”
