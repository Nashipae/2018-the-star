The maiden Kenya Airways direct flight to the United States scheduled for Sunday will take place after the industrial action was called off. This is after the National Carrier and the Kenya Aviation workers Union recorded a consent in court. The parties agreed that tomorrow’s express flight and subsequent flights will take place as scheduled in accordance with Kenya and USA laws generally and in particular as relates to cabin crew members. The consent was recorded before Employment and Labour Relations Court judge Byram Ongaya. The judge further directed the parties to continue with the negotiations for the new CBA, including negotiations on management of crew operations and emerging disputes, if any. Prior to the consent, the judge had barred members of Kawu from boycotting the maiden direct flight. Kawu had issued a directive on October 17 urging its members across all sections to stay away from KQ’s US operations until the national carrier commits to concluding their CBA negotiations before October 28. In the court documents, KQ said the directive issued by Kawu has caused panic despite the initial order barring the workers from going on strike.
