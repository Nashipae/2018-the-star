I will only rest when the court delivers justice on the murder of my daughter, Rongo University student Sharon Otieno's father has said. Douglas Otieno told K24 news that witnessing all the proceedings was a painful ordeal. "It is painful and painful enough for the whole family since I have Sharon's first born boy here. This means the two other young ones have also been left orphans," he said. Speaking outside Milimani law court on Monday, Douglas said that he believes the court will do due diligence to the murder case. "It is my belief and prayer that justice will be found for Sharon and baby Sharon... I pray for justice because I know the court will deliver justice..." he said. His wife Melida Auma said: "We are moved. But we are only pleading for justice. I am tired, I am really tired and perplexed seeing my daughter in the mortuary." The murder case against Migori Governor Okoth Obado, his PAs Michael Oyamo and Caspal Obiero were consolidated on Monday. The three denied the two counts of murder of Sharon Otieno and her unborn child. The charges were read afresh. High court judge Jessie Lessit ordered the three remanded until Friday, October 12 when their bail application will be heard.
