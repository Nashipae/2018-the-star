Uncertainty surrounds the Kenya Sevens coaching job despite Kenya Rugby Union advertising for the job a month ago. Sources close to the Union indicate that outgoing coach Innocent Simiyu, who did not re-apply for his job, may be allowed to continue as intrigues and politics take centre stage. The relationship between the union and Simiyu is strained following the blacking out of shirt sponsor, Brand Kenya, logo during the final leg of the World Sevens Series in Paris in June which saw the coach sent packing. The move saw the players strike for a week ahead of the Rugby Wold Cup until the intervention of the Sports CS Rashid Echesa to have Simiyu reinstated as well as the payment of the player’s pending allowances and salaries. Sources intimate that top officials at the Ministry of Sport and at State House want Simiyu to stay while the board at the union still insist on a new man. Homeboyz tactician and former Kenya Sevens assistant coach, Paul Murunga and Kevin Wambua of Homeboyz, are the frontrunners for the job from the 12 applicants received by the union. The position of the team manager’s job, currently held by Eric Ogweno, has also attracted interest and intrigues while the rest including physiotherapist and strength and conditioning coach seem to have been sorted out. Sources familiar with the going ons believe the boar may be forced to take a vote in determining who the head coach for the upcoming season. Simiyu’s contract expires at the end of this month and last week, he conducted trials with the 41-man squad being whittled down to 21. When contacted, KRU chief executive officer Sylvia Kamau said the board will have meeting today to decide on the appointment.
