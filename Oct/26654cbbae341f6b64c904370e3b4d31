Feathery costumes, multi-coloured
makeup and East African instruments are packed into boxes, ready
for shipping as Kenya’s National Theatre prepares to take its
popular children’s show "Tinga Tinga Tales" to New York. The cartoon by multiple BAFTA award-winner Claudia Lloyd and
Kenyan singer-songwriter Eric Wainaina features Kenyan
children's fables to explain questions from the animal kingdom,
such as why the giraffe's neck is long and how the chameleon got
its colours. The 2016 musical adaption, brought to life by a breakdancing
Rastafari tortoise, a soul singing hippopotamus and a jazz savvy
elephant, takes musical inspiration from gospel, funk and hiphop
-- genres rooted in the United States. "I'm thrilled to be able to give back to an audience that
I've borrowed so much from," said Wainaina, who is the show's
composer, music director and also plays the lead character
Monkey. "We all borrow from each other and I'm really happy to go
and show this African manifestation of all this music that I've
been listening to." The cartoon, named after a colourful Tanzanian art-style,
was first commissioned by Britain's public broadcaster, the BBC. Lloyd said she was excited to bring East African children’s
tales, visual arts and music tradition to the United States,
where the team will perform for two weeks in October at New
Victory Theatre, an off-Broadway theatre for children. She said she believed the show had the potential to reach a
much broader audience than the one it has so far entertained
with full theatres in the Kenyan capital. "When they all get up and scream and shout, that's why we
are doing this,” said Lloyd, adding she still tears up with joy
when she sees families or school classes engage in the tale and
move to the beats. "There's no reason why this couldn't tour around the world.
I would love it to go to pan-African capital cities and spread
the Tinga-love a bit." Click here for the latest political news
