An American NGO has donated a Sh700,000 water purifier to reduce waterborne diseases in Murang’a county. Water for the World president Danny Thomas said the bio-sand filter can purify 2,000 litres of drinking water daily. He spoke yesterday during the handover in Gatanga. The filter can run on solar power, other electricity, car and motorcycle batteries. It has been tested by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The machine is ideal for places that rely on borehole and river water that is easily contaminated. More than 1,300 bio-sand water filters are in use worldwide, Thoma said. The filter kills disease-causing organisms during purification. In the US, the machine is used in areas hit by floods and hurricanes to urgently purify water for victims. “The machine has a ditch filter that can be dipped in floodwater for immediate purification in case of emergencies,” Thomas said. The machine lasts for 20 years.
