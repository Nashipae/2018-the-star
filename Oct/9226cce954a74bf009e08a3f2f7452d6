A High court in Nakuru on Wednesday fined a quack lawyer Sh20,000 with an option of a month in jail after he was found guilty of contempt of court. Justice Dalmas Ohungo held that Isaac Kamau, in his own admission in court following questioning by the judge, admitted to not being a lawyer. "He deliberately represented himself and said he had rights to stand in court. I have no doubt that his conduct interfered with conduct and procedures of the court." Justice Ohungo, citing Section 27 of Contempt of Court Act, 2016, said that the offence makes litigants fall victim of quack misrepresentation. The court said that the accused had earlier stood before the court in an attempt to represent parties in a case. "He stood and addressed the court as a lawyer representing respondents in the land case number 300/15," Ohungo said. The said defendants had not responded to the matter but the lawyer claimed he wanted to proceed with the case contrary to civil procedure rules. Kamau sparked curiosity after insisting to proceed with the matter yet other parties had sought adjournment since the defence had not responded to the suit. LSK Secretary-General Stephen Opar informed the court that he had doubts if Kamau was a lawyer and had a practicing certificate. The accused later changed his mind and said he was a process server working for a firm in Naivasha. Upon investigation, it was discovered his name was not on the firm's list of employees.
