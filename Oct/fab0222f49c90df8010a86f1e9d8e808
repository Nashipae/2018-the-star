The family of a three-year-old who was defiled, killed, and her body dumped in a toilet in Mang'u, Gatundu North has demanded swift action by the police to arrest the perpetrators. Brenda Gathoni's father Sebastian Njoroge told the Star on Wednesday accused officers probing the brutal murder of his only child of dragging their feet. He said they have been giving excuses such as lack of transport to enable them investigate the last Thursday's incident. "I lost my only child and instead of police finding the killers, they are taking their sweet time. It's saddening that I will bury her without knowing her killers," Njoroge said. He said it was regrettable that the cases that are dispensed of fast in Kenya involve the rich and famous. "No one cares about the poor." However, Gatundu police boss Reuben Muli said the prime suspect in the murder was arrested and is in custody. Gathoni’s mother Margaret Wambui said: "I'm lost for words, I want quick justice. It is hard to believe or imagine that Brenda is no more." The girl was killed a day before her grandfather's burial.
