North Rift maize farmers will protest against delayed payments in Eldoret on Monday. The National Cereals and Produce Board owes them Sh3.5 billion for the maize they supplied nine months ago. The farmers yesterday met in Eldoret to demand their dues. Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter and his Moiben counterpart Sila Tiren will lead the Monday demos. Former MPs Jesse Maisz and Lucas Chepkitony also attended the meeting. Maisz questioned whether the government still intends to buy maize to be harvested from next month if it is yet to pay for past supplies. Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa had said only 500 smallholders owed less than Sh2 million each would be prioritised, but the farmers demanded that all be paid. Treasury has released Sh1.4 billion. They also demanded to have representatives in the board. “We’ve resolved that we’ll participate in the protests and follow due procedure, including informing the police,” Kenya Farmers’ Association director Kipkorir Menjo said. They said the government had frequently lied about the payments and they will not take more lies. “If the government is unable to pay us, then it should come clear than keep using lies to buy time,” David Amdany said. Keter and Tiren have said they will lead the protests to push for the payments. “It’s shameful that even senior government officials, including Cabinet secretaries, keep cheating farmers,” Keter said.

He urged the government to comply with the Maputo Declaration that requires states to allocate at least 10 per cent of the budget to the sector. The farmers are exploring alternative markets besides the NCPB. Governors of maize-producing counties, led by Uasin Gishu’s Jackson Mandago, have proposed value addition projects.
