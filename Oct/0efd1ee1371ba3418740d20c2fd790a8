The Cabinet has approved guidelines for the implementation of affordable housing under President Uhuru Kenyatta's Big Four agenda. Uhuru chaired the meeting attended by Deputy President William Ruto at State House. He said the guidelines will address the project's financing, the cost, design, quality and affordability. They will also provide a clear roadmap to establish a level playing field for both public and private sector investors. The Jubilee government has embarked on an ambitious plan for at least one million Kenyans to become homeowners by 2022. This will be achieved through the social housing and affordable housing programmes which is perceived as Uhuru's legacy in his second term. The government has set aside Sh460.2 billion this financial year to finance its Big Four agenda, under which housing is a pillar. See: Uhuru's Big Four agenda to cost Sh460.2 billion, budget summary shows The government targets to work in partnership with financial institutions, private developers, manufacturers of building materials and cooperatives to deliver homes faster and reduce the cost of construction by at least 50 per cent. Once completed, a one-bedroom unit under the social housing programme will be sold for Sh600,000, while a two-bedroom unit will go for Sh1.05 million. The cost of the units under the affordable housing programme will range from Sh800,000 for a bedsitter to Sh3 million for a three-bedroom unit. Of the one million units, 800,000 will be under the affordable housing plan, while 200,000 will be under the social housing project. Kenyans will be required to establish tenant purchase schemes to buy units in the social housing plan.
