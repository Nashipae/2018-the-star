Allies of Deputy President William Ruto on Sunday welcomed Bonny Khalwale’s support, saying it was a sign of good political times ahead. The former Kakamega senator declared he will support Ruto for president in 2022. More than 20 MPs led by Kapseret’s Oscar Sudi said the move will expand Ruto’s network ahead of the 2022 elections. Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa said Khalwale made the right move. Others who welcomed Khalwale’s support include Ndindi Nyoro, Kimani Ichungwa, Sylivanus Osoro, Lilian Tomitom, Githua Mashukuru, Alpha Ondiek and Robert Pukose. They said Ruto had demonstrated his ability to unite Kenyans. They spoke during a church fundraiser in Eldoret where Khalwale was the chief guest. Khalwale said he had made the decision after realising no candidate would beat Ruto in the race to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta. “I have a long experience in Kenya’s politics and I know it’s not possible to defeat a government candidate in an election,” Khalwale said. He said Ruto will be declared the winner of the election if he is beaten by another candidate.
