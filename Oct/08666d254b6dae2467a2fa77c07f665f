A KNH nurse was admitted after she was assaulted by a woman whose son died at the facility on Saturday. The woman was accompanied by her relatives when she attacked the nurse on duty who had informed her of the child's death. Simon Githae of Kenyatta National Hospital communications said the nurse was hit with a blunt object during the attack. KNUN vice chairman Moses Chirchir said the attacker strangled the nurse leaving her unconscious. "You would think it was a wrestling match. She covered the nurse's mouth as she strangled her," Chirchir said. The union leader condemned the incident and urged his colleagues to be wary of such attacks.
