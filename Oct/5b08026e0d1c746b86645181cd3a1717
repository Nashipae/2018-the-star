Kenya Airways will commence direct flights to New York from Nairobi
this Sunday after meeting stiff conditions set by the American government. All
the parties that contributed to this achievement deserve commendation.
There is excitement in the air that the new route will cut by half the time spent
in transit via European capitals to reach the American continent. Then there is the projected economic boom to both the
airline and the country because the flight will open up Kenya as a destination
for investment, business and holidaying. The combination of these prospects will boost the government’s
economic transformation agenda. Direct flights will create more jobs through employment
in the aviation sector with additional trickle down effect on services to the hospitality
industry. Given such high stakes, it is unpatriotic for anyone to erect
obstacles in the way of this breakthrough. The Kenya Aviation Workers Union which
has threatened to boycott the flights is no doubt aware of the significance of
this flight to the employer and the country. It is not our place to prosecute the merit of of their
members’ grievances with the national carrier. But it reeks of sabotage and
blackmail to attach their CBA dispute to such a national aspiration, however
deserving their demands may be. An agreement made under duress is not an act of
good faith. It behooves the staff to selflessly support their employer at such critical times.
