Do you want to live long? You should probably move to Laikipia in the Rift Valley. Children born in the county can expect to live for an average of 71.8 years, the highest life expectancy among the counties. This is according to a study conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, an independent population health research centre at the University of Washington. It is titled ‘Health disparities across the counties of Kenya and implications for policy makers, 1990–2016’. Homa Bay has the worst life expectancy at 57 years, with many possibly dying before the official retirement age. Governor Okoth Obado’s Migori county has the second lowest life expectancy at 59.2 years. Despite the low life expectancy, Homa Bay has improved. In 2006, it had 43 years, also the lowest in Kenya then. Migori has improved from 45.7.

Uasin Gishu follows Laikipia closely at 71.3 years. Bomet is third at 71.1 years. Overall, health outcomes have improved in Kenya since 2006. The study shows the burden of communicable diseases has decreased but continues to predominate the total disease burden in 2016, whereas noncommunicable disease burden has increased. Siaya has the greatest improvement — 64.7 against 46.8 in 2006. This marked about 18 more years. The findings were published last week. The national life expectancy is 66.8 years. “Health gains varied strikingly across counties, indicating targetted approaches for health policy are necessary. The county governments should develop specific public health interventions,” the study says. The researchers said they looked at the burden of diseases in the counties, and those doing badly have a high HIV burden, especially among young people. They used global burden of diseases 2016 estimates of life expectancy at birth, healthy life expectancy, “all-cause and cause-specific mortality, years of life lost and years lived with disability”. They also focussed on “disability-adjusted life-years, and risk factors to analyse health by age and sex at the national and county levels in Kenya from 1990 to 2016”. Among the top counties, Bomet is followed by Kericho ( 70.8 ), Trans Nzoia ( 70.4 ), Murang’a ( 70.3 ) and Nakuru ( 70.2 ). Other counties with life expectancy above the national average are Embu ( 69.7 ), Bungoma ( 69.5 ), Machakos ( 69.5 ), Nairobi ( 69.3 ), Kitui ( 69 ), Nandi ( 69 ), Mombasa ( 68.7 ), Makueno ( 68.6 ) Kirinyaga ( 68.2 ), Baringo ( 68.4 ), Kiambu ( 68 ), Kajiado ( 67.9 ), West Pokot ( 67.9 ), Elgeyo ( 67.6 ), Kilifi ( 67.6 ), Kisii ( 67 ) and Tharaka Nithi ( 66.8 ). “In 1990, a gap of 19 years was recorded between counties with the lowest and highest life expectancy, and by 2016, that gap had narrowed to 15 years,” Prof Tom Achoki said. The head of African initiatives at the IHME is one of its authors. The study showed that from 2006 to 2016, deaths declined across all age groups, although males and females aged 15–24 years lagged behind. The other bottom counties are Tana River ( 60.3 ), Kisumu ( 60.5 ), Vihiga ( 63. 2 ), Nyandarua ( 63.3 ), Turkana ( 64.1 ), Wajir ( 64.1 ), Mandera ( 64. 3 ), Taita Taveta ( 64.5 ), Busia ( 64.5 ), Siaya ( 64.7 ), Kakamega ( 65.3 ), Lamu ( 65.5 ) and Isiolo ( 65.6 ).
