Instagram appears to have gone down with hundreds of social media users unable to log in to the photo-sharing website. More than 1,000 people worldwide have reported problems with the Facebook-owned platform early on Wednesday morning. Attempts to log in on a desktop browser are producing a blank page with the message: '5xx Server Error'. On the mobile app users are being told that their feed cannot be refreshed. Tweets posted by frustrated users suggested the Instagram outage stretched across the globe with the app not working in London, San Francisco or Singapore. The website DownDetector said the problems had begun at 8.16am British time, which was 3.16am in New York and 5.16pm in Sydney. People commenting on the website's updates also reported problems in California, Indonesia, India and Romania. Almost an hour later users were still receiving error messages when they tried to load the website. One Twitter user said: 'That feeling when you delete Instagram  in hopes that it will start working again and you try to re long in and you can't even get past the login page.' Another said: 'I really just turned off my wifi, turned it back on again, tried using my 4g, turned my 4g off and on again, restarted my phone only to come on twitter realizing instagram was down and it wasn't just me.' One tweeted directly to the company, saying: 'Why is your server down for so long? Showing 503 error code. Put your team to work'. Another wrote: 'Instagram is down... across the world people are looking up from their phones, confused, angry, tearful.' And a further Twitter user said: 'Can't sleep and instagram is apparently down. what am I supposed to do now?' Instagram, which has more than a billion monthly users, has been contacted for comment.
