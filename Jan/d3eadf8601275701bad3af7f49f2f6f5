Akothee is expected in court today to fight for the custody of her son. The singer is not happy with the process and claims that the father of her child is being unreasonable in his demands. "I'm happy he finally filed his case in court under matter of urgency! But my question is, what does Markus (her baby daddy) really want? Is it true he really wants to see his son? Or he wants us as a package? Is this not the same man who threw me out nine months pregnant and denied the child? Is this not the same father who took his son at three years to Switzerland and brought him back after three months, saying he has no time and he wants to enjoy his life?" Akothee ranted online. She continued, "This time round, I will go to jail for you! I will climb mountains for you my son! It has been eight years of struggle, pain and humiliation from your dad! The tears I don't allow you to see, just as I protected you from adverse weather and through God's miracles, I brought you into the harsh world! So will I still and be there for you my king! Ooh yes you are a hero and A king Akothee sons, your mum is #Malefemale #InternationalBabyMama." The singer has five children with three baby daddies. She proudly adds, "I can't edit or swallow my past. This too shall pass, who wanna come with me to court tomorrow?"
