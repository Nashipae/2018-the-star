Opposition leaders Raila Odinga and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed yesterday attended the hearing of an election petition against Embakasi East MP Babu Owino. Raila was in court for 30 minutes then he left. Speaking to the media on his way out, he said he cannot comment on today’s swearing-in as there is a committee dealing with it. He, however, told his supporters to meet at Uhuru Park. Owino was in court to oppose an application by his opponent Francis Mureithi seeking scrutiny and recount of votes in all 207 polling station in the August 8, 2017 election. Through his lawyer Jackson Awele, Owino told Justice Joseph Sergon the application for scrutiny and recount was “frivolous”. “We object to the application for scrutiny, the court should not grant orders for a frivolous application, which has no proof of issues raised. The court will rule on the scrutiny application on February 5.
