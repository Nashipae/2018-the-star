Toyota Kenya posted an increased market share by from 15 per cent in
2016 to 20 per cent in 2017 despite a general economically tough year. They attributed the improvement to the highest market share over other car dealers. The car dealer has partnered with NIC
Bank to give customers a three month holiday on payment financing for pick-up buyers. “We are enticing customers to buy from us because immediately the
bank finances them, they will drive away with the pick-up and then start paying
for it four months into the finance grant,” MD Toyota Kenya
Arvinder Reel said during the signing of the agreement. The targets is business people who contribute largely to the country’s economy use
pick-ups to transport their tools of trade like agricultural produce,
construction industries et al to the markets. “With this agreement we hope to contribute
to the healing of Kenya’s economy in 2018 and there are plans to introduce to
the market more products and services to our esteemed customers in the near
future,” NIC bank executive director Allan Dodd said. Dodd said a high percentage of the business community
operates on financial institutions and transport sector since these are the
main needs for their operations to be successful. The ninety-day holiday offer is
flexible because one is allowed to pay in installments depending on how much
financing NIC grants them. Those who get huge financing are expected to pay
higher installments compared to the ones with little financings. The car dealer
will give free one year insurance for every pick-up bought.
