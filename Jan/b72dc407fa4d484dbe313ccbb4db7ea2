Corporal Jared Ogutu who was caught on camera extorting a driver will be dismissed. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet on Saturday said that they will not tolerate graft. “The officer in question is being processed by the Police disciplinary code for eventual dismissal." Boinnet said. Boinnet also said Kenyans found bribing police officers to avoid arrest also risk being arrested. The victim is a post graduate student at the Makerere University. Ogutu stopped the student who was in the country for some engineering projects along the Narok highway. He asked him for Sh 2000 but he only had Sh1000/. "We only accept thousands but if you have Sh2000, that is fine," Ogutu is heard telling the students in a video that has gone viral on social media.
