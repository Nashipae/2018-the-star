An acute water shortage has once again hit Garissa’s Masalani subcounty as residents call for an immediate solution. Speaking in Masalani yesterday, the residents said the crisis has forced them to seek alternative ways to get water. They added that the county government has ignored their plight. Resident Mohamud Abdi said taps have remained dry for three weeks. Residents walk to the River Tana, about 10km from Masalani town. Others buy water from vendors who sell at exorbitant prices. “The taps have remained dry. We are having difficulties in running day-to-day affairs at home or at work,” Abdi said. Khadija Ahmed said women and children are the worst affected, adding that they are spotted looking for water in the neighbourhoods, sometimes until late in the night. “We are calling for the governor to intervene,” she said.
