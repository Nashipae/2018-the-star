Nairobi county police commander Japet Koome has assured city residents of their safety while going about their businesses in the CBD. He said dozens of suspected muggers were arrested on Saturday night adding that the lot will be taken to court on Monday. "We have the responsibility to protect that wallet of yours in the pocket," he said during a presser at his office on Sunday. Koome said police will continue with the crackdown on muggers and criminals who continue to wreak havoc in the city. "This operation is continuous and is happening on a daily basis. But my concern is these youth who continue to lose their lives in confrontations with the police." Last week, Nairobi security chiefs put on a brave face in the wake of a new wave of mugging and armed robberies in the Central Business District. Koome said they were dealing with the situation after the Star reported of spiralling criminal incidents despite a new police team being formed to deal with the muggers. The team comprises of officers from the Special Crime Prevention Unit
and the Flying Squad. It was formed to deal with cases of criminals
who attack customers walking out of banking halls and ATM.
