Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong on Tuesday said petitioner Peter Odima moved to court for revenge. He told judge Kiarie Waweru that he refused to support Odima’s during ODM nominations for Nambale parliamentary seat and that is why he was bitter. “When Odima left his job as my director of resource mobilisation, he thought I would support his bid to win the ODM nominations. He later turned his anger on me by filing the petition,” he said. Ojaamong was testifying in a petition challenging his reelection. Earlier while being cross-examined by the petitioner’s lawyer, David Ochieng, Ojaamong denied his involvement in the leaflets that portrayed his opponent Paul Otuoma as a Jubilee mole. Ojaamong said Otuoma did not dispute the ODM nominations results and he also never denied being a Jubilee mole.
