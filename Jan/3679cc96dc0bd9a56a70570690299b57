There is a looming nurses strike in Nakuru. Some 1,200 nurses in the county have issued a seven-day ultimatum to the county government over three months pay arrears. Marching to the county offices yesterday to deliver the notice, the nurses said the have not received salaries for the months of August, September and October. This is despite the county government promising to make a lump sum payment this month. Kenya National Union of Nurses Nakuru secretary Syprene Odera said the government withheld the salaries as the nurses pushed for the signing of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.  She said it is unfortunate that other counties have received their pay for four months. Odera added that there is no clear communication from the employer on when they will be paid. The employees under KNUN were among health workers who went on the prolonged strike that disrupted services in health facilities across the country for more than four months.
