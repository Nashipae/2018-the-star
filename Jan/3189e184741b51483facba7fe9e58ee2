The National Land Commission has said it will compensate all those whose land will be acquired for the expansion of the Lamu-Garsen road. The tender for the 135-km road was awarded to H Young. However, NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri yesterday said only alternative land will be offered, not money. The road was commissioned by President Uhuru Kenyatta when he toured Witu town on March 9 last year. There has been little progress since. The government allocated Sh10.4 billion for the expansion of the road, which has been in a dilapidated state for decades. Swazuri said about 90 per cent of the land required is vacant so “just a handful” of individuals will be resettled. He said the National Land Commission is waiting for a full report from the survey department to determine the number to be resettled. Locals feared they had been duped out of their land following months of silence. Former Lamu Woman Representative Shakilla Abdalla accused the government of playing cat-and-mouse games.
