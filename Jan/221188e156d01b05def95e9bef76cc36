Senator Moses Kajwang’ yesterday urged governors to strengthen devolution
through proper use of public resources.
 He
said proper use of public resources would help reduce the stiff competition
for the presidency every election year. The new Senate
Public Accounts Committee chairman said his committee plans to strengthen
devolution by enhancing accountability of devolved funds.
 “It is high
time leaders tasked with management of public resources proved they are capable
of utilising them well,” Kajwang’ said in a press
release sent to journalists. He
said he is ready to use his new position to ensure governors spur
development in the counties. “Kenyans
require counties where youths can get employment, traders can have conducive
business environment and good service delivery. I’m ready to use my position to
ensure the billion of shillings the counties receive yearly are spent in a manner
that can transform the lives of citizens,” he added.
