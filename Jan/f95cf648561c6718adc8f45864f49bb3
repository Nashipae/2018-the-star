Nyashinski is about to prove that he is the king of Kenyan music. A source, who is close to the Star, whispered to us that Nyashinski is about to walk away with a mega deal of Sh20 million. The Raverend can confirm that Nyashinki will be spearheading a major campaign, which is yet to be announced. After a music hiatus, the Mungu Pekee star has proven that he has what it takes to take Kenyan music to the global stage. His music releases have all shot up the music charts not only in Kenya but also in East Africa. This deal will cement the fact that he is the unopposed king of Kenyan music.
