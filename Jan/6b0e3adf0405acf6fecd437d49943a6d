Kiambu Women Representative Gathoni Wamuchomba yesterday asked politicians to stop criticising President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Cabinet nominees. She was speaking in Karai ward, Kikuyu constituency, when she visited a family whose house was razed. Stanley Kamau said he lost property worth more than Sh500,000 on Sunday night. His wife Lucy Wambui and their children David, Jane and Grace escaped unhurt. Wamuchomba said Uhuru should be left alone to make his decisions. When he was campaigning, he had a vision, which he wants fulfilled, she said. Wamuchomba urged politicians to give the head of state space to appoint his preferred choices. “This is his last term and he has a dream. He wants to leave a legacy and he can only achieve it when we allow him to appoint able people who’ll make his dream come true,” she said.
