Vehicle maker Foton will re-invest over $2.5 million (Sh257.25 million) to rebuild market share in Kenya and the greater East African region. “We have coordinated with our dealer and partner in Mombasa with the total investment amount of up to $2 million and are launching a local manufacturing plant for a total investment of around $500,000 for an assembly line,” Foton Motor Kenya president Apple Sun said yesterday. The firm will assemble three to four units per day within the first half of this year. “The target is to hit 1,000 units this year which will come up to 8,000 units in five years,” he said during the launch of its AUMAN EST heavy duty truck and SUV Sauvana. The firm will focus on the Kenyan market in manufacturing, after-sales services, spare parts system and financial support, to accelerate competition in Kenya’s automotive industry and promote the development of the local automotive industry.
