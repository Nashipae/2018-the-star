Nakumatt's Nanyuki branch was closed on Tuesday over rent arrears of Sh36 million. By the time the supermarket was temporarily closed on November 6 last year, 42 workers had not been paid for six months. Before the closure today, property of unknown value was thrown out of the outlet at Nanyuki Mall by people who arrived at 3am. The goods were scattered outside the premises and later moved to a store about two kilometres away for possible auctioning. Police officers who arrived later fired in the air to scare away the people who also stole from the premises. A policeman who did not want to be named said the building's owner obtained a court order on evicting the client over rent arrears of that amount. But the source said they had not been notified of the eviction. “People believed to have been hired by the owner of the mall [carried out their operation] without involving police officers.” Nakumatt Diani was shut down last November amid efforts to revive what was once East Africa's thriving supermarkets chain. Some of employees were shocked when they found the premises locked. In a notice seen by The Star, Southcoast Holdings Limited had notified Nakumatt that the owner of the building had decided to re-occupy it.
