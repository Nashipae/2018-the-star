Politicians, academics, researchers and students on Saturday bid farewell to a researcher, development icon and the world global climate change think tank Prof Calestous Juma. NASA co-principals Raila Odinga, MusaliaMudavadi,MosesWetang’ula and Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong led the political wing at the burial at Juma’s Bumina village home in Bunyala West ward. Raila eulogised Juma, who worked at Harvard University, as a distinguished Kenyan scholar who helped build the country’s profile across the globe. “I have come to mourn not just a great Kenyan, but a great African and a great man of the human race. Calestouswasafriendandcomrade of mine,” he said. Raila continued, “Whenever he published a book, he would bring me a copy, the latest being The New Harvest. In the book Prof Juma decries Africa, which is a giant continent, yet it continues to be a perennial underachiever with children dying of hunger.” Raila said Juma described as a paradox the fact that the richest continent cannot be self-sufficient and able to harness water and other resources to feed its population, adding mediocrity in leadership is responsible for the poverty ravaging Africa. Mudavadi said Juma believed in every student’s ability to make a difference in the world and urged them to emulate the African intellectual giant. Wetang’ula said Juma had a humble beginning before scaling the ladder of academia. “Let Prof not go in vain, but we should emulate what he stood for. He believed in hard work,” he said.
