Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya will name his new cabinet on January 31 because of an ongoing external audit. He was to provide the new list yesterday, but the county communications office said on Tuesday the event had been put off. “The Kakamega county government cabinet unveiling that was to be done tomorrow [yesterday] by HE the Governor has been rescheduled for January 31, 2018 due to the ongoing auditing exercise in the various ministries and departments by external auditors,” the office said. Oparanya said in December that he knew all “witches and corrupt individuals” in his administration and gave them until yesterday to quit. A county officer yesterday said the decision by the governor would ensure all outgoing CECs respond to any audit queries that may rise. He told the Star that all senior county officials facing audit queries would be dropped, but the postponement will ensure they provide relevant information to help in the probe. “You can imagine a situation where audit queries are raised against an officer whom you have dropped. Do you think he or she would be willing to provide the right information?” he said, adding the CECs are uncertain about their future and this has caused anxiety and disrupted county services.
