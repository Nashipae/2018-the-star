Five Western counties are in talks over the formation of an economic partnership that will see them share ideas and promote trade amongst themselves. Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya and his Bungoma counterpart Wycliffe Wangamati said it was important for the Western counties to form an economic bloc. The other counties in the partnership are Vihiga, Busia and Trans Nzoia. Oparany said the move will help the counties to develop. “It will be easier for us to work together because we are all NASA affiliated governors,” Oparanya said. He said they soon will meet to conclude talks and come up with logistics on how the partnership will work.  Wangamati said the governors can make a difference in the lives of their people if they worked together. “With the over Sh40 billion we get, we can improve the lives of our people in so many ways,” Wangamati said.  The partnership will seek to revamp local industries like the Mumias and Trans Nzoia Sugar companies and the privatised Rai Paper Mills.
