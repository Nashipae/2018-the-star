National Super League debuntants Coast Stima have dismissed reports that they may fail to feature in the competition. Anxiety had gripped the Mombasa-based outfit after reports emerged that Football Kenya Federation might consider either blocking their participation or have them merged with other two teams, owing to multiple club ownership. Coast Stima, Western Stima and Nairobi Stima, which are all expected to feature in the NSL, are owned by Kenya Power and Lightning Company. The Mombasa team was promoted after beating Division One Zone ‘B’ runners up Timsales by a solitary goal in a play-off staged at Camp Toyoyo, Nairobi. Western Stima was relegated from the Premier League after 10 years stint. The Nairobi outfit also maintained its slot in the NSL while Western Stima were relegated ton the second tier. Coast Stima CEO David Kambu has maintained that they club will take part in NSL. “We have been in consultation with the FKF office and they have no objection to our participation in the league,” he said. He said it is ‘retrogressive’ to ‘kill’ a team because of mere multiple club ownership during this period when sponsors are reconsidering their partnerships, owing to heavy taxation. According to the CEO, each team is a ‘different entity with a different section and welfare’. “Therefore no conflict would warrant disbandment,” he said.
