Kenya’s Sandra Felis Chebet Tuei broke the Valencia 10km course record, slashing two minutes off Fatima Ayachi’s mark of 32:56 set during the 2012 edition.

Kimeli, who trains at St Patrick’s Iten High School grounds under coach Colm O’Connell said he weathered strong winds in Iten to record an improved time compared to December’s 28:57. The teenager said he is preparing to compete at the national track trials as he seeks to be a member of Team Kenya to the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia in April. “I am using this to sharpen my skills and improve my time. I am looking forward to representing my country at the Commonwealth Games,” Kimeli said. Kite won the race at 33:52 to defeat Dorcas Kimeli (34:25) and Hilda Chesir (35:22). Edna Kibiwott won the 6km junior women’s race in 19:43 while Ronnex Kipruto clocked 22:18 to win the boy’s 8km race men. “I trained properly and I am in a better form this time,” Kite said, adding the race will prepare her to compete for a slot in the 1500M in the Commonwealth Games.
