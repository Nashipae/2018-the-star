The 3,900 Uasin Gishu students who score
D- and below in 2017 KCSE tests will join technical training institutes. Governor Jackson Mandago said the county will help them join these institutions so they can learn skills such as masonry, carpentry and plumbing. Mandago said at least 500 students who scored Es will not be left out of the programme and that a county education forum will discuss how to assist these groups. The goal is to end the "worrying trend". "The county will hire the skilled youths for construction projects in the region that will be undertaken by the county and national governments," said Mandago. “We are about to start construction
of more than 2,000 housing units in Eldoret under a national government plan. We will need skilled youths ... this is why we must prepare them." Mandago backed calls for the results to be audited due to mass failure and said a stakeholders' meeting should be held for discussions on possible problems during marking. "Many students have been locked out of institutions of higher learning," he noted in Turbo. "We cannot [watch] as thousands of children suffer. Their future will be ruined."
