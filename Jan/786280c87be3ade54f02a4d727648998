Nairobi Deputy Governor Polycarp Igatheâ€™s shock post-dated resignation, which becomes effective on January 31, brings the issue of the role of this devolved government designation to the fore.  In Nyeri, where Deputy Governor Mutahi Kahiga succeeded Governor Wahome Gakuru after he died in a road crash, there is now no deputy governor. In Machakos, Governor Alfred Mutua served his first term effectively without a deputy. Many complaints have been made to the effect that the position of deputy governor is not properly defined in law. For instance, there is no law that says what happens when a deputy governor leaves office or is forced out. This is a serious lacuna in the law and should be addressed. The Senate has a pending bill that seeks to address these concerns. We urge the senators to pass this legislation to bring clarity to an important part of devolved government. Even as the law is being sorted out, governors and deputy governors should maintain cordial working relations for the sake of service delivery and the big picture of devolved governance.
