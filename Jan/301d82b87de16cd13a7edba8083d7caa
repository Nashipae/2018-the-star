Just few days after resigning as Vihiga United head coach, Edward Manoah wants his job back. The tactician, who steered Vihiga County-sponsored club to winning the National Super League and earning automatic qualification to the Kenya Premier League, is among those who have applied for the job. Twelve coaches including seven foreigners have applied to handle Vihiga United on their debut in the top tier. The job was advertised following Manoah’s resignation. Manoah’s latest move has left Kenyans wondering why the tactician quit in the first place. Manoah is a common figure at the team’s training ground and his latest move doesn’t come as a surprise.  Other tacticians who have shown interest in the job include former AFC Leopards coach James Nandwa, Ezekiel Akwana and Former international striker Francis Chinjil.  The team’s Executive Committee has also received application from Frenchman Jean Claude and Portuguese coach Paulo do Santos. Others are Zoran Pesic (Serbia), Trevor Morgan (Australia), Roy Barreto (Portugal), Giovonni Costantino (Italy) and Enoch Ken Yamonbe (South Africa). EC chairman, Indimuli Kahi, said the process of hiring the coach is in it’s final stage and they will unveil the tactician tomorrow. “Vihiga United have grown to a level where it attracts foreign coaches,” he bragged.  He assured fans that they will hire a competent coach to handle the club, adding that they have already resumed training at Kidundu stadium.  He said they will proceed for a pre-season training outside the county as part of their KPL preps, starting next week.  “The good news is that we haven’t lost any player and we have dropped 12,” he said.
