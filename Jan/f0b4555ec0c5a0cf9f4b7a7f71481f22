Four University of Nairobi students were yesterday charged in a Nairobi court with creating disturbance in a manner likely to disturb the peace. Austine Gotoeh, Elvis Kilwei, Hilary Ochieng and Comsmas Wakoli blocked a public road. They appeared before Milimani senior principal magistrate Peter Oloo and denied the charges. The prosecution says on Thursday, along State House Road in Nairobi county, the accused jointly with others not before court, created disturbance in a manner likely to cause a breach of peace. They are also said to have threatened and shouted at the motorists on the same road. The magistrate ordered each of them to be released on Sh50,000 bail pending hearing of the case on February 19.
