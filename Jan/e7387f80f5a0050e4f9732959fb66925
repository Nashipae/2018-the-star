She added that the Garissa PSV Sacco bus destined for Wajir from Nairobi on Tuesday last week crashed at Kanginga area near Mwingi.  Some of the vehicle’s parts were fastened with sisal ropes.  “The ropes were a clear indication of what caused the crash,” Kimanzi said.  The MCA said such vehicles should be removed from the roads in the bid to end carnage. Click here for the latest political news
