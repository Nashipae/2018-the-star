Two children have died in Ugunja, Siaya, after eating cassava bought from a neighbour. Their father Peter Onyango said the two, aged three and 10, died before receiving treatment after they were rushed to the Siaya County Referral Hospital (pictured). Margaret Akoth, 3, and Allan Odhiambo, 10, developed stomach complications after they ate cassava for lunch. “I personally bought the cassava from my neighbour for Sh50 before I prepared it for lunch. I had the meal together with my five children,” Onyango said. In the evening, the children started vomiting and complaining of stomachaches, he said. “I rushed them to Ambira Subcounty Hospital, but they immediately referred us to Siaya County Referral Hospital, where the two died on arrival,” Onyango said. He blamed the hospital for a slow response. “Had they been attended to immediately after our arrival, they would have survived,” he said. Onyango said he was forced to rush the other children to the nearby Bama Hospital. The three regained consciousness and were later discharged after receiving medication. The children’s mother, Seline Onyango, was away for a funeral at her paternal home in Alego-Usonga. She learned of the ordeal after receiving a call that her children were in a critical condition and had been rushed to hospital. The family has appealed to the county government to foot the medical and mortuary bills so they can take the bodies for burial.
