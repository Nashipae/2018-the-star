Telkom Kenya head coach, Jos Openda, is keen to extend their winning streak to 10 title during the Africa Cup of Club Championship set for January 20-28 in Accra, Ghana. The team, previously known as Orange Telkom, have won the event for the last five years in a row and nine times overall. Telkom defeat Ghana Revenue Authority 2-0 to retain the title the last year at the City Park Stadium, Nairobi. Openda said besides the change in name, the playing unit remains intact and raring to go. “The good thing is that I still have the same players who have brought accolades to the country and the change of the name doesn’t really affect us in any way. However, we are glad we won the titles under the previous name and we want to start on a high note under a new name,” said the tactician, who has guided the national champions to win the Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) league title a record 19 times. Openda, who has been nominated for the Safaricom Sports Personality of the Year awards is, however, wary of their West Africans rivals. “For instance, I am aware the Ghanaian teams are training in South Africa ahead of the event and they are no pushovers but we are also doing everything at our disposal to be at a at our best prior to the event. It is not going to be easy but we know what we want,” he observed. A provisional squad of 26 players resume training tomorrow at the City Park Stadium, having taken a two-day break. “If all goes well, we will jet out of the country on January 18. We have a league match next weekend, after which, we will name traveling squad of 20 players,” said Openda. Telkom and Strathmore University are scheduled to represent the country during the 9-day event.
