As a way of mobilising resources for the forthcoming 2018 Kenya Premier League season, debutants Wazito have acquired the services of a new patron Sammy Itemere replacing Solomon Alubala. Itemere has been tasked with getting the club a sponsor who will help in shouldering the financial costs for their maiden KPL season. After earning promotion to the top flight, Wazito publicly admitted their struggles without a sponsor and the acquisition of a new patron is set to bridge them to the cooperate world. Itemere, who serves as the Principal Secretary in Ministry of Information, Communication and Technology is set to use his connections with potential sponsors and bring on board a new funder. Wazito’s chief executive officer, Luthers Mokua, expressed the club’s delight to have Itemere on board and their confidence in getting a sponsor.  “We are happy that Itemere has accepted to be our patron for the upcoming season. He has connections with potential sponsors and I am confident he will help us get resources to cater our needs for the season. We have struggled without a sponsor before but I am confident the new patron will bring partners on board. He brings to Wazito FC high energy, passion, drive, commitment to excellence and— above all—trust in God. We look forward to his leadership.” Itemere, a golf enthusiast, has in the past served as the chairman of the Royal Nairobi Golf Club, and is also a member of Muthaiga Golf Club.  He is also a gym lover and has served as a member on several boards notably chairman of Golf Course Community Resident Association, vice chairman Royal Nairobi Golf Club, director Rotary Club Services, President Rotary Club of Milimani and committee member of Nairobi Gymkhana and Global Hope.  Wazito finished second in the National Super League, earning promotion to KPL and they are set to kick off their campaign against Sony Sugar on February 5.
