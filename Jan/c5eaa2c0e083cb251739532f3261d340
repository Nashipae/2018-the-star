At least 18 cows and 24 sheep died in Ngaamba location, Makueni count, after drinking dam water believed to have been poisonous. Chief Sammy Musyoki said the animals, valued at about Sh825,000, drank water at Kwa Nthambi dam between December 26 last year and January 1. "We suspect the water was poisoned and have warned residents against using it. No deaths have been reported since we imposed the ban." Benson Munguti, a farmer, told reporters on Wednesday that he lost livestock worth Sh150,000. "The animals died the same day after they were watered at the dam which we suspect was poisoned," he said. But he noted veterinary officers did not understand the circumstances under which the animals died. Makueni Agriculture CEC Lawrence Nzunga said they collected samples from the dam and carcasses for testing by the national government chemist. "We have taken samples to Kabete laboratories to
establish what killed the animals," he told the Star, adding they were to get the results after a short while. Affected farmers appealed to the county for help in recovering their losses. Click here for the latest political news
