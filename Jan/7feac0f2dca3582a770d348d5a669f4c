The
deteriorating state of security in Pokot, Marakwet, Kerio Valley and parts of
Baringo and the Mt Elgon region is cause for worry. Basically,
bandits are killing and maiming people at will. This cannot possibly be allowed
to continue. In some cases, bandits are attacking villages, killing – and
stealing nothing. In
Marakwet, teachers, pupils and their parents are fleeing the area for
fear of attacks. People
have been forced to live in caves, which are populated with poisonous snakes. In Mt
Elgon, about 20 people have been killed over a two-month period by a gang armed
with guns. In
Kapkateny, a man was killed and his high school daughter raped. There are fears
of a resurgence of the dreaded SLDF militia that caused the death of over 1,200
people more than a decade ago. Interior
CS Fred Matiang’i, who reformed the education sector with much gusto, should
take insecurity in these regions as his priority project, and help bring about
a lasting solution.
