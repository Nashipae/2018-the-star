A company which supplied lingerie to the Queen has lost its royal warrant over a book which revealed details of royal bra fittings. Rigby & Peller, a luxury underwear firm founded in London, had held the royal warrant since 1960. It was withdrawn after June Kenton, who fitted bras for the Queen, released a book called 'Storm in a D-Cup'. Kenton said there was "nothing" in the book to "be upset about", adding that it was an "unbelievable" decision. Buckingham Palace said it did not "comment on individual companies". A statement from Rigby & Peller said it was "deeply saddened" by the decision, adding it was "not able to elaborate further on the cancellation out of respect for her Majesty the Queen and the Royal Warrant Holders Association". Kenton, from Bushey in Hertfordshire, had bought Rigby & Peller with her husband in 1982 for £20,000 before selling a majority stake in 2011 for £8m - although she remains on the board. As official "corsetiere" to the Queen, Kenton regularly visited Buckingham Palace and served members of the Royal Family, including the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret.
