Two people sustained injuries following a fire which gutted business premises in Homa Bay town on Saturday. Elvin Atieno, 21, and her one-year-old daughter sustained burns and were rushed to Homa Bay county referral hospital for treatment. The fire also burned about 15 shops causing the owners losses estimated to be worth millions of shillings. Efforts by residents to fight the fire manually proved futile. The county's two fire engines were not dispatched to the scene. County police commander Marius Tum said they cause of the fire is yet to be established. "We
are assessing the value of property lost as investigations into what caused the fire continues," Tum
said. Jack
Nyambega, Homa Bay Giant Traders Association secretary general, asked the county government to purchase a fire engine. "This
is the seventh fire in the last six months. It is unfortunate that all
the fires destroy property without rescue." "Let the county government
purchase a fire fighting machine to salvage the situation in future,"
Nyambega said.  The affected traders said the tragedy caused them huge economic losses. Sophie Achieng’ said she lost furniture and other times estimated to be worth Sh2 million. MCAs Joan Ogada (Kojwach), Michael Nyang’i (Kochia) and Charles Awino (Gem East) said they will pass laws so that those who lose property are compensated. Ogada said they will pass laws which will enhance disaster management preparedness when they resume proceedings. Awino asked the county's department of disaster management to be proactive during such incidents. Click
