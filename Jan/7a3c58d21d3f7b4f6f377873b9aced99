UNFPA Kenya's evaluation programme has been ranked among the top five of 2017 globally. Evaluation office director Marco Segone said 'End Evaluation of GoK/UNFPA 8th Country Programme 2014-2018' is among the best evaluations, having received a quality assessment rating of 'very good'. "The evaluation stood out for a myriad of reasons, including its inclusion of a specific section on lessons learned and thorough approach to data collection and triangulation," Segone said in a statement to Nairobi from the headquarters in New York on Monday. The rating was conducted by an external independent consultancy firm, which undertook the quality assessment of the evaluation reports from all implementing countries. “I would like to encourage your office to continue to prioritise evaluation by supporting the production of good quality evaluations and facilitating the use of evaluation findings and recommendations for improved effectiveness and efficiency of your programmes,” read the statement. It was sent to the Kenya country representative, Dr Ademola Olajide. UNFPA Kenya is involved in initiatives including advocacy mechanisms to end female genital mutilation, managing the population, gender-based violence interventions and neo-natal and maternal health. It has partnered with organisations including the National Council for Population and Development, the Beyond Zero Campaign Secretariat and selected local communities. Its goals are to improve lives and enhance health service delivery. Click here for the latest political news
