Former Mombasa ACK Diocese Bishop Julius Kalu has advised NASA leader Raila Odinga not to “lift the Bible” to avoid chaos. He has also hit out at President Uhuru Kenyatta for “breathing hot and cold” concerning dialogue with Raila.  Uhuru has maintained he will only discuss economic development, not politics.  Raila said political uncertainty hurts financial progress and dialogue should be prioritised.  Kalu said Raila should abandon the planned inauguration slated for January 30 and instead reach out to Uhuru. The bishop said millions of Uhuru and Raila’s supporters will clash if their differences persist. “All we want is peace! Peace! Peace!” he said Friday at the Mombasa ACK Diocese after his last sermon before retiring. NASA announced it will name members of its Assumption of Office Committee to plan the ceremony. The People’s Assembly Organising Committee said a team has been identified and is working round the clock to fine-tune the oath plans that will kick-start the opposition’s broad agenda of entrenching electoral reforms. Sources told the Star NASA will stick to the date of the oath ceremony, which the state warned is treasonous and punishable by death. “An Assumption of Office Committee, which is already in place and working, will be unveiled in the coming days, and that Committee will keep you informed,” ODM executive director Oduor Ong’wen said.
