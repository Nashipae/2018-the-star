ACK Mombasa Diocese Bishop Alphonse Baya will be installed on Sunday at the Memorial Cathedral. Last Sunday, he was consecrated by ACK Archbishop Jackson Sapit. The announcement was made on the Sunday  service sheets. The service was held that day at the cathedral. Cathedral Provost Festus Kiseu said the ACK constitution required the new bishop to be installed before he is allowed to conduct service inside the church. Kiseu, Emmanuel  Nzaka, George Kuza  and Tom Dawawas are men of the cloth who moved to court to block Baya from taking over from retired Bishop Julius Kalu. Baya won the election, but it was challenged in court. The case was thrown out and church members fought in disagreement. The petitioners skipped Baya’s consecration that was held under tight security at the Kenya Ports Authority Mbaraki Sports Club. Kisesu said the installation will be carried out by ACK Mombasa  counsellor Wamuti Ndegwa during the 11am service. “The ceremony is part and parcel of the laid down procedures within the ACK fraternity,” he said. Baya  is the grandson of late Venerable Canon Emeritus Nathaniel Mweri of  Nairobi ACK St Stephen church, Jogoo Road, Nairobi.
