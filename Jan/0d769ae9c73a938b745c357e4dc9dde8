Marsabit residents on Monday said they have benefited from the tarmacking of the Isiolo-Moyale road. They said the road has stimulated growth and enhanced social cohesion and integration. Residents have benefitted from services such as petrol stations, which have been built since construction of the road. They said many young people have also been employed. They said businesspeople have also flooded to the county. The residents have urged small and medium entrepreneurs to start supply of vegetables that are rare in the area. They said despite the road construction easing transportation, it has also contributed to accidents. In July last year, President Uhuru Kenyatta commissioned the Sh42 billion Isiolo-Moyale road, which connects Kenya to Ethiopia. The road was expected to open up the Northern tourism belt to increase activities in Mt Kenya, Samburu, Meru, the Aberdares and Marsabit National parks, as well as the wildlife conservancies.
