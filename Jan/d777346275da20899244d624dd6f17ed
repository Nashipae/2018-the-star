Balambala MP Abdi Shurie has launched a water supply programme for constituents as a drought mitigation measure. The larger Garissa county is experiencing drought which has forced many herders to move to other counties in search of pasture and water. Speaking in Nunow, in Balambala on Wednesday, Shurie said the drought has severely affected more than 80 per cent of residents. “We were hoping that the December short rains would provide some relief,” Shurie said. Most herders from Balambala have crossed over into Isiolo and Meru counties. Shurie said only the vulnerable family members like the elderly, women and children have been left behind to fend for themselves. ”This programme will take care of the women and children left in the villages. We want to support human life as much as we can,” Shurie said. More than 30 water tanks with a capacity of between 5,000 and 10,000 litres were distributed along the Garissa-Modogashe road. The tanks will be supplied by two large water bowsers. The water will also be distributed to the worst affected locations of Nunow, Himbirey, Lago, Saka and Abdi Gab. Shurie said he was working with the National Drought Management Authority, the county government and donors for other relief assistance like food and animal hay. He said there were plans to sink boreholes to provide a permanent solution to the perennial water shortage. Balambala subcounty commissioner Rashid Kwanya said some teachers had not reported to work because of the drought.
