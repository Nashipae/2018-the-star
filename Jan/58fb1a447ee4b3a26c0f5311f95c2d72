The Teachers Service Commission has expunged names of three secondary and two primary school teachers from its register after they secured jobs elsewhere. Speaking to the press in his office yesterday, TSC county director Nimrod Kimathi said TSC has since written and served letters to the tutors. Kisii county KUPPET chairman Osoro Okondo, his KNUT counterpart John Makori and Geoffrey Omwoyo are among those who have been employed by the county government while Evans Manyara and Jared Omari Agora are lecturing at Jaramogi Oginga University of Science and Technology and Kisii University respectively. Manyara was previously teaching at Randani COG, Agora at Bombaba Secondary, Makori at Itierio Mixed Primary, Okondo at Nyagesenda Mixed Secondary and Omwoyo at Nyagoto DEB Primary. “The teachers cease to be employees of TSC because they have since been employed elsewhere,” Kimathi said. He said that unlike previous years, this time no teacher will be allowed to go back to his profession if employed elsewhere. The director said those who affected will be replaced because work must go on.
