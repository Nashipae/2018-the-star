Twenty-seven individuals were arrested on Monday in connection with the murder of a resident last Wednesday in Roba village, Nyandarua county. Maina Njuguna, 35, was killed outside Hilton Bar (pictured) and his mutilated body dragged and dumped along Ol Kalou-Kipipiri road. Maina’s friend, Joseph Njogu, yesterday told the Star the two were drinking at Hilton Bar until late at night, when Maina was chased away by the bar owner, David Njau, and hit with a stone. ”I ran away and left Maina behind. The following morning I got the report he was killed,” Njogu said. Njau and his wife were arrested and locked up at Kipipiri police station. Angry residents raided the business and torched the building, which also housed an M-Pesa shop, a butchery and an Equity agent. Security agents are providing round-the -clock armed security at the building. The arrests took place on Monday as the victim was being buried. A resident who spoke to the Star on the phone from Kipipiri police cells yesterday morning said they were rounded up at 4pm. Some people were picked from their homes and others at the shopping centre. Others were picked on their way from the nearby Laurel flower farm, while others were arrested at the victim’s home, including his younger sister who was later released. Ten workers from the flower farm were released later at night, leaving eight men and nine women in custody. One of those arrested accused Gatondo chief Margaret Karanja of framing them. Contacted for comment, she said, “Ah! I will not talk to you.” No one has been charged in court with the murder or the burning of the building.
