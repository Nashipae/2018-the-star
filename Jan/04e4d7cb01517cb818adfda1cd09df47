A police officer has been arrested for allegedly shooting and killing his girlfriend in Naivasha on Thursday night. It was said Benjamin Lelmen had a scuffle with his girlfriend Beatrice Mutura, 31, before shooting her six times at about 11pm.  The incident took place within the police housing estate at the Kongoni station, where Lemen was based. A police report seen by The Star on Friday says neighbours heard gunshots and found the officer next to the body with his AK 47 rifle when they went to check. Lelmen was disarmed immediately and the weapon later taken to the station where it was stored in its armoury for presentation in court.  The scene was photographed and the body taken to the Naivasha sub-county hospital mortuary. Naivasha sub-county assistant commissioner Joseph Opondo said the suspect was transferred to Naivasha police station. “The cause of the shooting is not yet clear but initial investigations indicate the victim was shot six times with an AK47 rifle,” he said. The incident came about a fortnight after a junior police officer killed the deputy OCS of Makueni police station and injured two others.
