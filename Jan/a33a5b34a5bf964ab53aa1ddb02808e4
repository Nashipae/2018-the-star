Irregular hiring of county staff has contributed to Kenya’s ballooning wage bill. The Salaries and Remuneration Commission has warned the figure will hit Sh650 billion by the end of this financial year. The Treasury has faulted the 47 county governments for disregarding public finance management regulations limiting the wage bill to 35 per cent of their total revenue. Treasury CS Henry Rotich said the counties have not been complying with the regulation since 2014. He revealed this in the proposed 2018-19 Budget estimates published last Friday. “Some counties are in violation of guidelines issued by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission on job grading, salary structure and compensation of employees, as well as payment of sitting allowances,” Rotich said.

It has remained above the 35 per cent limit since, with last year’s percentage standing at 37. Then SRC chairperson Sarah Serem last month said revenue collection has not risen despite the wage bill shooting to Sh627 billion in the 2015-16 financial year from Sh465 billion in the 2012-13 financial year. Serem’s term ended last month. The increase in the wage bill was 11 per cent. Serem said the wage bill should be lowered to 35 per cent for adequate funds to go to development. Rotich said, “A strong correlation exists between high wage bill and low development expenditure. These salary adjustments, combined with new recruitments, have contributed to the general rise in the county wage bill.”  The EACC has written to 40 governors for violating the law in appointing their Cabinets.
