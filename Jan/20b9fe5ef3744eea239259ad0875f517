Four Jamhuri High School students have been charged with assaulting and injuring two schoolmates. Brian Oswago, Clinton Luvayo, David Kyalo and Moses Otieno were accused of assaulting Sayid Osman and Mohamed Idris. The four allegedly clobbered Osman and Idris on January 23 at the Nairobi City Water offices on Murang’a Road. They denied the charges before chief magistrate Francis Andayi. The prosecution said the four are over 18 years, adding that they have their birth certificates and cannot oppose their release on bond. The students asked for leniency, saying they are candidates in form four. Andayi released the students on a personal bond of Sh20,000 each. He directed the parents to sign a guarantee to ensure the students appear in court for trial. The case will be heard on April 9. Last week, 35 students at the school were injured after some of them protested against alleged discrimination by the administration on the basis Of religion. The matter was reported to principal Fred Awuor, who calmed the students. Trouble started again on January 17, after another Muslim student was allegedly taken off the queue to the dining hall for cutting in front of his schoolmates. “The matter worsened and escalated to the classrooms. The principal came but he was roughed up by our Muslim schoolmate,” one student said. However, Awuor said the problem began when the two students fought outside the school compound. He said the fight spilled over. Several security officers, led by Nairobi police commander Japeth Koome, rushed to the school and contained the situation. Those injured were taken to hospital. Religious leaders, education officials, parents and teachers went to the school to counsel the students.
