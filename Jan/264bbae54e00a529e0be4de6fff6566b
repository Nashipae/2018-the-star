 Garissa county secretary nominee Abdi Muhumed has promised to initiate reforms in the running of the county once he assumes office. Speaking to the Star yesterday, Muhumed said county employees will be accountable under his leadership. Muhumed is among six officials nominated to various positions in the county by Governor Ali Korane last week. He said he will bring cohesion and unity across all the six subcounties to ensure equal sharing of resources. “I want to assure Garissa residents that they will have a true servant in me. I am equal to the task,” Muhumed said. “There will be no ghost workers in the county. All employees will do their work with diligence and accountability.”  Muhumed was a chief officer in the Immigration department before his nomination to become the county secretary. He has previously worked with the ministries of Interior and Devolution. He holds a Master’s degree in international relations from the University of Nairobi. He graduated with a bachelors degree in economics from the same institution.
