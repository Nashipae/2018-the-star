Embu leaders are planning to meet President Uhuru Kenyatta amid concerns following their exclusion from the first batch of Cabinet nominees. Led by Senator Njeru Ndwiga (pictured), MPs John Muchiri (Manyatta), Erick Muchangi (Runyenjes) and Cecily Mbarire (nominated), asked Uhuru not to forget the county in his Cabinet appointments. Speaking in Ruguru/Ngandori ward on Monday, Ndwiga said they were planning to meet Uhuru this week over the matter. Muchiri said they will give Uhuru a list of 15 names of those they have have recommended for appointment as either CS, PS or heads of state corporations. “We want to see him and tell him that we have our people. We shall not dictate to him whom to pick, but we shall plead with him to appoint them,” Muchiri said. He said Uhuru should reward residents’ support by appointing their people to his government. Muchiri said Embu has qualified people who can serve in various capacities. “It’s very dangerous to be out of government. We want a person from the county nominated as a CS,” Muchiri said. “I know the President never forgets us,” Ndwiga said.
