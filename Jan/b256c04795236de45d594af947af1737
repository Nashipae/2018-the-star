AFC Leopards fans will have the opportunity to support the club and save at the same time following the formation of a Sacco. The move, according to former Ingwe secretary general, Maurice Osundwa, is aimed at alleviating the club and fans from financial bondage. Osundwa said the Sacco will provide the opportunity to save for their future for both current and old AFC Leopards players, as well as fans while at the same time enjoying other benefits like loans and group medical and last expense cover (to legends) totaling up to Sh200,000. In return, AFC Leopards will also receive 10 percent of the registration money to support the club’s activities. To qualify as a member, one will be required to register with Sh1,000 out of which Sh100 will go directly to the club. Those, who can’t afford to pay the registration in lump-sum, will have the opportunity to pay Sh100 every week. “The aim is to provide a vehicle to financial freedom. The club has been in financial trouble for a long time and we love AFC Leopards. We want to support the team. “As you support the club by going to the stadium, we would like to support and empower you in return,” revealed Osundwa. “We are alive to the fact legends form the first line of supporters and we shall engage with the group as a corporate body. We hope to have an open conversation about the economic empowerment of legends. “We shall offer health insurance and last of expenses to all our legends and senior members among other products.”
