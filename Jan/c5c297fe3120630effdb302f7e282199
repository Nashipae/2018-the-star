Tana River Governor Dhadho
Godhana yesterday dismissed claims of witch-hunt in the ongoing investigations of fictitious tenders by the EACC. He said the probe is meant to unearth underhand dealings suspected to have been engineered by the former regime. The presence of the EACC officials has caused panic among some county government staff. Dhadho said the EACC
detectives did not come to investigate the Sh2.1 billion debt, but were
invited by his government to unearth any irregular contracts that were irregularly
offered. The EACC team led by Coast regional director Simon Cherpka has been interrogating senior county officials. The county government allegedly issued a fictitious contract worth hundreds of millions of shillings for the construction of a perimeter fence for the Kenya Wildlife Services in Garsen in 2016-17. As the interrogation was going on, the
detectives discovered that two Sh78 million projects were paid for, but never implemented in Hurara and Madogo. In Hurara, money had been allocated for weighbridge construction. Funds were also allocated for construction of an ultramodern market in Madogo. Both of them were not
implemented, but money was wired to the bank accounts of the
beneficiaries. Godhana said the probe will ensure no specific individual is unfairly implicated. â€œIf there are grounds that will make
them [the EACC] to stay, we will not stop them. Ours is to ensure the job is done
well," he said. The governor said the Auditor General will also audit the county finances.
