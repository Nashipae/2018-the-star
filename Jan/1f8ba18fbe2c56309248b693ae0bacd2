Education CS Fred Matiang'i has dismissed claims that the implementation of the new curriculum is hanging in the balance. The process, as designed, is on course, the minister maintained on Wednesday after a meeting with the National Steering Committee at KICD in Nairobi. Matiang'i noted the 2-6-3-3-3 curriculum is based on competence and that it followed wide consultation and detailed research. It will see children acquire skills that will make them globally competitive he said, adding they will also be able to nurture their talents. "I have seen reports in the media indicating the new curriculum is hanging in the balance. I categorically say there is nothing like hanging. The plan for the implementation remains as drawn," he told a press briefing. The Cabinet Secretary said the curriculum will be implemented in phases instead of a switch off-switch on affair. "For the last two years the steering committee has been in wide consultations. So far we have already trained 170,000 teachers on materials for grades one and two," he said.
