Red Cross has assisted 39 students who couldn't leave Kisumu on Wednesday due to the night travel ban. The learners could not travel as NTSA banned night bus operations, following several grisly road crashes that left at least 330 people dead in December alone. The buses the students booked were unavailable but the society offered alternatives. "Kisumu team assisting stranded students by providing our vehicles [to take them] safely to schools in Siaya and Busia," the society said on Thursday. The groups were received by their teachers upon arrival this morning.

MOA said only unapproved city operators should be affected, not companies that were vetted and that complied with traffic rules.
