Vera Sidika made headlines the better part of 2017, but a few months
ago, she went missing in action. Well, it seems she's finally ready to
leave the public scene and do her thing. About
a month ago, she revealed that she had her implant removed and she and
her bae are now ready to have kids. For a long time, many speculated
that she was pregnant but she refuted the rumours, proving that she
couldn't be pregnant if she had an implant. Well,
the controversial socialite announced that she wanted to get her teeth
done, and from the look of things, she stuck to her words. She
shared a photo captioned, "Got my temporary teeth done. Can't wait for my final veneer appointment. They look great yet this ain't the final work."
