A 13-year-old boy on Sunday committed suicide in Chumani village Kilifi after his gambling attempt failed to bear fruits. Evans Kadenge, a standard four pupil at Kararacha quarrelled with his uncle aged 15 after he was denied Sh100 he had won in a cards gamble, three days earlier. “We have our detectives on the ground to ascertain what exactly happened. This is too much. We believe there is something more which needs to be unearthed over that death, it is very sad,” Kilifi OCPD Alexander Makau said.  Makau said they have already summoned the other minor to shed more light on what transpired.

His statement will assist with our investigations because we strongly believe he has enough information concerning that death,” Makau said.  “On Sunday evening, the boy became infuriated by this. The two fought but the victim was overpowered and dashed to his house in a huff,” the chief said. Inside the house, the chief said the young boy sent her little sister out to bring some water. “The young sister returned only to find the boy hanging. He had hanged himself using a bed sheet,” Thoya said. The body was taken to Kilifi county hospital mortuary. The incident comes only a month after a nine years old boy also committed suicide after losing a gamble in Mtondia. The late Silas Kazungu, then a class two pupil at Mtondia primary school hanged himself in their bedroom after he failed to contain his anger after the loss. The boy was gambling using cashew nuts, in a game that whoever wins would take all the cashew nuts the other boys had.   Click here for the latest political news
