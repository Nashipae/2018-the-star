Paint maker Crown Paints will absorb more women in its trade to add
to the over 45,000 painters in the country. “Women can adapt very fast to  interior
design work because they are colour sensitive,” chief executive Rakesh Rao said. He added that the construction sector was the hardest hit last year, realizing only seven to eight per cent growth. He said the company will introduce new products in the market, while focusing more on niche markets to improve market share from 60 per cent to 65 per cent in the premium sector. Rao said the company plans to launch a major campaign drive to educate and connect with the painters’ fraternity as a way of establishing a long-term partnership that will improve the market needs and increase demand for its products. “We also intend to offer many new value added services for homes by engaging with customers for research in order to develop products and services that meet and even exceed customer expectations, to grow this segment of our business”, Rao added.
