British Airways has announced a multi-million pound investment aimed at increasing customer satisfaction through expanded catering services. The new catering initiative, which will start on January 17 is focused on broadening the airlines menu to incorporate a four-course meal accompanied with snacks and beverages. “Our customers tell us that when they’re taking a long-haul flight, great food and beverages make a real difference to them,” British Airways’ director of brand and customer experience Carolina Martinoli said. “It’s a huge driver of customer satisfaction so we want to make sure we deliver a great experience.” The new approach which will be changed every six months, will focus on introducing more quality and quantity throughout the flight. Previously customers travelling in the cabin were served a complimentary snack, a three-course-meal or a light meal, depending on the time and length of their flight as well as a complimentary bar service of hot and cold drinks. The airline’s travellers will be served a four-course meal accompanied by a bread roll.
