Kenya’s Stacy Ndiwa and Julien Wanders claimed the titles at the Corrida Pedestre Internationale de Houilles, as the 46th edition of the IAAF Silver Label road race was held in windy and rainy conditions on Sunday. Ndiwa fulfilled her role of favourite in the women’s race as she led the race from start to finish to win in 31:35. Her compatriot Evaline Chirchi, whose only outing this season was a 48:54 performance over 15km in Nijmegen, wasn’t able to sustain the pace and eventually drifted to second. Fifth at the 2015 World Cross Country Championships, Ndiwa confirmed her current form as she improved her PB this autumn in two back-to-back races, clocking 31:37 in Prague and then 31:27 in Ziwa. Chirchir was second in 32:10 as Magdalene Masai, who ran a 31:44 PB in April, rounded out the podium, one minute behind the winner. In the men’s cvategory, Wanders’ victory in this 10km event put an end to 30 years of African dominance in Houilles. He’s the first European runner to prevail in this race in the northwestern suburbs of Paris since Frenchman Paul Arpin’s victory in 1987. “I want to win the race, and the time will follow,” Wanders said. As usual, he set an aggressive pace from the outset and took command of the race with Ethiopia’s Jemal Yimer by his side.
