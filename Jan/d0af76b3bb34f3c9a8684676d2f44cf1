Following complaints from teachers, the ministry of education has said
textbooks for the new curriculum will be distributed from next week
to actualize the pilot program. This comes after complaints from teachers who say that there are
no text books and guide books for teachers in schools leaving them
stranded. The Kenya institute of curriculum development CEO Julus Juan,
however, says materials for the new syllabus will be available from
next week. Acting Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangâ€™i confirms that
challenges are there but the government is working on correcting
them. Speaking during a meeting with education stakeholders at
Strathmore University on Friday, he said that the overhaul of the
Kenyan education system is a gradual process that needs to be
conducted with caution.
