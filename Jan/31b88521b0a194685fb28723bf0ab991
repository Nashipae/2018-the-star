More than 10 Coast MPs opposed to the multibillion-shilling Galana-Kulalu irrigation project want it temporarily stopped and new terms negotiated. They are  pushing the Kilifi government to initiate talks with the national government over a new deal. The national government has announced plans to privatise 20,000 acres of the 1.7 million acres of the project. It is one of Jubilee’s flagship projects to improve food security. Some Sh20 billion has been spent on the project. Kaloleni MP Peter Katana on Wednesday told the Star powerful people are scheming to grab the land. Kilifi Woman Representative Gertrude Mbeyu told the Star on the phone that Kilifi residents will only get more benefits if there are new terms of engagement.
