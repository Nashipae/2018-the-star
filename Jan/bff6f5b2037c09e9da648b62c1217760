Ngumu Tupu activists yesterday accused Kaya elders of being hypocrites after they criticised opposition leader Raila Odinga's installation as one of them. The elders said Raila defiled Mijikenda tradition when he was given the traditional leadership stick and stool. But Hassan Chitembe, chairman of Ngumu Tupu, on Wednesday told the elders to take a political stand. "We have come to know you that you're not true friends. When Raila comes you are in ODM and when President Uhuru Kenyatta comes you switch to Jubilee," he told the Star on the phone.
