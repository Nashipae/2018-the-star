Justice George Odunga says the High Court lacks jurisdiction to hear a case challenging mass transfers of head teachers and principals and directed it be heard by the Labour Court. The case was filed by Knut Mumias branch executive secretary John Wesonga on December 29 last year. He wants the court to quash the transfers by the Teachers’ Service Commission. “Accordingly, I direct the matter be heard by a Labour Court as this court lacks jurisdiction to preside over matters concerning employers and employees,” Odunga said. In the suit filed through lawyer Joshua Magua, Wesonga said the affected principals live with their families and transferring them will greatly undermine their family obligations. He said despite acknowledging the TSC has the mandate to transfer teachers, it should act in a manner that protects the family unit. “The decision by the TSC to effect mass transfers was issued irrationally and arbitrarily without due regard to the laid down principles of transfers,” he argued. Wesonga said the TSC did not seek the input and opinion of school heads before acting. He said the commission did not act independently as the constitutionally mandated employer. Wesonga said Education CS Fred Matiang’i meddled with the transfers and issued the directive to the TSC. He said this is unreasonable and a policy violation. The CS asked the court to dismiss Wesonga’s application.
