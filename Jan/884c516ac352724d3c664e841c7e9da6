St John Ambulance officials in Lari and Limuru were yesterday trained by a petroleum company on how to handle accidents involving fire and petroleum.  The course is aimed at expanding their knowledge on how to handle victims in a fire incident in a residential area, cars and fuel tankers. Vivo Energy trainer Stephen Muchoki said first aiders in areas where the national highway passes handle numerous cases.  Vehicles may explode or fuel may spill.  The company trained the first aiders on how to talk to people to keep them away from accident scenes, how to handle fire and put it out as well as handling victims.  “People keep learning and we aim at ensuring they talk to residents in their areas about accidents. We do not want to hear cases where people are siphoning fuel from a tanker or other vehicles involved in an accident,” he said.  The programme is under the Petroleum Institute of East Africa.
