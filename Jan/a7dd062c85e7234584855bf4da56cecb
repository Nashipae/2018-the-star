Kenya’s squash ace Muqtadir Nimji registered mixed results in Under-19 category at the ongoing British Junior Open tournament at the University of Birmingham. Nimji won his first round game against Ireland’s Stephen Hearst and lost the second to Czech Republic’s Vojtech Ryba. The loss to Ryba consigned him to the Classic Plate competitions. Placed third in Kenya Squash and Rackets Association rankings, Nimji hammered Hearst 3-0 in sets of 11-5, 11-4 and 11-5 in a match that lasted half an hour. In his second tie, the Peponi School final year student then lost 3-0 (11-4, 11-8, 11-6) to the Czech who was capitalized on Nimji’s errors. Nimji’s performances were highlighted by several unprompted fault, which according to him, cost his campaign for the top honours. “My first game went quite well. However, I feel the player wasn’t very strong so I was able to get away with several unforced errors. Things turned against me in the next duel largely because my opponent was much stronger and very consistent than I was. I did play a fair number of errors and because this player was much better, I wasn’t able to get away with it,” said Nimji, who is ranked 327 (U19) by World Squash Federation. “I need to be more patient when playing my game. Trying to finish the rally early here doesn’t work well as it does in Kenya, mainly because all these players are younger, fitter and are able to get some of my winning shots. I have learnt and now looking forward to performing at my best,” he added. The Kenyan now faces England’s Curtis Malik in the Classic Plate category. Malik, ranked sixth by English Squash Federation (U19) and 14th by WSF, begun his campaign with a bye and lost to Pakistani Mansoor Zaman Jnr 3-1 (11-9, 11-6, 7-11, 11-8) in the second round to drop to the Classic Plate competitions.
