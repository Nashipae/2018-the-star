The Mumias police station risks closure in two months due to dilapidation and filth. The subcounty public health officers on Wednesday served the police station with a 60-day closure notice. The station is the police headquarters of Mumias East and Mumias West subcounties. On September 25 last year, the station had been issued with a cleanup notice, but the public health office says little changed. The health office holding cells were unfit for human occupancy, dirty and in need of more ventilation. The old, almost collapsing latrines, were ordered demolished and modern ones set up. The housing units of the junior officers were also red-flagged. The officers live in old iron sheet round houses (uni-huts) that have few windows, the public health office says. The houses have earthen floors.  ACT OR WE SHUT YOU DOWN Mumias Public Health officer Antony Ngaira said the move was necessary because the earlier notice was not acted on. “This is a precautionary move and we are not attacking anyone. What we need is a clean Mumias,” he said. “If after 60 days nothing has been done, we will ask for a court order to have the station declared unfit for human habitation.” Mumias OCS William Oyugi confirmed the first notice and said the station carried out some recommended improvements. He said some of the repairs and construction are still underway and the station has limited resources. Oyugi said they are committed to adhere to the public health requirements. The Health office says it will crack the whip on any institution not adhering to the universal basic sanitation standards. Last year two Mumias schools, Shibale Primary and Shibale Secondary, were closed for two weeks in September due to poor sanitation and fear of a cholera outbreak. Ngaira said the region was on high alert and would shut any facility failing to meet hygiene standards.
