Parents stormed Agwara Secondary School in Bondo sub-county on Wednesday to evict the principal over poor performance and misuse of money. They blocked the gate to bar Stephen Kosewe from accessing the compound, having accused him of running down the institution. Last year, the school enrolled 17 candidates for KCSE examinations and the best scored a D. The protesters attributed the poor performance to the principal's administration style. They also decried poor infrastructure and lack of representation in the board of management. The parents further said enrollment numbers had declined tremendously due to the principal's poor relations with parents and community members. Most of the parents have opted to transfer their children to neighbouring schools including Kapiyo, Got Matar and Usire. Of the poor performance, deputy principal Grace Onyango said: "Last year, we had a population of 76 students, much lower than the 140 the previous year." She attributed the poor performance to a staff shortage, noting the school only had three employees of the Teachers Service Commission. Elisha Omala, Bondo sub-county director of education, said they will allow the principal at the school for a week as investigations continue. Incidents of parents and politicians storming schools have been rampant since 2017 KCPE and KCPE exam results were released. While some cases are related to the exams, others are executed by those opposed to the mass transfer of head teachers that the TSC executed in December last year.
