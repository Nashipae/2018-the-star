The night travel ban imposed on public service vehicles will be lifted in two weeks, Transport PS Paul Maringa has said. The ban has been widely criticised as illogical and unfair by PSV operators, passengers, traders and others. The government yesterday told Parliament the night travel ban will be lifted early next month after it receives comprehensive reports from all stakeholders on adherence to traffic rules. It was imposed on December 31 last year after 36 people died in a night road accident in Migaa.

NTSA director general Francis Meja told the committee that PSV owners must adhere to the regulations for them to be allowed to operate at night. “This is not a lifetime ban. Proper fleet management of all PSVs must be conducted for accountability of drivers to curb road carnage,” he said. Meja said his team has investigated all accidents on the Salgaa stretch that claimed many lives last month. Earlier, the Matatu Owners Association asked the NTSA to reconsider the ban. MOA chairman Simon Kimutai asked the state to review it. Buuri MP Rindikiri Mugambi accused the Traffic Department and the NTSA of failing to work together. “The NTSA is in conflict with the Traffic Department, yet the two are supposed to cure the same problem. I don’t see the essence of having the NTSA. The two institutions should be merged,” he said. Click here for the latest political news
