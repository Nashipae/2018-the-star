Gender CS Sicily Kariuki (pictured) has urged women lawmakers to ensure national and county governments allocate sufficient resources for maternal and child health care. Kariuki addressed the 12th Kenya Women’s Parliamentary Association Parliament Induction at a hotel in Naivasha over the weekend. Read: Parliament’s mischief on two-thirds gender rule  The workshop brought together all women legislators. They elected Kirinyaga Woman Representative Wangui Ngirichi as their new chair. The CS partly blame women leaders for failing to implement the two-third gender rule. “In the last Parliament, when the not-more-than-two-thirds Bill was tabled in the Senate, a good number of women legislators were not present,” Kariuki said. She said the issue of women’s fair representation has been used over and over to fight women’s affirmative action seats in the National Assembly and Senate. “It’s the little things that trip you up like deadlines. If you miss a bill filing, it could be a whole year before you can try again. So attend to the housekeeping chores,” Kariuki said. She said the new lawmakers occupy a pivotal position to give new impetus to the two-thirds gender rule, which is yet to be attained. “The quest for increased numbers of women’s in leadership is just. You can leave a legacy by ensuring our country attains and upholds the not-more-than -two-thirds gender rule,” the Cabinet Secretary said. Click here for latest political news
