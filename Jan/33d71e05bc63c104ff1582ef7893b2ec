Five leaders from Mt Kenya on Sunday could not seem to speak in one voice regarding the 2022 succession. Kirinyaga Deputy Governor Peter Ndambiri said Deputy President William Ruto should take over from President Uhuru Kenyatta as the two have worked together in harmony. Nyeri politician Wachira Keen said Nyeri people must ensure that they are not left behind in the succession as the county will need to be in the next government. Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu said it is too early to speak about 2022 and leaders should first deliver services to the voters. The leaders spoke at a church service in Nyeri. Kirinyaga politician Mureithi Kang’ara also seemed to support Ruto. “Let Wambugu know that 2022 is time for payback. Whether he likes it or not, it will be time to give Ruto a chance since he helped the President to win the seat twice,” he told Wambugu. Ngunjiri said if leaders continue to debate about succession, some will start fighting, which will affect the services. He said Uhuru deserves to be given a chance to serve Kenyans and secure his legacy.
