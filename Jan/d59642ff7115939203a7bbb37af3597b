Vision 2030 Delivery Secretariat
has began stakeholder discussions on innovative and successful ways that Kenya can
adopt to develop structured and sustainable cities. “To achieve structured urbanization
that boosts our economy and the realization of Vision 2030 we need to support
the new cities,” director general Julius
Muia said in a statement. The forum aims at addressing
issues of climate change mainstreaming and providing a guide towards an action
plan for the secretariat and stakeholders to take the agenda forward. According to a World Bank Report, Kenya Urbanization Review 2016, Kenya’s level of urbanization is below par with 27
per cent of urbanites and the annual rate of increase in urbanization rated at
