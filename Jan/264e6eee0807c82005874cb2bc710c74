Nondescripts have been docked 10 points for allegedly fielding ineligible players in the 2017-18 Kenya Cup campaign. Kenya Rugby Union insist Nondies’ latest acquisitions of Fidel Oloo, Levy Ochieng (Kabras Sugar) and Blak Blad trio of Moses Begi, Mark Ongayo and Franz Obudo were not done in accordance with the rules.
The five have played all of Nondies matches this term including wins over Strathmore Leos and Mombasa Sports Club and losses to Homeboyz, Impala and Blak Blad.
The development has seen Nondies drop from sixth to 10th on the standings behind Mwamba, Nakuru, Blak Blad and Strathmore. Nondies are expected to appeal the decision with team manager, Kevin Were, terming the decision by KRU unjustified.
“We are going to appeal. We find the move unreasonable. We are confident the move will be rescinded since we signed the players in good time and in accordance with the rules,” said Were. Nondies face Resolution Kisii RFC on Saturday.
Elsewhere, South Coast Pirates climbed to ninth in the KRU championship after beating Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology 10-0 over the weekend.
Kevin Amiani scored the only try in the win over JKUAT with Hajj Mohamed bagging a drop goal and a conversion to seal the win. JKUAT drops to 12th as University of Eldoret sinks into the relegation zone after a 26-0 defeat to Menengai Oilers. It was also a bad day in the office for Moi University, who lost 19-8 to Egerton Wasps.
