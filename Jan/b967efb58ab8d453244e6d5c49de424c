Lupita Nyong'o wanted to watch Black Panther on opening weekend but she was too late to the party. Advanced tickets for movie went on sale last week and quickly sold out. Lupita took to her Twitter account to express her utter delight and exasperation that she couldn’t buy tickets to the movie in which she stars as Nakia, a badass Wakandan warrior who moonlights as a super spy. Black Panther hit the theatres on February 16. Meanwhile, Walt Disney Korea announced that Chadwick Boseman, Michael B Jordan and Lupita will visit the country alongside director Ryan Coogler. Boseman plays the titular character, otherwise known as T’Challa and is the king of the fictional African country of Wakanda, while Jordan takes on the role of his nemesis, Kilmonger. Expectations among Korean fans for “Black Panther” are heightened, as several key scenes were shot in Busan.
