German opera singer Doreen Ziegler and the British soprano Emma Withill take us on a hilarious journey through the world of music and opera in their comedic opera show ‘Rent-A-Diva’. In the show, the cheeky diva Doreen dreams of a glamorous lifestyle as the greatest opera singer in the world. But there is an obstacle: Rival Emma appears on stage determined to reach the same heights. Question is, How to market oneself as an opera diva? Why not "renting" a diva? These and more thoughts run through the minds of our divas during the play, and it's a joy to follow their cheeky mindset. We follow the budding divas through marvellous arias from operas, operettas and musicals in their quest to find the perfect agent that will take them right up to the top.
