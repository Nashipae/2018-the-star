Thirteen students cheated death on Wednesday after the matatu they were travelling in crashed in Kabarnet town, Baringo county. Area OCPD Eliud Njeru said the vehicle was speeding before the driver lost control and hit the boundary wall of the New Pentecostal Church building. He said 11 students from Ossen Girl's and two from Moi high school Kabartonjo were on board during the 4pm incident. "There were no deaths although one student and the driver were rushed to Baringo referral hospital in Kabarnet town with critical injuries." Kiprotich Chesimet, the hospital's medical officer, said they were stable. "We will retain the student for her to undergo a dental surgery while the driver will undergo a CT scan on the head." Witnesses said the conductor was the one driving the vehicle before a bottle stuck under the brake pedal, a situation that made it difficult for him to control the car. Baringo education chief officer Joseph Waiyaro urged school managers to consider assigning school buses to drop and pick students when schools close and reopen. "It is unfortunate that our children have to squeeze themselves into congested matatus as they rush to their respective schools," Waiyaro said.
