Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has refuted claims he is poised to take a Cabinet position, saying residents are his priority. Speaking after being elected chair of Senate's ICT Committee on Tuesday, Gideon noted his duty is to serve his constituents. "I have not been offered one and if I was offered any, I would not take it. I have a role - to serve the people of Baringo," he said. Gideon, who is eying the presidential seat come 2022, noted he is committed to Baringo residents and will remain dedicated to them for the next five years. "I have a commitment and if God will give me time, I will serve them with all my dedication. I am like you ... I have no role," he said. The question on everyone's lips is whether the Senator and Kanu chairman will enter the Cabinet ahead of his presidential bid. Gideon has mulled joining the Cabinet or nominating his allies to Uhuru's administration as he strategises on the race to State House. It is understood that at least two Cabinet slots have been designated for him and his Kanu party. Sources said one of his likely nominees is director general of the Kenya School of Government, Dr Ludeki Chweya.

Gideon said they will need familiarisation to run the team. "Change is not bad. ICT is dynamic yet people undermine the wonders it works. I will take the role with the commitment and energy it deserves," he said. He added: "We will fast-track audits on technologies that are being used and check why infrastructure has not reached some places." Click here for the latest political stories
