Businessmen and women at Tangakona market  have threatened to boycott paying tax to Busia county government starting today.
Traders’ leaders Moses Wanyonyi and Christiano Mbuya said the market is dirty. “There is only one operational toilet in this market. It has not been washed for months now since people who were cleaning it boycotted citing nonpayment by the county,” Mbuya said.
 He added,”The market itself is also filthy. There is litter all over, posing a health hazard. We cannot be paying tax to the county and clean the market ourselves.” They also cited lack of clean water, small space and lack of sheds and stalls. “There is a borehole at the market but it is ever locked. It was drilled to help us but it is useless. The market space is so small, we are forced to squeeze and it’s so uncomfortable. The market should be expanded and developed.”
The traders say they have raised the complaints with the relevant departments in the county but no action has been taken. “We are only left with one option, to boycott paying tax until the issues raised are addressed,” Wanyonyi said.
The traders urged Governor Sospeter Ojaamong (pictured) , Nambale MP John Bunyasi and Nambale Township MCA Mwajuma Toloi to address the issues. The market, one of the biggest open air markets in Busia county, serves Teso South subcounty, Matayos and Nambale.
It lies at the border of the three subcounties, though located in Nambale.
