Murang’a farmers will be included in an online networking platform. They will get instant solutions on farming problems to their mobile phones. We Farm platform allows farmers to ask questions through text messages and get fast replies. The platform speeds the flow of information from experts to individual farmers who are members. Jamila Abass, the country co-coordinator for We Farm, yesterday said the platform compensates for the low number of extension officers.  Abass said the platform has incorporated extension officers and other experts. Speaking during a training forum at Kenol town in Maragua, Abass said one extension officer serves more than 600 farmers, which she said compromises the quality of agricultural produce. “The platform encourages a free flow of information from experts to farmers and consequently improves farming methods,” she said.  Farmers are required to register in the platform to access information. The text messages are free. Farmers are clustered into groups depending on their farming activities , including livestock keeping, fish farming, poultry and horticulture. Once a farmer sends a message through the platform, it is automatically sent to all other members of the platform who are involved in the same farming practice.
