The IEBC has declined to clear a Kenyatta
University don Nzuki Mwinzi to contest at the March 26 Kitui West parliamentary
seat by-election. Returning officer James Mbai
at the weekend cleared five other candidates to faceoff for the seat left vacant after the death Francis Nyenze on December 6 last year. “We declined to clear him because he had
not formerly resigned his teaching job at the Kenyatta University,” he told the Star on the phone yesterday. Among those the IEBC gave a nod to
participate in the March 26 by-election are Edith Vethi
of Wiper and Robert Mutiso of Narc Kenya. The others are Fridah Nyiva of the Kenya National Congress, Elijah Kilonzi of Muungano Party and
independent candidate Dennis Mulwa. Mbai has cautioned the candidates to adhere to the Election Code of Conduct. He said the politicians are expected to observe
campaign timelines and steer clear of violence. “They all committed themselves to
adhere to the campaign schedules. The Code of Conduct, which they have
subscribed to, is binding until the ultimate winner goes to Parliament and is
sworn in,” he said. Mbai said he told the politicians that in the event one of them is caught violating the rules,
he or she will lose candidature.
