Gangsters killed a watchman at a garage in Kerugoya town on Wednesday night. They stole a lorry's battery and bumper after murdering the 60-year-old, said Kirinyaga Central OCPD Yawa Chome. Chome said victim David Githiomo was hit on the head with a blunt object and that police were informed at about 5.30am on Thursday. He said investigations will reveal more details about the attack. A witness who did not want to be named said he heard cries after a pick-up was driven into the garage at about 11 pm. "Three people alighted from the car. They wore masks," the witness said at the scene. The murder took place metres from the house where a 16-year-old student was murdered in November last year. Residents asked police to intensify patrols so crime rates decline. Chome's body was taken to the mortuary at  Kerugoya Level 4 Hospital. Click here for the latest political news
