Police are escorting students heading to Buna and Eldas subcounties to keep them safe from clan clashes. Renewed clashes between Ajuran and Degodia cland erupted last week over the border, and have claimed seven lives.  Among those killed are a chief, and a police reservist. The Star has learnt the situation is dangerous for students, and security officials are not taking chances.  Many students are yet to report back to school. They lack transport. Buses that plied the route are not operating because of a ban on night travel. “The situation is not good. We cannot risk peoples’ lives. Attackers may direct their anger at innocent children. That is why we asked police for security,” a parent said, requesting anonymity. Last week, Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi urged the two warring communities from Wajir North and Eldas to cease hostilities. “We need peace in Wajir. We will not tolerate people who create conflict, Abdi said during a peace meeting in Wajir town attended by leaders from the two subcounties. He asked the government and religious leaders to do more to ensure peace prevails. “I condemn the recurring clashes. The root cause has not been addressed. Let everyone take it upon themselves to preach peaceful co-existence. We need to live in harmony,” the governor said. Abdi said his administration would work with the national government to ensure sanity is restored. The meeting called for urgent deployment and, or increasing security at hotspots and in buffer zones. They agreed that hostilities between the communities should end through engagement of the elders.  It was resolved that peace meetings be expanded to incorporate all the political, religious and opinion leaders to find lasting solutions.  They also agreed to form a 25-member peace team of elders from the antagonising sides.
