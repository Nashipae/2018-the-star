Tension is building in Migori county as lobbying intensifies for the speaker and deputy speaker posts. Last Friday, the High Court ordered a repeated election following chaos during the first exercise. Battle lines have been drawn as hopefuls scramble to win over the 56 MCAs who will vote. North Kadem MCA Boaz Okoth and advocate Kerario Marwa are seeking the seat. Judge Hillary Chemitei ordered elections within 14 days. The judgment set aside Okoth and his deputy and North Kanyamkago counterpart George Omamba’s election on August 31 after Marwa filed a petition. “I am more than ready for the election, which will confirm my victory was stolen. My campaign base will be in my office in Migori town. I will have a 24-hour campaign,” Marwa told the Star on the phone yesterday. ODM life member Marwa said he is an ODM life member and resident of Migori county. He comes from the minority Kuria community. “My rivals have claimed I am a Jubilee point man in Migori. I welcome them to come to my office and pick copies of my life membership in ODM,” Marwa said. He said during the first election, he was headed for a win, but youths allied to Okoth invaded the assembly and beat MCAs, making some scamper for safety and an” impromptu election decision” was made. “I am comfortable with a repeat and will respect and comply with the court order. I am sure of winning and won’t appeal,” Marwa said. Jubilee point man Majority leader and Oruba-Ragana MCA Mallan Ogega and Majority chief whip and South Kanyamkago MCA Graham Kagali said they will not allow a Jubilee point man to take over the assembly. Okoth said he is an ODM candidate and will ensure the party wins the seat. The election divided the county on tribal lines with the minority Kuria citing discrimination after missing the governor, Woman Representative and Senate seats.
