Kisumu East MP Shakeel Shabbir has said he might go back to court to stop the relocation of the Kachok Dumpsite to the Kajulu area. Last week, the county government gave the green light to relocate the dumpsite after a petition to stop the relocation was withdrawn. Shabbir told the Star on Monday other options should also be considered. He said the petition did not collapse, but rather one petitioner withdrew it after allegedly being bribed. “There is no shortage of people in Kajulu to lodge another petition to challenge the relocation. We can always move back,” Shabbir said. He said he will not entertain dumping in Kajulu. Shabbir said he is not against the relocation, but his main concern is how it is going to be done. Health hazard Kajulu residents are opposed to the relocation, saying it is a health hazard. This prompted two residents to file a petition which led to the temporary stop of the relocation. They said the proposed relocation to the abandoned quarry was less than 200m from the River Kibos and there is a risk of seepage of toxic substances from the dumpsite to the river. Many locals depend on the water for domestic use. The petitioners also said the relocation was shrouded in secrecy and there was no consultation with residents. Decade-old The decade-old project has not taken off due to disagreements on the relocation. Two areas previously identified for the relocation were rejected by residents because of the health risk. A 50-acre parcel acquired for the purpose was abandoned in Muhoroni, after residents, project financiers and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority rejected it.
