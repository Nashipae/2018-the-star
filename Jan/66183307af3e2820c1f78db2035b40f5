The intrigues going on around the elected
chairmen of four committees of Parliament are cause for deep concern. Yesterday, Deputy President
William Ruto summoned the four rebel MPs to State House this morning. The apparent coercion of MPs for acting against the party's preference raises grave issues about the independence of the Legislature and the latitude elected members have to perform their electoral mandate. The roles of parties in Parliament are well enunciated in Standing Orders. They are little more than nominating members to committees, after which they are functionally free to perform their work of representation and oversight. Parties — not limited to Jubilee — must resist the temptation to emasculate MPs as it ultimately undermines the independence of Parliament and the Separation of Powers. MPs have to strike a balance between blind loyalty to their sponsoring parties and serving the electorate. It is ok for a party to whip its members for a particular cause. But it is something else to brow-beat MPs to toe the whims of the leadership. That's a short route to  abhorrent single-party authoritarianism. Summoning MPs to State House is both intimidating and a crude attempt to micromanage the affairs of Parliament. Moreover, it is sub-judice as there is already a court order on the matter in which State House is seeking to intervene.
