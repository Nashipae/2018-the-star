Chief Justice David Maraga has warned people against blanket accusations of corruption in the Judiciary. Maraga said people should stop blaming judges and magistrates whenever they lose cases. He said magistrates and judges have recently been accused of receiving bribes to give favourable decisions. Maraga said it was wrong to label the entire Judiciary as corrupt, when only a few staff have been involved in corruption scandals “Issues of integrity have been there but the number is so small compared to those who are clean," Maraga said. Maraga urged people who have genuine complains of corruption against any judge or magistrate to present their grievances to the judiciary service commission. “If you have evidence against one of our officers stand up and be counted. Give us the evidence and we will take a step, “he said. Maraga noted that JSC will deal accordingly with any of its officer who is found culpable of corruption thus tainting the judiciary name. Recently, magistrates and judges have been accused of receiving bribe to pre-determine and favor cases. In 2017, the CJ kicked out 11 magistrates accused of professional misconduct with allegations varying from corruption to reporting to work drunk. The nature of complaints against the magistrates included absenteeism, issuing rulings calculated to defeat the course of justice, sitting on a case already concluded and releasing a suspect on bond, receiving irregular allowances and delayed rulings and judgments.
