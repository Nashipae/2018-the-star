The Opposition will reject the Cabinet nominees because President Uhuru Kenyatta violated the Constitution in their naming. Minority whip Chris Wamalwa yesterday said the list failed to the two-thirds gender principle and did not not include youths and people with disabilities. Addressing mourners at a funeral in Matunda, Wamalwa asked Uhuru to re-look the list. The Kiminini MP also called for the scrapping of the newly created position of Chief Administrative Secretary. He said Uhuru had violated the Constitution by sneaking back assistant ministers under the new title.

The President should re-look at his list before sending it to Parliament for vetting, otherwise we will reject the nominees,” Wamalwa said. Uhuru has already nominated former MPs Ababu Namwamba, Rachael Shebesh, Ken Obura and Gideon Mung’aro as CAS for Foreign Affairs, Public Service, East Africa Community and Lands respectively. He also nominated former Tana River Governor Hussein Dado as CAS for Devolution. Others are Winnie Guchu (Water), Chris Obure (Transport), Nelson Gaichuhie (National Treasury), Simon Kachapin (Education), Patrick Ntutu (Interior), Andrew Tuimon (Agriculture), Rashid Aman (Health), and Abdul Bahari (Labour). Wamalwa said the new position will put more strain on the country’s wage bill. Click here for the latest political news
