The news seemed to have a rubbed Zari the wrong way, and she expressed her frustration towards Diamond by asking whether their matrimonial home had become a brothel. According to reports from the Tanzanian newspaper Mwananchi, Diamond was not too pleased to be questioned by Zari about his cassava and which crevices it had been in. So according to reports in the paper, he proceeded to use his fists to discipline his wife. The penalty for her insolence was being slapped by Chibu, if the Tanzanian paper is to be believed. Clearly, all may not be well at their Madale home, even if we are to take the latest scandal with a pinch of salt. This allegation does not seem to have affected Diamond or Zari much, as their social media profiles were bland: Diamond was in Rwanda promoting his nut products, while Zari was relaxing in her kimono.
