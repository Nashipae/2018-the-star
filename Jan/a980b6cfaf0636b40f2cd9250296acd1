A Royal Media Services journalist on Thursday night was slapped and detained for more than eight hours by police in Malindi under unclear circumstances. Zomolo Wanje of Radio Citizen had gone to inquire about the arrest of his younger brother who was nabbed by the security personnel at 1am. He was released after intervention by fellow journalists who learnt of the problem on Friday morning. Wanje said he received a call from his brother that police had arrested him outside the gate of the Malindi police station. “I went straight to the station to inquire from the officers what had happened. An officer opened the gate. Other police officers called me as I went to the report office,” he said. He said one officer asked him why he was at the station at that time. Before he could answer, Wanje said the officer slapped him and told him to go to the report office. The officer who slapped him followed him and locked him in the cells and booked him in the occurrence book. He said the officer took his phone and switched it off, then released his brother. Efforts to get a comment from the police boss were unsuccessful as his phone was switched off.
