Residents of North Imenti and Central Imenti constituencies in Meru have asked the county government to quickly construct a bridge across Giaki Kathita river for their easy movement. The bridge collapsed a month ago, leaving residents of the two constituencies cut-off. Boda Boda operators are forced to use an alternative route that which they say is long and expensive. "It is very difficult especially during emergencies. Some women have been forced to give birth on their way to hospital," a resident told the Star. The Star has established that some Boda Bodas ferry their passenger before handing them over to their colleagues on the other side of the river. The passengers are forced to cross the river on a risky and rickety wooden bridge. "We know the national government and county have funds set aside for such disasters and emergencies. We urge them to help us," Boda Boda Peter Mutwiri said. Another resident called for the deployment of Kenya Defence Forces troops to rebuild the bridge. He said the collapse of the bridge had slowed down business activities in the two areas. It is suspected that the bridge collapsed due to overloading of lorries ferrying sand and other building materials. "The bridge collapsed at night when no one was crossing," resident Peter Karani said. He said lorries will be banned from using the new bridge unless the contractor builds it to support the lorries tonnage.
