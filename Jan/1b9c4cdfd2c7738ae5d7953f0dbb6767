Police are investigating an incident where unknown gunmen fired shots and reportedly hurled a grenade at Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka's Karen home on Tuesday night. Nairobi DCI commander Ireri Kamwende together with senior police officers from Bomb Detection Unit are at the home to investigate the incident. No injuries were reported during the 2am incident. The former Vice President was at home at the time of the incident. Police say the attackers arrived at the home in a private car and drove past the main gate after realizing there were private guards on duty. "They hurled a grenade and shot at the compound before driving off," an officer said. This came day after the NASA co-principal's security detail was withdrawn ahead of Raila Odinga 'swearing in' at Uhuru Park. Kalonzo skipped the event.
