The officer accused of renting guns to criminals has surrendered to police after close to a week in hiding. He presented himself to officers of the Special Crimes Prevention Unit at Kenyatta on Thursday afternoon, in the company of his lawyer. The senior sergeant attached to Kiambu police station was taken to Nairobi area DCI offices for grilling. The policeman went missing last Friday, hours after two suspected gangsters were shot dead in Industrial area and a police gun recovered. Evidence of collusion between police and criminal gangs emerged after guns from the Kiambu station were found in his house. Five pistols kept in a safe, intended to be exhibits in criminal prosecutions, appeared to have been handed to police officers on duty. Such guns are normally under lock and key and are not given to police. Two pistols and 95 bullets were recovered from the house and office of the senior sergeant.
