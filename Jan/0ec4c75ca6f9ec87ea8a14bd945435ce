Martha Mwende, 22, was assaulted by her boyfriend in 2013 at her Kiluilu home - Kitui township. She lost her arms and sustained deep injuries on her head and back leaving her hospitalised for months at PCEA Kikuyu Hospital. Her family was left with a huge hospital bill cleared through the support of well-wishers and her local church. The form three student at Yumbisye Secondary School, a top-performing institution in Kitui township, consequently dropped out of school. Efforts to find support to enable her purchase prosthetic limbs have remained fruitless five years later. PCEA Kikuyu Hospital costed the artificial arms at Sh10 million, which remains a tall order for her family. Nonetheless, she enrolled at Joytown Secondary School in Thika town - a special school - to proceed with her secondary education. “I had to repeat my second form to get acquainted to the system,” she said yesterday. She, however, said life has been difficult because of lack of school fees. Her mother Mary Joseph, a single mother of three, said she has sold what she had to keep her daughter in school. “I want my daughter to finish her education,” she said.
