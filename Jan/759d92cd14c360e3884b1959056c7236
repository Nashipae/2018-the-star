Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi yesterday dashed to the Court of
Appeal to challenge last Friday High Court's decision nullifying his August 8
victory. He filed a notice of appeal at the court registry
at the Milimani law courts through lawyer Tom Macharia. “I'm dissatisfied
with the entire decision to nullify my well-deserved win and I intend to pursue
this matter until justice is served,” Abdi said. While the governor termed last week’s nullification controversial, his lawyer said he
will file documents today. Abdi of Jubilee Party became the first governor to lose his
seat, following a successful petition. Former Governor Ahmed
Abdullahi of NASA had challenged Abdi's win. On Friday, Justice Alfred Mabeya ruled that Abdi was not validly
elected, because he did not have a valid degree certificate.
