A popular songstress
set to wed her director/producer boyfriend secretly. This comes after the
boyfriend publicly denied her pregnancy. It turns out the couple has been
dating secretly. They kept it hush-hush
because the director was publicly embarrassed when his ex-wife cheated on him
with a well-known Nairobi gigolo. The proud director was left with egg on his
face when a video of his ex-wife kissing the playboy hit the interwebs. A source
close to the couple whispered to us, “Late last year, the couple had plans to
go visit the singer’s parents to ask for her hand in marriage. They are keeping
this on the down low and want everything to progress well before they can
announce anything.” The singer
is yet to publicly announce that she is expecting her first child. For the
music director, this will be the third child with three different women.
