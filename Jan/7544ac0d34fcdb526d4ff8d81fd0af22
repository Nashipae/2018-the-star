Kenya Railways has dismissed reports appearing in a section of media that passengers traveling on the Madaraka Express must book their tickets 30 days in advance. Speaking to the Star on phone, Kenya Railways managing director Atanas Maina clarified that the advance booking window is what has been extended from 14 to up to 30 days in order to streamline services to meet the growing travel demands while improving customer experience. ''Passengers can book and travel on any day depending on availability of space on the Madaraka Express, there is no restriction. The extension of advance booking window will therefore help them plan and book space one month in advance. Group bookings will now be done 32 days to the travel date and not 16 days as has been,'' said Maina. He said Kenya Railways is committed to identifying and instituting measures that will meet the demands of the ever increasing customer base on the service. Madraka Express which started its operations in June last year has ferried at least 660,106 passengers, reaching its peak during recent Christmas festivities when the train was fully booked for a month. The change come into effect on Monday.
