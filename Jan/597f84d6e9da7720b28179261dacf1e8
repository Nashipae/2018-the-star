The state plans to allocate Sh2 billion as a contingency measure for infrastructure development in both primary and secondary schools to cope with the increased admissions. The funds will be set aside in the supplementary budget and will be part of the governmentâ€™s agenda to offer quality service. These will include development of new classes, laboratories, dormitories, purchase of desks and repair of buildings. Overall, the total funds dedicated for infrastructure development to schools is Sh8 billion for the financial year 2017-18. In primary school, the funds will also be used to develop infrastructure used during the implementation of the new curriculum.
