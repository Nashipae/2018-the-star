An organisation in Kiambu county will train youth on how to use their talent to make money. Amo La Moda Kenya is targeting 1,600 youth across the county to train in beauty, fashion, modelling and film production. The programme, to cost Sh100 million a year, is expected to start in March. Organisation patron Gladys Chania on Monday said the money will be provided by partners and funding agencies. The youth will also be trained on farming. They will get seed capital at the end of the programme. Speaking at her office in Thika town, Chania said Amo La Moda Kenya aims to tap talent across the county. Youth will generate income through their talent, ending unemployment. “We have seen many stars rise from humble beginnings and use their talent to excel. Our youth lack someone to hold their hand and show them the way. Amo La Moda Kenya will see many of our talented youth supported financially,” Chania said. The organisation has been training youth on beauty, fashion and modeling since 2014. It will partner with the Film Village of Kenya to train Kiambu youth on film production. “We are reaching out to organisations in the music industry like Music-On Sweden that will fund the training of our youth,” she said.
