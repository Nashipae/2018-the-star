Boda boda riders yesterday said they will comply with the latest order banning them from the CBD, but they want convenient alternative picking and dropping points. The ban was issued yesterday morning. Speaking to the Star, chairman of the boda boda operators’ association Ken Onyango said they accept the ban. “We are ready to comply, but they should give us a designated place to operate,” Onyango said. He said the county should consult boda boda operators to solve problems of congestion and general disorder in the CBD. Senior City Hall Inspector Peter Mbaya yesterday told the Star, “It has been hard to ban boda bodas because some were unregistered.” Some boda bodas are rogues and won’t obey any traffic rules or warnings by city officers, Mbaya said. Some have been used as getaway vehicles during crimes. He said boda bodas can operate around Ngara, the Globe Cinema, Uhuru Park and OTC but not within the CBD.
