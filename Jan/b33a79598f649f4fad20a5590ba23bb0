The resignation of Deputy Governor Polycap Igathe has sent Nairobi into confusion. On Friday last week, Igathe resigned stating he had failed to earn Governor Mike Sonko’s trust. Residents do not know what will happen to the his resignation, since it has only been five months since the two took office. “Tough decision. Sad for Nairobi. My hopes were pegged on your presence at City Hall but ... do what feels right for you and your family, and gives you peace,” resident Esther Ssweranga said via Twitter. Resident Martin Karanja said he thought the city was in good hands courtesy of Igathe’s integrity and diligence. “Sonko and Igathe have been fooling us. How can he fail to get his boss’ trust and they campaigned together? I am disappointed,” resident Elijah Ouko said. Some believe Sonko cannot deliver even half of his manifesto without Igathe. The Constitution of Kenya does not indicate what a county can do when the Deputy Governor’s seat falls vacant.
