Sofapaka are determined to hit the ground running in the new Kenyan Premier League season that kicks of in exactly two weeks as they look to improve on their second-place finish last term. Batoto Ba Mungu have lined up two top drawer friendly matches — against Ugandan champions KCCA and Sudanese giants Al Hilal ­— as part of their pre-season activity. KCCA, who are in the country to face Kenyan champions Gor Mahia in a friendly match today, will afterwards take on Sofapaka at Narok Stadium on January 26, head coach Sam Ssimbwa has confirmed. Ssimbwa, a former KCCA coach is confident his charges will gain from the friendly match. And having finished second to Gor Mahia last season, Ssimbwa observed that the game is part of a pre-season regime aimed at ensuring the team goes to the 2018 campaign in top form. “KCCA is a strong team and they have a big profile in the region. To play them in pre-season is an important part of our preparations and from it, alongside other plans we have in the coming few days, I hope we can head to the new season very fit,” he said on the club’s official portal. On January 31, the 2009 KPL champions will take on the Sudanese side at the Narok County Stadium, another game Ssimbwa hopes his charges will gain massively from. “Al Hilal is among the big teams in the continent and with new players in my team, what better way can we get to help them gel ahead of the season than taking on the big teams around? We will definitely gain a lot from this game. We are really working hard in training and after this clash, I believe we will be ready for the new season,” he added. Sofapaka open their 2018 campaign against Bandari on February 4.
