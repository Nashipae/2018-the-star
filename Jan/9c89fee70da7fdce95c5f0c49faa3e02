Kiambu residents without KCPE and KCSE certificates will have a chance to sit the exams.
Woman representative Gathoni Wamuchomba yesterday said those willing to have KCPE certificates can go back to standard five. Those who were unable to continue with secondary education can join Form Two.
She said she is working with the Education ministry to see the Transformative Education Programme become a success.all expenses paid
Students in the TEP will not pay fees or be in the same classroom as regular students.
“We are sponsoring everything, including paying teachers’ salaries,” Wamuchomba said. The lessons will run from 5pm to 8pm since the target group is middle-aged and older people.
“This programme should not be misunderstood for adult education. We want people who didn’t sit KCPE and KCSE exam to have a chance to get the certificates,” she said.
Wamuchomba said the programme will also help girls who get pregnant and drop out of school or poor children whose parents could not afford fees.
