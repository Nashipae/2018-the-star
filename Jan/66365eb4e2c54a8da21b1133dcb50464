NASA leader Raila Odinga will on Sunday start a series of countrywide rallies as he builds momentum for his parallel ‘presidential’ oath. The opposition has lined up at least seven rallies this month — spread mainly in its strongholds — where the NASA principals will address supporters on the coalition’s way forward.  The Star has established the opposition team will be educating local leaders on the concept of People’s Assembly in the morning of the consultative tours.

The first forum was held in Kikambala, Kilifi on December 17. People’s Assembly organising committee member Oduor Ong’wen yesterday said the technical committee will conduct civic education on the concept of the Assembly, which he said is widely misconceived. The technical team is headed by economist David Ndii. “Many people do not understand what People’s Assembly is all about. Some even think it is to replace county assemblies,” Ong’wen said on the phone. NASA principals sit through the sessions and watch as residents ventilate on their local issues and come up with resolutions.
