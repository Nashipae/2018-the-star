A Homa Bay magistrate has disqualified herself from a case in which Suna East MP Junet Mohamed is charged with hate speech. “I disqualify myself from the case due to personal reasons,” principal magistrate Susan Ndegwa said. Junet is accused of perpetrating hate speech against Nyeri residents based on their ethnicity. He committed the offence during an ODM rally in Homa Bay town on July 2, last year. Junet is charged with uttering words that were intended to incite feelings of contempt, hatred and discrimination. He is out on bail of Sh100,000. “I ask the court to give a way forward on how this case will be handled,” Nyauke said. Ndegwa scheduled the case for mentioning on January 26 when it will be reallocated to another magistrate.
