Online retailer Jumia has announced plans to more than triple its sales agents in 2018, creating 20,000 new jobs. Under its sales consultancy programme dubbed J-Force Jumia plans to empower individuals to become entrepreneurs by selling the firms products to customers and earning a commission in the process. Since the online retailer’s inception in 2013, the company has recruited 6,000 agents under the J-Force programme meaning the move will increase the firm’s workforce by about 333 per cent. All individuals, regardless of their background or educational achievements, can sign up to the program online and receive free sales and digital training from the Jumia team. The sales agents earn a commission ranging from 3-10 per cent and can be paid up to Sh1 million depending on number of sales made per month. Speaking during an award ceremony for outstanding J-Force sales agents, J-Force Manager Clarice Odando said there is need to empower youth and enrich entrepreneurs across the country. “The J-Force program is of great significance to the country as it creates employment, helps us educate customers in how to shop online, and contributes a significant share of Jumia’s sales,” he said.
