Kajiado Governor Joseph Lenku has accused the Kenya Wildlife Service of fuelling human-wildlife conflict. Lenku (pictured) said KWS continues to harass herders around national parks and has refused to compensate farmers maimed by wild animals. Kajiado KWS warden Dickson Korir did not respond to queries. “Some 37 people have been killed in the past one year, while many more have been maimed by these animals that stray onto people’s farms. KWS has turned a deaf ear to the affected families,” he said on Saturday. He was speaking in Mombasa after the Kajiado Leadership Conference. He was reacting after several herders were detained and their livestock seized by KWS rangers for trespassing on Chulu Hills and Amboseli parks. Lenku accused rangers late last year of banning herders from grazing their livestock in the parks. He said residents have continued to host zebras and other herbivorous animals on their farms without complaining, but KWS has failed to reciprocate. On Saturday, Maasai morans in Imbuko killed two elephants that strayed onto their farms.
