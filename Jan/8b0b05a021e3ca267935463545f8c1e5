Nakumatt goalkeeping coach, former Kenya international, Mathew Ottamax Owino has left the supermarket chain side for AFC Leopards in the same capacity.
Nakumatt are suffering uncertainty at the moment with an unconfirmed reports indicating that the club may be up for sale as their main sponsor, Nakumatt, struggles to stay afloat.
Ottamax, who has also held the same position at Gor Mahia, said on the KPL official portal he was looking forward to working at the popular club.
“I have signed a contract with AFC Leopards for two years and I feel very happy. To me it feels like coming back home. It is also the beginning of a new journey and I feel very motivated and ready to go,” he said.
The former Harambee Stars goalkeeper joined Nakumatt in January last year after a fallout with the then Gor Mahia coach Marcelo Ferreira.
At Nakumatt, he helped tune former KCB and Gor Mahia custodian Sammy Okinda and Charles Ouma as first choice and reserve goalkeepers respectively.
Okinda has left Nakumatt for his former club, KCB who will be featuring in the National Super League for a third successive year after missing out on promotion last season.
Others who have left Nakumatt are defender Kennedy Onyango (Posta Rangers) and Kepha Aswani (Sofapaka). Ottamax’s decision to quit Nakumatt is believed to be influenced by the financial difficulties currently facing the club’s parent company. He, however, cited Ingwe’s ambition as key to his decision to join the den.
“This year, the club has set very high targets because of the good players they have been recruited. I hope to offer some good contribution towards achieving those goals. We will be defending the GOtv Shield and also fighting for the league title,” he said. Ottamax replaces Erick Wasike an experienced bench headed by coach Robert Matano and Gilbert Selebwa, the team manager.
