The High Court will on February 1 decide whether to allow the Law Society of Kenya to continue participating in a case where David Muchiri is accused of murdering a KRA lawyer. Justice James Wakiaga of the Milimani High Court yesterday set the date after hearing an application by Muchiri where he wants the LSK barred from participating in the case as an interested party. Muchiri’s lawyer John Khaminwa told Wakiaga that LSK should not be allowed in the case because it is not a victim. The LSK has assigned lawyer Stephen Ongaro to participate in the case on its behalf. Ongaro opposed Muchiri’s application, saying the LSK has rights to participate in the case because it is a matter of public interest.
