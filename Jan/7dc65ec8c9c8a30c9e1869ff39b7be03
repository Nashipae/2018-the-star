Mandera Governor Ali Roba is yet to constitute his cabinet, more than a month after the county assembly rejected his initial nominees. Speaking to the Star on the phone on Tuesday, assembly speaker Mohamed Khalif said they were still waiting for the governor to present a fresh list of nominees for vetting. The committee on Appointments rejected the nomination of Izzudin Abdullahi, Mohamed Ali, Suleikha Harun, Mohamed Adan, Ahmed Sheikh, Abdiaziz Sheikh, Johara Mohamed, Aden Hussein, Shamsa Mohamed and Ibrahim Barrow as county executives. There was a fracas in the house during the tabling of the report in November as MCAs allied to Roba ganged up in an attempt to defeat the report. They shouted down their colleagues before the report was eventually tabled and its recommendations adopted. Mohamed said the assembly had given Roba until December 7, 2017 to submit the names of new nominees. The County Government Act limits the functions of outgoing executives to 21 days after the swearing-in of MCAs. That means the county is operating without a cabinet. The law however, allows the appointment and approval of new nominees beyond the transition period. After his nominees were rejected, Roba asked the Public Service Board to halt the recruitment of chief officers. MCAs are currently on recess until mid-February. Mohamed said the assembly will embark on legislative work when it resumes sittings. The house went into recess amid divisions caused by the rejection of cabinet nominees. Mohamed said he will steer the house to ensure MCAs carry out their mandate without chaos. “I’m optimistic that members will behave themselves. We have had several meetings with them since the ugly incident during the debate on nominees. We all agreed to work without letting emotions get the better of us,” Mohamed said.
