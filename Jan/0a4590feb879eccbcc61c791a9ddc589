The ongoing extension of the SGR has been temporarily called off following protests by workers in Naivasha. The Chinese contractor was forced to call off work after a strike by workers in Mai Mahiu area of Naivasha entered the second day. The over 800 workers said they will not resume duties until their grievances, which include a rise in salary, are fully addressed. The strike came barely two weeks after two workers were crushed to death while working in a section of the railway line from Nairobi to Olkaria. In the latest strike, the workers accused the contractor of subjecting them to poor and inhumane working conditions, which led to the death of the duo. Worker Peter Kuria said staff at the Satellite site get lower wages compared to their colleagues.  Click here for the latest political news
