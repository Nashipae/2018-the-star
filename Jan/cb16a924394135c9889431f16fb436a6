One more person died with ameobiasis symptoms on Thursday, bringing the number of deaths to three in a span of two days. Mainda Mathina, 95, died on Tuesday afternoon. His son Mugambi Kirigo and wife are admitted in Isiolo with abdominal pains, vomiting and diarrhoea symptoms. There is public outcry over the integrity and accountability of the Meru Public Health department after a disease outbreak and slow intervention measures taken to contain it. Kaibung’a Mithiori and Angelina Maitei, 63, died at the Meru Teaching and Referral Hospital while under treatment. Ann Gacheri, 31, said despite losing her mother, Angelina, her husband Benson Kaberia was taken to hospital yesterday. She said her sister-in-law is also admitted at Muthara Subdistrict Hospital. Acting Public Health chief officer Kanana Kimonye said measures have been set up to prevent spread of the symptoms.
