Two students from Homa Bay who passed their 2017 KCPE exam may fail to join their respective national schools for lack of fees. They are Isaac Asuga,14, and Kevin Otieno,13. Asuga scored 419 marks and is to join Starehe Boys Centre. He said his dream is to become an engineer. Asuga sat his KCPE examination under difficult conditions at Dr Owen Preparatory School in Homa Bay town. He lives with his mother on the Sofia Estate, an informal settlement. His father died of kidney failure in December last year. “I don’t have any source of money to pursue my higher education since my father died,” Asuga said. Speaking to journalists in Homa Bay town on Friday, Asuga’s mother Sarah Ogechi, who is a housewife, appealed for assistance. She called on well-wishers to help her son.  Otieno, who scored 413 marks, said he wants to be a surgeon. He is to join Maseno High School after sitting his KCPE exam at St Paul Education Centre in Homa Bay town. Otieno lives with his mother, Jacqueline Adoyo, a security guard. Otieno’s father died five years ago. “The money I get as a security guard is not enough,” Adoyo said.
