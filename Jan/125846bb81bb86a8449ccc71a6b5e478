Curtains have fallen on “Lunch Time” hitmaker Gabriel Omollo. He died at Busia Referral Hospital on Wedneday at 9pm. He was 80. He was among the few surviving veteran musicians of the 1960s and 70s. Many Kenyans, however, did not notice his accomplishments. He performed at the Mashujaa Day celebrations in 2010. He was also given a head of state commendation.  In an earlier interview he recalled with nostalgia how the hit song “Lunch Time” sold more than 250,000 copies. This earned him a Golden Disc Award from Phonograph Company - a renowned Dutch music firm. He composed the song while working as a laborer at Industrial Area in Nairobi. It talks about what how workers take porridge and githeri (a mixture of maize and beans) on credit but at end month, they are able to go to eateries and eat nyama choma Before his death, has been living on meagre loyalties. In 2016 he announced his desire to make a comeback and being out of the limelight. He promised to release eight new songs by 2017. But that was never to be.  He lacked money. A friend, who had promised to finance the production, pulled out at the last minute. In an interview with the Star, he said he had composed songs to entertain his old fans.  Omollo practiced with colleagues Charles Awita and John Jassor. They refused to divulge the names and details of the new compositions for fear they may be pirated. Omollo said the songs had educative messages, unlike the songs sang by some upcoming musicians which lacked moral values. He urged the government not to discriminate against musicians while recognising heroes. He said musicians played a key role in educating the nation. He was disappointed that politicians from Central Nyanza failed to sponsor talented musicians. “If our politicians could support the music industry, then musicians like myself should not be left struggling,” Omollo said.
