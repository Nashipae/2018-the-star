 Form One students, the first batch under the Free Day Secondary Education (FDSE) programme, are set to report to various schools starting Tuesday. Basic Education PS Belio Kipsang in a press statement said the government has already sent out Sh29.5 billion for the programme. The government is looking forward to achieving a 100 per cent transition from Primary to Secondary school level through the free education programme. Kipsang said the government has released another Sh7.5 billion for printing and supply of six core textbooks. "The funds disbursed to schools will cover all the tuition and other operations as per guidelines for each student enrolled in secondary schools irrespective of whether they are enrolled in sub-county, county, extra-county or national schools," he said. He said schools with boarding facilities, National Schools and Extra-County schools in the urban centres of Nairobi, Nakuru, Mombasa, Kisumu and Eldoret, will charge Sh53,554, while all the other boarding schools expected to charge Sh40,435. "The Ministry of Education advises children from needy and vulnerable families to seek financial assistance for the boarding component from alternative Government and Private interventions that include Constituency Development Fund, County Government bursary funds, Equity Bank Foundation, Jomo Kenyatta Foundation, Kenya Commercial Bank Foundation and Cooperative Bank, among other charities," he said. Kipsang maintained with assistance from all these interventions, the Ministry wishes to advise all Form One students to be ready to report to the schools they have been selected to by Tuesday.
