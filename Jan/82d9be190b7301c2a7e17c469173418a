Former President Moi’s factory risks closing as residents cite oppression.  The more than 16,000 tea farmers from Kuresoi South in Nakuru county supply raw tea leaves to Kiptagich factory. It is owned by the Moi family.  The farmers got Sh6.80 bonus while KTDA, located barely two kilometres away, payed Sh34 per kilo. The farmers want Baringo Senator Gideon Moi to pay them or risk losing their support in his 2022 presidential bid. The hundreds of residents met at the Kiptagich chief’s office. They called upon MP Joseph Tonui and four MCAs to deliberate on the problem and find a lasting solution. Farmer Edna Bii said they get fertiliser at Sh3,600, while KTDA offers its farmers the same product at Sh1,900.Joseph Mutai said the problems include lack of payslips, nepotism and ethnicity.
