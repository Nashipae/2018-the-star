Former Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma (pictured) will today appeal the High Court ruling that upheld Governor Anyang Nyong’o’s win in last year’s election. Ranguma’s petition against Nyong’o was dismissed last week. His lawyer Richard Onsongo said they will file a notice of appeal at the appellate court in Kisumu. Onsongo said they did not agree with the decision of justice David Majanja. He said Ranguma will engage another lawyer to handle the appeal. Majanja dismissed the petition citing the former governor’s failure to prove his case. The judge said Nyong’o could not be called upon to answer a case whose basis had not been pleaded or proved to the extent required. Majanja said the allegations by the petitioner were vague and embarrassing. Ranguma’s case was founded on lack of impartiality on the part of the IEBC, improper voting, failure of operational transparency and tabulation of results. Ranguma insisted that electoral malpractices were committed during the voting and transmission of results.
