Transporters in Kiambu have protested against the ban on transportation of charcoal by the Kitui county government. Juja Transporters Sacco chairman David Macharia yesterday said the county government did not give notice prior to the ban. Addressing the press in Juja on Monday, the 51 members said 15 trucks transporting charcoal from the county were impounded the day the ban was effected. They are yet to be released or charged in court two weeks later. “We have all licences and permits to transport charcoal. We had paid cess and charcoal fees to the county government and we have the receipts. They hadn’t notified us of the ban and still took our money,” Macharia said. The chairman said they have been barred from moving through Kitui county while hauling charcoal from other counties including Wajir, Tana River and Garissa.
