There has been speculation as to whether Wangechi and producer Kevin
Provoke are still working together. The highly acclaimed rapper took to
Instagram to share her thoughts on her successful musical journey. Wangechi said she has had an epic journey of self-discovery. Since she started, the rapper has had monumental milestones, including working with Ne-Yo on Coke Studio Africa, appearing on CNN, and dropping some of the top Kenyan hit singles in the last five years. "Five  years later and here I am, finally deciding to take my life and music
into my own hands. To create because I love it and not because it’s what
the crowd wants to hear," she said. Asked whether she is still working with Provoke, the man who discovered her, she said: "No, I am not; I'm going solo."
