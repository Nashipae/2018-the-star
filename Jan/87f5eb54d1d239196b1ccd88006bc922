Five aeroplanes were grounded at the JKIA in Nairobi on Thursday for violating cargo transport rules. Transport CS James Macharia (pictured) yesterday said they were involved in illegal operations at the airport. He did not specify the airlines in his address at the airport during the signing of a service charter for six ministries. “I am happy to announce that two airlines operating illegal activities have been grounded. Whoever else is engaged in such activities should be warned that action will be taken without delay and mercy.” This comes a day after the CS said a team of investigators had been deployed to probe claims some aircraft operators at Wilson and Jomo Kenyatta International airports violate cargo carriage rules. He made the decision following an exclusive  report by The Star that exposed illegal practices with the potential to ruin Kenya Airways’ expected direct flights to the US. The International Civil Aviation Organisation is planning an audit in Kenya in July amid concerns the country may fail and be blacklisted like Uganda. The ICAO banned all planes registered in Uganda for safety reasons. Kenya could face the same problem if the current situation is not corrected. Any blacklisting will automatically affect Kenya’s planned launch of direct flights to the US.
