The self-proclaimed King of Bling, Jackson Makini alias Prezzo, finally reunited with his seven-year-old daughter Zahrie during the festive season after a long time. Prezzo, who left Nairobi Diaries to concentrate on his music career, in a recent interview with Kalekye Mumo said of his relationship with his estranged ex: "Marriage life was good because I got a beautiful baby girl out of that. But Daisy loved Jackson Ngechu Makini but hated Prezzo but I couldn’t let go of the brand since I took so long to build it."  Well, the father of one, who seemed to be enjoying every bit of the holiday cheer, spent time with his daughter and shared photos of him and the little girl, leaving many awed. "OMG your daughter is so adorable and so grown," a  social media user commented on Prezzo's post.
