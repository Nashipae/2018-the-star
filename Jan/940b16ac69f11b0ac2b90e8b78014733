Kenya Rugby Union officials and Kenya Rugby Referee Society are headed for a collision course over match allocation. “KRU will take up referee match allocation responsibilities for all the leagues. This is as per league manuals that gives this power to the league organizer. With this regard, KRU will be reaching out directly to accredited referees in the country for the management of the matches,” read a letter sent to clubs by KRU CEO Ronald Bukusi. The referees are under referee society. They officiate Kenya Cup Championship, Eric Shirley Shield and the Nationwide league. KRU statement comes in the wake of a go slow over the weekend with claims from the referees society that they KRU) have outstanding arrears from last season totalling Sh6 million. The Kenya Cup matches involving Impala vs Kisii and Mwamba vs Mombasa had no assistant referees. Sources familiar with the story indicate that the referees have only paid been once since the start of the 2017-2018. They were given Sh230,000 on the first weekend, which is inadequate to cater for transport, accommodation and match allowances. The tussle could jeopardise the weekend matches with the highlight pitting the Ngong Road derby between Quins and Impala at the RFUEA ground. The news comes hot on the heels of the uncertainty surrounding Kenya Sevens participation in the World Sevens Series. The team was due to be announced yesterday but the occasion was shelved. The Sydney and Hamilton legs of the World Series are slated for January 26-28 and February 3-4 respectively. Kenya are 11th on the log with 11 points from two tournaments played.
