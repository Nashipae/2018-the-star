The World Bank yesterday launched a project to support Embu farmers to accelerate production and increase income, economic growth and job creation. It will carry out the National Agricultural Rural Inclusive Growth Project together with the national and Embu governments. Nineteen other counties will take part in the project. The World Bank will provide $200 million (Sh20.5 billion), while the Kenyan government will give the remaining $19 million (Sh1.9 billion). World Bank lead agriculture economist Ladisy Chengula said the money will be moved from the national government to the county government. The county will then give it in the form of grants to the communities to implement micro-projects of their choice.
