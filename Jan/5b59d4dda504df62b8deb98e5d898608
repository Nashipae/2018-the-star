The High Court has ordered a recount of votes in the Lang’ata parliamentary petition against MP Nixon Korir. In an application by Oscar Omoke, who is challenging the MP’s victory, justice Lucy Njuguna ordered the recount in six poling stations to establish the valid and spoiled votes. “Votes will be recounted at  two poling stations in Kongoni, two poling stations at KPA, one poling station at MoW and one poling station at KOWI,” the judge said.

The petitioner said the election of Korir as the Member  of Parliament for Lang’ata constituency was characterised by irregularities and malpractices. The petitioner said the election was not administered in an impartial, neutral, efficient, accurate and accountable manner. Omoke claimed the results declared by the IEBC and the returning officer lacked verifiability. The recount is set to be done on January 29 at the  IEBC warehouse in Industrial Area. Njuguna directed that the case be mentioned on January 24 before the deputy registrar of the High Court for parties to agree on modalities on how to conduct the recount.
