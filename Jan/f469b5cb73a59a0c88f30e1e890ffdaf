Zesco United midfielder and Kenyan International Anthony Akumu believes his Zambian outfit will dethrone reigning Caf Champions League Wydad Casablanca in the 2018 edition. Akumu guided his side to the 2016 champions league semi-finals for the first time everand the holding midfielder believes the experienced gained and the quality additions made in the playing unit has spiced their quest to land their first continental title. The former Gor Mahia midfielder was optimistic of Zesco’s success in returning and landing the champions league which has been missing in the club’s cabinet since its formation in 1974. “This year, we hope to be crowned the new champions considering the vast experience we have gained in the continental league. We missed out in last year’s edition after finishing second in our home league in 2016 and I am happy we will be returning to the league and hopefully capture it from Wydad Casablanca. Akumu further tipped more Kenyans to join the Zambian league and any other league in the world courtesy of their hard work and self believe. “I have seen amazing talents from players who ply their trade in the domestic leagues and from their abilities, I can say they are capable of playing in the Zambian league. Initially, we had David ‘Calabar’ Owino before joined him alongside Jesse Were. Mark Makwatta and Cliffton Miheso later joined the fray. Opportunities are scarce but with time, they can make it to the any league provided they keep on training and growing professionally.” Akumu joined Gor Mahia in 2010 and left in 2014 to join Sudan-based Al Khartoum for a year. He then joined Zesco United in December 2015 and has been inspirational to the Ndola-based side in reclaiming the Zambian league from Zanaco.
