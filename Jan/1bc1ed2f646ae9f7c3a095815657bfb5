Lamu Governor Fahim Twaha has asked the court to reject an application by his rival Issa Timamy for a recount of votes in a petition against his win. Twaha said the exercise would be waste of public resources and time. He spoke on Wednesday when he testified before Lady Justice Dorah Chepkwony who is hearing the petition.

"Scrutiny and recount of votes can only be requested at the polling station, nothing wrong happened, the agents were satisfied during the elections, it’s a waste of public time and money," Twaha said during cross-examination by Timamy's lawyer Duncan Odera. Odera, together with Yusuf Abubakar acting for Timamy, had asked Twaha to allow for scrutiny and recount of the votes if he was confident of his victory. Governor Timamy was represented by Lawyer Maurice Kilonzo. Twaha was declared the winner with 22,969 votes against Timamy's 22,848, a margin of only 552 votes. The deputy governor opposed the call for scrutiny and recount. Aboud, who is a former IEBC constituency returning officer for Lamu, admitted that he worked with Lamu East returning officer for five years before his resignation last year to join politics. The Deputy Governor, however, dismissed claims that he influenced his former colleagues at IEBC to forge for Twaha's victory during the August 8 elections. The petitioner claimed the election was not administered in an impartial and neutral manner. He has also alleged the Lamu East returning officer used form 36 B to declare results instead of Form 37 B as required by the law.
