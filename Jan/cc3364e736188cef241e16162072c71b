Three independent experts appointed by the UN have expressed concern about recent reports indigenous Sengwer people in Western Kenya have been attacked and forcibly evicted from their homes. The experts are John Knox, a special rapporteur on human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment; Michel Forst, a special rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, a special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous people. In a joint statement yesterday, the three urged the government to ensure the human rights of the Sengwer people are respected even as the Water Towers Protection and Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation project, an EU-funded water management project, is implemented. “The Sengwer are facing repeated attacks and forced evictions by agents of the Kenya Forest Service, which is an implementing agency in the project financed by the European Union,” the three said. On December 25, more than 100 armed Forest Service guards entered the traditional land of the Sengwer in the Embobut Forest, fired gunshots, burnt 15 homes and killed livestock. Last Tuesday, one of the Sengwer leaders was shot at by Forest Service guards. While he managed to escape unhurt, his house was burnt down and his property destroyed. The experts called on Kenya and the EU to ensure the human rights of the Sengwer people are respected. “We are concerned the project is being undertaken without a human rights impact assessment,” they said.The group said there was no consultation with the Sengwer.
