Operations at City Hall yesterday were
disrupted for more than two hours
after Safaricom disconnected internet
services over a Sh3.2 million debt. Residents seeking services were
stranded as most systems have been
automated. ICT executive Charles
Kerich said internet was disconnected
at 9am and restored at 11am after the
county engaged Safaricom. “We talked to Safaricom to give us
until January 31 to clear the bill,” he
said on the phone. The county pays for
the service quarterly. There were long queues at the county headquarters.
Everyone seeking to make payments,
process statements and applying for certificates, such as food handlers, or
business permits were affected. SERVICES AVAILABLE The county has automated 92 revenue
streams, but residents are required
to physically visit the offices for hard
copy receipts. JamboPay, the company contracted
to automate collection, said residents
could still make payments using their
phones, despite the disruption. “All services are available online at
epayments.nairobi.go.ke,” chief executive Danson Muchemi said. Acting
secretary Leboo Moritant said the disconnection did not ground operations
as it did not last long. Payments for single business permits, rates, parking, education, inoculation and garbage collection fees are
among the revenue streams that have
been automated. REVENUE STREAMS Food handlers’ certi cates, tax inspections, court fines, court awards, adverts
on poles, building materials, licences,
exchequer releases and hoarding fees
are also in the new system. Others are survey fees, Waithaka
Technical Centre, laboratory fees, Dagoretti training fees, building occupation certificates, conveyance fees and
ambulance fees.
