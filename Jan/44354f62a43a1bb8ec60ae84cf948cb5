North Imenti MP Rahim Dawood has urged principals in day secondary schools in the area to have a standard price for buying food. This will help tame a tendency of some school heads to inflate prices, he said. Dawood spoke on Monday at Runogone chief’s camp during a public participation forum for CDF projects. He urged principals to comply with the government regulations and to desist from charging parents tuition fees. “Parents are required to meet the costs for the feeding program as the national government has paid the tuition fees for the students starting from this term,” he said. “The government added tuition fees from Sh12,000 to Sh22,000, so no parent should be charged,” he added. Dawood said schools should not also overcharge parents for food. “I think day schools in my constituency should sit down and harmonise what they are going to charge for food,” he said. Dawood promised to improve infrastructure in the day schools and primary school. Meru deputy speaker Elias Murega  supported the MP, saying schools should charge the same fees as they get commodities from the same market.
