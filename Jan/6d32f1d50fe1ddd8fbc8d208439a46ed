The Garissa county government has started demolishing structures along Ring Road following the expiry of a two-week notice. The demolition which has been ongoing yesterday met stiff resistance from residents of Bulla Qubah, who termed the exercise ‘discriminatory and illegal’. The residents said they were shocked to find their structures flattened and burnt down. The demolition had to be suspended after residents threatened to lynch the county askaris. When the press toured the area, tension was still high. The owners of the demolished structures said they would not leave or allow the askaris to destroy their kiosks. Usalama Scheme on Ring Road was initiated by the now-defunct Garissa municipal council. It sought to allow organised planning and surveying of land within the municipality. This followed complains that private developers were curving huge plots. Galbet MCA Abdirizak Ismail said the county assembly and other stakeholders were not involved in the demolition order. “As the area MCA I am not aware of the operation. This is something that should have been brought to the assembly for debate and determination,” he said. “If the government wants to reposes this land then let them involve the stakeholders and owners who have occupied the land for several years.” The rep said it is unfortunate to see the county government surpassing the MCAs’ mandate. The National Land Commission was also left out in the matter, Ismail said. But Lands executive Mohamed Shale said the government has already made plans for the land and that implementation has started. “I am appealing to the residents to cooperate. They need to know that this is a programme that was initiated even before the county government came into place,” he said. Shale denied claims of discrimination in the demolition, saying it was transparent and meant to bring sanity in the adjudication of land in the county.
