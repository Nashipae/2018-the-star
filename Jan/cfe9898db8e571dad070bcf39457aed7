The annual VIPI Awards, now in their fourth year, which use talent to preach peace, integration, cohesion and integrity, have unveiled Lenga Hongo campaign. “Every journey starts with a step, and on this day we want everyone not to bribe or take a bribe,” said Cynthia Kerubo, the awards communication director. “Before the awards gala night in April, we shall conduct four such activations [to] inculcate the culture in Kenya slowly.”  Cynthia also requests everyone to take a picture of anyone found taking or receiving a bribe on this day and post it on social media with the hashtag #LengaHongoJanuary12.  “Corruption is the cause of all our troubles and everyone must take the responsibility by not receiving or giving bribes. Kenyans cannot access good services because someone is interested in bending the law to take or give a bribe. As a result, many have suffered and others died,” she said.  For the last four years, VIPI has agitated for a more cohesive and corruption-free Kenya where individuals abhor tribalism and fight corruption in all its manifestations.  It is composed of a group of passionate and focused individuals looking at making a positive difference in the lives of Kenyans.  “Our aim is to ensure that we have more informed youth who are not easily influenced by relatives and society in general and who subsequently are able to cut a nationalistic profile,” VIPI Patron Charles MÃ»nyui said.  The VIPI Awards winner will be the face of the campaign for the year and will hand over the crown to the person who wins in the next year. The winner will receive a Sh1 million cash award.
