Public prosecutions secretary Dorcas Oduor will take charge at the ODPP before Keriako Tobiko's successor is appointed. Tobiko made this announcement on Thursday following his nomination to the Cabinet by President Uhuru Kenyatta last week. "Oduor will take charge of the office as we await the process of getting a new Director of Public Prosecution," he said. Tobiko expressed confidence in the team he left behind saying the people are qualified. "My exit leaves no vacuum at the ODPP, " he told workers from the headquarters of all 47 counties. The former DPP took pride in the the growth of the office during his tenure. President Uhuru Kenyatta appointed Tobiko, former senator John Munyes and former Marsabit governor Ukur Yattani to the Cabinet. The three were nominated to posts which are yet to be revealed and will be subject to vetting and approval by Parliament.   Read: Uhuru keeps six CSs, nominates Tobiko and Ukur Yatani
