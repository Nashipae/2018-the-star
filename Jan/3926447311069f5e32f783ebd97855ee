An 87-year-old trader was on Tuesday buried under the stump of his beloved cyprus tree at Ngarariga village in Limuru. Funeral committee member Elijah Mbogo said Elijah Karanja planted ithe 30 years ago. “The tree was huge. We cut it down, but the stump remained. Our headache was digging the grave, because of the roots,” Mbogo said. He went on, “We were forced to hire a power saw to cut the roots. Digging the grave took almost four hours.” Mourners eulogised Karanja as hardworking and trustworthy. Former Lari MP David Njuguna said Karanja was always smart. He wore suits and liked driving new cars. “He used to be smart. When he drove to my place of work, whenever he alighted, I would admire his suits. His coat, shirts and shorts were well ironed. I asked him how long it took to prepare the clothes. He replied my people take care of them,” Njuguna said. Businessman John Njeng’wa described Karanja as an honest man. He never insulted anyone and encouraged people to forgive those who offended them. “He set a good example to many people, be they his children, grandchildren, great grandchildren or residents. That is why you see all these people at his funeral,” he said. Karanja was a founder of Ansante Enterprises in Limuru and Nairobi. He was an ardent member of the Holy Akorino Church in Murengeti. Former Limuru MP John Kiragu and Limuru assistant county commissioner Mary Njuguna attended the funeral. Njuguna urged residents to emulate Karanja the lessons. He created jobs for many people.
