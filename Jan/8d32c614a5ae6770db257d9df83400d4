Nyandarua Woman Representative Faith Gitau says she will table a motion in the National Assembly requiring the arrest of those driving PSVs without speed governors. She said the government should ensure the Michuki Rules are applied to the letter. She wants “every driver found driving a vehicle without a speed governor arrested and jailed for one month without an option of fine.” “We shall not allow people to continue dying on our roads due to speeding. We are saying enough is enough!” Gitau spoke on Tuesday at Ngai Ndeithia Secondary School Ndaragwa in Nyandarua during the funeral of nine people who died last week on the Nyeri-Nyahururu road. They included a nine-month-old baby. Five victims are still in hospital. She was with Woman Representatives Wangui Ngirici of Kirinyaga, Rahab Mukami of Nyeri and Cate Waruguru of Laikipia. Mukami said PSV drivers should be compelled to go through training at the National Youth Service, before being licenced so they can learn how to behave on the road. She said the death of the nine is a big blow to Nyandarua. She  thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta for ordering NTSA off the roads. “The [NTSA] officers were contributing to many accidents while chasing vehicles,” Mukami said. Ngirici said bad drivers, not bad roads, are to blame for the increased road accidents. The NTSA said more than 250 people died from road accidents in December last year alone. Ugandan roads, she said, are in the worst condition, “but the accidents that occur in Uganda are not even a quarter of what happens in Kenya”. Ngirici said traffic police should learn to attach more value to human life, not money. Waruguru said she will lobby other legislators to pass a law dictating the number of hours a driver can work without rest.
