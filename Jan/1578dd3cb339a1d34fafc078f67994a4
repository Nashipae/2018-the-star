Six officials of the Kericho assembly were interrogated and recorded statements with the EACC in Nakuru over a fistfight two weeks ago. South Rift EACC deputy director Gilbert Lukhoba said the speaker, clerk, the sergent-at-arms and MCAS recorded statements yesterday. Four MCAs have been summoned to record statements today on claims they engaged in a scuffle. “It’s alleged chaos erupted during deliberations on the allocation of funds to construct an airport in Kericho,” read the statement signed by Lukhoba. MCAs grabbed the mace, and a tug- of war ensued.
