A Limuru court will rule on March 3 whether Apostle James Ng’ang’a (pictured) will stand trial for reckless driving. The ruling was postponed yesterday, as senior principal magistrate Godfrey Oduor is attending a one-week workshop in Meru. Ng’ang’a, who is out on bond, is charged with dangerous driving, giving false information and failing to report an accident on August 21, 2015. He is alleged to have caused an accident while driving a Range Rover Sport, which collided head-on with a Nissan March. Mercy Njeri, who was in the Nissan with her husband, died, while her husband Martin Mbugua was injured. Oduor was transferred from Limuru to Nakuru early last year, but he goes back to listen to the case. “We will come back again next time. We want to know how the case will be ruled, no matter how long it takes. We will not get tired to follow it,” resident Josephine Wambui said.
