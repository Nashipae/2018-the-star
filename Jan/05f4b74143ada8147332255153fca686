Hundreds of youths in West Pokot can now dream of starring in movies as a deal with Tanzanian film stars comes to fruition. Launching the premier of the first movie, called ‘Riziki Yangu’, Tanzanian movie and comedy star Rashid Wamzangwe, alias Kikwendu, said that they struck a great deal. "We have seen the untapped great talent in West Pokot, and that they will make sure that the dreams of the youths are fulfilled," he said. Kikwendu added that the movie industry is well-paying and praised the county government for showing a good gesture to assist the industry. Two Pokot artistes said they are excited about the opportunity and how it will change the face of the county. Ashiono Awendo and Sammy Abuyanza said they want to paint a good picture concerning West Pokot, and rally the youth against bad behaviours like drug abuse and irresponsible sex. They said it is very expensive for the youth to venture into the industry, but they are optimistic that their style of production and engagement with the Tanzanian movie stars will help a lot. Hundreds of residents attended the launch, including county leaders, who were impressed with the work of the first movie in Pokot land. Governor John Lonyangapuo said the county will build a theatre within the town to ensure such events of acting and watching of movies attract foreigners and investors to the region. Lonyangauo, who applauded the youth for the ‘Nyayo Hood’ movies, said the county will also build a recreational centre for the youth.
