A court in Nkubu, Imenti South, Meru has issued an arrest warrant for a gang that raped a 15-year-old girl at Nkubu town in November last year.  The warrant was issued by senior resident magistrate Joan Irura. Imenti South police boss John Cheruiyot said suspect Kenneth Mwandiki, aka Camera Ken, was arrested last week. He is out on Sh30,000 bond. He and another man are said to have committed the offence on November 26. Cheruiyot on Wednesday said Camera Ken’s accomplice is yet to be identified. Ken works with a vernacular TV station. He failed to appear in court, prompting the court to issue the arrest order.  The girl’s parents say the suspect is sending emissaries to their home, seeking an out-of-court settlement.
