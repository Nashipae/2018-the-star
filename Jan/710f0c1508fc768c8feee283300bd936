Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati and Kimilili
MP Didymus Barasa have blamed the rising insecurity on police laxity. The two leaders on Saturday said insecurity is deteriorating each passing day across the nine constituencies. There has been a spate of attacks on businessmen
and their families, especially in Mt Elgon constituency, where a number of people
have been killed and property stolen. They said the number of people who have died from attacks is overwhelming and police are doing little to curb
the situation. They spoke in Matili, Kimilili constituency, during the burial of Celestine
Wanyonyi. Wanyonyi was killed by thugs last week on Saturday. "The national government should ensure citizens are safe and their property secure," Wangamato said. The county chief urged security officers in the area to increase night
patrols. Barasa, who is a member of the Parliamentary Security Committee, said police watch as residents are killed and do nothing to improve the situation. "We want Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to take seriously the letter written to him last week by Committee on Administration and National Security chairman Paul Koinange," he
said. Barasa said the letter demanded Boinnet transfers the Kimilili DCIO, OCPD and some of Bungoma security agents who
have overstayed in the area. He said that if Boinnet fails to do so within seven
days, he will table a motion of no confidence against him in Parliament.
