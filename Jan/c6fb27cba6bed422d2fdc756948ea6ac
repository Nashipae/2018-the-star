The four Bungoma MCAs who ejected Kamusinga's new principal have been charged and released on Sh50,000 bond each. They had been on the run after committing the offence last Wednesday. They stormed the school and ejected principal Alex Maina, saying he was transferred from an under-performing school and would lower standards at Kamusinga High School. The principal was later escorted back to the institution by police. The ward representatives are Luke Opuora (Nominated), Aggrey Mulongo (Kibingei), Stephen Wamalwa (Soy Sambu Mitwa) and Elvis Abuka (Milima). They denied the charges before Kimilili magistrate Christine Menya on Monday. The case will be heard on March 26. Acting Education CS Fred Matiang’i has ordered county commissioners to arrest anyone who attempts to frustrate newly posted school heads. He noted the transfers were in line with ministry guidelines and that the exercise will continue regardless of dissatisfaction by some members of the public and leaders. On Thursday last week, six MCAs were arrested for blocking a new principal from taking over at St Joseph's Girls in Kibwezi.
