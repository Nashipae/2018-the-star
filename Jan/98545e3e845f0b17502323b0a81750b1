Hospitals
in the Rift Valley and other parts of the country are overburdened by the high
number of accident victims, Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital CEO Dr Wilson Aruasa has said.  He said there is need for measures to stop
increasing road carnage.
 Aruasa said the orthopaedic and trauma units are full of people involved in accidents. He said the shocking number of road accidents, especially in the
last one month, indicates there is a serious problem in the transport
sector. “As a hospital, we receive a high number of accident victims and this is
a worrying trend, which we have to deal with urgently," Aruasa said on Saturday He said the NTSA should focus more on curbing boda boda accidents,
which contribute a huge percentage of admissions in most hospitals. Aruasa on said the Authority must start proper training of
riders on traffic
rules. He said more than 70 per cent of accidents also involve long-distance trucks
operating on the highways, especially at night. Aruasa urged Kenyans to be disciplined on the roads. More than 200 people have died in road accidents in the month of December alone.
