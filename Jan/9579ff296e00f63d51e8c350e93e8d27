Farmers have opted to sell their maize to middlemen following delays by the NCPB to pay them Sh3 billion debts for delivery of their produce. Timon Kosgey yesterday said they are selling their crop to traders at a throwaway price in order to pay school fees. Director of Kenya Farmers Association Kipkorir Menjo said farmers should be paid promptly to avoid exploitation. Traders are offering Sh2,200 for a 90kg bag and the NCPB pays Sh3,200. “We have been waiting for the payments since December 5 in vain. We don’t have fees for our children,” Kosgey said. The NCPB said it has bought 1.8 million bags worth Sh5.7 billion. Spokesman Titus Maiyo said they have paid farmers Sh2.6 billion. They are waiting for the National Treasury to release more money. Farmers are owed more than Sh3 billion. Farmers in the Rift Valley are piling pressure on the state to release the money.  MPs from the region led Moiben MP Sila Tiren have demanded that farmers should be paid their cash.  The NCPB boss Newton Terer was expected to meet Agriculture CS Willy Bett and Treasury officials over the cash to stall demonstration threats by some farmers.
