Jua Cali is upset with reports of students of his former school, Jamhuri High, fighting over religion. The rapper condemned the intolerance causing the needless fights and school disruptions. Jua Cali said, "I am appalled by the reported incidents of religious intolerance at Jamhuri. As an alumni of the school, I strongly condemn acts of aggression by students directed at their fellow students on account of religious differences." What began as a small issue between two students — a fight over a cup and a slap — escalated into a full-blown battle between Muslim and Christian students at Jamhuri High School. Jua Cali added, "As a people, our diversity should make us admirable to each other. Religious intolerance should have no space in Jamhuri High School or any other place for that matter. "I am proud to have passed through the hands of Jamhuri and as such, I would like normalcy to resume so the young people can keep moulding their future. We should see each other only as human beings and not for each other's caste, religion, tribe, etc. One God."
