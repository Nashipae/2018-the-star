Chinese workers have demonstrated their incredible efficiency yet again. Around 1,500 workers spent just nine hours paving the railway for a new train station in Fujian Province, southern China. Seven trains and 23 diggers were used to assist the massive project, according to a supervisor. An aerial video released by Pear shows how the construction workers connected three major railroads - the Ganlong Railway, Ganruilong Railway and Zhanglong Railway - with the new Nanlong Railway. They also installed the traffic signals and a series of traffic monitoring equipment. The construction took place at the Nanlong Railway Station in the city of Longyan according Xinhua News Agency. It began on January 19 and finished in the wee hours of January 20, said the report. The project was finished so quickly because the workers had been arranged into seven units to tackle different tasks simultaneously, said Zhan Daosong, a deputy manager at China Tiesiju Civil Engineering Group, the country's main railroad builder. The construction of the Nanlong Railway is ongoing and is expected to complete at the end of 2018. Measuring 246 kilometres (152 miles) in length, the railway is due to be a main transport link between south-east China and central China, Xinhua reported. The railway would be able to support trains which operate at a maximum speed of 200kmh (124 mph), according to reports. Click here for the latest political stories
