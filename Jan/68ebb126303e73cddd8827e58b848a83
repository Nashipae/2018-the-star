The High Court in Eldoret on Friday ordered the state to pay two families Sh4.5 billion compensation for prime land amounting to more than 1,050 acres. Justice Anthony Obwayo awarded the money to the families of Joseph Korir and Kiptot Sitienei, who are both deceased. Obwayo ruled that the land genuinely belongs to the two, hence had to be compensated instead of evicting the more than 200,000 people currently living on it. The land, which lies near the Eldoret Polytechnic along Kisumu road, includes the entire Langas Estate. The case which, has been ongoing for 15 years, had made the World Bank and the Uasin Gishu county government to halt a Sh2 billion slum upgrading project and other development plants eight years ago. The state will also pay for costs of the suit.
