The results of 1,205 candidates in the KCSE examination were yesterday cancelled over cheating. Kenya National Examinations Council chairman Prof George Magoha said thorough, fair and objective investigations found the candidates engaged in exam cheating. He refused to divulge the names of the schools and teachers involved, but said Knec has forwarded recommendations to the Teachers’ Service Commission. The affected students were from nine out of 10 schools whose results had been withheld pending investigations. Magoha said 67 candidates in one of the schools were cleared and will receive their results today. “Candidates whose results have been cancelled have been offered an opportunity to register for the 2018 KCSE examination before the registration deadline ends on February 28, 2018,” Magoha said during a press briefing at Mitihani House, Nairobi. He said the affected candidates are at liberty to appeal. Reports for each of the 10 schools have been dispatched through the respective principals and county directors of education. A total of 611,952 candidates sat last year’s KCSE across 9,701 centres. Candidates whose results were cancelled either entered exam rooms with mobile phones containing examination materials, smuggled written unauthorized information into exam rooms or colluded and copied answers from each other. Eleven candidates were found in possession of mobile phones in one examination centre, nine candidates were found with unauthorised materials while candidates produced identical responses in eight centres. Magoha however confirmed that no KCSE exam paper was leaked before or during the exam period. “There were attempts by some individuals to gain prior access to question papers but all these efforts were nipped in the bud,” he said.
