The government has refuted claims that the dreaded SLDF militia has regrouped and was behind a spate of killings in the region. Western regional coordinator Chimwaga Mwogo on Monday said the current killings were associated with a criminal gang of six. He said police have gathered enough information on the criminals and will be hunted down soon.

He was speaking after a crisis meeting with the county police chiefs in Bungoma. Mwogo said ballistic reports of the cartridges used in killings pointed at two guns being used in all the incidences. The SLDF militia reigned terror among residents between 2005 and 2008 leading to the death of over 1,200 people. They also rendered over 10,000 people homeless. Mwongo said unlike SLDF militia who were agitating for land, this group has been targeting businessmen and farmers after selling their produce. "This is just a criminal gang who only strike people who have made transactions during the day, " he said Mwongo said police had had a rough time arresting the gang because of the poor terrain and communication in Mt. Elgon. "Let them know that their days are numbered, we will hunt in the forests and caves," he said.  Click here for the latest political news
