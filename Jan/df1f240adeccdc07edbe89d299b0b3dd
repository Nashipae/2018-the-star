There was a standoff at Rongo CDF office on Wednesday when rowdy youth stormed in to demand the removal two officials. They claimed receptionists Peter Osodo and Nancy Akinyi supported former Rongo MP Dalmas Otieno.  The group claimed the officials have been sabotaging the office by leaking information to rivals who attack the current leadership on social media. The officials locked themselves up in the office, saying they havenâ€™t been paid since last August. Rongo CDF chairperson Morine Auma denied there was tension, saying the youth overacted, but the transition is going smoothly.
