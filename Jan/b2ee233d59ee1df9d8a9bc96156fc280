Linda Boni Operation director Joseph Kanyiri has accused some health centres of secretly treating al Shabaab terrorists who suffer gunshot wounds. Speaking yesterday, he said some health facilities in Lamu, Witu, Garsen, Ijara, Sanghailu, Msalani and Galmagala are giving medical supplies to the militants. The operation to flush out terrorists is underway in three counties of Lamu, Garissa and Tana River. Kanyiri said this is happening despite pleas by security office for health facilities to report terrorists who seek treatment. He said on November 26 last year, over 20 kilos of cartons full of medical supplies were found floating near the shores in Shella. He said the drugs were being ferried to an al Shabaab hideout and the suspects fled when they realised security officials had spotted them, Kanyiri said. “We are following leads. We’ll unmask the health centres helping terrorists,” he said.
