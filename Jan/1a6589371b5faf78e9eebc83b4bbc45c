Jubilee MCAs have castigated some MPs for frustrating Governor Mike Sonko’s efforts to restore sanity in the CBD and transform the county. Led by Majority leader Abdi Guyo, they said some legislators have been interfering with the governor’s effort to remove hawkers, boda boda riders and street urchins by inciting the public against him. This comes just days after Starehe MP Charles Njagua sued Sonko for banning boda bodas from operating in the CBD. In an attempt to tame runaway insecurity, a gazette notice dated January 22 stated only riders offering courier services would access the CBD. The court declined to grant the orders. Guyo asked MPs to stick to their mandate and allow Sonko do his work.
