Budgetary constraints may hinder Kenya Volleyball Federation’s plans to run age group academies across the country. KVF needs slightly under Sh5m to partner with Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association to fully operationalise the academies in eight schools across Kenya— four for boys and girls apiece. Previously, KVF had stations at Kwanthanze, Cheptil High, Tuiyo Secondary School, AIC Kosirai, Lugulu Girls, Malava Boys, Gathangururu Girls, Hospital Hill and Kabula Boys. But some of the above academies never took off due to local politics and stakeholders sabotage. The federation, whose main event in 2018 is to send senior women’s national team ‘Malkia Strikers’ to Japan for the World Championships later in September, is positive that the government will come to their rescue to fund the academies. “We have forwarded our budget for running the academies which is slightly under Sh5m. We intent to have players in camp for at least 14 days every April, August and December,” said Martin Makokha, KVF first vice president in charge of age group development, adding KVF cannot afford to have centers in all its 15 branches. “The amount is intended to cater for the young boys and girls meals and accommodation during the camps, transporting those who come from far and buy equipment. The amount will also be used to foot the bills of hiring coaches during the training stint,” he noted He said they intend to attach two club coaches to each of the academies and they will be assisted by KVF or CAVB-trained tacticians from the schools and locality.
