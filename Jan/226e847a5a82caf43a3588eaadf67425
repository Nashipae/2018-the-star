A group of business people and lobbies have urged Kisumu county leaders to stop bickering and focus on development. They have given Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o ’s team other feuding leaders one week to end the squabbles, failing which, they will take unspecified action. Led by Kisumu Residents’ Voice Association chairman Audi Ogada, the group said development cannot be achieved when leaders fight. They accused county leaders of engaging in public exchanges instead of focussing on implementing their pledges. Senator Fred Outa and speaker Onyango Oloo have accused Deputy Governor Mathews Owili of scheming to destabilise Nyong’o’s administration. They accused Owili of working with a group of MPs in the county to undermine the governor and his vision. Outa said Nyong’o is ready to work and anybody with ulterior motives will not succeed because he will stand with the governor to fast-track development. Owili denied the claims of sabotage, saying he supports Nyong’o, adding that all is well at the county government. Ogada said, “There are promises the governor made, including the relocation of Kachok Dumpsite and formation of village councils within 100 days in office, but, to date, we can see nothing apart from the squabbles.”  He continued, “We have seen groups being formed against the governor and senator, but we are not interested in this, only service delivery, because, as leaders, they have a mandate to ensure this is achieved.” Women Representative Rosa Buyu said it has been barely four months since the leaders were elected, adding they should concentrate on service delivery and not wrangles over 2022 positions.
