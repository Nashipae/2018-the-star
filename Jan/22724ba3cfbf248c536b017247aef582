Irungu Houghton is now the new boss at Amnesty International Kenya. He officially assumes the executive director’s office today succeeding Justus Nyang’aya, who has led the organisation for eight years and seven months. Nyang’aya moves on to head a regional organisation - Leadership Education for Africa - that deals with accountability.  Irungu is an activist and leading voice in the civil society movement. He is credited for being among the activists who staged dramatic protests in 2015 that led to the recovery of the Lang’ata Road Primary School playground that had been grabbed. The protests gave birth to the Shule Yangu Campaign Alliance aimed at protecting public schools against landgrabs. So far, the campaign has led to 1,000 schools being issued title deeds. “I have been in the justice and human rights field for over 27 years. I started off as a volunteer activist for organisations like Release for Political Prisoners in 1991. I was involved too in the Mothers in Action campaign that kicked off after the rape ordeal of 60 girls at St Kizito, as well coordinator for ethnic clashes network, and the Maila evictions in 1990 to clamour for a new Constitution and the 2017 Redcard campaign ,” Houghton said. He continued, “This is a field that I know well. For the past five years, I have been working on one part of the Constitution which is Chapter six on leadership and integrity. I look forward to working on Chapter 4.”
