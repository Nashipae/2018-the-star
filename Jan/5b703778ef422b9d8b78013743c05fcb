Mukami from Kiru location in Mathioya constituency told the court she contributed to purchase of the family land and construction of their permanent home. That’s when both were working as teachers. Mukami said when Kinyugo married his second wife, he gave the bigger chunk of their land to her, leaving her with a small parcel. “I helped plant the tea he gave her and he left me without any. I had to plant tea afresh on the small land he gave me,” Mukami told the court. Mukami was wheeled into court from Huruma Hospital in Nanyuki. She told senior resident magistrate Dennis Kivuti her marital issues worsened six years ago when her husband stopped visiting her. Mukami said she built many businesses with Kinyugo and she wants a share of them. She said her husband forced her to participate in his traditional wedding to his second wife and to live in the same house with her for a year. Defence counsel Gichuki Waiganjo produced photos of Mukami and her co-wife during her dowry ceremony.
