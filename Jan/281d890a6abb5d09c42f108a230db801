Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has slammed Health CS Cleopa Mailu for “maliciously damaging the county’s image to retain his position”. By claiming Mombasa should be blamed for viral diseases, Joho said Mailu was angling for an executive post. Joho insinuated such an attack would please the government. He said, “Mailu as the CS should play a part in eradicating disease instead of playing politics, pointing fingers and passing the buck.” Joho, a vocal opposition politician, and Jubilee top brass have been at odds. The county denied it is not reporting disease incidents to the Ministry of Health, resulting in disasters. Health executive Hazel Koitaba said the county has consulted the Kenya Medical Research Institute, a government institute, after the chikungunya outbreak. Mailu on Tuesday said delays in communicating can affect the population. “It is not that if it is in Mombasa, it is my problem, let me deal with it...no...the counties should see infectious and transmissible diseases which can affect people as serious problems of public concern,” he said. Joho said Mailu was employing “underhand” lobbying tactics.
