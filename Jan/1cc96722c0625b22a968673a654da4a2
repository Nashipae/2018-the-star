Qatar has filed a complaint to the United Nations about an alleged violation of its airspace in December by an Emirati military aircraft. The United Arab Emirates is one of four Arab countries including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, that have imposed travel, diplomatic and trade sanctions on Qatar, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism. Qatar has denied the charges. A report by state news agency QNA said Qatar's ambassador to the United Nations sent a message to UN secretary general Antonio Guterres and the president of the Security Council regarding the alleged violation. It said this occurred on December 21 at 9.45 am local time and lasted one minute. "H.E. Sheikha Alia (Ahmed bin Saif Al -Than) confirmed that the UAE plane entered the airspace of the State of Qatar without prior knowledge or approval of the competent Qatari authorities," QNA quoted the ambassador as saying. "She considered that the incident was a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the State of Qatar, as well as a flagrant violation of the provisions of international law, conventions, charters and international norms." UAE officials were not immediately available to comment on the Friday report. Click here for the latest political stories
