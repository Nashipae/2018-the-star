"We sent our team this morning, together with four marine police officers and the family members, to Ngoi area where the three are said to have gone fishing." On August 13 last year, Lamu ODM politician Shekue Kahale lost 12 of his family members who included his wife and their four children. They had been reported missing a day before when they did not reach Lamu island from Kizingitini. Their boat had capsized at Manda Bruno area which is known for gigantic waves. The politician survived after hours of swimming. On June 20 last year, 10 people perished when a dhow that had 25 passengers and their luggage capsized at the Mkanda Channel in the Indian Ocean. The tragedy occurred due to rough tides while they travelled from Lamu to Ndau village in Lamu East. Another four people were found alive by a search team mounted by Red Cross and KMA after being reported missing on October 9 last year. They had spent a night in the ocean after their boat was overpowered by rough tides normally experienced at the Manda Bruno area. It was swept away to Dodori area where they were later found.
