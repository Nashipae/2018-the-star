Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo has pledged to solve land problems in the constituency so that about 80,000 squatters can be permanent residences. He said the solution to land problems in the constituency lies in dialogue adding that the same will be given preference in the case at hand.

"I am a performer. I am ready to die for my people to save our lands," Mbogo said during a meeting with squatters in Junda ward on Monday. He was accompanied by Lands committee vice chair and Lunga Lunga MP Khatib Mwashetani. The Kisauni MP also asked Deputy President William Ruto to fulfil his promise during the campaign that Junda residents will be issued with title deeds. "We are now telling him to fulfil the promise. Payment is the only medicine to a debt," he said.

"If they bought the Waitiki land at Sh1 billion, why should they not buy land for us?" Mbogo said he will petition Parliament through the Lands Committee to set aside some funds to buy lands so that genuine squatters in Kisauni can occupy their own plots. "There is nothing for free. And don’t expect a miracle to happen. We have to sacrifice," Mbogo said. Click here for the latest political news
