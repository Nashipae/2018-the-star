 A 23-year-old university student died on Saturday night after falling from the balcony of his hostel shortly after returning to his room after a drink with friends. Ian Kibet, a fourth-year engineering student, was confirmed dead shortly after 11.30 at the University of Nairobi’s Mamlaka Hostels. Kibet had just reported back to his room after a night out with friends. Efforts to get comments from the university management were unsuccessful. Police said, however, that preliminary investigations indicated Kibet had consumed alcohol at the time of the accident. They ruled out suicide. Investigations are ongoing. “We haven’t seen any indications that the student committed suicide. We think he accidentally fell from the balcony,” Nairobi DCI chief Ireri Kamwende said yesterday. He said Kilimani police have opened investigations into the death. Prior to his tragic death, Kibet had broken into his room after losing the keys to his cubicle, police said. Kibet’s fellow students eulogised him as hardworking. In a Facebook post, student James Mogaka said, “Death has robbed us of a young and vibrant shining planet earth — rest in peace. In God’s hands you’ll rest, but in our hearts you’ll remain. Rest well bro.” Steve Onsarigo said, “Indeed a star has been dimmed. My world has shrunk and the comrades fraternity is weakened and in pain. The loss is numbing and unbearable.” Click here for the latest political news
