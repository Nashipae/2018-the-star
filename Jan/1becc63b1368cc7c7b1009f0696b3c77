Bungoma leaders and union officials have vowed newly transferred school heads will not set foot in schools in the county.  Senator Moses Wetang’ula, Governor Wycliffe Wangamati, Woman Rep Catherine Wambilianga, Webuye West MP Dan Wanyama and Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi said it was done in bad faith. All ward reps, Knut and Kuppet county officials backed the plan. They unanimously decision was reached at a meeting in Bungoma called by Wetang’ula on Thursday. Top performing schools in the county were affected by the transfers, the leaders said. They suspect the teachers were moved so that educations standards in Bungoma drop. However, Education CS Fred Matiang’i is firm, the transfers will be effected. He said teachers can work anywhere in the country. Friends School Kamusinga, Lugulu Girls, Kimilili Boys, Kibabi Boys, Chesamis High and Cardinal Otunga Girls in Bungoma were affected by the mass transfers. Wetang’ula said as Bungoma leaders, they will talk with one voice to protect schools if not, history would judge them harshly.  “Our region produces some of the best teachers. We cannot produce good teachers yet low-grade teachers are brought from elsewhere to run our schools,” he said. Leaders will not watch as schools the community and churches built, are brought down, NASA principal Wetang’ula said. “We’ll put our political affiliations aside and speak with one voice. The child that goes to Kamusinga, Lugulu, Kibabi or Teremi doesn’t go carrying a party’s tag, they go to the schools as our sons and daughters,” he said. The alumnus of Kamusinga said they don’t want schools in Bungoma destabilised.  Wetang’ula said there was a time Kamusinga’s performance had deteriorated, it was unable to send a single student to Kamusinga, but now the school is an academic and sports giant
