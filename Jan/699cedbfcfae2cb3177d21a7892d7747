The National Police Service Commission chairman Johnstone Kavuludi has defend police conduct in crowd control. Speaking yesterday on the sidelines of a meeting with the National Assembly Committee on Administration and National Security in Mombasa, he said the officers largely act professionally within the law. “They can’t go beyond their mandate. Their mandate is to ensure that there is safety and security for every Kenyan and their property,” said Kavuludi. “I have always advised the police to stick to the law and they always stick to the law. They have done it with a lot of restraint. We believe they will continue to do it with a lot of restraint.” This is despite the opposition accusing police of using excessive force in dealing with NASA supporters. NASA claims the police killed more 100 of their supporters during and after the August 8 and October 26 elections last year. They accused Jubilee of using police as a force instead of a service, a matter Kavuludi said has not reached his office. “I don’t know about that. But the National Police Service is not a force. It is a service. I don’t know to what extent it becomes a force,” said Kavuludi. He told the public to uphold the peace and avoid provoking the police, who, he said, have human feelings.
