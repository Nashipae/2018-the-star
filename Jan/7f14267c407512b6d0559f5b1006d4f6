The High Court will decide whether Nelson Havi who is running for the Law Society of Kenya president seat will be on the ballot next Monday. Justice John Mativo will deliver judgment in the case filed by Havi, challenging the decision by the LSK to lock him out of the election for not meeting the age limit required by law. He wants the court to declare Section18 (1) and Section 2 (a) and (b) of the LSK Act, 2014, unconstitutional as it discriminates on the basis of age  and status for the election of the president, the vice president and the  council member. Through his lawyers, he says he is qualified to vie for the seat since he has 15 years experience as a practicing lawyer. Havi said he was admitted to the bar in June 2003, but has had “an illustrious career with tremendous service to the public”. He wants the court to stop the election slated for February 12 or include his name on the ballot. In response, lawyers Paul Muite and Steve Ogolla told the court he was disqualified because he did not meet the requirement of Section 18 (1) of the LSK Act. They argued that Havi will not have attained the 15 years of service as a legal practitioner by the time the LSK is holding the election. They say Havi will have attained at least 15 years experience on June 12 this year, which is more than three months after the election date. The LSK denied claims by Havi it had conjured a clandestine scheme to outmanoeuvre his bid to run for office, adding the allegations are incorrect, untrue and unsubstantiated. Havi was disqualified from contesting for the president’s seat on December 13.
