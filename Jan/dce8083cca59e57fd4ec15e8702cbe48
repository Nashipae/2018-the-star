The Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims has said Tourism CS Najib Balala is anti-Islamic after his statement on the shisha ban. Supkem officials yesterday gave him a week to apologise and retract or they will organise demonstrations against him and advice all mosques to denounce him. On Saturday, Balala criticised the Ministry of Health for “frustrating” investors by banning the importation, manufacture, sale and use of shisha. Balala said the “rushed” decision will affect the tourism sector. “The whole world has shisha! Why are you banning it in Kenya?” the CS asked. “It is unacceptable to wake up overnight and arrest people who have put a lot of money to create jobs.” Supkem Mombasa general secretary Khalfan Ali said Balala has prioritised material wealth over health, moral and Islamic teachings.
