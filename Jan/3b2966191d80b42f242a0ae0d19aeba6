Acting Education CS Fred Matiang’i has delayed the naming of a new VC to head Moi University causing anxiety among staff. The delay is as a result of a row over marks awarded to some of the top candidates for the position who participated in interviews on November 27. Matiang’i received a report on results of interviews for the VC position soon after that, but sources indicate there has been intense interest in who will be named the VC. Education PS Kipsang Belio said the matter is being addressed. UASU official Luke Abok said, “The university should have a substantive VC so we can move smoothly without anxiety over leadership of the university.”  The interviews in November were conducted by a panel picked by the University Council. Isaac Kosgey emerged tops. The Laikipia University deputy vice chancellor scored 76 marks, while acting VC Laban Ayiro tied with Ann Nagulu at second with 70. There were claims three interviewers were biased against Ayiro and deliberately gave him low marks to lock him out and pave way for Kosgey.
