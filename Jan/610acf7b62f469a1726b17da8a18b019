Former Kirinyaga Senator Daniel Karaba yesterday formally applied to withdraw his election petition challenging the victory of Senator Charles Kibiru. Karaba, through lawyer Kibe Mungai, said he wants to drop the case, because he lacks faith in the judicial process. The immediate former senator said he has carefully considered the proceedings and after consultations with his family, supporters and Kirinyaga residents, he decided to abandon the case. But Karaba slammed the judiciary, saying he has decided to call it a day because “no justice will be delivered”. Mungai said he received instructions from his client to stop proceeding, since the election petition is being manipulated by an “unseen hand”. The court was expected to rule by end of the month.  The parties in the case have been instructed to go back to court on 22 of this month, when it will rule whether the case will be terminated.
