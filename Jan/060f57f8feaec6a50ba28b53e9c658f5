The National Police Service Commission has kicked off the recruitment of police chiefs following a shake-up in the service by President Uhuru Kenyatta last week. The Johnston Kavuludi-led commission said interested and qualified applicants for the director of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations as well as two deputy inspectors general of police should submit their applications by Monday next week.

ODM leader Raila Odinga was the first to raise the red flag and accused Uhuru of “acting with impunity in the belief that he will never have to face Kenyans in another election”. On Friday last week, Uhuru redeployed Deputy Inspector General of Police Joel Kitili, his Administration counterpart Samuel Arachi and DCI boss Ndegwa Muhoro. On acting capacity, he appointed Edward Njoroge to replace Kitili, Noor Gabao to take over from Arachi and George Kinoti to succeed Muhoro. But in what might be seen to have tilted the interview in favour of the newly promoted officers, Uhuru said he appointed the three “on the advice of the National Police Service Commission and in consultation with the Inspector-General”. It is expected that Njoroge, Gabao and Kinoti will formally apply and face the Kavuludi team during interviews. To be qualified as deputy IG – Kenya police or Administration Police – one must hold a degree from a recognised university. He or she must have also served in the police service for at least 15 years. Also Read:DCI boss Muhoro fired as Uhuru reshuffles police bosses Click here for latest political news
