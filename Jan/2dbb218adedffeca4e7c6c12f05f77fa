Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos has urged communities in Kerio Valley to stop glorifying banditry and likening it to a betting game. Banditry has claimed many lives in the region and must be stopped. Tolgos said on Sunday banditry is a serious crime. He warned residents against carrying out retaliatory attacks and taking pride in killing people and stealing animals. “We hear that those going for livestock raids call it ‘betting’, likening it to the popular SportPesa betting game. What do you go to bet? Stealing cattle is not permitted,” Tolgos said at a peace meeting in Kerio Valley. Ten MPs were present. Tension has been high in the region after six people were killed last week. The leaders want an AP camp set up to fight bandits. “We urge our elders to help discourage youth from banditry,” Tolgos said.
