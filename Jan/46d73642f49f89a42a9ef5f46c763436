Communication Authority has advised Kenyans to vet software vendors citing that there is a plan by Cyber criminals to exploit their vulnerability to hit on organisations. In an advisory to the press yesterday, the authority said that there is a growing global concern and trend that depicts a serious concern in cybercrime management. "Though Kenya has not been adversely affected by such attacks as at now, the trend depicts a serious concern in cybercrime management and thus a precaution should be taken when dealing with outsourced products and personnel. The advisory therefore is to enable ICT users to make informed and risk-free decision on the choices of their products by engaging Cybersecurity experts,‚Äù Acting director general of the authority Christopher Kemei said. According to CA, the trend is gaining momentum with the increased offers of free anti-malware products by vendors which are used as a bait to lure the unsuspecting users, while the real intention is to have the anti-malware installed into a system, then use it to capture personal and confidential data. A supply chain attack, or third-party attack occurs when someone interrupts a system through an outside partner who validly has access to the systems and data. The attacker takes advantage of the inherent trust between users and their software providers.
