Diamond Platnumz is well known for his philandering ways. A week never passes without mention of his wayward ways. But according to him, that is a caricature of him that is not true. In an interview with Kiss FM Rwanda, the self-made musician made it clear that he has not been enticing any other woman because he now has a wife. He said the last time he enticed a woman was in 2014, when he did it to the mother of his kids, Zari. The Sikomi hitmaker had gone to Rwanda to visit Jordan Foundation and also promote his peanut brand. The Jordan Foundation is aÂ non-profit organisation that improves lives of children with blindness in Rwanda.
