A defilement suspect who escaped from an Ol Kalou police cell last year has been arrested. Joseph Wamithi 27-year-old, was arrested on Tuesday after a 14-year-old girl, who disappeared from a school in Munyeki, Ol Kalou was found to his house. Police said the girl disappeared from their home on January 14 and was declared missing. Nyandarua Central police boss Wilson Kosgei said the parents were worried their daughter was killed. “The issue was shared on social media. The girl  was found cohabiting with Wamithi for the eight days she has been missing,” Kosgei said. “When police went to rescue the girl, one officer noticed Wamithi was an escapee in another defilement case. Our records show he committed a similar offence last year. Police are looking for the parents of the 15-year-girl he defiled last year,” he said
