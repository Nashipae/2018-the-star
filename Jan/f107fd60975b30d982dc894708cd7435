The squatter problem in Kisauni is the first real test for MP Ali Mbogo’s leadership and the way he handles it will  affect his bid for Mombasa governor in 2022. Over 3,000 squatters in Nguu Tatu are battling with Bandari Sacco over ownership of 60 acres. The MP met the squatters’ leaders and promised to help them. Bandari Sacco says it bought the land in 2011 from Hussein Dairy Farm for Sh385 million and plans to put up a Sh4 billion housing project. Another group of squatters in Ugatuzi is fighting with a private developer over 100 acres. On Saturday, Kisauni squatters chairman Hisham Mwakazi accused tycoons of colluding with land officials to forge documents. “They run to court using dead people’s names to obtain orders that hurt the squatters,” said Mwakazi after a meeting in Barawa, Utange. Mbogo is in a catch 22 position. He does not want to lose popularity. The land question in Kisauni has helped build or destroy political careers. Governor Hassan Joho branded himself as a defender of squatters to win the Kisauni MP seat in 2007.
