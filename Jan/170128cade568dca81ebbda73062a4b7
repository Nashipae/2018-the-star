Farmers in Trans Nzoia county raked in more than Sh2.8 billion from sale of milk last year. This was an increase from Sh2.7 billion they received in 2016. Speaking to the Star in Kitale town on Monday, acting county director of Livestock production Harrison Were said 113,000 litres of milk were produced in the county last year. This was an increase from 109,000 litres produced in 2016 Were attributed the increase in milk production to the interventions put in place by the county government to improve dairy farming. Last year, he said, the county government subsidised livestock feed and managed to control diseases early from attacking the livestock that farmers kept. Were said the county government purchased 10 milk coolers with a capacity of ranging from 1,000 to 1,200 litres. Each subcounty got two coolers to help keep the milk fresh. The subcounties are Kwanza, Saboti, Kiminini, Cherangany and Endebess. He said before the milk coolers were introduced, farmers had challenges in selling their produce and they were forced to sell it in the villages at low prices. The director said the milk collected from farmers is sold in cooperative societies at Sh25 per litre. Farmers sell their milk to the New Kenya Creameries Cooperative, Brookside Dairy, Daima and supermarkets.
