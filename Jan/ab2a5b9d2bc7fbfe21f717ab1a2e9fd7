Nyamira county has launched the Linda Mama programme, which seeks to ensure women deliver their babies in health facilities. This will help reduce the number of deaths during delivery. The programme is sponsored by the NHIF, NGO Fhi360’s Aphia Plus programme and Path International. Path International development vice president Cathy Cahill said, “It is wrong when a mother cannot deliver in a hospital because she cannot afford delivery fees. It is wrong when mothers die during birth because of complications that can be avoided if the delivery took place in a health facility.” She spoke in Nyamira County Referral Hospital on Wednesday during the launch of the programme. Nyamira Health services chief Douglas Bosire urged pregnant women to take advantage of the programme. Mothers will be educated on family planning, prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, as well as receive antenatal and postnatal services. Governor John Nyagarama praised the programme, saying it will improve mothers’ lives. “We join the government in launching the Linda Mama and Boresha  Jamii programme, an expanded free maternity care programme, through which over 80 facilities in our county will be offering free maternity services,” he said. Nyagarama said more women deliver in hospitals in Nyamira than elsewhere in Nyanza region. “Quite a good number of mothers deliver in health facilities unlike before when mothers gave birth in their households. The skilled deliveries have increased to 74.9 per cent up from 52 per cent in 2013,” he said.
