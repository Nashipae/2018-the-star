A WhatsApp group in Bibirioni, Limuru, has raised school fees for a boy on the verge of losing his Form One place at Thika High School. John Ndung’u, 18, scored 379 marks in the KCPE exam. His parents have white- collar jobs in Ngarariga village, but could not raise the Sh43,000 fee. Their second-born daughter Sarah Wamathwe, 16, is still at home after finishing primary school in 2016. Emmanuel Gathecha, chairman of the Bibirioni Notice Board group, said they learnt of Ndung’u’s plight from a member. “He had applied for the Wings to Fly scholarship, which was his only hope of joining high school, but after the team visited his home, he missed out,” Gachecha said. “Dejected, defeated and having lost hope, John was going to seek a place in a local day school.” The 137-member group raised Sh60,000, did his shopping and enrolled him in school yesterday.
