More than 1,200 nurses in Nakuru on Thursday marched to the county headquarters to issue a one week notice over unpaid three months arrears. Led by branch officials of the Kenya national union of nurses, they delivered the notice to the county health executive Jonah Manjari. This came barely hours after Seth Panyako, their national secretary-general said nurses in 13 counties will withhold their services from next Thursday because of unpaid salaries. Read: Nurses issue seven-day ultimatum over unpaid salaries Nakuru branch secretary general Syprene Odera said despite a return to work formula signed between the union and the council of governors last year, Nakuru County was among 12 others that are yet to pay the arrears for the period that they were on strike. He said the government had withheld the salaries as the nurses pushed for the signing of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). “We have not received salaries for the months of August, September and October despite the county government promising to make a lump sum payment this month,” she said. They expressed concern that they have been unable to service loans and pay school fees for their children. “The county has not responded to our demand for paying all our salaries and unfortunately, our letters have been ignored,” she said. Other affected counties are Bungoma, Nyeri, Homa Bay, Elgeyo Marakwet, Tharaka Nithi, Makueni, Kakamega, Wajir, Laikipia, Kirinyaga, Murang’a and Kericho. Panyako said the union understands some counties are facing financial challenges but asked them to let union officials how the payments will be made. He noted the daily picketing was not a strike, but that if need be, the union will issue a legal notice. “They should follow the example of Nyamira which has reached an agreement with workers. If need be, we will start the year with industrial action," he said. Click here for the latest political news
