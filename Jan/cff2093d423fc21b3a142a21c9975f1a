Kimilili MP Didymus Barasa has joined a growing list of politicians who want to table a motion in Parliament for a review of NTSA's mandates. The lawmakers have been mounting pressure on the authority following the deaths of at least 330 people in road accidents in December last year. Barasa accused the authority of "not knowing its roles and "doing things that can’t be comprehended while more Kenyans lose their lives". He lashed out at NTSA for banning night trips by PSVs saying this will not end road carnage. The MP further said NTSA has been doing the job of traffic police yet its officials did not study traffic laws. "I promise that as soon as the House opens, I will present a motion and MPs will take a keen look at NTSA and what it does on our roads," he siad. "They should focus only on regulatory issues. Enforcement and camping on roads like traffic police are not their mandates ... they are wrong." He addressed the press at the Kimilili constituency office on Wednesday after meeting all secondary school heads from the area.
