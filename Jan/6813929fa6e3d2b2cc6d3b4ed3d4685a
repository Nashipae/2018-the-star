Majority Leader Aden Duale has dismissed claims of a fallout between President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto. The talks emerged following the DP's absence when the president unveiled changes in his administration on Friday. "We have one government which is led by Uhuru. All of us, including me and Ruto, are behind our leader and we endorse every decision he takes." Duale, in the twitter post on Sunday, added: "Those who are speculating on the absence of the DP want to create a controversy where there is none." Despite being in the country, Ruto was not with his boss, as per the tradition they set when they unveiled their first Cabinet in 2013, an issue that got many talking. His spokesperson David Mugonyi told the Star that the president was in charge and it was not a must for the DP to be there. He further cited the functions of the president as enshrined in the Constitution. In his announcement, Uhuru retained only six Cabinet Secretaries and nominated three fresh faces. Former Turkana Senator John Munyes, ex-Marsabit governor Ukur Yatani, and former DPP Keriako Tobiko are the fresh faces. The three were nominated but the portfolios they will man are yet to be revealed. They will be subject to vetting and approval by Parliament. The development sparked anxiety over the fate of 13 CSs as reports indicated that they have been sacked. Uhuru's administration refuted the claims that the ministers were sacked.
