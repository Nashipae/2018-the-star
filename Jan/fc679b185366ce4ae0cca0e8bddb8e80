Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko is not off the hook as an appeal has been lodged seeking to reverse last monthâ€™s decision to terminate a petition against him. Petitioners Japheth Muroko and Zacchaeus Okoth want the petition reinstated, arguing the court made an error in law when it struck it out. They are not happy Justice Mbogholi Msagha ordered them to pay Sonko and the IEBC Sh5 million as costs for the suit. The costs are unreasonable and unjust, they said. The petition was terminated on January 9 after Muroko filed an affidavit. The petitioners argue the judge should have followed the procedure and allowed them to withdraw, but leave the matter pending in case someone else wants to pick it up.
