Jane Mukami alias the fit Kenyan girl is now involving men in her 21 day transformation work out dubbed as the transform 21 challenge. Talking exclusively to Word is, Mukami says this is to pay tribute to her late brother Stephen  Githehu who died in Georgia, USA. "I started working out because of my own personal journey, I wasn't happy with how I looked so I decided to do something about it. Initially  it was a personal quest which the grew into something else. This is the 10th year now." She added, "The challenge is open to both men and women.Normally I focus on women but this challenge is a tribute to my late brother so I'm including the men as well." Her brother was ex US-military serviceman. So how did she handle the grieve? "For me dealing with grieve was staying busy so I got an IT gig and I got a lot of therapy, I had a psychologist whom I still see and just taking it a day at a time. Death is one of those things that are very hard to express." Curious to know who's the man in her life, the gorgeous fitness guru confirmed that she was very single, but who's her ideal man? "I'm single, I haven't found the one. My ideal guy would be someone that's passionate about his life, he who has a career in something that he really likes, he's on purpose. He must subscribe to healthier living because if he does that, he motivates me."
