Two children who were allegedly killed by their father on December 26 were laid to rest on Saturday in an emotional send-off at their home in Narumoru in Kieni East. Eleven-year-old Steve Mwangi and five-year-old Maryanne Wanjiku, were stabbed to death in Kiganjo, Thika county, after a domestic quarrel between their parents. The suspect linked to the crime drank poison, but survived. He is being treated at Thika Level Five Hospital under tight security. The 32-year-old man, who lives in Kiganjo, travelled to Narumoru in Nyeri to visit his wife on December 23. The parents quarrelled, and the suspect took the children with him back to Kiganjo on December 26, when they were killed. A dark cloud hang over the village as two white coffins bearing the remains on the children were lowered into one grave. The mother, Jane Ndegwa, was overcome by grief as she mourned the death of her only children, brutally cut short. Residents who attended the funeral were outraged by the killing. Politicians and church leaders called on the government to ensure justice done and the suspect is jailed. Clergymen said the rise of killings involving family members is worrying. They urged people who are depressed to see counsellors. Kieni MP Kanini Kega opposed the decision by the Supreme Court recommending a review of the Constitution to scrap the death sentence. “We cannot allow killers or those who rape our children to walk freely. I will be in the front line to ensure the death sentence is made mandatory,” he said. Mt Kenya Diocese Bishop Joseph Kagunda asked legislators to ensure those who commit murder are sentenced to death.
