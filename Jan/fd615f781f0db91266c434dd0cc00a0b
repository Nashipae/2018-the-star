Likoni MP Mishi Mboko has said she does not know where Inuka police station is despite the same being in her constituency. Mishi, while testifying in a petition challenging her win, said she does not know the location of the said police station. It was here that she reportedly secured the release of some of her supporters who were arrested on election day. Inuka police station is located in Ujamaa ward and is the second largest in Likoni sub-county. Mishi's confession came after the petitioner's lawyer questioned her whether she had a hand in the release of people who were arrested and detained at the station. The lawyer accused the MP of protesting the arrest of people who allegedly caused chaos during the election and thereafter, assisted in securing their release. Mishi said she was not aware that people were arrested and, therefore, did not assist in their release. The Likoni MP contradicted former MP Masoud Mwahima who averred that there was blackout when IEBC declared the winner. Mwahima had told the court that the winner was announced at night and IEBC used light from the phones. He said the election officials did not use spotlight provided by IEBC but instead relied on light on their phones. However, Mishi noted that she does not remember whether there were lights or not when IEBC declared her as the winner. She said this is because she was announced as the winner during the day and not at night. The MP further downplayed allegations that Jubilee agents were denied access to 12 polling stations. Mwahima wants the court to annul Mishi's election and order for fresh elections. Also read: Court rejects Mishi Mboko's bid to throw out Mwahima petition Click here for the latest political news
