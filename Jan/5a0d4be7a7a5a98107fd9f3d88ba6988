Homa Bay High court on Thursday concluded the recount of votes cast in the governor election in August last year. The recount was ordered following the petition filed by former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga challenging Governor Cyprian Awiti's win. During the recount, it emerged that some ballot boxes had their seals tampered with while some ballot papers were not accounted for. For instance, at Got Rabuor polling centre, the ballot box and the lid were broken from one corner and the tamper-proof envelop was not sealed. At the station, Magwanga got 244 votes against Awiti's 153 votes while presiding officers did not sign form37A for Nyaundho polling station. The recount also revealed that the governor was added 18 votes at Kobuya primary school while Magwanga lost 6 votes during tallying. Awiti was declared the winner at the station with 474 votes against Magwanga's 26. It was further noted that two ballot papers could not be accounted for. Further illegalities were realised at Kunya 1 polling station where Magwanga's votes were reduced by 2 in favour of the incumbent. The recount, which was presided over by deputy registrar Leister Simiyu, was ordered by Justice Joseph Karanja on November 7 last year. The former Kasipul MP has grounded the petition on illegalities and irregularities which he said affected the results.
