Kenya National Union of Teachers, Nyandarua North branch, is not opposed to the ongoing transfer of head teachers. However, it says the government should not use the shakeup to punish some teachers.  Region executive secretary Simon Kairu yesterday said the government, through the TSC, has the sole mandate to employ ,transfer and discipline teachers.  “The least the other stakeholders can do is to allow the TSC do its work,” he said. Kairu spoke at Ol Kalou on Tuesday afternoon. He said the transfers are affecting families as some teachers are taken to counties away from their families. Kairu, however, distanced himself from a recent suggestion by Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion that teachers will call a strike to oppose the transfers. ”Never. We cannot strike because of transfers because the TSC is doing its work,” he said.  Nyandarua TSC deputy director Wilson Koros said the new head teachers are already at their new stations.
