RnB artiste Otile Brown has hit the headlines by terming himself the highest-paid artiste in Kenya. The lad, who is currently hitting the airwaves with the song 'Tamu Sana' featuring Tanzania's Shetta, says he got all the facts to prove his claim. "Yes, I'm the highest-paid artiste. I don't wanna put anybody down but trust me, I got the facts. People assume but they don't know what's going on on the ground." He added: "We are talking about music, so I'm saying I'm the highest-paid artiste in the 254." Nevertheless,Â  Otile's songs have been trending on YouTube, and he took this chance to narrate how he made it to the top. "You have to be creative, you don't need to be doing what other artistes are doing. I'm true to myself, I usually say I'm not the best vocalist but there is something that makes me different, something that makes people wanna listen to my music. In fact, I'm one of the artistes who are really doing well in downloads. It's because of the melody and the words." And how is the process of the making of his songs? "A line in my song can take me up to a month. The song is over but there's always this one line that's the problem. Coz I want it to be perfect. It can take me up to to a month to do that line." The singers concludes by saying he has collaborations with another Tanzanian and an international Nigerian singer that are yet to come.
