NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga won the August 8 with 70 per cent against President Uhuru Kenyata’s 30 per cent, Busia Woman Rep Florence Mutua said.  Addressing ODM party agents on Thursday during a thanksgiving at Lugare, Bunyala, Mutua thanked them for volunteering to work long hours and remaining vigilant on the election day. She said NASA supporters across the country voted overwhelmingly for change and suffered police brutality while demanding for their right. She said they would not rest until Raila is sworn in as ‘President’.  She told ODM elected leaders in Busia to continue strengthening the party so that it is no swallowed by NASA. “I want to appeal to them to do everything at their disposal to ensure our party remains strong,” Mutua said. She said those who stood firm with the party should be given first priority when opportunities arise. Mutua said she would allocate adequate funds for the bursary kitty to enable needy children, who dropped out of school, to go back this term. She said stern action will be taken against people impregnating young girls. Mutua urged the youth to form and register groups so that they can be awarded contracts.
