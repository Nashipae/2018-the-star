The National Environment Management Authority and police will work jointly to ensure traders comply with the ban on plastic bags. Speaking at Nema’s offices, director general Geoffrey Wahungu said they are facing challenges, especially in Gikomba, Ngara, City Park and City markets. He said police will inspect vehicles for plastic bags. Wahungu warned hawkers who are still using plastic bags to pack goods. The ban took effect on August 28 last year. He urged traders’ committees in the SME sector and listed markets to ensure the facilities are plastic bag-free or face closure. “Traders are still polluting the environment and interfering with law enforcement. We are going after them. City askaris will be involved. We will also follow up in other counties,”  Wahungu said. He warned that anyone trying to form gangs to resist the ban will face the full arm of the law. “The county commander is fully aware of what we are doing and has agreed to back us. Plastic bags are an eyesore. Let us all work together to ensure we have a clean and healthy environment ,” he said. Manufacturers of plastic bottles were warned they might lose their business if they fail to put up enough collection points for disposing of used bottles. Wahungu said the manufacturers have until April 31 to implement their plans to curb pollution from plastic bottles.
