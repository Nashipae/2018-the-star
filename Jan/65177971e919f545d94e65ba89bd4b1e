In his typical style of grooming footballers with budding talent, Mathare United coach Francis Kimanzi has described his latest prospect, Klinsmann Omulanga, as a bright prospect who is hungry to succeed.  “He is a young boy who is showing a lot of promise and we hope that we can guide him at this crucial stage of his development,” Kimanzi remarked about the son of former international Wycliffe Anyang’u.  Omulanga is eager to get going after joining the club on a one-year loan deal from Liberty Academy. He is set to provide more options in attack beyond the trio of Chris Ochieng’ and Elijah Mwanzia as well as the experienced Clifford Alwanga, who was recently snapped up from Tusker. The 21 year old is elated at graduating from the third tier, the National Division One League, to the top tier adding that he is ready to fight for a place in the first team. “This is a new experience for me and I am happy that I am playing at this level. It is tough to compete here and it requires a lot of determination and hard work,” said Omulanga. “I am grateful to coach Jacob Mulee for advising me to join this team because it gives young players an opportunity to learn. I want to work hard and gain experience by playing as many matches at this level. When my opportunity comes I will grab it. I am here to score goals,” he said. It remains to be seen whether he will better his tally of seven goals for Liberty Academy in the 2017 season once he settles in at his new home.
