Wrangles between the county and national governments pose a major threat to food security, newly appointed Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa said yesterday. The two levels of government have been acting as though they are in competition, leading to limited production in the irrigation sector. Wamalwa was speaking during the handing over of the Irrigation docket to incoming Agriculture and Irrigation CS Mwangi Kiunjuri. Kiunjuri previously served as the Devolution CS and President Uhuru Kenyatta moved him in his second Cabinet. “Food production is a devolved function, but there is need for the national government to understand these activities cannot succeed without proper support,” Wamalwa said. “There is great need for the two governments to work hand in hand to boost food security.” Wamalwa said the disbursed cash for irrigation projects across the country is not enough. He said for the country to move from the list of food insecure nations, more money must be injected into irrigation projects. Wamalwa said privatization plan for the 10,000 acre Galana- Kulalu model farm is almost complete, and will be handed over next month.
