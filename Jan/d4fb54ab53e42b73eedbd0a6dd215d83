An MP has called for an amendment to the Tourism Act to turn around the fortunes of the industry in the Coast region. Kilifi North MP Owen Baya on Tuesday said he will table a Bill in Parliament to amend the act. He said the amendment is aimed at empowering investors market tourism to boast the economy of the region. Baya said the ministry and the tourism marketing board had failed to satisfactorily market the sector. Speaking in Kilifi, Baya said Tourism CS Najib Balala must roll up his sleeves and vigorously market Kenya. “We want to improve the economy of our people. Many tourists mean a stable economy for us,” Baya said. He said the restriction of planes landing at the Malindi airport had hampered the growth of tourism. "The Ethiopian Airlines have said they are ready to start landing in Malindi. That will mean more tourists coming to the Coast," Baya said. He praised the Kenya Airport Management and the Kenya Airports Authority for the ongoing expansion works at the airport. Baya asked the county government to give tax incentives to hoteliers who get bookings of over 80 per cent to promote tourism. “That will encourage them to bring more tourists," Baya said.
