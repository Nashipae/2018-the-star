Khetia's Supermarket has opened a new branch in Busia town, bringing to 12, the number of branches the retail chain has opened in western Kenya. Other branches are in Trans Nzoia, Bungoma, Kakamega, Uasin Gishu and Busia. The retailer also opened two stores in Kisumu last year. The branch, which cost Sh150 million, was opened at the premises which was previously occupied by cash-strapped Nakumatt retail chain. Ashok Khetia, the proprietor, said 90 per cent of residents have already been employed at the new store adding that more will be absorbed. "More will be employed if the business picks up. We shall open more outlets in Busia with the support of the county residents," he said. "Plans are in the offing to start a new branch in Kisii. We might
also consider extending our investments to Uganda in the
near future," Ashok said. Busia deputy governor Moses Mulomi presided over the official opening on Wednesday. He was accompanied by director of trade Vincent Asikoye. Ashok assured consumers that the supermarket will offer them cheaper and affordable foodstuffs, households, and electronics. Mulomi said the county government welcomes investors asking them to take advantage of the county's investment policy. He asked the retailer to purchase products like vegetables, onions, tomatoes, and peanut butter among others from locals. Asikoye  said the Trade department will give the retail chain the necessary support to realise his expansion plans in the county. Boda boda association chair Eric Makokha appealed to Khetia to build a shade for boda boda riders outside the shop as part of its corporate social responsibility.
