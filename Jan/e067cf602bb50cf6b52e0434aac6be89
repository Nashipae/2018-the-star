The failure by Busia County to register a single A in 2017 KCSE has upset former vice chairman of Electoral Commission of Kenya Gabriel Mukele. Mukele who met Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong said as an elder in Busia he wants the scenario reversed. " Busia County has had some best brains in the Country including surgeons and academicians. With the best brains retiring who will take over the mantle? he asked. Mukele said he had shared the same concerns with the Busia County Director Education and his Teachers Service Commission counterpart over failure by county schools to produce quality grades. " There is urgent need for leaders and all education stakeholders to meet and chat the way forward so as to reverse this worrying trend. I am not blaming anybody for our failure to register a single A plain. The question I am asking is do we have all very stupid people in Busia County? No. This trend must change," he said. For the second year running no student managed to score an A plain in KCSE. In 2017 KCSE, six candidates scored A-, 32B+, 119B, 218B-, 424C+, 705C, 1215C-, 1822D+, 2898D, 3076D-281E, 34X and 2 ungraded. ut of 10,332 candidates who sat for the exams from the County in 2017, only 799 candidates scored C+ and above to earn places at public universities. This represents 0.074 per cent of the candidates who sat for this year's exams. In 2016 KCSE no single A was registered with 15 students scoring A-. In order to motivate students to perform in national exams the County Government introduced laptops for any student who scores an A in KCSE. A total of 13 students who sat for 2014 and 2015 exams won a laptop each for scoring As in the exams of 2014 and 2015.
