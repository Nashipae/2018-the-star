A Busia court will rule on January 10 whether to terminate a petition against Amukura Central MCA Moses Ouma.  Ouma’s lawyer Joseph Makokha filed an application asking the court to terminate the case filed by election loser Paul Okello. He said the petitioner served an amended petition instead of the original therefore, making it a nullity. Chief magistrate William Chepseba was scheduled to give the ruling on Friday, but deferred it to next Wednesday on grounds he received submissions from the advocates late.
