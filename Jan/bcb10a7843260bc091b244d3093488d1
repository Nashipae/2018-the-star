More than 10,000 children risk dropping out of school in Baringo owing tof prolonged drought as well as food and water scarcity.  At least 30,000 residents, especially in the lowlands, face starvation. The dire situation is blamed on total crop failure and last year’s politics. Kenya National Union of Teachers Baringo branch executive secretary Joshua Cheptarus said there is fear of massive school dropout this year if the state does not act swiftly. He spoke to the media in Kabarnet town yesterday. Cheptarus urged teachers to assist leaders and parents in mobilising children to resume school. “It is about the future of the children, we need them to stay in school,” Cheptarus said. A spot check by the Star along the Kerio Valley in Baringo North on Monday revealed poverty, hunger and water shortage. Some children from more than 30 schools in the county are yet to resume schools this term. The majority are at home assisting their parents with household chores, herding livestock and trekking for long distances in searching of water.  They are also forced to look for wild fruits to feed their families. Resident Reuben Aengwo, a parent at Cheptigit Primary School said half of the pupils have not gone to school. “At one time the school had a class eight stream, but due to harsh drought conditions, pupils dropped out. The school now has pupils till class three,” Aengwo said. He said last year they lost thousands of livestock -their source of livestock. Rains failed from last July. “Parents are unable to pay fees for their children,” Cheptarus said. He appealed to the state to start a school feeding programme to attract children in the arid and semi-arid areas back in school. Kabosgei chief Richard Chepcheng said times are tough. He said government plans to distribute food have been delayed this term.
