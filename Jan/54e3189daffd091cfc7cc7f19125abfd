Athlete Richard Tirop and his friend Martin Kimutai are the latest victims of rising crime in Eldoret after they were killed by unknown gangsters. Mutilated bodies of the duo were found in Kipkorgot market along the Eldoret-Kaptagat road yesterday morning. The two suffered multiple injuries that were likely inflicted with blunt objects. “It appears they were tortured before being killed,” resident Patrick Too said. Tirop, 44, was an athlete who participated in several marathons in the United States. Police said pieces of cloth were stuffed into the mouth of one of the bodies. Uasin Gishu Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno and top security officers in the county visited the scene as investigations were launched. “This is terrible and unacceptable. We have asked police to quickly probe the killings,” Chemno said. Detectives were already following crucial leads to apprehend the killers. “We have officers on the ground and they will ensure those involved are brought to book,” Uasin Gishu county commissioner Abdi Hassan said. He promised to firmly deal with criminals terrorising residents. According to residents, at least six people have been killed in similar fashion over the last one year. They accused the county government of failing to install street lights in the area, despite the rising crime. Chemno said the concerns were being addressed. “We have already made plans to install the security lights. We urge residents to work with the police in identifying criminals,” Chemno said. In November, Hassan ordered a security operation in Eldoret to recover illegal guns and arrest criminals terrorising residents. He said the operation would be carried out in Langas estate and other areas identified as hideouts for criminals. Police were to carry out door-to-door searches. “We know those involved,” Hassan said.
