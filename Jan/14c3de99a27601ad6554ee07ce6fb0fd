Only clubs within estates are being shut down, and not those in the CBD, Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has said. Last Friday Space Lounge and B-Club, both in Kilimani, were closed following complaints from residents over too much noise. "Many youths have been employed and the county collects a lot of revenue from those clubs so we have to work together, but they should do business in a manner not to hinder other issues like peace," Sonko told the Star on Tuesday. Clubs operating in residential areas should not exceed sound levels of 55 decibels during the day and 35 decibels at night. Those operating in purely commercial areas should not go beyond 60 decibels during the day and 35 decibels at night. However, most the sound levels of most city clubs is at more than 80 decibels. The two clubs were closed in an operation by the Nairobi Liquor Licensing Board and the national government. In a public notice on Saturday, Sonko said the crackdown will continue until law and order is restored.
