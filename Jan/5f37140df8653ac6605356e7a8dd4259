The
Kenya Maritime Authority has launched a search and rescue mission for three fishermen who went missing at Ngoi near Lamu on Monday. Lamu KMA rescue coordinator Jacob Odanga said Madi Issa, Bunu Ali and Omar Issa failed to return from their fishing expedition. They were reported missing by family and friends after they failed to return to the Tenewi beach. Odanga said a team of maritime police was yesterday dispatched to search for the fishermen. "We have sent the team to Ngoi and Kipungani where the three are said to have gone fishing," Odanga said. The three fishermen hail from Shanga Island in Lamu East. Their phones have since gone off. Cases of people going missing at sea are not new to Lamu. In October last year, four people went missing after their boat was overpowered by rough rides near Manda Bruno. They were were found alive at Dodori. Earlier in August, politician Shekhue Kahale lost 12 family members, including his wife and four children, after their boat capsized on its way to Lamu Island from Kizingitini. On June 20 last year, 10 people perished when a dhow that
had aboard 25 passengers and their luggage capsized at the Mkanda Channel in
the Indian Ocean.
