Students who C+ and above in the 2017 KCSE examination will be admitted to private and public universities under government sponsorship. The learners - with 46 points and more - will pursue degree courses,  the universities placement office said, following completion of the first phase of student assignment to universities. John Muraguri, who is Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service CEO, said learners who had not been selected would be considered in the second round. "The placement service will open its online application system on Wednesday for applicants to revise their choices," he said in Nairobi on Wednesday. The system will remain open until February 14. Candidates who scored C- will also be put on government sponsorship to pursue diploma courses offered in tertiary institutions. Those who scored a mean grade of D will pursue craft certificate courses in tertiary institutions. Click here for the latest political news
