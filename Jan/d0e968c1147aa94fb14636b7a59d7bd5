A Kenyan and a Nigerian walked away with Sh10.2 million each in the hotly contested continental GoGettaz enterpreneurship competition. Peter Wachira and Ezinne Uko will also get a similar amount in credit from Equity Bank Kenya, and a two week mentorship at Kwesé headquarters in South Africa with Strive Masiyiwa, founder and executive chairman of Econet Global. They won in the last round of pitches, beating 10 other contestants in Nairobi. The other 10 runner-up will each receive $10 000 (Sh1 million) investment in their ventures. The Kwesé Inc #GoGettaz competition received over 4,800 entries last August when it launched on Econet Global founder Strive Masiyiwa’s Facebook page. The top scorers won online quizzes, then asked to submit written pitches. Winners progressed to a social media voting phase where the semi-finalists made their online pitches and then used social media to lobby votes for their ventures from the general public globally. Judged on the pitch’s sustainability, originality, social benefit, and scalability as well as votes garnered from the general public in a month-long social media voting phase which closed on 30 November 2017, Contrail Stores and A Remote Youth Venture impressed the judges to bag capital injection into their venture from Masiyiwa.
