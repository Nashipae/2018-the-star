Kisumu West constituency residents will benefit from a 200-bed capacity hospital in Holo. The construction of the Sh200 million hospital is almost completed.  It will see the residents easily access quality health services. The hospital sits on 15 acres that belong to the county government. The construction is done by Dawa Development Group Kenya.  Officials from Kisumu county government led by Deputy Governor Mathews Owili visited the site yesterday.  Dawa CEO Ishmael Haj said the hospital will be opened in five months. Haj said Holo Community Referral Hospital will help residents access better services.  He said they are expecting donors from the United Arab Emirates to visit next week.  “If they recommend any changes they will be implemented immediately so that we can start ferrying equipment,” Haj said.  Owili praised the organisation for coming up with the project. He added that the county is committed to ensuring the hospital will operate to full capacity.
