Health CS Cleopa Mailu’s ban on the importation, sale and use of shisha will remain in force, a judge ruled yesterday. Justice Roseline Aburili declined to issue orders suspending the ban, saying there is a “lesser risk” in having the government’s directive stay as it is. “Having considered arguments, I find the lesser risk at this stage is to decline to issue any orders, but I direct parties to argue the main petition before any substantial orders are given,” the judge said. Aburili’s ruling is a blow to shisha manufacturers and promoters, who had told the court their businesses were suffering losses following the ban on December 28. The judge said even though the applicants have an arguable case, it does not automatically mean they will be successful. She considered arguments from all parties and was not convinced lifting the ban at this stage would be in the interests of the public. The judge is of the view that should the court  hear the case and rule in favour of the applicants, it will not be impossible to return to the initial status. Aburili said if the businessmen win the case, their losses will be easily compensated. The judge said she considered affidavits filed by the CS and Director of Medical Services Dr Jackson Kioko in support of the ban. Mailu had told the court shisha was outlawed based on greater interests of protecting and enforcing public health from harmful effects and practices associated with its consumption. The  court was told the  water-piped tobacco is harmful not only to smokers, but non-smokers too. Shisha affects vital organs, including the brain and lungs and leads to the blockage of arteries. It can cause tuberculosis. Kioko said shisha contains many cancer-causing agents. He said other non-communicable diseases caused by shisha include cancer, high blood pressure, stroke, heart attack and asthma. “Statistics show shisha use causes  chronic health effects,” Mailu said.
