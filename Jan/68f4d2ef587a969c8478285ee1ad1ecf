Cherangany MP Joshua Kuttuny on Saturday called on the NCPB to pay Sh200 million it owes farmers in the North Rift to enable them prepare their farms this season and pay school fees. The legislator wondered why farmers who have been supplying their produce since November have not been paid and yet the Ministry of Agriculture had promised to pay them on delivery. NCPB managing director Newton Teter says the board has received 1.8 million bags of maize so far. The government is purchasing the commodity at Sh3,200 per bag. Kuttuny said farmers in the area owe various financial institutions more than Sh400 million. He called on the state to write off the debt to enable them to collect their title deeds which they had deposited as security. Â
