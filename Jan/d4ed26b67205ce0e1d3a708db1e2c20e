County governments are illegally allocating or leasing lands to individuals, the National Land Commission has said. Chairman Muhammad Swazuri yesterday said this will create problems for the people involved. He spoke at Fort Jesus in Mombasa when he visited the controversial site for construction of a Sh498 million sea wall project by the National Museums of Kenya. The wall will protect the historical monument from erosion by sea water. Swazuri raised the red flag over an upsurge of invasion of public and private land over the last seven years. This comes in the wake of a dispute over 60 acres in Nguu Tatu, Kisauni. Bandari Sacco says it bought the land from Hussein Dairy Farm in 2011 at a cost of Sh385 million. Squatters claim the land belongs to them.
