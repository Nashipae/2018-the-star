The Nakuru crash that claimed 38 lives on New Year's Eve sent NTSA bosses scrambling for a quick way to staunch rivers of blood. In their rush to end the slaughter, assuage public anger and create the impression they're on the job, they banned night bus transport. We've been down this road before. In December 2013, a night ban was imposed but rightly overturned by the courts. Darkness doesn't cause accidents, as the NTSA knows. Crashes are caused by incompetent, drunk, drowsy drivers and unsafe buses, matatus and other vehicles. Migaa crash survivors said their bus was veering from side to side at 3.30am as it hurtled downhill and smashed into the truck. In 2013 the NTSA required night permit for PSVs. Did the Migaa bus have one? NTSA and incorruptible traffic police can dramatically reduce accidents by ridding roads of bad drivers and deathtrap vehicles. The ban also punishes the wrong people, including petty traders and fish sellers who must transport perishables overnight.
