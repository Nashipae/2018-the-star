Just who will succeed Hassan Joho as Mombasa governor in 2022? This is the question on the minds of many residents.  Three people have already emerged as likely successors. They are Abdulswamad Nassir (Mvita MP), Ali Mbogo (Kisauni MP) and Mombasa county assembly speaker Harub Khatri — all Joho allies. Khatri’s involvement in youth activities is widely seen as his game plan to woo the youth, who make up the majority of voters. This is the same game plan that Joho used to create a cult-like following among the youth.  There has been speculation Joho is grooming the speaker to take over from him.  Nassir is focussing on education in his plans to gain the people’s trust. His target is teachers, parents and other sector players.  This is the same game plan used by Mbogo. As to who will carry the day, only time will tell.
