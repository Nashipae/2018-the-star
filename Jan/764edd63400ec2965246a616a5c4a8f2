Pokot residents in Tiaty subcounty, Baringo, have urged Education CS Fred Matiang’i to consult other leaders or quit. The region faces myriad problems, among them insecurity, a teacher shortage and hunger as schools re-open today. “We urge the government to address these issues. The CS should consult fellow leaders or leave the sector,” resident Yudah Losutan, a resident, said. He said candidates in Pokot failed in last year’s KCPE and KCSE exams.  Losutan was addressing a gathering on Saturday at Ng’inyang during celebration of a Pokot girl, Immelda Lochom, 19, who defied odds to score an A- in KCSE at Alliance Girls High School. Lochom’s father Musa Ewoi said he struggled to raise his daughter’s school fees of Sh137, 000 per year. He sold his camels, cattle and goats to pay her fees. Pokot elders Lopuwo Aturoit and Loruko Loliwale backed Losutan. They said some schools remain closed because of insecurity.
