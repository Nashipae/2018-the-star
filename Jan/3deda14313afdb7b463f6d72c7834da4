The High Court has directed the National Bank of Kenya and a grains supply company to negotiate outside court with a view to resolve a Sh245 million dispute. Tulla Reserve Supplies obtained a loan from the bank but a dispute arose after the parties failed to agree on terms of payment. Yesterday when the matter came for hearing, Tulla Reserve Supplies applied to have the bank refund a surety it had deposited with the bank to enable it dispose it so that it can repay the loan. Justice Francis Tuiyot declined to rule on the matter but told the company and the bank to talk and see how to come up with a solution. The company through lawyer Tom Ojienda filed an application saying in a letter dated November 20,2014, National Bank offered working capital under its Islamic products christened Investment Musharaka a loan of Sh245 million which was approved, but he only got Sh145million. Tulla Reserve Supplies Limited has accused National Bank of changing the terms of a Sh145 million loan it took, a move the grains supplier says has led to loss of business worth Sh3.7 billion. Last year, Tulla asked court to shut down the lenderâ€™s Islamic banking wing while demanding compensation over the loan dispute. The firm claims National Bank illegally changed the facility from a fixed term loan to a revolving Musharaka loan, effectively raising the interest rate from 18.5 per cent to an Islamic profit-sharing equivalent of 19.5 per cent. Under the revolving Musharaka loan, terms of Islamic banking are revised but the borrower and the lender open a joint account in which all business proceeds are deposited before each party is paid.
