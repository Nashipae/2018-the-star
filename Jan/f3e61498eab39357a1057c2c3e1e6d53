Janet Mbugua is among the most dedicated media personalities in the
country, credited for her role in so many programmes and initiatives. Well, she's not about to stop anytime soon. She is now raising awareness to end child marriage, which persists despite being illegal. She
took to social media to share with her fans how the campaign has been,
thanking everyone who played a part in making the message known. "I
am glad and honoured to be part of a campaign that is fighting to end
violence against children by raising awareness around the critical issue
of child marriage in Kenya. This campaign has received overwhelming
support and I am thankful to everyone who joined in the conversation and
shared the campaign launch video which has garnered nearly a million
views! This is not the end of the #ENDChildMarriageKE campaign. Together
with UNICEF and our partners, we will continue to raise awareness."
