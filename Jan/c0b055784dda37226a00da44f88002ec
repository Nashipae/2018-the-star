The reports were made through a 24-hour hotline service number 1195. It is managed by Healthcare Assistance Kenya and the Gender Affairs ministry. Kariuki said the increased cases are alarming and this demonstrates that GBV remains one of the most pervasive human rights violations in Kenya. “I’m greatly concerned by the increased reports of numerous cases of gender-based violence across the country, including early child marriage, domestic violence and sexual violence,” she said. “Of particular concern are the recent allegations of sexual violence at the Kenyatta National Hospital.” Read: Say NO to Gender-Based Violence: 16 days of Activism against GBV The CS urged Kenyans to be patient as the country awaits the outcome of the investigations initiated by the DCI on the KNH rape claims. “I understand their concerns and urge for patience as we await the outcome of the investigations.
