Bungoma Roads executive Collins Mukhongo yesterday urged social media users to use the platforms for socioeconomic development. He said many WhatsApp groups operated by residents have been turned into avenues for negative politics. Mukhongo said administrators of those groups focus on maligning leaders. ‘I want to challenge these WhatsApp groups like Webuye Yetu, the County Flash, Newsroom, the Noticeboard and the Bukembe East Development Forum to register and apply for jobs, contracts and tenders from the county government,” he said. “You wake up in the morning to find over 800 chat messages and when you go through them, you find only ‘Oooh Jubilee and NASA supporters have been abusing each other, oooh [former Governor Kenneth] Lusaka and [current county boss Wycliffe] Wangamati’s (pictured) supporters have been tearing each other’, instead of discussing development-oriented issues.” Mukhongo wants the groups to support the county government of Bungoma so it can serve wananachi better, instead of engaging in constant criticisms. He also warned them against spreading hate messages and inciting residents. “We, as a county, have made it clear that most of the county tenders and contracts will be done by residents. We want you to change from daily politicking to make this social media groups development-oriented,” Mukhongo said, adding it only takes four days and Sh1,000 to register a business name that can be used to get tenders.
