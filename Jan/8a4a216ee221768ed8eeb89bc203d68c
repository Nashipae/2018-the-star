Uasin Gishu governor Jackson Mandago has warned that those found vandalising street lights willface the full force of the law. Mandago noted  said lighting up of the streets would enable traders to conduct their business without fear of being attacked. "I am sternly warning individuals with such behaviour that their days are numbered. I cannot allow someone to destroy street lights on which we spent million of shillings," he said in Eldoret town on Wednesday. "I have received information that security lights in Langas have been destroyed by unknown people. I urge residents to report such individuals ... I promise to take stern action against them." Mandago noted the lights have helped reduced the county's crime rate by 80 per cent. He announced that the county will install street lights in estates and slums, clear drainage and sewer systems and upgrade hawkers’ markets The slums to be upgraded are Munyaka, Huruma, Mwanzo, Shauri Yako, Langas and Kisumu Ndogo.
