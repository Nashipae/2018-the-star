Malava MP Moses Malulu has declined a Sh2 million award after the Kitale High court accepted the withdrawal of a petition challenging his election. Justice Janet Mulwa awarded Malulu the Sh2 million as cost of the petition. Malulu declined the award, saying he wanted to focus on uniting his constituents after a divisive election. Malulu’s victory was challenged by voter Gilphine Omwenga. Omwenga had on November 12, last year, applied to withdraw the petition, saying he could not sustain it. He cited the courts decision to expunge witnesses’ affidavits, saying it left the petition with no evidence. Mulwa also awarded Sh2 million to the IEBC. The costs were to be paid by the petitioner. “I have considered the application by the petitioner to withdraw the petition. The elections rules have been complied with and I’m satisfied that the petitioner has followed the process of withdrawing her petition,” Mulwa said. Mulwa also directed that the Speaker of the National Assembly be served with a certificate of determination of the petition. Malulu was elected on a Jubilee Party ticket. In her petition, Omwenga had cited massive irregularities and illegalities in forms 35A and 35B. He also said there were votes from unrecognised polling stations. Malulu becomes the second Jubilee MP from western Kenya to survive a petition after that challenging the election Mumias East’s Ben Washiali was struck out. Washiali’s election had been challenged by ANC’s David Wamatsi.
