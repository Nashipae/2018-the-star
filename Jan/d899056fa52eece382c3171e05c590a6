Garissa Governor Ali Korane (pictured) has assured residents he will not leave unpaid debts after his term is over. Former Governor Nathif Jama’s administration has been accused of leaving behind a huge debt of Sh4.3 billion owed to contractors and other service providers. In most cases, it led to friction between the executive and the contractors. Speaking to the press in his office on Friday, Korane said the county will only implement projects that have a budgetary provision. “During my term, I don’t intend to leave unpaid bills. The projects will be advertised, a contractor given the job and paid,” he said Korane said the county will not recommend a project that has no budgetary allocation. “The report on the bills the county owes is shocking. I will read the report and certainly we will subject them to an audit,” he said. Korane said he has not read the report detailing the debt “because of its gravity”. Meanwhile, Korane has said that subcounty administrators will also coordinate and chair development committee’s projects within their areas of jurisdiction. The committee will also include area MP, MCAs and other stakeholders from the community. This, he said, will enable residents to take part in decision-making on development. Korane said he will from next month start touring all the six subcounties to know some of the challenges that need to be tackled immediately. He said the tours will also help residents know the county staff and officials heading different dockets.
