The election of Mwingi North MP Paul Nzengu was upheld yesterday by the election petitions court in Kitui. Nzengu's predecessor, John Munuve of Jubilee Party, had challenged his win, but High Court judge Lilian Mutende dismissed the petition with cost. Munuve filed a petition through lawyer Eric Mutua after he was beaten in the August 8 election by Nzengu. Nzengu garnered 23,583 votes against Munuve's 15,915 votes. Mutende noted that the big margin between the votes represented the will of the people of Mwingi North, and even if there could have been a few administrative errors on the part of election officials, that could not have altered the final result. The judge further dismissed allegations of massive irregularities, violence and intimidation of voters, saying the evidence could not be corroborated by the petition side. She noted that most of the allegations made by the petition were speculative and not backed by facts. The judge specifically said no evidence was provided to show that Nzengu had imported maize and used it to bribe voters after it was allegedly treated by a sorcerer called Matei Musili. She also said there was no evidence that Nzengu bribed a voter on polling day at the Gai polling station. Both Munuve and Nzengu were in court during the judgement, as well as Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua and Kaiti MP Joshua Kimilu. Mutua was not present but lawyer Cephar Musyoki held brief for him. Mutende further said there was no evidence on the election day the Wiper democratic party leader Kalonzo Musyoka campaigned at Tseikuru Primary school where he voted asking voters to vote for Nzengu, who was his parties candidate. She said a witness contradicted himself. She also said contrary to claims by petitioner that Nzengu had a family cartel that officiated at the August 8 election and influenced the result in his favour, there was no proof.
