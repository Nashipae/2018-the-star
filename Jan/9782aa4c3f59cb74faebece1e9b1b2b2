Jubilee leaders in Kitui have stated they are supporting the late Francis Nyenze's wife Edith as an individual and not because she is in Wiper. County chairman Caxton Munyoki said this after the news of Jubilee Party supporting Nyenze's wife sparked questions among residents. Many wanted to know if Wiper party has joined Jubilee or vice-versa. Others claimed Edith used to support Jubilee but hid in Wiper. Other quarters claimed that the ruling party is planning to recruit Nyenze's wife once she wins the March 26 by-election. Caxton told the press on Monday that Edith's situation is 'one of the peculiar things in politics where a party can support a member of another party fully." "Jubilee did not produce a candidate to contest the by-election simply because we saw and felt how Nyenze used to support and criticise the government." "Nyenze was a true citizen who could appreciate government's projects and criticise where necessary. That's what we want in Kenya," Munyoki said. "Voters must know that once a certain politician is in the opposition, he or she can't raise a positive or negative issue about another party." The politician thanked Maluki Kitili for conceding defeat to Edith in the primaries, adding that he is hopeful the Wiper candidate will win the race. He discouraged NASA leader Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka from proceeding with the January 30 oath. "Raila should not lie to citizens that there could be another president yet there is already one in power."
