The Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital management plans to bury nine unclaimed bodies in a mass grave at a public cemetery in Uasin Gishu county by the end of this week. The bodies, including that of a child and a woman from the Turkana community, have been at the hospital’s mortuary since October last year. MTRH Farewell Home Services administrator Tony Kirwa said most of the bodies were taken to the morgue from accident and crime scenes by the police. “We issued a 21-day notice to those with missing relatives to come and check before we take the next step,” he said. Four of the bodies were found dumped in the Sosian River along the Eldoret-Kapsabet highway. Kirwa said they have sought a court order to allow them to inter the bodies as they are incurring huge bills.
