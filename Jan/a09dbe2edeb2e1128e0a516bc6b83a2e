The Kisii government will carry out a head count this month to weed out ghost workers on the payroll, Governor James Ongwae has said. “I suspect we have officers who are not working,” he said during his New Year address at Nyakoe Hotel. He directed county secretary Patrick Lumumba, Administration executive Walter Okibo and chief officer Geoffrey Mogire to revamp the Public Service by March. “Let me tell the new County Secretary, the CEC Administration and the Chief Officer Administration that your main task is to restore discipline. We have officers in various departments who do not work,” Ongwae said. He was accompanied by Deputy Governor Joash Maangi and speaker David Kombo. Ongwae said action will be taken against indisciplined workers. “Don’t run to me, do your job,” he warned.The governor said restructuring, meant to improve teamwork and accountability, has been finalised.  He urged staff to focus on service delivery.
