A man has killed himself in Witeithie, Juja, and cursed his wife in a suicide note for allegedly abandoning him while he was ailing. John Mwatiati, 27, is the sixth person to die in domestic-related wrangles in two days in the ward. “Nimesema asante sana, kwa vile umeweza kuniacha nikiwa mgonjwa. Lakini ujue hakuna siku hata moja utawahi kuwa bibi wa mwanaume mwingine kwa maisha yako yote mbele na hata ya nyuma ya mimi (Thank you for abandoning me when I was sick. But you will never be any other man’s wife in all your life, beside me),” reads the note (pictured). Mwatiati told the mother of his two children she would die by hanging, just as he did. “Although you told me that your mother bewitched your father, you will not survive my curse. Just wait for me to be buried  and you will see what will befall you. No amount of prayers or deliverance will save you,” the decease states. The couple’s relationship soured when Mwatiati lost his job at a liquor factory in Thika two years ago. He started doing odd jobs to supplement his wife’s salon income, but fell sick shortly after. Mwatiati’s elder brother Simon Ndirangu, who’s been taking care of him, said the woman sneaked out of their home on Monday and took the children with her.
