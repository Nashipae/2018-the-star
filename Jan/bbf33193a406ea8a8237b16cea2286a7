The Homa Bay government has sacked more than 650 casual workers to cut the huge wage bill, Governor Cyprian Awiti (pictured) says. He said the county staff list was bloated and had to be streamlined for his administration to achieve its development pledges. Speaking to journalists in his Homa Bay town office on Tuesday, Awiti said his government has high recurrent expenditure. “We cannot be deterred from realising the development agenda we have for residents just because people want to earn salaries and wages,” he said. Awiti said the county Public Service Board has will conduct a staff audit and reorganise jobs. Staff who underperform will be laid off. “We are not stopping with casual workers. After the audit, we want to ensure even the lazy staff members are laid off,” Awiti said.
