President Uhuru Kenyatta stuck his neck out during the General Election campaign and stated he was absolutely opposed to Members of Parliament getting higher pay and allowances. He spoke in the wake of the then Sarah Serem-led Salaries and Remuneration Commission reducing their pay and getting rid of their allowances. Delivering the State of the Nation Address in Parliament on March 15, President Uhuru turned to the runaway wage bill and said he appreciates that the silent fear of every politician is ending their career in politics broke and destitute. He reminded them that the calling of leadership is to serve. Not to become rich through serving. But the President’s silence in the post-Serem era is being misinterpreted. Uhuru should speak out again and restate his views with the same forthrightness and conviction so as to remind the ruling Jubilee Party of his firm stand on the matter. JP legislators have a hold on the Parliamentary Service Commission, which has a major say on MPs and senators’ pay and allowances. The only person who can do anything about the prevailing situation is President Uhuru. He should restate his opposition to a higher wage bill and stick to his guns.
