The county government this week is carrying on with the crackdown on entertainment joints selling banned shisha. The government in December banned the importation, sale and smoking of shisha, citing health risks. Head of Nairobi Tobacco Control Unit Anthony Muthemba yesterday said the ban is still on and this week a crackdown will be conducted on entertainment joints. “We started with enforcement and last week we carried out a major crackdown in clubs along Ngong Road, including Ornyx, Space Lounge and B-club,” he said. “Directors of the establishments were seized during the raid and patrons were ordered to leave immediately.” Muthemba said other raids were carried out within the CBD and many owners have complied with the shisha sale ban. However, there have been several challenges encountered by the county government during the crackdowns. “One of the challenges we encounter is that some of the clubs have ceased selling shisha flavours, but still have the bongs on display,” Muthemba said. “It makes it quite hard since you cannot tell whether they will sell shisha or not.”
