Brokers "selling government jobs" are responsible for the delay by President Uhuru Kenyatta to fully name the Cabinet, Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli has said. Atwoli asked Uhuru to complete the naming of Cabinet nominees, saying the delay was causing anxiety. Speaking at a funeral in Kakamega on Saturday, Atwoli said brokers were selling top state jobs to politicians who lost in last year's General Election. “Uhuru should not exhibit his weakness. How can it take the President more than three to four weeks to come up with a Cabinet? It is a worrying state of affairs for a man who says he was overwhelmingly voted into office,” Atwoli said.  Atwoli said Western politicians who lost in last year's elections were selling property to bargain for state jobs. On January 5, Uhuru named three new faces to join his Cabinet. He also announced that six current CSs would be retained. The move has since triggered debate on the fate of the remaining 14 CSs. It is not clear whether they have been fired or not. State House Spokesman Manoah Esipisu said the CSs will remain in office as the President continues to reconstitute his Cabinet. Meanwhile, Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala has said asked all NASA leaders to sign an affidavit he has sworn committing to rally their trouped behind the coalition leader Raila Odinga. Speaking in Kakamega town yesterday, Malala said that some NASA leaders were dinning with the state at night to frustrate NASA efforts to swear in Raila and his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) as the people’s president and deputy respectively. “Some NASA leaders are seemingly not willing to sign my affidavit but it is coming and they must sign so that we can be able to separate chaff from wheat,”
