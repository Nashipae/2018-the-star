Lawyer Apollo Mboya wants Kenya Power CEO Ken Tarus and Energy Regulatory Commission director general Robert Pavel Oimeke summoned for contempt. Mboya, in his application to the High Court, says the two failed to comply with a court order, which required them to stop billing electricity consumers with inflated backdated electricity charges to recover Sh10.1 billion contained in their annual report and financial statements for 2016-17. Kenya Power on January 23 billed him Sh2,319.43, despite the bill showing zero power consumption based on the previous and current meter reading. “The KPLC admits in the said electricity bill that there has been zero consumption of electricity from the previous and the current meter reading,” he said. “Unless the prayers in this application are granted, the respondents will continue acting in contempt of this court to the detriment of its customers.” Earlier this month, Mboya, a former Law Society of Kenya CEO, and the Electricity Consumer Society of Kenya sued Kenya Powerfor  inflated bills amounting to Sh8.1 billion for the months of November and December last year. The figure was initially Sh10.1 billion, but the government recovered Sh2 billion. Mboya and the ECSK want the court to declare that Kenya Power made a false and misleading representation, and violated consumer rights. They also want the court to stop the firm from sending its consumers backdated bills.
