At least 150 members of the amusement and gaming association in Kericho county yesterday urged Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i to lift the ban on gaming machines. The Kericho Gaming Association officials said they had adhered to rules and regulations and at no time had they allowed underage children or college going students to participate in betting. Speaking to journalists in Kericho town chairman Justus Yego said the ban caught them flat-footed. Members said the ban on gaming had put them in an awkward position since most of them had already acquired bank loans to finance their business. Secretary Kenndey Cheruiyoit said besides creating employment the association had ensured no students were allowed into any gaming premises.
