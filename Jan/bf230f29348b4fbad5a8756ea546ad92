Ikolomani MP Bernard Shinali and his Kwhisero counterpart Christopher Aseka have criticised Parliament House committees leadership. “We don’t have any committee chairperson in the National Assembly or the Senate who is a Luhya. We feel we were discriminated in the appointments,” Shinali said. He was elected on the ruling Jubilee Party but is opposed to how some MPs allegedly forced themselves into leading the House committees. Some members of Jubilee were told to step down. The party leadership said those slots were meant for other members to achieve regional balance. However, reports indicate they were stripped of the posts since they are tagged ‘rebel MPs’. The MPs are Alfred Keter (Labour and Social Welfare), Silas Tiren (Agriculture), David Bowen (Environment and Natural Resources) and James Gakuya (Broadcasting and Library Committee). The Ikolomani lawmaker said both Jubilee and NASA shortchanged politicians from the community in awarding the parliamentary posts. The two MPs also criticised the nominations to the East African Legislative Assembly. Shinali said the community was not allocated any among the nine members approved to serve at EALA.
