One person was killed by a hippo in Lake Naivasha and two others seriously injured in different incidents at the weekend. Two of the incidents occurred at Kasarani beach, where a man was killed. The last attack was reported in Oserian. The attack came barely a week after residents expressed concern over closure of wildlife corridors around the lake, leading to increased human-wildlife conflict. In the first case, a man was attacked by hippo in Kasarani and crushed to death as his colleagues watched in horror. Lake Naivasha Boat Ownersâ€™ Association chairman David Kilo said the man was laying nets near the shores of the lake when the animal attacked. Hours later, another fisherman in the same area was attacked by another hippo. He was left with broken limbs. Kilo said in the past few weeks, residents have been encroaching on wildlife territories, leading to attacks. Kilo added that the last attack was reported in Oserian, where another fisherman was attacked and his legs broken. The men suffered serious injuries and have been admitted in Naivasha Subcounty Hospital.
