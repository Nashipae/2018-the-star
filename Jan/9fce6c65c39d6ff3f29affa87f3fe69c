A herder in Qorehey village, Madogo subcounty Tana river county lost his entire herd within one hour due to a mysterious disease. According Farah Moulid, 70, his cows were grazing in a field when they started behaving strangely. Within 30 minutes they started falling one, after the other, with fluid oozing from the nose and mouth. It was not immediately clear what caused the deaths Abdi Moulid, his son, said the animals ate some greenish vegetation while grazing. “I had taken the cows to the river to graze but barely 10 minutes later they started becoming restless,” Abdi said. Moulid said he lost more than Sh1 million because the cattle were his only source of income. A veterinary officer took samples from the animals and of the vegetation for testing. He declined comment.
