Kwale Matatu Owners Association has warned drivers against scaring passengers that fares will rise next month. Chairman Joseph Mutunga said the notice that fares will be hiked is fake and is meant to tarnish their business. Speaking to the Star yesterday, the businessman said there have set procedures which the association follows before hiking transport cost which takes more than a week’s notice. He warned serious action will be taken against those spreading false information. “Fuel prices have increased, but that should not be the reason to increase fare,” he said. Mutunga said fuel has increased by only Sh2, and it might go down in a month since the price flatuates. “If we hike fare because fuel price has increased, then what shall we do when it goes down? It’s normal for businesses to make losses sometimes, we cannot punish our customers,” he said.
