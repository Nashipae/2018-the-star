Harambee Stars and Kariobangi Sharks striker Masoud Juma has signed with Cape Town City at an undisclosed fee. The club confirmed the acquisition via Twitter saying he will get his work permit and fly to South Africa on January 8. "He will meet his new teammates and begin preparing for CTCFC's domestic and CAF campaigns." Juma scored 17 league goals for Sharks in the 2017 season and Albanian FK Skenderbeu had also been eying him, according to goal.com. Cape Town City said is was "delighted" at the acquisition of the 21-year-old who was African top goalscorer of the year. “The undisclosed transfer fee, was accepted by Juma's club Kariobangi Sharks ahead of bids from Europe, Egypt, and South Africa - and the club is thrilled that Juma in the end decided to join Cape Town City,"  the club said. “At just 21, Juma has proven to be Africa's most prolific goal scorer. His quality is evident as is the interest for him in Europe. He is still young and needs to be nurtured [so he] adapts and settles. He has all the makings of a lethal out and out nine.” Juma's new coach Benni McCarthy noted they have had to rely on possessional dominance to win games and that midfielders scored most of their goals. "We're building a team for the future so it's nice to start putting together a group of young promising strikers who can score goals for the club going forward," he said. The footballer hit the headlines when he downplayed chances of moving to either Gor Mahia or AFC Leopards. Click here for the latest political stories
