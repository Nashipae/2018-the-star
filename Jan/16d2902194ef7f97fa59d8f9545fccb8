Ngilu and MCAs have agreed to work together to foster development and economic prosperity. They held a Kamkunji on Monday led by Ngilu and speaker George Ndotto, and forged a common front in the implementation of projects. Ndotto pledged the legislature's support in the implementation of
the multimillion-shilling community level infrastructure development
programme. The MCAs also promised to support distribution of bursaries and drought mitigation
plans. “You must remember we are
the servants of the people and not the other way round,” Ndotto, who was the
moderator, said. The meeting was at the Kitui Agricultural Training Centre. Ngilu urged the MCAs to pass the 2018-19 budget in good time before the June 30 deadline. “We all need to
move with speed since the annual budget does not wait,” she said. Ndotto said MCAs will play a pivotal role in the full enforcement of the ban on charcoal production and sand harvesting. Ngilu said her
administration will reconsider the criteria for allocation of
development funds, saying the increase of funds to  marginalised
areas in the Clidp is on the cards. “You are all aware we are facing hunger and starvation as a county and
we need to do something for our people” she said.
