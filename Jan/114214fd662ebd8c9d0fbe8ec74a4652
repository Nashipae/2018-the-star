Team GAA-Huruma’s Joseph Mbugi, who turns out for Kenya Premier League side Posta Rangers has vowed to help steer his team past an equally star-studded South ‘B’ side when the two clash in the final of the annual Kothbiro tournament this weekend. Mbugi converted one of the spot kicks en-route Huruma’s victory in semis and touted their underdog status as a motivating factor going into Sunday’s final. “Very few people expected us to reach the final of this competition due to the quality of opponents from the group stages to the knockout level but we have done well so far and we will have to complete the job against South B,” said the midfielder. The finals have been dominated by A1000 Street, Pumwani and Opitos in the past seven years. Beirut will take on Fifa Best in the third-place play-off on Saturday starting 3pm while the final is slated for Sunday 2pm. Both matches will be played at the historical Ziwani Sports grounds. The winner will walk away with Sh300,000 while first and second runner-up will pocket Sh100,000 and Sh75,000 respectively. Fourth-placed team will get Sh50,000 courtesy of tournament sponsors, SportPesa. Pamojah Movement has provided the large tournament trophy while former Kenya One Arnold Origi has proved a pair of gloves and Sh10,000 for the best goalkeeper. In the semis South ‘B’ came from two goals down to edge out Ziwani’s Beirut 3-2. In the second sem, Team GAA-Huruma fought tooth and nail against the might of Fifa Best in a tactful and physical match that ended in a goal-less draw before the former prevailed in penalty kicks. Musa Masika, who is in contention for the tournament’s MVP scored for Fifa Best while Francis Alumba, Wesley Onguso and Philip Okayo missed their kicks. Team GAA converted their spot-kicks through Asembeka Amos, Alfred Mburu and Joseph Mbugi while John Mwangi’s was saved.
