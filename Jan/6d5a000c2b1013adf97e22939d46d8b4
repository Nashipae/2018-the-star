Bafana Bafana defied all odds to win the annual Charles Oppong Buchere tournament for the second time after seeing off Khwisero All Stars 6-5 on post-match penalties in the finals of the fifth edition. The teams had played to a goalless draw in a nervy atmosphere at Emulunya Primary School grounds in Kakamega County with both sides threatening to cause trouble. The tournament’s new entrants Khwisero All Stars will live to fight another day after coming close to lifting the trophy by a whisker after they squandered a number of goal scoring opportunities including a penalty that was skyrocketed by the tournament’s top scorer Isaiah Nandwa. With both teams failing to find the back of the net in normal time, it set up for a tense post match penalty shoot outs leaving the teams to rely on either their goalkeeper’s shot stopping prowess or the infield players’ ability to beat the keeper from six yards. Livingstone Ofuyo, Phillip Amakobe, Japhet Gatei, Newton Maina, Conelly Yalwala and Boniface Okulo scored for Bafana Bafana while Morgan Ambuka, Shadrack Inyangala, Sheldon Moi and Podoski Litunya converted for Khwishero. Bafana Bafana, who also won the second edition of the tournament and emerged third in the fourth edition, now becomes the first team to lift the tournament’s trophy twice since it was started five years ago. Meanwhile Olympia FC beat Emulunya Chelsea 5-4 in post-match penalties to take the third position of the competitive annual tournament sponsored by the Buchere’s family to commemorate their late brother Charles Derick Buchere, who was a talented footballer. Simon Denno of Emuruba FC won the best keeper’s award with Kisa All Stars’ Vincent Murula winning the best defender’s gong. Dan Okore of Wazee emerged the best midfielder while Francis Atwoli of Misango Red Stars was the Most Valuable Player.
