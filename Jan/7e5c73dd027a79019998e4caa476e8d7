National and extra-county schools’ principals transferred in December should return to their previous stations, Lugari MP Ayub Savula said yesterday. He added that the transfers ought to be conducted gradually and in consultation with the involved parties. Savula said Education CS Fred Matiang’i is running the ministry like the military. “Education is critical for the country’s future and requires adequate consultation before making decisions,” Savula said on the phone. The lawmaker said the mass transfers will disrupt learning and lead to poor results in the exams. The mass transfer of more than 500 principals by the Teachers’ Service Commission in December caused an uproar from teachers, students and politicians.
