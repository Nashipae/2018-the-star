He said they have traversed the country starting from Western, Coast and now Eastern and the mood of the people was that they have refused to accept and move on. “One person told me if you want to make a Kenyan happy then talk of secession or swearing in Raila. That tells you that there is a problem with our country and we need to solve it once and for all,” Raila said. He added that they had the August 8 election results from all the polling stations and were confident they won the election. The NASA leader asked Kamba politicians to be slow on Kalonzo’s 2022 bid. “I have heard my good friend [Makeni Governor] Kivutha Kibwana talk of 2022, but I want to tell him we already have some unfinished business from 2017. Someone has run away with our meat. Let’s first get that before we talk of 2022,” Raila said. Kalonzo said President Uhuru Kenyatta will be to blame if the violence breaks out. He allayed fears that they are likely to flee the country after being sworn in. Wetang’ula said they are not bound by opportunistic reasons, but because of the common interest to protect Kenyans.
