Any further attempts to subvert democracy and the rule of law, in particular the use of state violence, will leave Western with no further recourse but to pursue self-determination. This was decided by the People's Assembly on Sunday. “We resolve to participate and fully support the People’s Assembly process until we restore democracy or go our separate ways," the resolution reads. "We state in no uncertain terms that we shall not accept the institutionalisation of sham elections in Kenya. There will be no business as usual until a democratically elected President assumes office.” The assembly was launched at the Golf Hotel, Kakamega, by NASA leader Raila Odinga. The event was attended by NASA co-principals Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Moses Wetang’ula (Ford Kenya). NASA has announced it will swear in Raila and Kalonzo as the Peoples’ President and Deputy President on January 30. Raila said he and Musyoka are not afraid of being sworn in and dared the government to arrest them.
