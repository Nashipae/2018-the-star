Tanzanian rapper Shetta, born Nurdin Bilal Ali, is in Kenya promoting his love ballad with Otile Brown, Tamu Sana. It is a song he says was inspired by love, adding that he's tired of loneliness. Shetta, 26, is seriously looking for a Kenyan spouse. "Hata niko Kenya natafuta bibi wa Kikenya sasa hivi. I want a beautiful girl. I love girls a lot. Sasa hivi natafuta mtu nitulie naye, coz I used to go around and mess. Nataka mwanamke Kenya, that's it." He added: "But niko na girlfriend pia Tanzania. I'm a Muslim, nataka nikija Kenya niwe pia na bibi. Mimi ni mwanaume." So what kind of woman is he looking for? "I love classy ladies, sipendi wanawake fake. Most women love money, I can handle all that coz I have the money. Nahitaji mwanamke yule ambaye hawezikuenda nje, awe mwanamke anaweza kuchill. "I've gotten a lot of DMs from Kenyan ladies. I'm not the kind of man that messes around. I can marry five to six women. Nataka msichana ambaye ametulia." However, baba Kaylla, as many would call him, is is a proud father "I'm very proud of my daughter. She's famous in East Africa, a lot of people like her. I'm very proud to be her father. I dreamt to be a father. I got Kaylla when I was 21 years. She's very beautiful and I'm happy." Shetta has been in stardom for eight years now, and is set to release a couple of international collaborations this year.
