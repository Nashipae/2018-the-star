Kenya Premier League side Bandari FC yesterday suffered a major blow after the demise of their team manager Alfred ‘Obwaka’ Achayo. Obwaka, 43, died on his way to hospital after collapsing at his Majengo home shortly after 1am Thursday. Doctors suspect he had a heart attack. The Bandari FC board, technical staff and players yesterday flocked his Majengo home to console his young family including widow Damaris Omega and three children Kate Achieng, 8, Risper Owenga, 5, and Sylvia Achayo, 2. Bandari FC vice chair Musa Hassan said the board will cater for the funeral arrangements and assured Obwaka’s widow Omega of full support. “All we have to say is Alhamdullilahi". Obwaka was yours but he was also ours. We will take care of everything until we lay him to rest. We will also ensure you and your children are well taken care of,” said Hassan when the board visited Omega at their Majengo home. Much of Bandari FC’s success in recent years is down to Obwaka’s management, according to players and technical staff who talked to the Star. A former player himself, Obwaka took over as the Bandari FC team manager in 2015 and guided the Mombasa-based team back to the KPL after a lone sojourn in the National Super League in 2014. He helped guide the dockers to the GOtv Shield success in 2015 before beating current KPL champions Gor Mahia to lift the Super Cup at the start of the 2016 season. He also helped Bandari lift the Kenya Communications Sports Organization (Kecoso) title in 2016 and 2017. In his heyday, Obwaka turned up for Coast Stars, Congo Boys and Bandari FC in Mombasa. He also featured for the defunct Lake Warriors in the 90s before helping Coast Stars reach the finals of the Moi Golden Cup against Mumias Sugar at Kasarani in 1999.
