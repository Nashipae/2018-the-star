The newly appointed Chief Administrative Secretaries will not be vetted. The Constitution states the President nominates and, with the approval of the National Assembly, appoints Cabinet Secretaries. On Friday last week, Uhuru unveiled his new Cabinet which had several entrants of election losers, and women. The President also created the new position of Chief Administrative Secretary. A letter to National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi from President Uhuru Kenyatta through Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua only showed names of CSs, PSs and Ambassadors. Missing from the list was the name of Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju, who was nominated to Cabinet without a distinct portfolio. “The President has directed me to request you, on his behalf, to submit the names to the National Assembly for approval,” read the letter copied to Majority leader Aden Duale. Kinyua said the nominees’ CVs and other testimonials will be forwarded to the Speaker today. Muturi said the process will start after the names of the nominees are published in local newspapers. Vetting will be conducted by the Committee on Appointments, chaired by Muturi. “The names have to be published in the newspapers for seven days after which the vetting will begin,” the Speaker said. Uhuru said, “The Chief Administrative Secretary will be responsible for helping the CS coordinate running of affairs in respective ministries.” Some of the changes unveiled include Amina Mohamed’s appointment as Education CS.
