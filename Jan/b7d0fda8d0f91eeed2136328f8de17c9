Tanzanian singer Rich Mavoko was in town last weekend and brought Nairobi to a standstill on New Year's Eve at the Safari Park hotel. Talking exclusively to Word Is, the Show Me hitmaker touched on scandals that have followed artistes under the WCB label, including his boss Diamond Platnumz's baby mama drama. Even though hesitant, he said, "Sidhani scandals za WCB zinaweza ni-affect. Sio scandal za WCB tu, mimi nadhani scandal yoyote haiwezi muadhiri mtu mwingine wakati yeye hayupo. Kwa hiyo itatokea, itaenda, itaisha. Yaani fans ni mtu wa kusahau. Anaposahau, anataka kusikiza mziki wake. Sijawahi kufikiria kitu kama hicho." He then revealed why he's distanced himself from scandals. "Ni lifestyle kuchagua kutokua kwa scandal. Kwa hiyo hata nikichagua kuwa na scandal naweza tu." So is he dating? "Mimi niko na watoto wangu wawili, siwezi nikawaonyesha mpenzi wangu. Wa kwanza ana mama yake, wa pili ana mama yake, sio kitu nimependa, imetokea tu." In a past video, he used actress Elizabeth Lulu Micheal as a vixen, a girl who was sentenced to two years in jail last month for the murder of Stephen Kanumba.  Mavoko expressed his disappointment: "Si kitu kizuri na wasaanii wengi tuliungana kumtetea yeye, kesho inaweza kuwa mtu mwingine. Jela sio sehemu nzuri. Tumeumia sana kwa swababu unaona ni kati ya wasanii wa kuigiza ambao ni wazuri sana. She is young, she's not even 30, ukienda kule unaona umeenda kupoteza mda. Kuna mipango mingi ambayo itaenda mrama, alikua amepata ubalozi wa sinema zetu Tanzania. Ilikua a very sad moment." The singer is said to be releasing his album early next year following a collabo with our very own Nyashinski "I’m planning to do a collabo with Nyashinski, he’s one of my best artistes from Kenya.The music industry is different, I can’t judge the music here but from what I know, Tanzanians listen to a lot of Sauti Sol, Bahati, Willy Paul, Nyashinski and even Mercy Masika."
