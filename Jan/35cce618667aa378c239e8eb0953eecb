The 13 Cabinet Secretaries whose names did not feature in the changes announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday will remain in office until further notice. State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu said: "Cabinet Secretaries currently in office remain so, as instructed in a memorandum from the Head of Public Service in December 2017, until otherwise advised." In a statement on Saturday, Esipisu said Uhuru began the task of reorganising his administration noting that the process is yet to be complete. "In the coming days, Uhuru will complete the task of assembling the team to serve in his second term of office," he said. Esipisu said the president's appointments will be guided by merit, integrity, commitment to service, and in terms of the Constitution. The President dropped 13 men and women who propped his first Cabinet.  In his announcement, Uhuru retained only six Cabinet Secretaries and nominated three fresh faces. Former Turkana Senator John Munyes, ex-Marsabit governor Ukur Yatani, and former DPP Keriako Tobiko are the fresh faces the president unveiled, sparking anxiety on the fate of those who were not retained. Most reports indicated that they have been sacked, claims that Uhuru's administration refuted. The three were nominated but the portfolios they will man are yet to be revealed. They will be subject to vetting and approval by Parliament.
