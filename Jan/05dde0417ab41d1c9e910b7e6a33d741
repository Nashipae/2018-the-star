Kilifi South MP Ken Chonga has warned investors against mistreating their employees. Speaking at Makio Hall in Kanamai on Sunday, Chonga said most employees in the Export Processing Zones were working under very poor conditions. Chonga said he will make impromptu visits to all the industries in the constituency to assess the situation.He said most workers had complained to him about low and delayed pay. “Most of these industries flout the labour laws. I’m working closely with MCAs about the situation. We also want to know whether the workers are remunerated according to the law,” Chonga said. “Some workers are not provided with protective gear, yet they work under very harsh conditions. We understand the company’s provide the gear when they know somebody is going there for inspection.” Mtepeni MCA Victor Mwaganda said he was working with other leaders to have Mtwapa town elevated to a city. “Elevation of Mtwapa town to a city will automatically translate into higher salaries for the workers. These people have suffered for long and it is time we found a lasting solution to their problems,” Mwaganda said. Mtwapa and Kikambala have several industries including Umoja Rubber, Pwani Oil Products, Mzuri Sweets, Coast Bottlers Limited and Milly Fruit Processors. Employees have staged several protests to demand improved pay. During the campaigns, politicians promised to end their suffering.
