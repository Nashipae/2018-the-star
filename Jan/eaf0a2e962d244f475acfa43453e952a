A Kiambu-based police officer accused of renting his gun to criminals has surrendered to the
authorities after a week on the run. Senior Sergeant
Gabriel Rotich, 56, yesterday presented himself to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations officers Nairobi in the company of his lawyer. Detectives from the Special Crimes Prevention
Unit had been hunting for the officer since last Friday, when a gun said to
have been issued to him was found in the hands of criminals. Two suspected thugs were gunned down in the Industrial area and the government-owned pistol found on them. The identity of the slain suspects is yet to be established. Rotich was yesterday questioned by SCPU officers before being handed over to Kiambu police for further interrogation. Rotich, who
was until last Friday, the officer in charge of the Kiambu armory, denied
giving his firearm to criminals. He said the gun got lost at a bar last year, although he had not reported the loss
to his bosses. Asked why he
vanished from work, Rotich said he feared that his colleagues would shoot him after
discovering that the gun found on the suspects was his. On Tuesday,
senior police commanders in Kiambu broke into Rotich's house and office where
they recovered two pistols and 95 bullets. Police said
one pistol was missing from the Kiambu firearm records. It is suspected that Rotich disappeared with the gun. His seniors have described him as a rogue officer. Yesterday,
he told investigators that he had not taken any gun with him when he left his
work station last Friday. Head of
SCPU Noah Katumo said they will seek more time from
the court to investigate Rotich. The incident
has revived claims that police could be colluding with criminals to commit robberies and other crimes.
