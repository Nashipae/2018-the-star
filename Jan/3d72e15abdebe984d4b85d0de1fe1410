The High Court has declined to order recount of votes in the Mandera North MP election petition. It said yesterday there was no basis for the application. “Scrutiny is allowed and limited to only reading of SD cards in respect of Al-hidaya Primary School number 4, Ola Primary School number  3, Kajaja No 1, Quarahey Primary School, Dara Farm number 2 and Barwaqo number 1,” Justice Hedwig Ong’undi said. She said the court could not fill any gaps for the party applying. Ong’udi said she would not consider what was not covered by the evidence produced to warrant the orders sought. An application for a recount was made by 23 petitioners who are voters from the constituency. One of the complainants, Issac Hassan Maalim, said he is a trained agent who reported at about 7.15am to the polling station. He said he was made to sit at a certain corner and was just observing the goings-on. But respondents Abdibashir Alinoor and Bashir Sheikh Abdullahi said Maalim appeared satisfied during the vote. They said Maalim could have reported to a police station if there was a problem. The applicants had alleged that they were assaulted by agents as voting went on.
