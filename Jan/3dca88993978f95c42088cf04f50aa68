MATHEWS NDANYI/ Part of the NCPB depot in Eldoret town caught fire on Thursday night. However, it was quickly put out by fire fighters from Uasin Gishu county. A maize dryer burst into flames and caused huge flames. Maize stored in the silos was already burning during the 4am incident. County secretary Peter Lelei visited the scene and said they mobilised fire staff quickly and dashed to the depot where the incident was contained in a few minutes. NCPB officials said only the maize dryer was damaged. Chief executive Newton Terer said they are investigating the cause of the fire. “We are dealing with the matter to ensure we quickly repair the damaged dryer so we can resume quick intake of maize,” Terer said. Engineers were at the depot demolishing the dryer that caught fire to establish the cause. “We heard a huge explosion which caused the fire, but we are still investigating,” an official said. The board has two driers and officials said one would remain in use.
