A case challenging the election of Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja has been dismissed with cost. Voi High Court judge Eric Ogola yesterday struck out the case on grounds the court had no powers to investigate and determine the authenticity of Samboja’s academic credentials on time. Petitioners Arsmtrong Kiwoi and Thomas Jumwa, both voters in Taita Taveta, challenged the validity of Samboja’s Kenyatta University degree. They will foot the Sh500,000 cost of the petition. The court was ruling on two preliminary objections by Samboja and the IEBC to have the case dismissed on grounds an election court cannot undertake an inquiry as sought by Kiwoi. They said it is the EACC which has the sole mandate to probe integrity matters. “All election cases should be heard and determined by the end of February. This court does not have enough time to determine the matter before then,” Ogola said. He directed the EACC, Attorney General and DPP to pursue a case against Samboja that is ongoing at the Milimani law court’s Constitutional division. The EACC filed a case on August 1 challenging the nomination of Samboja for the governor seat during the August 8 General Election. They faulted the IEBC for clearing Samboja despite the authenticity of his degree being in question. Ogola termed the case a waste of the court’s time, adding it was a replica of the one before the Milimani law courts. He said, “The only issue to be determined here by both courts is whether Samboja holds a valid degree. The petitioner did not raise issues of election irregularities. The petitioner also filed this case being in full realisation that a similar case had been filed by the EACC at Milimani.”
