Efforts to overturn
the election of four rebellious MPs to the leadership of parliamentary
committees yesterday moved from odd to bizarre. Tens of Jubilee
members of the committees turned up at State House, where they were compelled
to sign a document to the Speaker admitting that they were not in their right
minds when they elected the four rebels. For
adults of sound mind to confess to be “non compos mentis” (not sane or in one’s
right mind) is remarkable. We cannot speculate on the incentives or threats
that yielded disowning a decision they consciously made a month ago. But such
strange goings-on at the nation’s seat of power do not inspire confidence or
pass the test of probity in the management of public affairs. An
insanity plea as a strategy for removing the stubborn chairmen raises
fundamental questions about the elected leaders as it does the proponents. Persons of unsound mind are prohibited by the Kenya Constitution from holding
public office. The new step is evidences of extreme desperation and Jubilee’s
control-freak impulses. It calls into question the integrity of all the parties
in this saga.
