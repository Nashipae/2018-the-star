A researcher has invented a magnetic lightning arrester that once adopted, will phase out unreliable, expensive and old copper model in the market. Meshak Kobul, a 69-year-old engineer, says the invention took him 42 years to accomplish. Dubbed Komli Magnetism Lightning Interceptor has overcome the old system which has several disadvantages. The new technology is reliable and versatile. Kobul says the oldest technology known to many people is a gadget made of copper flat. It is used during thunderstorms and lightning. It was a major target for scrap metal dealers. The prices of new copper flats shot up drastically, hence its major disadvantage. He says the Komli magnetic arrester operates under a completely different principal, which includes a magnetic body and coil that creates a magnetic field. “The interceptor has the ability to stay dry due to the silica chemical and is not damaged easily,” Kobul adds. He notes that no electricity is required during the process. The equipment is efficient due to the spark plugs and ignition coil. It is also easy to maintain. “There are no mobile parts,” he adds, saying Komli is available in a wide variety of construction options. What distinguishes it from other interceptors is its magnetic functions. The scientist, born in Gem subcounty, went to Sawagongo High School. He then proceeded to Kyambogo Technical Institute in Uganda. He studied Meteorology and air conditioning. He served as a chief engineer in the tours and hotel industry until 1978 when he decided to drop from formal employment and settled for scientific research. Kobul said innovative research development is the way to future technology. He says the drive to study weather and atmospheric behaviour was occasioned by thunderstorms. The father of three says his intention was to find out how lightning could be prevented from destroying structures. He hopes to get financial support to improve his innovation and produce it on a large scale.
