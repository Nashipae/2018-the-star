Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko’s formation of a new boda boda association has divided riders in the CBD. He formed the United Boda Boda Association on Tuesday. Speaking after meeting riders, Sonko said all operators in the CBD must be registered as members of the new association. He said riders will operate in designated areas outside of the CBD. United Boda Boda Association chairman Ken Onyango said they have agreed to abide by the regulations. He said boda boda riders are satisfied with Sonko’s action. However, chairman of Boda Boda Safety Association of Kenya Kevin Mubadi told the Star that it is the only riders’ lobby in the city. “Onyango is former chairman of riders in the CBD, and lost to Charles Gichira in the election. He just wants to remain relevant,” Mubadi said. On Monday Mubadi chaired a meeting with riders at Kariokor Social Hall. Starehe MP Charles “Jaguar” Njagua was present. He has opposed a boda boda ban in the CBD.
