Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has presented five mosquito spraying machines after an outbreak of chikungunya virus. The machines from Malaysia cost about Sh15 million, excluding the chemicals used to fight mosquitoes through spraying. Joho said Malaysia was the country worst-hit country by chikungunya and has developed effective spraying techniques and equipment. “We have studied how Malaysia managed to control the outbreak and the kind of equipment they used,” he said. The governor spoke on Monday during presentation of the equipment at the Public Health Department offices in Mombasa. The machines will help eradicate mosquitoes, which spread the disease that has been troubling residents. So far, 32 cases of chikungunya fever have been confirmed of the 120 cases that had been reported. The machines are expected to reach all six subcounties in Mombasa, starting with Changamwe subcounty, worst-hit by the joints fever, as well as Mvita subcounty. The situation was brought to the attention of the governor by Changamwe MP Omar Mwinyi. Joho said the modern machines would probably eliminate all the mosquitoes carrying vectors, which will help curb chikungunya, dengue fever and malaria. “We hope this 10-day operation will fully eradicate chikungunya and dengue fever if possible, and significantly reduce the number of malaria cases,” Joho said. The governor also urged residents to ensure proper sanitation and remove standing water to prevent breeding of mosquitoes. “In terms of sanitation, we have procured enough equipment and chemicals that will help us deal with this outbreak,” Joho said. The governor said the chemicals are not toxic. “It is just like Doom sprayed in your house. The effect is almost the same,” he said. Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes.  It causes fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can vary in duration.
