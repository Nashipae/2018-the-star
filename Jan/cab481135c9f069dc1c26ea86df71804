The Kiambu county government has merged all 12 water companies in the county into one named Kiambu County Water and Sewerage Company. It has acquired all assets and liabilities of the former companies. The move earlier attracted resistance from residents who said it was an ill-informed decision. Every region has its own problems regarding water supply. It would have been prudent for residents to control water in their regions. Governor Ferdinand Waititu yesterday said those against the merger are cartels. He said Kiambu is not the first county to have a centralised water management agency.
