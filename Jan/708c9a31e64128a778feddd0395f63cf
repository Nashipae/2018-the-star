Anti-riot police officers who were spotted at Uhuru Park on Tuesday at dawn have been withdrawn. This was after they were reportedly told to leave the park for NASA youths who streamed into the grounds from as early as 6am. The presence of the police had caused tension in the city. Police had maintained they would stop the swearing in of NASA leaders Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka.

It is still not clear who had taken the bees to the grounds or the motive behind the move. Elsewhere, the police briefly detained buses that were headed for Nairobi in Voi before releasing them. The officers claimed most of those on board did not have identification documents. It is not clear why police were demanding for identification documents from travellers. "Some of the buses are still in Voi while some managed to travel," a police officer said on Tuesday. The officers were withdrawn amid calls for restraint in dealing with any protests that might erupt following the event. Otsieno Namwaya, Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch, said it is crucial security forces respond to any protests or violence with restraint and respect for rights. "Everyone should respect and uphold rights enshrined in the constitution and international law, especially the right to life."
