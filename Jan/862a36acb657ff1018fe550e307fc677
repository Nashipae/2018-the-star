Matatu Owners have backed the current ban on night travel of PSV’s.  In what seems to be change of stand, chairman Simon Kimutai yesterday said the association partly supports the ban because it is could restore integrity on the roads and reduce accidents.  Kimutai, however, said the association has requested the transport ministry and other stakeholders to consider partially lifting the ban to midnight.
