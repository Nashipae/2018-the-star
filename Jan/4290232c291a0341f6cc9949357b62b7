A man on Friday lost his bid for child
custody against his estranged wife settled by the Kadhis court. This is after High Court judge Rosylin Aburili ruled that the Kadhis
court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the dispute. “It’s my view that the children's court has elaborate
provisions on orders that the court can issue and what facts it should take
into account in issuing such orders,” Aburili said. Aburili further quashed proceedings and orders of the Kadhis court between the two parties in as far as those
proceedings touch on the custody, controls and welfare of minor. The court was to
determine whether the Kadhis court has jurisdiction to hear the dispute. The mother had moved to court to stop the child custody case that had been filed at the Kadhis court
by her ex-husband. She argued that even though she professes the Islamic faith
she is not willing to submit to the Kadhis court jurisdiction and believes that
the dispute between her and the child’s father falls within children’s court. In response, her ex-spouse told the court that the high
court has no jurisdiction to hear the case claiming that it will be infringing
on his rights to a fair hearing because he was being compelled to appear before
a court which does not have specialty to hear a matter of Islamic personal law. The father also said that he was compelled to seek
protection of the court premised on a past incident where his ex wife
choreographed his illegal incarceration at Kisumu Police Station on framed up
charges of terrorism after luring his through court summons to attend Kadhis
court in Kisumu. He also said that he believes that the Children’s Act 2007
never amended or repealed the jurisdiction of the Kadhis courts as Children
matters are perfectly under personal law and so the Kadhis courts have jurisdiction
to hear and entertain children’s matters.
