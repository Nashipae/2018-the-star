Suspected bandits on Thursday shot dead a herder and injured two police officers in Kagir, Baringo North subcounty. The killing of Joseph Yator, 45, has raised tension and fear in Baringo. Yator died of head and chest injuries as he was being rushed to Marigat Subcounty Hospital. Over 2,000 residents were said to be considering fleeing the area for fear of more attacks. Baringo North assistant subcounty commissioner Mohamed Sheh said Yator was herding his cattle when he was ambushed by armed bandits at about 4pm. “They wanted to drive away his cows but security officers from Kagir police camp and the National Police Reservists repulsed them,” Mohamed said. Mohamed said the bandits engaged police in a fierce exchange of fire before fleeing towards Seretion in Tiaty subcounty. Two police officers were slightly injured. Yator died as he was being rushed by police to the hospital. The killing occurred a few metres from Natan village, where a mother and her three-day old child were shot dead by suspected bandits in March last year. Last month, two herders were shot dead in the same area before the bandits drove away more than 600 goats. The area is also near Bartabwa, where Ng’orora chief Thomas Ruttok was shot dead during Deputy President William Ruto’s visit on February 24, last year. Residents said many people were dying of gunshot wounds because there were no ambulances to rush them to hospital. “There is not a single ambulance in the entire ward, forcing residents, including very sick patients to wait for police vehicles for emergencies,” Richard Chepchomei said. He said banditry has increased since Rift Valley regional coordinator Wanyama Musiambo was appointed the deputy head of public service by President Uhuru Kenyatta.
