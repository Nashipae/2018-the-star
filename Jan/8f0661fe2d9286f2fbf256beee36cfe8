President Donald Trump has accused Pakistan of lying and deceiving the United States while receiving billions of dollars in foreign aid. In his first tweet of the year, he also alleged Pakistan harboured terrorists. Pakistan reacted angrily to the tweet, saying all the funding was accounted for and that Trump was bitter due to the "US defeat in Afghanistan". The US is considering withholding more than $250m (£185m) in aid that it delayed sending to Islamabad in August. The move is being considered due to Pakistan's perceived failure to crack down more effectively on terror groups, The New York Times reports. Skip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump "The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools," Trump wrote. He added: "They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!" Pakistan's Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif told Pakistan's Geo TV: "We have already told the US that we will not do more, so Trump's 'no more' does not hold any importance, "Pakistan is ready to publicly provide every detail of the US aid that it has received."‏
