Embu Senator Njeru Ndwiga, a legislator and parents have opposed Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i’s (pictured) direction for school buses to operate between 6am to 6pm. Ndwiga, Runyenjes MP Erick Muchangi and Embu County Parents’ Association chairman John Kathangu said Matiang’i’s instructions cannot work, especially when children are travelling to remote places. The leaders asked the CS to review the timing. They asked that children be allowed to travel at night. “School buses have not been involved in many accidents like other public vehicles because teachers are careful,” Ndwiga said. “It is impractical. If students finish activities at 3pm and they have to travel from Nairobi to Embu, which is a three-and-a-half-hour journey, they will not make it home by 6pm,” he said on the phone. Muchangi added, “The only thing that should be discussed further are technicalities of students travelling to far-off places.” He said operation of school buses between 6am to 6pm might be impossible because students participate in activities like sports far away from school. “They should be allowed to travel any time they finish their activities since parents do not have money to hire lodgings,” Kathangu said. The three leaders said they support orders by Matiang’i that politicians blocking new principals in the mass transfers be arrested. They also support the directive to paint school buses yellow.
