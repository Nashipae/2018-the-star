The first commercial cargo train arrived in Nairobi yesterday at the modern inland container depot launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta a fortnight ago. The arrival of the 1-4-container train is in line with the government policy of reducing costs of doing business in the country. In his New Year’s message, the President said the new commercial cargo train would cut costs and delays for Kenyan traders and those from neighbouring countries. Uhuru said the delivery of a world-class railway on time and within budget would attract world-class manufacturing and value-addition investments. He said these are critical to creating jobs and business opportunities. According to Kenya’s Ports Authority head of Inland Container Deports Symon Wahome, the new train will revolutionise cargo transport. “While the meter train used to carry 20-30 containers, the standard gauge train will carry 216 containers,” Wahome said. He said for now, four cargo trains will operate daily and in future they would be increased to eight. Last month during the launch of Makadara Express inter-county train service, Transport CS James Macharia said the cost of moving a container from Mombasa to Nairobi will be cheaper within 24 hours.
