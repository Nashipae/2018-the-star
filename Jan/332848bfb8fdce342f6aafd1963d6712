A contingent of elite security forces will be deployed to Embobut forest as state intensifies operation to flush out illegal settlers, an official has said. Elgeyo Marakwet County Commissioner Fredrick Ndambuki said the special team will be deployed to the forest on Monday [tomorrow]. Ndambuki said the officers will be followed by another team that will be using helicopters in what he termed as an operation to smoke out armed criminals currently undertaking illegal logging and cattle theft. Indigenous Sengwer community has however maintained that the operation aims to evict members of the community. A section of the community members were each paid Sh410,000 by the state to move out of the forest in 2014 but recently returned. But Ndambuki said anyone who will be found inside the forest will be deemed to be a criminal and will be ‘dealt with’ by the security forces. “The county security committee has resolved to deploy a more specialized security forces to Embobut forest from Monday. Another team using choppers,” Ndambuki said in Koibatek, Marakwet East on Friday.
