It is a national shame that there are still "primary schools" in
Kenya where a dusty tree shade constitutes a classroom. Yet in West Pokot county most primary schools have yet to start using laptops supplied by the government despite the nationwide rollout of the Digital Learning Programme (see P33). In Kakamega county, Eshianini Primary School in Butere constituency has no classrooms or desks (see P38). Pupils have
had many an encounter with snakes roaming into the compound from a nearby sugarcane farm. This is the astonishing state of affairs at many schools in "remote" parts of the country. While the government took electricity to the majority of primary schools across
Kenya at great effort —  coverage estimated at 80 per cent — it is doubtful if this will fundamentally change the fortunes of the learners under such adverse education environments. Government must pull all stops to ensure conditions for learning are standardised across the country. These should include classrooms, desks, learning materials and adequate instructors. These facilities can benefit from the plethora of funds — CDF, Ministry of Education and county ward development funds. And now that the national government has mandated county commissioners to coordinate its functions, such shame should not escape its radar.
