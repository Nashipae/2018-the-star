The High Court in Migori has ordered a fresh election for speaker and deputy speaker of the Migori county assembly. An earlier election is said to have been marred by violence on August 31. Judge Hillary Chemitei ordered the election be conducted within 14 days, setting aside the election of North Kadem MCA Boaz Okoth as speaker and his North Kanyamkago counterpart George Omamba as deputy. Kerario Mwita filed the petition challenging the election. He said he was set to be announced the winner when youths invaded the assembly. His lawyer Kennedy Bosire said, “My client welcomes the court verdict and is very much ready to take part in the fresh election.” NASA Parliamentary Group chairman Graham Kagali said Migori MCAs will comply with the verdict. Majority leader and Oruba Ragana MCA Mallan Ogega said they will use their numbers in the House to reach a just decision. Boaz Okoth said he will respect the court’s verdict and present himself for re-election. “We don’t have a problem with the verdict of the court,” he said.
