Former DPP Keriako Tobiko has said he will work hard to unite the Maa community once he gets to the cabinet. Tobiko was recently nominated by President Uhuru Kenyatta in his cabinet list. He said for long, Maa leaders have preoccupied themselves with just clan issues that do not add value to our community. “If I am appointed CS, I will focus on unifying Maasai people in Kajiado, Narok, Samburu and Laikipia rather than dividing them. I will also unite the Maasai and other non-Maasai communities living in these counties,” Tobiko said in an exclusive interview with the Star.

As for horizontal, I mean that we do not live alone as Maasais but other communities are with us and we should embrace them,” he said He said if he appointed, “My leadership will focus on four issues that include; displaying mutual respect for our elected Maa leaders and offering constructive engagement with them on issues that affect us in common. There must be respect among the leaders to allow healthy consultations among the entire stakeholders in the leadership sector.” Kenya, he said, is not a federal state and both the county and the national government have clear duties defined in the constitution. “Let us strive to lead by providing solutions rather than criticizing what others are doing for the sake of it,” he said.
