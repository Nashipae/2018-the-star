The county government has formed a team of investigators to probe the Sunday night fire that left six people dead and more than 6,000 others homeless at the Kijiji slum in Lang’ata. The team comprising county land officials and detectives seeks to unearth the cause of the fire as resettlement continues. Governor Mike Sonko has assured families they will return to the same land. There are claims the fire was started by arsonists to force residents out so it can be grabbed. Residents said they have received vacate notices issued by unknown people. Sonko said the county will pay all funeral expenses and support the bereaved families as well as those who lost their property. The county and national governments are setting up temporary shelter for families camping at Ngei Primary School. Sonko said firefighters had difficulty accessing the burning areas because of the narrow roads. He spoke on Monday night when he visited the victims. Sonko said the Land, Urban Renewal and Housing department will survey and map all informal settlements for infrastructure development. Deputy President William Ruto pledged Sh70 million to resettle victims. Security and Compliance executive Tito Kilonzi said the department will enforce Sonko’s directive on resettlement. “I have not received a brief from the investigators, but the claims the land has been grabbed is neither here nor there because the governor has assured the families the land belongs to them and they will be resettled there,” Kilonzi said. “We are investigating to find out whether it was an act of arson or misadventure.” National Land commission chairman Muhammad Swazuri said he has not been involved in investigations.
