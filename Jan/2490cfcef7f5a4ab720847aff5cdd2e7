Buses and matatus hiked fares between Eldoret and Nairobi to up to more than Sh2,000 due to passenger congestion caused by the ban on night travel imposed by the NTSA. Travellers usually pay Sh800 for the trip. From Kitale and Bungoma, some passengers had to pay upto Sh2,500 to Nairobi. John Mburu, a manager at one of the matatu shuttles operating in Eldoret,yesterday said it has been hectic. “This crisis is likely to worsen unless the ban is lifted,” he said. In major towns, including Iten and Kabarnet, travellers remained stranded at bus parks while others lined up at booking offices, hoping to get vehicles to their destinations. “We fear the situation will worsen as schools reopen. We urge the government to lift the ban and implement other measures to deal with accidents,” Eldoret traveler Mary Maina said.
