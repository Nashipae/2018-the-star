Kenya’s huge potential to produce freshwater fish has declined because of poor farming methods, experts have said. Despite the country being ranked the fourth major producer of aquaculture in Africa, it has not reached its potential capacity of 11 million tons per year. Paul Orina, research scientist in fish genetics and culture systems at the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute, on Friday said the country’s total freshwater output dropped by 19.8 per cent from 18.7 tons in the year 2015 to 14.9 tons in 2016. “This is attributed to many factors, including wrong farming methods and dwindling and pollution of freshwater resources through human activity,” he said. Orina urged fish farmers in Nyanza and Western to consult professionals to ensure sustainable ventures. He spoke at the Kegati Aquaculture Research Centre in Kisii. Orina said innovative technology is the only way to ensure effective production, as rivers and lakes record dwindling stocks because of pollution.
