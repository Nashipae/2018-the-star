There was drama in a Naivasha estate after administrators carried out an impromptu raid on a factory manufacturing illegal brew following a tip off from members of the public. Al least 30 chiefs and their assistants drawn from all locations in the lake side town were involved in the operation that attracted tens of residents of Karagita estate. The exercise kicked off after residents alerted  local police that there was a factory manufacturing chang’aa and kangara. Chiefs were  alerted to prepare for the operation and elders under Nyumba Kumi Initiative were also involved. This owner fled, leaving his family in their posh house located next to his brewery. The operation led by Naivasha deputy county commissioner Isaac Masinde netted close to 2,000 liters of chang’aa that was at different stages of distillation.
