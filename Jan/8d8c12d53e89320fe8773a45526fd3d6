A widow of a slain Mombasa tycoon and a mother of two is now living in fear after the High Court in Mombasa ordered the reopening of the succession file of her husbandâ€™s properties. Joyce Mumbua alleged she has been receiving death threats from unidentified people after justice Thande Mugure ordered the reopening of a matter involving her late husband Mohammed Khan. In December, Mugure certified the written grant of Khan who died in 2007 issued to his wife in line with his property. The judge further ordered that several other properties, including 10 parcels of land in Kwale-Diani and motor vehicles, be enjoined in the list of properties on the original case file opened in 2008. The previous matter filed under succession cause number 126 of 2008 which listed only one parcel of land has stalled for years. In 2015, unknown people broke into her house and stole seven title deeds. Later, an attempt by a popular businessman in Diani to grab one of the properties was thwarted by the now Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko.
