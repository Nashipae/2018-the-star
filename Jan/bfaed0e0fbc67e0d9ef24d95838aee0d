Plans to upgrade the Lanet Airstrip and have an International airport in Nakuru have started in earnest. Nakuru, a tourism and horticultural hub, has been lagging behind due to lack of a much-needed airport. The airstrip, next to the Kenya Military Academy, 10 kilometres from Nakuru Town, will be expanded in partnership with the county government. Last month, officials from Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure and Kenya Civil Aviation Authority led by Peter Munyao, the Kenya Airport Authority officials led by Edmond Wekesa and KDF team led by Colonel Martin Ndirangu toured the airstrip. They were accompanied by Governor Lee Kinyanjui. It will be upgraded to accommodate large commercial planes. The airport is expected to boost commercial activities in the county. “Under this arrangement, we shall convert the military facility into a public utility available for use by civilian aircrafts,” Kinyanjui said. During the tour, Kenya Airport Authority said that Nakuru County holds huge potential in terms of cargo generation. They also said that the passenger capacity in Nakuru is high and the area is key for diversions as it is near Nairobi. The stakeholders agreed that a report on technical issues on the design for the airport and the costing for improvement of the airstrip will be availed before the end of this month. Efforts by former regimes to construct an airport were frustrated by divisions among local leaders over its location. At the centre of controversy was a 640-acre land that had been earmarked for the airport project in 2004 by former President Mwai Kibaki in Pipeline area in the outskirts of the town. NEMA Chief Enforcement Officer Robert Orina said the land was on a bird migratory corridor, hence unsuitable for the facility.
