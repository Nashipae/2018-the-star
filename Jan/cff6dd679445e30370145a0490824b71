Homeboyz coach Paul Murunga believes his side must go back to the drawing board and correct the mistakes that saw their unbeaten record end following a 26-6 defeat to champions KCB at the Lions’ Den over the weekend. The deejays were outplayed by the clinical bankers and Murunga admitted they were second best in the contest. “The boys gave it their all but we fell short in some facets of play and with KCB, you can’t allow them to have momentum. They will make you pay,” said Murunga. He observed that it is still early in the season, with just five matches played, and can still bounce back in the forthcoming assignments. “The season is long. We will go back, review and come out stronger for our next match against Nakuru,” added Murunga. Open-side flanker, Davis Chenge and centre Stafford Abeka scored a try each for the bankers as Darwin Mukidza added four penalties and two conversions in the victory. Mohammed Omollo replied with two penalties for the deejays who trailed 19-6 at the interval. The defeat saw the deejays drop from second to fourth on the standings with Impala leapfrogging them to third following their 77-0 win over Kisii. KCB coach Curtis Olago, said: “It’s a good win we took our chances and when Homeboyz piled pressure in the second half we defended well to close out the match.” KCB top the standings with 24 points, one point ahead of Kabras, who edged Quins 22-13 in a tight encounter played at the Kakamega showground. Patrice Agunda and new signing, Alex Olaba, scored a try each for the visitors with Lyle Asiligwa adding a penalty. Kabras led 14-3 at the interval. Mwamba picked their first win of the season, crushing 7Mombasa Sports Club 74-3 as Nakuru laboured to a 28-6 victory over Blak Blad. Nondies edged out Strathmore Leos 25-20. Enock Markinga, Ernest Chiambah, Fidel Oloo and Ben Mgangah scored for Nondies, who host Kabras Sugar this weekend.
