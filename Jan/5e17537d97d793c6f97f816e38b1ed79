After making a comeback with the hit song Oyoyo, gospel singer Mr Seed says he missed producing music. "As a young person, I have done a couple of mistakes, but my biggest regret is staying silent for a year. A lot of things were happening and I had to stay without releasing music for that long." In Oyoyo, the EMB-signed artiste is is seen dressed like a tout. It made fans wonder if he is a 'makanga' in real life. Mr Seed shut down the claims. "Sijaikua makanga, lakini nishaidandia gari. Kuna siku nikiishi Huruma, dereva hakua na makanga akaniambia nimuingizie watu. For the first time nikaona ni interesting, lakini sijaikua makanga, ni concept tu yangu. Niliona nifanye hivyo ndio ni-relate na watu. The response has been amazing, unlike my previous songs. This one blesses me." And yes, the Simba Wa Yudah hitmaker is a hard worker. "I do a lot of research. Sometimes I sleep at 4am and wake up at 8am, working. I do research on so many different things. I don't want people to always predict what I'm going to release next." What about the daily trolls he receives on social media? "I'm used to being trolled. I've been here for long and I've gone through a lot. I've developed a thick skin and I believe I'm here to inspire people. I want to give people good music, gospel music. I'm also human and at some point, some things on social media get too personal." Even though hesitant, Seed says there is hope for a wedding. "When that time for a wedding comes, I'll make the announcement. But right now I'm just focused on music."
