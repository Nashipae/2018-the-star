Isiolo Governor Mohammed Kuti has ordered Isiolo Referral Hospital to destroy all expired drugs to ensure are not diverted and sold by unscrupulous dealers. Kuti (pictured), who made an impromptu visit to the referral hospital on Monday, was shocked the hospital still had drugs two years past their expiry date. He said the drugs should be disposed as the hospital incinerator is working. “These drugs might find their way back into the market. There should be no excuse why these drugs should not be disposed of,” he said. Governor Kuti said the county meet the health management team to address problems holding back the hospital from operating at full capacity. He said the County Health Management team should lobby the assembly to allow the hospital to spend revenue collected to buy urgent and minor supplies such as stationery and computer anti-viruses software to avoid delays caused by bureaucracy. He praised the progress made in cleanliness and service delivery at the hospital since his last visit after he was elected. He promised to address the casual workers’ grievances, especially delays in their payment. Kuti, who was recently appointed as the chairman of the health committee in the Council of Governors, called on counties to implement the nurses’ CBA to end strikes. This will save Kenyans from the agony they go through when health facilities are paralysed, he said.
