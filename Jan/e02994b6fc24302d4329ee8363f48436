Tigania East MP Josphat Gichunge has blamed the police and the NTSA for the rise in the number of road accidents in the country. About 200 people died in December in road carnage. Yesterday, 36 people perished in a grisly road accident at the notorious Salgaa black spot. The bus they were travelling in collided with a trailer. Thirty died on the spot while six others lost their lives while undergoing treatment at the Nakuru Level Five Hospital and Molo Subcounty Hospital. Gichunge said the high number of accidents is unacceptable and must be stopped. He called for thorough investigations and swift solutions. He also urged drivers to be cautious. “Our people are dying and we know life cannot be repaired. I urge our people to be our brothers and sisters’ keeper. If a driver is speeding, it is better to tell him to stop it,” he said.  Meanwhile, the legislator wants cows to be fitted with tracking devices to tame cattle rustling. He said the technology is useful and must be adopted as soon as possible to help residents who lose their livestock to theft. “I went to China, Russia, Scotland and Botswana. Finally, I was able to find the kind of system I wanted in England. A system that is able to track cattle as far as 150 kilometres away,” the legislator told residents.
