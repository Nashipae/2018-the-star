Boda boda riders (pictured) in Ruambwa, Budalang’i, have accused Traffic police of harassment. The riders plying Ruambwa- Maumau road have accused the officers from Port Victoria police station of alleged extortion. The riders spoke to the press at Ruambwa trading centre on Thursday. They said the Traffic cops and armed AP officers are “notorious and arrogant”. They demand Sh50 from every rider, even those who comply with traffic rules. “They erect illegal roadblocks near St Peter’s Ruambwa Primary School on the main highway to collect Sh50 from riders at 4pm every day,” one rider said. “If you refuse to give them the Sh50 they threaten to arrest you,” a second rider said. The boda boda riders have promised to stage a peaceful protest against the traffic police. “We are riding hired motorbikes. We are required to pay Sh300 to the bike owners daily, but due to persistent harassment, we keep off the road at 4pm,” a rider said.
