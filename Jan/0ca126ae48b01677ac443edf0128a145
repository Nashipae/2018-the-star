Thirteen people will appear in court today over noise pollution and for contravening the ban on the sale of shisha. They were arrested in a sting operation for playing loud music and allowing consumption of shisha in their premises on Friday night by police and Nairobi county liquor licensing board officials. Two bars were ordered shut for allowing patrons to smoke shisha. Officers raided Space Lounge and B Club in Kilimani. Directors of the establishments were seized during the raid. Patrons were ordered to leave immediately. Head of Nairobi Tobacco Control Unit Anthony Muthemba said Ministry of Health officials and Nairobi county government’s Environment department were involved. The raids were carried out within the CBD. Many owners of social joints were found to have complied with the order to ban shisha sale. “We are going to ensure full compliance,” Muthemba said.
