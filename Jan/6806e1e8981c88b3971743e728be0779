Millers have denied claims they are hoarding subsidised maize a week after the programme ended. Nick Hutchinson, the Cereal Millers Association chairman, said members have no subsidised maize left in their stores. “They are now buying maize at market-determined prices. We hope the prices will stabilise as soon as there are adequate supplies of maize in the market,” he said in a statement. Read:Sh9bn maize subsidy plan has not ended, say millers Millers are buying maize from farmers and traders at Sh3,000, while the National Cereals and Produce Board is buying at Sh3,200. This has increased the price of a 2kg packet of maize flour to between Sh110 to Sh120 in the local market. Agriculture CS Willy Bett had announced in November that the ministry would make provisions to transition into the end of the subsidy programme. Hutchinson said as the subsidy was coming to an end, millers’ allocated quotas were reduced in order to ensure that no subsidy maize was left over. “There was also an agreement that at the end of the subsidy programme, millers would return any leftover subsidy maize to the NCPB,” he said. A check yesterday showed that some small supermarkets still have stocks of the Sh90 subsided maize flour and are selling it at Sh120.
