 Nairobi county government plans to devolve offices to 17 subcounties to decentralise services. ICT executive Charles Kerich on Friday said the county also wants to begin using the digital platform to improve efficiency. All the services offered at City Hall will be available at the subcounty offices and on the digital platform. He spoke during a TV Interview. Kerichsaid the county launched a data centre which is the backbone of all projects that are intended to transform the county. “We want to open subcounty Huduma Centres so that every service offered by City Hall can be accessed in the subcounties. If you live in Westlands, you don’t have to come to town for anything,” Kerich said. “We want to have a website where services can be offered. If you want a food handling certificate  you apply online,  pay online and get certificate online,” he added.
