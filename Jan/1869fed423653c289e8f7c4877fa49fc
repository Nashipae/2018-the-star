Residents from Dramvell and Kamulu in Mavoko have accused Machakos politicians of absenteeism. They said the leaders disappear once they are elected. “We voted for six leaders on August 8, from President to MCA. Apart from Muthwani MCA George King’ori and Governor Alfred Mutua whom we watch on TV, we have never seen the rest,” said Janet Karimi. They spoke at a public meeting in Dramvell on Saturday. “It is unfortunate that the former area MCA Domnic Wamaitha concluded his five term without visiting this area. We are worried the other leaders might follow suit. They visited this place last when they were hunting for votes,” Karimi said. The residents said they have problems which the leaders promised to solve but they have since gone missing. The residents said there are no public primary and secondary schools in Dramvell. “We need schools and polytechnics. Our children walk to schools far away from here. When it rains and during the dry season when there is too much dust our children suffer,”said another resident identified only as Honga.
