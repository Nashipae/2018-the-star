Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has advised those seeking to succeed him to focus on the positions they hold. Oparanya told those who wish to succeed him it is too early to talk about succession. Those eying Oparanya’s seat are Lugari MP Ayub Savula, Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali and former Kakamega Senator Bonny Khalwale. The governor attended the funeral of teacher Felisters Shiriswa in Mumias. Savula was present. Savula who spoke before the governor asked the residents to consider him for the governor seat in 2022. “I have served two terms as an MP and I feel I have nothing more but to look forward to lead this county,” Savula said. “Oparanya you are my father and I only need your direction, which I will follow,” he added. However, Oparanya criticised Savula for eyeing a seat that is currently occupied. “I have no trouble with my brothers looking for the seat but first let them deliver on what that where elected for,” the governor said. Oparanya invited all elected leaders to come together and deliver to the residents while respecting each other’s position and avoid unnecessary political fighting.
