Kenya's Real Estate growth dropped more than 10 percent to stand
at 14.5 per cent in 2017 down from 25.8 per cent in 2016, Cytonn
report has revealed. The slowed growth has been attributed to a drop in private sector
lending as a result of the interests cap law that come to effect in
September 2016. Private sector lending moved from a five year
compound annual growth rate of 14.4 per cent to a low of 2.4 per cent
as at October 2017. Cytonn chief Investment officer Elizabeth Nkukuu has also linked
the drop to political uncertainty brought about by the extended
electioneering period and thus cautious investors postponed making
purchase decisions. Despite the drop, the investment firm has outlined at least five
reasons why the sector is set to rise from its slumber this year. They includes high housing demand and the large housing deficit at 200,000
units annually, growing middle class, government to spur affordable
housing development, improving infrastructure and growing businesses
and SMEs creating demand for office and retail space. She however cautioned investors, asking them to conduct research
to identify the niches in the market given the increased focus by
institutional developers, which, while clearly an indication of
growth, will result in stiff competition as clients and investors
demand quality developments.
