The national government wants all children admitted to Form One but have yet to report to school to get enroled by Monday. Education CS Fred Matiangi (pictured) yesterday launched the Operation Tupeleke Watoto Shule (Let’s take our children to school), which will be enforced by national government officials and county education officials. Many students, especially in the Coast region, have yet to report, citing lack of school fees among other factors, Matiang’i said.

Last Friday, the Education ministry was forced to extend the reporting deadline to yesterday, after some regions registered low enrolment. Yesterday, Matiang’i met with Coast governors, senators, MPs and other education players at the Kenya School of Government, Mombasa, to discuss the problem. “The most important resolution we have reached here is that we are going to launch OperationTupeleke Watoto Shule in Coast,” he said after a four-hour meeting. “We are going to start by visiting the primary schools where these children studied to know which schools they are supposed to report to.” Read: Ministry extends form one admission deadline Leaders present during the meeting included governors Granton Samboja (Taita Taveta), Salim Mvurya (Kwale), Deputy Governor William Kingi (Mombasa) and Kwale Woman Representative Zulekha Juma.
