One thing that we admire about Maddy is how committed he is to his family, despite having a tight schedule almost everyday. Unlike
other celebrities who prefer to hide their families from the public
eye, he always shares photos and videos of his family, and we just love
how he bonds with his daughter, sharing videos of her little milestones. Well,
the little one will not be the centre of attention any more. Madtraxx
recently shared photos of his newborn, and I must say, the baby is
adorable. He posted a photo of him holding the little one with the caption, "Latest member of the team." Here are some comments from his fans: mimmokenya: Awww shhoooo cuuuuute! kimothojackie: Wow!!Cuzo you look great....my niece ako tu sawa niniwacera: Cutest little cookie!! junegachui: She is adorable!!!! Hello littu niece!!
