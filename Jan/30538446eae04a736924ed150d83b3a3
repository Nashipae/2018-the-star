Governor Martin Wambora has applied for a review of last Thursday’s ruling on vote recount. Wambora filed the application on Friday, a day after Justice William Musyoka ordered a recount of votes in some polling stations in three constituencies. The request for a recount was made by former Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti, who lost to Wambora in the August 8 General Election. The constituencies are Manyatta Runyenjes and Mbeere South. Musyoka also ordered a scrutiny of Forms 37As and 37Bs. He said there was inflation, swapping, doctoring, and vote theft across the board. Wambora wants several other polling stations in various constituencies where he says he was denied more than 300 votes included in the list. Musyoka’s ruling has been opposed by Jubilee leaders, including Embu county assembly majority Chief Whip Margaret Kariuki.
