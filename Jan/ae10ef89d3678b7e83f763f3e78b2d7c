The rumour mill is abuzz with riveting
tales about the unfinished business of naming the Cabinet. Citizens are
congregating in open spaces and around street corners over lunch hour and in
their favourite evening joints in amused animated discussion of who will make
it to the list and whose fate is sealed. Bets will be won and lost, arguments
break out and sharp differences emerge as opinion is expressed. Proximity to
power, connection in high places, political intelligence and street-smart
political instincts are being tested. It is now a national pastime, thanks to
President Uhuru Kenyatta's indecision two months since being sworn in. Even the media is exhausted with
prediction of who is being considered for inclusion. Smart operatives have new
business as go-between lobbyists for the anxious State officials whose heads
are on the chopping board. Eager to retain their jobs, they are grasping at
anything, hopeful it will return a nod, a call perhaps, from State House. The casualty in all this anxious
waiting is the urgent business of State, which is suffering from inattention
and low performance. Is the President aware and does he care?
