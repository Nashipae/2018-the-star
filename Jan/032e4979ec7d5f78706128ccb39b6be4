Meru MCAs on Wednesday approved the names of chief officers nominated by Governor Kiraitu Murungi. They are Victoria Kanana (Health), Joseph Chabari (Finance) Joseph Muthuri (Land), Catherine Wanja (Cooperatives), and Lawrence Kinoti (Environment). Others are Dionesia Warue (Agriculture), Kananu Ntongai (Youth Affairs), Mercy Mwendwa (Sports), Kanathi Haron (Education), and David Mugambi (Livestock). Lewis Mwirigi was seconded as Gender chief officer, Cyprian Karaine (Culture), Stephen Gituma (Roads), Patrick Kirema (Energy), Denson Mwirigi (Trade) and Titus Murungi (Tourism). The assembly started vetting each of the nominees last week. Salecio Thuranira, a resident, raised concerns that one of the nominees did not meet the qualifications for the docket she was nominated to. She petitioned the assembly's committee on education to reject Kananu's nomination on grounds that she is not fit for the docket. But Majority Leader Victor Karithi told The Star all those seconded for the chief officer jobs are qualified to man the respective dockets. Click here for the latest political news
