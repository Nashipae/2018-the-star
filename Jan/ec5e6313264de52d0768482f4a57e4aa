Forty-four IDP families, who were settled at Camuka villlage in Ol Joro Orok, have asked both the county and the national governments to stop discriminating against them in offering services. Speaking on Saturday, their chairperson Lucy Nyambura said they the government had not offered them any assistance since 2013 when they were resettled in the area. She said the state had promised to subdivide the land for them. They had to contribute to pay surveyors. "We don't have water and roads. Our children don't get bursaries. We also don't get jobs whenever we apply," Nyambura said. The IDPs were among 101 less fortunate families who were offered Christmas gifts by the Nyandarua county. ICT executive Mbataru Kariuki said the government will issue title deeds to IDPs.
