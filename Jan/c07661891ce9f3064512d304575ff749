Former world junior 3,000m steeplechase champion Daisy Jepkemei clinched the women’s 8.6km race during the San Sebastian international cross country in Spain on Sunday. Jepkemei clocked 27:52 ahead of team-mate Norah Tanui (28:10). Olympic 3,000m steeplechase champion and world record-holder Ruth Jebet, who was contesting her third race in the space of a week, wasn’t a factor on this occasion, dropping off the pace early and finishing a distant third in 28:49. Bahrain’s Aweke Ayalew clinched the men’s 10km race on a mild afternoon with heavy underfoot conditions and the winning time was almost three minutes slower than last year. Ayalew made a strong run from home in the last kilometre to defeat 2015 to crossed line in 32:54, two seconds ahead of the world U-20 cross country champion, Yasin Haji also from Ethiopia. European 5,000m champion Ilias Fifa was third in 33:10 with European 10,000m champion Polat Kemboi Arikan from Turkey fourth in 33:21. Meanwhile, a week after setting a world indoor 600m best, Kenya’s Michael Saruni clocked a world-leading 1:45.19 to win over 800m at the Texas Tech Invitational in Lubbock on Saturday. Saruni, a student at the University of Texas at El Paso, now moves to 20th on the world indoor all-time list. There was a high-quality high jump competition at the same meeting with three men leaping 2.30m. Jeron Robinson won on countback over Trey Culver and Vernon Turner. Two weeks after clocking 7.31 over 60m, four-time world champion Brittney Reese contested her first long jump competition of 2018. She opened with two fouls but then found her groove with a 6.55m leap in round three. As is her trademark, she produced her best in the last round with 6.57m to take victory by one centimetre over Canada’s Christabel Nettey.
