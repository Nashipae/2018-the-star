Kiza Club owner Ali Oumarou yesterday accused Nema of malice after it ordered closure of several clubs in the city. Nema last Thursday issued a closure notice to four clubs, including Kiza, a club located on the eighth and ninth floor at Galana Plaza, on Galana Road in Kilimani, as a result of numerous complaints from residents. Speaking to the Star, Ali said he finds it malicious because the club does not have windows to let noise out and is the only East African club to have a soundproofed disco and modified headphones. “The club was opened in 2015 and I took responsibility as the owner to make sure that noise from the club will not interfere with people’s lives,” Ali said. “I even installed 2.22mm soundproof glass to ensure noise from the club does not go outside. After this, I wrote to Nema to come counter-check but they did not respond,” he said. Ali said that If the club was causing noise pollution, the first people to have complained would have the Homeboyz Studios stationed in the same building. He says complains started when other clubs came and settled at Galana Plaza. “I have around 100 staff members who depend on salary from the club operations and we also host DJs. How will they earn If the club is closed?” he asked. DJ Creme de Creme said Nema should reconsider closure of the clubs saying the move will greatly affect the club owners, staff and DJs. According to Nema’s corporate communication manager, Evans Nyabuto, the authority’s environment director has never received any letter from Kiza Club and perhaps they got a wrong address. He says once the club owners are ready to operate by the regulations they will be reopened and business will run as usual. The club will remain closed as Ali’s lawyer sorts out the issue.
