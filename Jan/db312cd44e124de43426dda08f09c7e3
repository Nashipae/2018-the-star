One in every four Kenyans is living with the high blood pressure, statistics from the Director of Medical Services show. In a report released early last year, more than half have never had their blood pressure checked. Human rights activist Ken Wafula passed away at St Luke’s Hospital in Eldoret. Doctors said he had high blood pressure. Age is one of the contributors of high blood pressure, Dr Lemmy Oginga of the Ministry of Health told the Star yesterday. He said people under 30 usually don’t have the disease because they are active. Oginga said it is common among people aged between 40-65 years. The normal blood pressure (optimal) range is less than 120/80 mm Hg. Elevated blood pressure is when readings are consistently ranging from 120-129 systolic and less than 80 mm Hg diastolic.
