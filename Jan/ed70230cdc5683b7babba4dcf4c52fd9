National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale has been accused of having a low opinion of the Kalenjin community. Mosop MP Vincent Tuwei yesterday said Duale was behind removing some Rift Valley legislators from parliamentary committee chairman posts. Tuwei said the committee positions should not be used to arm-twist and intimidate Kalenjins. The MP was with Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi, Nandi Governor Stephen Sang and Senator Samson Cherarkey in Lemook village, Kapseret subcounty, Uasin Gishu. The MP said Duale was promoting his own people into leadership positions. “We shall not accept or allow anyone to peg the 2022 presidential candidacy on how we distribute positions,” Tuwei said. They attended the homecoming party for Nandi county Agriculture executive Wilson Tay.
