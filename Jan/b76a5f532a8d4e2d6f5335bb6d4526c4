Two thousand two hundred and twenty one slums dwellers from Mukuru Kwa Njenga have gone to court seeking title deeds for the land they have been living on. The members of the Mukuru Makao Bora Trust on Thursday told the court that Akiba Mashinani TrustÂ has been holding title deeds for a 23-acre piece of land valued at over Sh900 million. They said they have already settled a Sh81million loan advanced to them in 2009 by Eco Bank to finance the purchase of the land. Efforts to have titles transferred to them have however become futile. AMT through their lawyer Gerry Gitonga sought to adjourn the case but the judge Elijah Obaga said the move granting the request would cause delays. He set February 19 as the date for cross examination.
