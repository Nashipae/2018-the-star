The ERC has attributed the increase to “weighted average cost of imported refined petroleum products”. “The changes in this month’s prices have been as a consequence of the average landed cost of imported Super petrol increasing by 3.99 per cent from $636.22 per ton in November 2017 to $661.63 per ton in December,” ERC acting managing director Robert Oimeke said in the monthly review. Diesel increased by 4.63 per cent from $463.63 to $568.82 per ton and kerosene shot up by 6.36 per cent — from $579.64 to $616.51 per ton.
