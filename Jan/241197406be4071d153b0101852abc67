The Red Cross on Wednesday donated 87 cartons of antibiotics, antiseptics and oral rehydration therapy to fight diarrhoea. This is after three people succumbed to dysentery, while 21 others were admitted in Lairang’i, Tigania West, Meru county, last week. Central region Red Cross cordinator Gitonga Mugambi also gave out water treatment chemicals. Mainda Mathina, 95, died on Tuesday afternoon last week. His son Mugambi Kirigo and wife are admitted in Isiolo with abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. There was a public outcry over the integrity and accountability of the Meru Public Health department after disease outbreak and slow intervention measures taken to contain it. Kaibung’a Mithiori and Angelina Maitei, 63, died undergoing treatment at the Meru Teaching and Referral Hospital.
