Police and their CID counterparts in Bungoma town on Monday gunned down a 24-year-old suspected thug. The man, who was armed with a pistol, was killed outside his house at Muslim area in the outskirts of Bungoma town. Bungoma South OCPD David Kirui said police arrested four other youths who were with the suspect. Kirui said the suspect tried to flee and shot at police, prompting them to shoot back. He said the police confiscated a German shepherd the group used to terrorise residents with at night. The group used to travel with the dog and pretend to be police officers then rob residents. Kirui said one of the thugs escaped, but the police are pursuing leads to nab him. He urged residents to volunteer information that can lead to arrests. Kirui said the suspects could be part of a larger gang that terrorises residents and business operators at night. Kirui said the four who were arrested are being investigated and will be arraigned in court soon. “We would like to thank our officers for the swift reaction,” he said.
