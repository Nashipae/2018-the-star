Two Jubilee MPs from Nyamira have accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of excluding the county from Cabinet appointments. Woman representative Jerusha Momanyi and North Mugirango MP Joash Nyamoko said this is a betrayal of voters in Nyamira. “In the last general election, Nyamira residents voted overwhelmingly for President Uhuru and the Jubilee party,” Momanyi told the Star. “They voted on grounds that our people could be appointed to his government. But on the contrary, he has dumped them.” Momanyi said that as elected representatives of Nyamira county, they would not support a government that only uses them to ascend to leadership. She said that for the first time, Nyamira county rejected opposition politics in the general election, by electing most of their leaders on a Jubilee ticket. Interior CS Fred Matiang’i comes from Borabu in Nyamira. However, Nyamoko said the CS is a ‘tenant’ in Nyamira, since he hails from Etago in Kisii county. “Kisii county has a Cabinet Secretary, a principal secretary and a chief administrative secretary, while Nyamira has nothing. We will be forced to reconsider our political stand,” Nyamoko said. Nyamira politician Justus Rasugu also asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to reward the people of Nyamira. Separately, Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tong’ and former Bonchari MP Zebedeo Opore welcomed the appointment of former Kisii Senator Chris Obure as CAS and Susan Mochache as PS. “Obure has a wealth of experience in public service and private sector and will help the Jubilee administration and President Uhuru Kenyatta. However, we request the President to give us more appointments,” Tong’i said. Click here for the latest political stories
