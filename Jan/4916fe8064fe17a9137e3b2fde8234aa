Kitui East MP Nimrod Mbai has put on notice tycoons from Nairobi and Garissa who send hostile camel herders to his constituency. He said they clash with residents over pasture and water. “Rich owners of thousands of camels, who live in opulence in Nairobi and Garissa, should know their herders and animals are not welcome in Kitui. Previously, they have shot and killed some residents conflict over pasture and water,” Mbai said. The MP declared the herders merchants of death. He said they deplete pasture and water with their large herds of camel, cows and goats. Mbai spoke in Inganzo, Endau-Malalalani ward, when he accompanied the Kitui East security team led by deputy county commissioner Benjamin Nzioka in a patrol to establish the extent Somali pastoralists had infiltrated the area.
