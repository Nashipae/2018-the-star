The High Court yesterday ordered a patient accused of killing a nurse in Nairobi last month detained until January 29 for his bail application. Joseph Mungai appeared before justice Jessie Lessit and pleaded not guilty to a murder charge. The prosecution told court his medical report shows he is fit to stand trial. Earlier, there were reports the suspect had a mental condition, but the prosecution said he sought medical attention for alcohol detoxification. “A plea of not guilty has been entered, but the suspect will remain in custody until his bail application is heard and determined,” the prosecution said. The licensed gun holder will be held at the Industrial Area Prison. The accused, through his lawyer, had urged the court to temporarily free him before pleading to the charge, but the court declined. Mungai is accused of killing 43-year-old Faustine Mwadime on December 6 at the Chiromo Lane Medical Centre in Westlands. The nurse was shot in the head.
