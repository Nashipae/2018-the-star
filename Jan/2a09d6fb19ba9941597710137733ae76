NASA principals Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang’ula are committed to ensuring electoral justice, ODM treasurer Timothy Bosire has said. “The leaders remain steadfast in ending Jubilee’s rule, which is characterised by corruption, tribalism and electoral injustices,” he said. Bosire spoke to the Star on Tuesday amid reports of a fallout in NASA over the sharing of key parliamentary committee seats. “The principals and all levels of NASA are fully committed to the cause. We are fighting for a worthy cause and we are not going to be distracted. Big ideas are pursued by committed people,” he said.
