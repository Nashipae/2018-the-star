Garissa Governor Ali Korane has given lifeline to losers in the August 8 General Election by appointing them to key county positions. Most former members of the county assembly have been appointed to senior positions and top officials in the previous administration retained their slots. Korane was instrumental in mobilising MCAs to vote for immediate former Ijara Member of Parliament Ahmed Abass as the speaker. Abass lost to his arch-rival Sophia Abdinoor. Former ward representative Mohamed Abdullahi (Ijara ward) and Abdi Dekow (Jarajara) were appointed to chief officer in charge of Water and Vocational training, respectively. Consolidate power Several other leaders who failed to recapture their seat were also given positions as subcounty administrators. Commentators say the move to appease poll loser by the governor is a ploy to consolidate power and retain the position for a second term. However, speaking recently, Governor Korane told his political detractors he is not afraid of the consequences of his decision. He said his main agenda is development for the people of Garissa. Development agenda The governor said the 2022 election is still far away for him to worry about what will happen if he makes firm decisions that will be beneficial to the residents. “Whatever decisions we will make will be firm and are geared towards solving problems bedeviling our county. They’ll be made without fear of the political consequences that will come with it,” Korane said. Last month, Korane thanked former Governor Nathif Jama for withdrawing an election petition against him. Korane was commenting on the issue after a deal was struck by elders from his clan and those from Nathif’s clan. He welcomed the move, saying it will help unite people who were divided along political lines because of the protracted poll campaigns. Although Nathif has not come out to publicly deny or acknowledge he had withdrawn the case, elders said they had his blessings during the negotiations.
