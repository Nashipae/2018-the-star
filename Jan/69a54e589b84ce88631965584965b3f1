 The Homa Bay county casual workers who were sacked last week have threatened to move to court. The 650 workers said they will sue the county government should Governor Cyprian Awiti and county secretary Isaiah Ogwe fail to address their issues within seven days. Through their chairperson Ocholla Owaka, the Homa Bay County Workers Union said it is working on modalities for its concerns to be addressed in court. “We’re headed for a court battle if the top county leadership does not meet and tell us why we were laid off,” Owaka said. Speaking to journalists in Homa Bay town yesterday, Owaka accused the county government of hiding behind huge wage bill for their dismissal. The workers said they will continue working on grounds the sacking was unprocedural. “We have families who depend on us and we cannot obeyillegal dismissals. In fact, I have told my colleagues to continue discharging their mandate,” Owaka said. Last Friday and Saturday, the workers protested in Homa Bay town to express their anger after they received a letter from a Public Service Board official stopping them from working. In the letter, the Homa Bay government said itwas cutting the wage bill.
