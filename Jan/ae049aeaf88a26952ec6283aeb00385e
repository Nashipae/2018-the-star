Marakwet
residents have called for the release the body of a teenager killed nine days ago in a fierce gun
battle in the West Pokot/Elgeyo Marakwet border on December 5. Resident Samson Lolis said locals had received reports that Nathan Korir, 19, was beheaded, the head hidden and others parts burnt by angry West Pokot bandits. He said failure to do so will complicate the search for peace on the volatile border. Resident Margarina Mijir said the deadly attacks erupted as local herders mounted a chase of bandits who stole 200 cows in December. Elgeyo Marakwet leaders led by Senator Kipchumba Murkomen on Friday said a lasting solution in the renewed clashes will be found. Murkomen dismissed claims that political leaders are inciting local herders into violence, saying leaders are committed to ensuring that stolen livestock are recovered.
