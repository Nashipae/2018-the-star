On Tuesday Kalonzo Musyoka failed to turn up at Uhuru Park to be sworn in as People’s Deputy President of Kenya. Whatever you think of Raila Odinga, at least he had the guts to show up. On the other hand Raila’s co-principals were phoning him until 2pm on Tuesday to persuade him to drop out of the ceremony. Raila ignored them. Kalonzo claimed he could not attend because his security guards had been withdrawn. But he was in Dusit Hotel with Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang’ula, a short distance from Uhuru Park. He could have walked there. The people would have protected him. On Tuesday Kalonzo demonstrated conclusively that he cannot be a true opposition leader. A revolutionary has to be decisive. He cannot just wobble to and fro like a jelly. The overnight farce of the alleged attack on his Karen home further questioned Kalonzo’s credibility. If Kalonzo wants to remain relevant in Kenya politics, he has to have the courage of his convictions. Otherwise he is finished.

But this is far better than a mean little flame." - Russian president Boris Yeltsin was born on 1 February, 1931
