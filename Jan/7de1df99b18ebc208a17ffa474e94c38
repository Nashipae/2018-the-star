Leaders and elders in Wajir county have urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to retain tourism PS Fatuma Hirsi. Addressing the media yesterday, the elders said her re-appointment will be seen as appreciation to the residents by President Uhuru for voting for him in last year's General Elections. Hirsi who hails from Wajir South was among the few PSs who were not named. The president promised to fill their positions at a later date. It has been speculated that she might be dropped and replaced by another individual from the county. Sources told the Star leaders led by a vocal MP from the area are pushing for her ouster and replacement. “We believe that Fatuma delivered in her ministry. Kenyans can attest to this. We will be very disappointed if she is not retained,” Mohamd Haji said. They said that Fatuma steered the county through ‘murky waters’ like when the country faced travel advisories from foreign embassies. “She rallied us to support Uhuru and today, we are appealing to the president on her behalf to let her continue the good work she is doing for the country”, Dakane, chairman of the elders, said. Hash Elmore, the head of Wajir Good Governance, a community organization said Hirsi was among the few daughters of the soil that the county was proud of. Wajir Woman Representative Fatuma Gedi assured residents that the elected leaders from the County would lobby for her reappointment. “She has delivered and we will ask the president to keep her in the team to deliver his legacy”, said the Women MP. She was working with the United Nation in Geneva Sweden before landing a Cabinet post.
