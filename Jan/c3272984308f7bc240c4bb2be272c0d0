Armed robbers on Friday attacked the home of ODM politician Hamisi Pweza and destroyed his two cars before making away with Sh200,000 cash. Msambweni police boss Joseph Chebusit said the attack was executed by a gang of three who escaped from the scene on a motorbike. "Nobody was hurt. Both the politician and his family are fine. We are conducting investigations to ascertain the motive of the attack," the police officer said. He asked residents with information that can lead to the arrest of the culprits to come forward and help police with investigations. Pweza, who is eyeing the Kinondo MCA seat, said that the attack was politically motivated adding that he suspects his rivals in last year's general election. Kwale law court on December 19, 2017, nullified the election of Juma Maone as Kinondo MCA following a petition by Pweza. They are expected to face off in a by-election whose date is yet to be declared by the IEBC.   Read: Jubilee MCA loses seat after Kwale court nullifies election Click
