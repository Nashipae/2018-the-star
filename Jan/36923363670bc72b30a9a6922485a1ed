Two American and two Canadian citizens have been kidnapped near the northern city of Kaduna, Nigeria, police say. Two police escorts were also killed in a shootout with the kidnappers, who emerged from hiding to attack the convoy. The group, travelling in two vehicles, was reportedly attacked on their way from Kaduna to the capital Abuja, about two hours away. Parts of the Abuja-Kaduna road have been target locations for kidnappers. John Babcock, a spokesman for Global Affairs Canada, told the BBC on Wednesday they were aware of the reports of the kidnapping. "Consular officials in Nigeria are in contact with local authorities to gather additional information," he said. The individuals involved, aged between 20 and 27, include six Poles, four Belarusians and one German, police said at the time of the incident. They launched a firecracker in the car park and chained themselves to the gates before museum guards intervened. Local media reported that the group used a drone to film the disturbance, and draped a white banner with the red text "love" over the gate. In a statement, the Auschwitz museum said: "Using the symbol of Auschwitz for any kind of manifestations or happenings is outrageous and unacceptable."
