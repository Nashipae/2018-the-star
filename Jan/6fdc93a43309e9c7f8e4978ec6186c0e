Thirdway Alliance former presidential candidate Ekuru Aukot and Kiambu MP Paul Koinange have promised to pursue justice for James Kiarie.  The former Maseno University student leader died at the Neema Uhai Hospital after he was attacked by touts and drivers of Zuri Genesis Sacco and Marimba Investment Sacco in Zimmerman on December 24.  Police are yet to arrest the killers of 33-year-old motorist who was beaten to death by matatu crew.  Aukot and Koinange accused the police of frustrating efforts to get justice.  The two joined hundreds of mourners on Wednesday during Kiarie’s burial in Komo village, Thika East.  Aukot said senior police officers own vehicles in Marimba Investment sacco, which explains the slow steps in apprehending the culprits.  He said he will help the family through his law firm to pursue Kiarie’s justice.
