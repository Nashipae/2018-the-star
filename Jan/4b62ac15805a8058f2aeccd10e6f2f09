Mwalimu Rachel has been on our radios for the longest time.Â Her show on Homeboyz, Class124, was a big one, with a massive listenership and a huge following, where she always had a lesson or two to offer. She recently broke our hearts when she announced her exit from Homeboyz Radio to an unknown place. She had hyped her followers on Instagram, saying she has a big announcement for her fans and haters, of course, who also fall under fans. Her last post is what brought so much shock to the public, when she said she is leaving Homeboyz radio. In an interview with Mpasho, she opened up, saying she really will miss being on Homeboyz, as it was not only a job but something she loved waking up to as she shared her life. She said, "The thing is, I am going to miss being on radio, as it wasn't just another show, another job to pay my bills. It was a part of me, and every day, I shared a part of me, and yes, it was a big deal." When asked what is her next move, she said she will be revealing it on her YouTube channel, but as you know we always have the scoop. Rumour has it she is moving to the new radio station, NRG Radio. NRG Radio had been trending last week because of how good the setup looks. NRG is probably the next big thing, as they are even in talks of bringing in Rick Ross to the country. Well, all the best to Mwalimu Rachel and all her future endeavours. At least she will still be on our stereos.
