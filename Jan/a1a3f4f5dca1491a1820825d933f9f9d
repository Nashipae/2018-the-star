The fate of the Kenya Sevens sponsorship will be known today after a consultative meeting between Ministry of Sports, Treasury and Kenya Rugby Union. An air of uncertainty has gripped the various national teams following the termination of the sponsorship by betting firm, SportPesa last month. The sponsorship, which ran into Sh600 million for the next five years, catered for the players salaries and allowances not only for Kenya sevens but the Kenya 15s, Kenya U-20 team and the Kenya women’s team with the union receiving Sh120m every year which translates to Sh10 million every month. The union had targeted the Kenya Sevens as the most critical, owing to their involvement in the World Sevens Series, which starts at the end of the month with the Sydney and Hamilton legs. World Rugby pays for accommodation and air fare for the Sevens team for the 10 legs of the series Sources at the union have hinted that the players’ salaries for this month are intact6 but they do not know where they will find funding for the reminder of the series and the Rugby World Cup Sevens slated for San Francisco from July 20-22. The ministry held meetings with KRU officials late last week to chart the way forward with Sports Permanent Secretary Peter Kaberia asking the union to present a 3-month budget for funding from the government. KRU chairman Richard Omwela said Kaberia had promised to treasury for funding of rugby. “It’s critical we get an answer. This is big year for rugby, especially for the sevens team and Kenya 15s and without sponsorship or funding, we might be forced to terminate the contracts for Kenya Sevens players which in turn will be big blow for us,” added Omwela.
