A miner who was buried in a collapsed gold mine in Kanyasrega Nyokal has been pulled out alive after three days. Joseph Owino, 42, was rescued on Wednesday. The 50-foot-deep mine collapsed on Sunday as the miners were leaving for the day. “He was buried alive right in front of our eyes. It was like a dream,” Ismael Okech said. The miners heard him talking and started digging with their hands. “We almost lost hope on the last day, when he stopped talking. We thought we would find him dead, but his will was strong,” Okech said. Awendo subcounty commissioner Alfet Jillo, Central Sakwa MCA Edward Ouma and Disaster Management executive Kephas Nyamita organised excavators. As Owino was rushed to hospital, his co-workers shouted praises to God, wept and prayed.
