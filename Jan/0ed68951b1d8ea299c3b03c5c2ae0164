A matatu Sacco, whose crew members caused the death a former university student, will have to wait longer for a court to lift an NTSA ban against it.  High Court judge Roselyne Aburili said she will make her ruling on January 15 since she is going on vacation next week.  Marimba Sacco told the court their business has gone down, as all their buses are grounded following the suspension of its licence.  The NTSA lawyer, however, told the court the matatu driver who killed Joseph Kiarie is still at large.  He asked the Sacco officials to appear before their appeal board.  But through lawyer, Karuku Wachira, they objected saying the court has the jurisdiction to review the decision.  They said the sacco, which operates 40 vehicles, said the grounding of their matatus was hurting their business.  Kiarie died shortly after an altercation with the conductor and driver of a matatu registration number KCF 932C
