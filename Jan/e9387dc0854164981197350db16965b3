Lanky 100m hurdler Nusra Rukia is eyeing the IAAF World Youth Championships set for July 10-15 in Tampere, Finland. Nusra, a Form 3 student at St Francis Rang’ala Girls in Siaya County, represented Kenya during the World Under 18 Championships in Nairobi last year. “I’m targeting the Under-20 championships in July. I have learnt a lot since we went to camp for the U-18 up to now. The experience we got in Nairobi is invaluable,” said the 16-year-old. She is not deterred by lack of facilities including hurdles at her school. “I have participated in national events without proper training facilities. However, any athlete requires better training facilities,” said the athlete, whose personal best is 15.96 secs. Nusra, who is in her school’s basketball team, said she has improved her tactics since she represented the country. “Overcoming the hurdles and take off are areas I improved a lot and I want to perfect more on them,” added Nusra. However, for her to qualify to represent the country, she must meet the qualifying mark of 14.20 during the national trials set for June 12 at Nyayo Stadium. During the AK weekend meeting at Gusii Stadoum, Nusra finished second to Priscilla Tabunda. She clocked 16 seconds while Tabunda won in 15.08. Nusra also finished second during the first AK meeting in Kisumu. “I want to work hard in school and score B+ to enable me get a scholarship to study abroad where they have better training facilities,” said Nusra.
