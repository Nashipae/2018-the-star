Police will be involved in further investigations into the death of human rights activist Ken Wafula. Samples taken from his body by pathologists were handed over to investigators. Wafula’s death was reported as sudden because he died less than 24 hours after he was admitted to St Luke’s Hospital Eldoret. Pathologists, led by Dr Benson Macharia, on Monday said police had to be involved. They are required to handle the samples that will be taken to the Government Chemists in Nairobi. The police officers took photographs along with the samples during the postmortem at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret. “Such samples taken from the body are handled by the police,” Macharia said. Wafula will be buried on Friday at his parents’ home near Soy market in Likuyani constituency. The postmortem showed he may have died of diabetes due to very high sugar levels, blood infection and kidney problems. Wafula, 45, was director at the Centre for Human Rights and Democracy. Kipkorir Ng’etich, a programmes officer at the centre, said the activist had been well until when he complained of being sick. Dr Macharia, in a preliminary report, said Wafula had an enlarged heart and mild changes in the lungs. “The deceased was found in a coma which may have been caused by the elevated blood sugar,” Macharia said. He carried out the postmortem together with Dr Walter Nalianya from the Independent Medico-Legal Unit. Dr Nalianya said the results showed Wafula had diabetes, but full investigations will reveal the actual cause of death. Macharia said they analysed Wafula’s medical history as part of the investigations into the cause of his death.
