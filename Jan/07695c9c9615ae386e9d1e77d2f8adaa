The burial site of Yvonne Wamalwa will be turned into a national monument to preserve the history of the late VP Kijana Wamalwa, the National Museums of Kenya has said. The monument will cover the place the late VP was buried. Kitale National Museum’s curator Kizili Chole yesterday said the government has gazetted the graveyard. He said the purpose of the initiative is to ensure the museum uses its capacity to preserve the site based on the quality and standards approved for historical sites. “We have agreed with the family and plans are underway. The land has been enlarged and much more will be done after the burial,” Chole said. The museum will refurbish the site to attract visitors interested in learning about the history of the late Vice President and that of Trans Nzoia county, he said. “Our children in the current generation are not able to recall the history of this country because of lack of preservation,” he said. “Reseachers and students must be able to learn about the country’s history.”
