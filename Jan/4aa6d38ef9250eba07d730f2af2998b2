Hundreds of women took to streets on Monday to demonstrate against President Uhuru Kenyatta's "men only" Cabinet appointments. They said women are missing in the list of nine cabinet secretaries named by Uhuru on January 5. Read: Uhuru drops 13 Cabinet Secretaries, fires cops The
protesters, who marched from Uhuru Park to Harambee Avenue, demanded that the president appoints nine women to fill the remaining 13 slots. Wangechi Wachira, executive director Centre for Rights Education and Awareness (CREAW), said if Uhuru has no list of qualified women, they are ready to provide him with one. "For too long,
the women of Kenya have been intentionally excluded in decision-making and
deliberately denied the right to full representation in Parliament." "They are constantly overlooked in positions of appointments to the public
office," she added. In the petition presented to the Office of the President
at Harambee House, Wachira said it is clear from decisions of courts there
cannot be more than 2/3 of of one gender in appointive positions. "This principle has neither been adhered to by the Parliament nor has it
been given any consideration in ongoing appointments in the Cabinet." She
said Parliament should have 117 female members but only 76 women are in
the National Assembly, which is 41 short of the required number. The Senate has 21 women which is two women short of the required number. "This
has resulted to a Parliament that is improperly constituted and
operating outside of the law. The Parliament has conveniently chosen to
ignore the court orders issued by Justice John Mativo in November
2016 and March 2017," Wachira said. They also accused Parliament of failing to make legislationÂ to effect gender parity as advised by the court. Justice
Mativo, on March 28 last year, faulted Parliament for failing to
legislate the gender rule within a one year deadline as ordered earlier. Click here for the latest political news
