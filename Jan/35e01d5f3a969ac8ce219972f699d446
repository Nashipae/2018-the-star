The Watamu Association of Boat Owners and Operators on Monday protested against what they called misuse of tourism funds by the Watamu Marine National Park warden. They demanded the resignation of warden Dadley Tsingayiu and a top Coast Kenya Wildlife Service official, claiming they have not paid boat owners’ Sh1.5 million commission. The boat owners said KWS has withheld their cash since July last year. Wabo chairman Abdi Mjaidi said they have an agreement with the KWS to get commissions from park entry fees paid by tourists. “For every 10 visitors who board their boats, cash for one ticket goes to the operators,” he said. Contacted for comment, Tsingayiu denied the allegations. He accused Wabo of failing to account for the funds they receive. Tsingayiu said a few boat owners were dictating to members and imposing decisions on them. “I received complaints that although every member contributes to the kitty, when it comes to sharing the money, some are locked out. When KWS tried to intervene, Wabo officials protested,” he said. Mjaidi said the fund was set up in 2014 after the state raised park entry fees from $10 (Sh1,000 ) per tourist to $20 ( 2,000 ). Tourists stayed away from the reserve because of the increased fees. “To promote the park KWS entered into a pact with Wabo to earn a commission for bringing tourists,” he said. Mjaidi accused the warden and the KWS official of colluding to split their association.
