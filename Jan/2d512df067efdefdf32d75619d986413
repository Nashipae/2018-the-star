Week three of January 2018 the year of “Maaaaahhh!!!!! #Maaaaaahhh! Is a slang word used too describe Shock or Surprise! Hence, 2018 is the year of maaaahhh because of all the surprising shit pooping all over without notice. Talking of surprises, the President hasn’t named the full Cabinet. So, we still have guys in office, who are supposedly fired! Nairobi Governor has no Deputy and he doesn’t care. In fact, last weekend he was in the Coast trying to reclaim the relative's land. Still in politricks, RAO has suggested  he will go ahead with his swearing-in, even thou it means doing it in exile! Yeah with less than 20 days of 365 days of 2018, it feels like the year is already 300 days in. ION, men are celebrating all over the world with introduction of the android sex doll what #TheRaverend likes too refer to as #RobotBae! RobotBae is a dream come true. Now, men can finally watch sports without interruptions. Men can talk to any woman without questions, men don’t have too remember her birthday or get jack shit for valentines!!! Men can now focus on building the world Period! Because you don’t have too worry what RobotBae has been doing all day, because she is stuck in the closet where you left her! Men can now have sex around the clock because RobotBae is always in the mood she doesn’t do mood swings and periods! It’s happy day to be a man, especially when recent research showed that men are the weaker sex compared to women...So all you women complaining about #RobotBae asking if she can cook? Can she get Pregaz or how will you introduce her to your parents. All of a sudden, the girl child feels that cooking, washing and all, are women duties...Women have been using dildos ever since and the boy child never said anything! Now that men have RoboBae to even the odds all of a sudden their asking: Does it show emotions, can RoboBae converse, can it cook does it get pregnant? #TheRaverends Questions to all the women hating on RoboBae is very simple can Dildos & Cucumbers do all the above??? 2018 dowry price is down by 90% dropped the marriage Biashara has collapsed  like the Quil business! In fact, only men available will be the broke once who can’t afford RobotBae! The scramble for husbands is on before RoboBae land in Kenya....So women start picking all calls including the once from that guy with bad teeth and smells damu because you can’t afford to be picky!!! As Kenyan men celebrate RoboBae clubs in Nairobi are still under siege with the county government cracking down on noise pollution in clubs situated around residential areas....Last weekend, B club, Kiza, Space Lounge and Jiweke were all under lockdown, with staff and Djs, who reported to work, getting arrested in the process. Something that didn’t make sense because the club closure was due to noise pollution and not the employees of the establishment...#TheRaverend made a quick spot in all the clubs affected by the Nema ban and the whole week the club owners were busy working day and night trying to make changes that included sound proofing of the clubs too conform with the set Neema guidelines. #TheRaverend expects Space lounge x Bclub x Kiza to be operational tonight after Neema and county inspections!!!!
