Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday in Kitale, officer in charge of lands Pascal Wekesa said since the waiver of interest in November 2017 they had a target of recovering Sh50 million.They fell short. 100 PER CENT WAIVER The county granted a 100 per cent waiver of interest and penalties on rates if landowers paid between November 23 and December 22. “We had targeted to get 50 million but now we are at Sh7 million. The response has been low,” he said. Wekesa applauded Kenya Creameries Cooperatives and Kenya Seed Company for paying their land rates.County Deputy Governor Stanley Tarus has said measures will be taken against all defaulters. “We will soon start to repossess all plots that have not been paid for and defaulters taken to court,” he said. Taurus said that those who have not cleared debts will be denied approvals for development. SERVICES MAY BE GROUNDED He said the county urgently requires the money for services. “Taxes are a vital component of our budget. If the dues are not collected, vital services in the county may be grounded,” he said. He complained that the town’s expansion programmes have been hindered by lack of land, yet some prime plots remaine idle. “We are failing in our service delivery because of the huge monies owed to the county. A lot of projects are stuck,” he said. Tarus said the county administration was open to dialogue with land owners on any issue concerning land rates. Tarus warned those bent on defaulting that the county will not hesitate to recover the money. The county government has given defaulters until January 31 to clear their debts. “Any rates that remain unpaid after the waiver will revert to the principal amount, plus interest and penalties,” he said. The county will take legal measures to recover the rates.
