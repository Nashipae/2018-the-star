Bomet Governor Joyce Laboso on Sunday told residents that Jubilee has not “forgotten us” in government appointments. Laboso urged residents to be patient, saying she was equally shocked at why the county did not get a slot. “Let’s be patient because we know there are some good plans in store for us. We should not politicise the whole issue,” she said at Siongiroi AGC Church in Bomet. She sought to calm disgruntled residents who complained of being sidelined by the President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration. Laboso said that even though the county did not get any position among those announced by Uhuru on Friday, she remained optimistic the county will still be considered for other posts. She promised to talk to Uhuru and DP William Ruto to reward the county for supporting them at the polls. “You all know William loves us. He loves Bomet. So let’s give him time. We shall still talk to him,” she said. She also promised to ensure former Governor Isaac Rutto is rewarded by the Jubilee administration for his support.
