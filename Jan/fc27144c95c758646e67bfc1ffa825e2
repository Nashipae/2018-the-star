 The University of Embu administration has achieved several milestones despite the divisive political environment in the last five years, the management has said. Chancellor Paul Musili said since the university was started five years ago, it has gone through turbulent times including strained financial resources and limited government funding. He said they have also had the challenges of inadequate facilities for academic, welfare and research, inadequate internal road infrastructure, drainage and lighting, and attracting and retaining qualified staff. Musili said the university has increased the number of students from 123 students to more than 5,000. He spoke at the university on Friday. Musili attributed the successes to the University council chairperson Margaret Gikuhi, vice chancellor Daniel Mugendi and the university management. He also commended the national government for its continued support.
