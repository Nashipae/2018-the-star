Foreign embassies should revoke the visas of MPs supporting the swearing-in of Raila Odinga as the People’s President, Kieni MP Kanini Kega has said. He said the revocation should be extended to NASA leaders at the core of the swearing-in slated for January 30. Kega said the NASA leaders are signing affidavits to support illegitimate leaders. He spoke in Muthua-ini, Nyeri town, on Friday, during the burial of Esther Nyang’endo, 81. Tetu MP Gichuhi Mwangi was present. Kega said the international community should be committed to ensuring the country is peaceful. He said cancelling the NASA MPs’ will ensure they do not leave the country “after causing chaos”. Kega said NASA’s supporters should also be denied visas. NASA legislators began signing affidavits last week supporting the swearing-in of Raila. Kega said choices have consequences and Raila should be ready to face the full force of the law because “his actions amount to treason”. Click here for the latest political news
