Ugandan fans are praying for the quick recovery of Mowzey Radio, one half of the popular duo Radio and Weasel, who is in a coma. Mowzey was reportedly involved in a bar brawl on Monday night at Freedom Beach, Entebbe, sustaining a head injury that led to a blood clot. It is yet to be understood what led to the fight. However, reports by friends close to the Star say Radio was "shoved by a bouncer, landing his head on a sharp object that inflicted a deep cut". Ugandan singer Michael Ross wrote on social media, "To all fans of Radio and Weasel and well wishers, please say a prayer for our brother Mowzey Radio who is in hospital now under going head surgery after a brawl last night."
