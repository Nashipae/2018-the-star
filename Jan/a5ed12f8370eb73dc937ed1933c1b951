President Uhuru Kenyatta has been accused of snubbing Embu in Cabinet appointments, despite their voting for him in elections. Maendeleo Chap Chap’s Joshua Kanake said neighbouring counties benefitted from appointments, with some getting more than one, but Embu people’s support “was taken for granted”. “Embu we were given a raw deal. It’s high time Embu people realise that we are being taken for a ride. I would ask anybody do an analysis of the appointed CSs and tell me whether there is actually an appointee from Embu. There is not,” the politician said.
