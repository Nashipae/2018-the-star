Four people were critically injured in an accident involving a PSV matatu which hit a concrete electricity pole at Kiganjo, Ol Kalou on Saturday. The injured, who were rushed to J.M. Memorial Hospital, told the Star that the driver was drunk. The driver lost control of the vehicle while negotiating the sharp corner near the Nyandarua department of water and environment offices. At least 15 passengers were on board the 14-seater matatu, which belongs to Nuclear Sacco, at the time of the accident. Winnie Waithera, 20, whose leg was fractured said the driver did not heed their complaints after they condemned his reckless moves. "Before we crashed, he had missed hitting a motorbike rider. When he noticed he was about to hit the pole, he jumped out and ran away." "After the crash, I noticed the driver was out. I pleaded with him to help us out but he refused," Joseph Kariuki, one of the survivors, said. They were taken to the hospital by a good Samaritan after which they were referred to Nakuru PGH for further treatment. Those who sustained minor injuries were treated and discharged. Nyandarua Central police boss Wilson Kosgei said he has instructed the traffic police commander to arrest the driver so that he is charged. He urged the residents to shun vehicles whose drivers they notice are drunk and notify the police for immediate action. The accident followed in the wake of deaths of over 200 people during the festive season which saw NTSA ban night travel to end more deaths. The decision resulted in a bus rush across the country as thousands sought to report back to their workplaces and schools.
