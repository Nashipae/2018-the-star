The Kisumu government has launched a programme to address solid waste management. Deputy Governor Mathews Owili said environment protection and waste management are a priority. He spoke at the Jomo Kenyatta Sports Ground on Monday during the launch of 18 skips to be distributed to the seven subcounties for waste disposal in trading centres. Owili said, “This is in line with the governor’s manifesto on the conservation and protection of the environment as well as well as addressing public health issues.” He called for joint efforts in waste management. Senator Fred Outa said he will work with Owili to ensure the governor’s manifesto is realised. Environment executive Salmon Orimba said he will ensure the skips are used properly.
