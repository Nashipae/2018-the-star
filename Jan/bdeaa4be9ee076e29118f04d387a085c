Activist Okiya Omtatah has challenged President Uhuru Kenyatta’s new list of Cabinet nominees. He filed an urgent application at the Milimani law courts yesterday. Omtatah has accused the President of breaching the Constitution and ignoring the rule of law by creating non-existent positions. He said Uhuru committed an illegality by creating the position of Chief Administrative Secretaries. Omtatah said handpicking and appointing people to the positions without subjecting them to a merit based competitive recruitment process, is a violation of the law. Fresh vetting “There was no public participation, and, therefore, the decision to have CAS in the Cabinet is null and void,” he said. The activist is also unhappy that the Cabinet Secretaries, who have been reappointed to serve in the President’s second term, are being selected without being vetted. He argues Cabinet Secretaries are not transferable from one term of the President to another, and, therefore, they must be vetted afresh by the National Assembly. Omtatah is aggrieved that Uhuru appointed people as Principal Secretaries without first being identified and recommended by the Public Service Commission through a competitive and merit-based recruitment. Competitive recruitment He said Uhuru and the PSC are bound by the Constitution and other laws of Kenya, and have no capacity to act beyond or outside them. The spirit of the Constitution must be upheld, he said. Omtatah wants the court to quash Uhuru’s list and prohibit National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi from receiving the list for vetting. He also seeks another order to compel the President to submit a list of all nominees for vetting by Parliament, whether or not they served in the first term. Omtatah wants the PSC compelled to announce vacant PS positions in all ministries. Hopefuls should be recruited competitive and recommended to the Presidents for appointment.
