A man has been detained at Bungoma police station on allegations that he killed his wife before hanging her body on a tree to cover up the crime. Ben Wafula, 46, is suspected to have killed Sara Nyanyama, 37, on Friday night after a domestic quarrel. He was arrested on Saturday after family members discovered the woman's body. They said that the woman of four never showed any sign of taking her life, hence dismissed the husband's claim on the same. Police have launched a probe to ascertain the circumstances under which the woman died. Alex Wafula, the woman's son, said they examined their mother's body and doubted whether she committed suicide. He said the shoes his mother was putting on looked clean and must have been worn on her feet after being killed. "This is very sad. We want the police to carry out an intensive probe and bring to book whoever killed our mother, even if itâ€™s our dad," he said. Wafula described his father as a harsh man who has subjected them to a lot of suffering. The body was taken to Bungoma referral hospital awaiting postmortem on Monday. Kennedy Wamukota, an elder, said that the body of the woman will have to be buried after Bukusu traditional rites have been performed. Click here for the latest political stories
