DCI officers have been accused of coercing and detaining seven Nepalese at a popular club in Nyali on Thursday. The foreigners are among 10 women arrested by the Transnational Organised Crime Unit detectives attached to the DCIO over human trafficking claims. The arrest took place on December 30 at Sham House and Bar. Owners Zubair Deen and Shama Deen were also detained. Out of the 10, three Asian women were released to the Indian High Commissioner after recording statements with the officers. Documents obtained by the Star indicate the seven were produced before the Shanzu law court on Tuesday. The sworn affidavit read in part: “We pray to the court to grant us custodial orders of four days to enable us organise an interpreter from Nepalese Embassy in Nairobi to enable us take their statement.” The request was granted. But on Thursday, the court ordered the seven to be released. However, the foreigners were detained by the officers. Reports which were crroborated by relatives and lawyer of the accused suggest police acted on orders from their superiors. Lawyer Cliff Ombeta said the seven were illegally detained after officers investigating the case were “compromised by rival businessmen believed to be well connected with security agents”. Ombeta said there was a plot to deport the seven without valid reason. “The women had proper working permits and allegations they are locked in the country are not true,” he said.
