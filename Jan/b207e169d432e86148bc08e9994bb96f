Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has asked Education CS Fred Matiang'i to reverse the transfer of principals in the area, saying it will affect schools' performance. The Teachers Service Commission last month transferred 180 principals, including those of Friends School Kamusinga, Chesamis Boys High and Lugulu Girls. Speaking when he met principals from Bungoma county, Wangamati said he is opposed to the transfers. “TSC should not bring failures to our schools. We will not accept a principal who had a mean score of 5.9 to come to a school that had a mean score of 9 and above. They will bring down our schools,” Wangamati said. He told the new principals to return to their previous work stations or ask TSC to redeploy them to other schools outside the county, failing which they will be kicked out by force.  "I will not entertain mediocrity in our schools. As an elected leader, I have to ensure we improve academically. Let TSC and Matiang'i understand that Bungoma is not a dumping site for failures," Wangamati said. Bungoma Kuppet chair Denson Barasa said they will not work with the new principals. Among the schools affected by the transfers include Friends School Kamusinga, Lugulu Girls, St Luke’s Kimilili Boys, Chesamis High and Cardinal Otunga Girls. Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) Chairman, Denson Barasa, said that they won't accept to work with those principals until they are transferred elsewhere. Barasa asked the commission to redeploy the principals in other schools saying that they will not be allowed to stay in the schools. "Let TSC transfer them elsewhere they are no longer needed, they can head other schools but not those ones they have been deployed to head," said the unionist
