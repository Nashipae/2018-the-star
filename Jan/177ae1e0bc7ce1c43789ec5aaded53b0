 Leaders and traders from Central Kenya have accused MPs Moses Kuria (Gatundu) and Ngunjiri Wambugu (Nyeri Town) of being political brokers. This comes a day after the MPs clashed at a church service in Nyeri over Mt Kenya’s support for Deputy President William Ruto for the top seat in 2022.  Kenya Coalition for Political Progress chairman James Mwangi said the leaders are fuelling divisions in Jubilee. He said the succession debate is ill-timed.  Speaking to journalists in Thika yesterday, Mwangi called Ngunjiri a NASA mole who was sent to stir up trouble in JP. “Ngunjiri was once NASA leader Raila Odinga’s spokesperson. He is not Mt Kenya region’s mouthpiece,” Mwangi said. Businessmen Lukas Ndegwa and James Murimi said traders are unhappy with the reckless remarks. They said President Uhuru Kenyatta and the DP need to be supported to heal the nation after a brutal election.  “It seems these people never learn. Didn’t they see what politics to the economy because of prolonged campaigns?” Ndegwa asked.
