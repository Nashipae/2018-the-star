Jubilee leaders in Baringo county skipped celebrations to mark the nomination of Simon Chelugui as Water CS. The residents are demanding more Cabinet slots. The poorly-attended ceremony was held in Kabarnet town on Monday. It attracted a handful of youth who criticised President Uhuru Kenyatta (pictured) and the new Cabinet list. “We supported and voted for Jubilee. We gave them more than 70 per cent in the August 8 General Election and the repeat polls on October 26,” said youth leader and civil society crusader Isaiah Biwott.
