Kenyan teenager, Muqtadir Nimji, will compete at the 2018 British Junior Open set for between January 3 and 7 in Birmingham, England. Sitting in position three in the Kenya Squash and Rackets Association’s rankings with 9312 points, Muqtadir seeks to develop his prowess in the sport. This will be the second time in slightly under 18 months that the Peponi School student will play in Britain. However, he missed another opportunity to play abroad just to honour KSRA trials for the World Men’s Team Championships in October, only for the team selection to turn out to be dubious. Meanwhile, Muqtadir has been offered a place at the Trinity College — Hartford, Connecticut. The Year 13 student at Peponi School is keen to take up the offer when he completes his education at the year. “It is an honour that coaches and scouts far away from home have seen and acknowledged the potential I have in the game. Now the onus is on me to perform well both in class and in the courts and make it to the college, said Muqtadir. “The Birmingham outing will be part of my growth journey and I will push harder and bring home a good report.” Muqtadir won three of the seven tournaments he took part in last year including Public Service Open, Izaak Walton and Visa Oshwal.
