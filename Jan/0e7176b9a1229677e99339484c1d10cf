Lamu county administration and leaders have launched Operation Rudisha Mtoto Shule to ensure all students admitted to Form OneÂ  are enroled. Many students fail to report for lack of fees. Many primary school children have dropped out of school. Speaking during the launch at the Huduma Centre yesterday, county commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo (pictured) said only 48 per cent of those called to Form One have reported. The rest are at home. Kitiyo said officers are going house to house in search of truant children and sending them to school. Parents will be arrested for keeping children at home.
