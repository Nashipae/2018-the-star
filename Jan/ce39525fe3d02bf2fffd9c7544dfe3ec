Security has been restored in Ijara subcounty, Garissa county following Saturday morning raid by al-Shabaab militants. Officers drawn from the KDF, rural
border patrol unit and the regal police are pursuing the militants. Mohamud Saleh, the regional commissioner, assured residents that security agencies were in control of the situation, and urged them to volunteer information
that will help nab the culprits. “They militants can run but they can not hide. We will smoke them out of their hideout,” Saleh said. During the
1 am incident, the militant group believed to be numbering 100 set fire on two police stations before
escaping with a police Land Cruiser.  They
also vandalized a safaricom mast, cutting off communication in the area.   Last week, a man suspected to
have fled from the militia group was arrested by Motile area chief and
handed over to anti terror military officers based in Gamba in Tana delta. Two youth, a boda boda operator and a standard seven leaver from Korisa Primary School have also been kidnapped by the militants, who accused them of spying on them. Both have been missing for
the last three month. Chiefs and their assistants do not
spend nights in their houses for fear of  being
killed or kidnapped. The group is suspected to have fled from onslaught by the somali national army and Amisom forces in the eastern enclave. Despite having two
military bases in Hulugho and Bothai area, the militants hide in the thick Boni
forest, Taqsiley and Walkon areas. The forest extends from kismayu in Somalia, through Hulugho, Ijara subcounty to Tana Delta. They have also been radicalising youth from the area.
