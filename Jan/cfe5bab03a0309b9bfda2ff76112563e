The Matatu Owners’ Association has criticised the move by the NTSA to ban night bus travel. Coast chairman Saalim Mbarak said the ban has hurt countryside bus companies “that comply with traffic rules and have been vetted and approved”. Mbarak said only city operators that had been issued temporary TLB licences to carry passengers travelling upcountry should be affected. “These vehicles took advantage of the festive season to operate on some routes, resulting in accidents,” he said. Only one driver Mbarak said the city vehicles have only one driver throughout the journey. “The upcountry buses and companies have two drivers alternating at specific points,” he said on the phone yesterday. The NTSA on Monday restricted long-distance passenger service vehicles to travel between 6am and 7pm. The ban followed over 330 road deaths in December alone - the majority occurring at night. “The decision was arrived at after careful consideration and discussions for the public good and safety,” NTSA director general Francis Meja said in a statement. Last week, the authority revoked temporary TLB licences issued to city operators. Meja said the vehicles were supposed to be for hire, but instead, they were used for fare-paying passengers. Mbarak said compliant bus companies will suffer loses. “It will be unfair to ban them. They should continue to operate. The unapproved vehicles can be banned until they comply,” he said. Nasa leader criticises association NASA co-principal Moses Wetang’ula called for the for disbandment of the NTSA.  He said the directive will hurt the economy. “You can’t run a 24-hour economy by curtailing workers’ travel. The world is on the move,” he tweeted.
