Strathmore University will send only the women’s hockey team to the Africa Cup of Club Championship set for January 20-28 in Accra, Ghana. The institution was to field the men and women’s teams after both sides qualified for the annual event by virtue of emerging first and second at the end of their respective 2016 Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) Premier League season. However, the institution has been forced to settle for the women’s team due to financial constraints. A source from Starthmore confirmed that the Madaraka-based outfit was in dilemma and had to look at all the perimeters to decide on which team to send to the West Africa event. The source, however, said the institution was willing to send both sides save for the financial hiccup. “They had to look at the form and status of both teams to determine which team should be fielded. Form in sense of the performance and status of where the teams finished at the end of the season,” the source revealed. The source added: “The men’s team finished first at the end of the season but if you look at their run during the entire season it was not good enough. The women on the other hand were steady in their contention and showed that they can challenge for the trophy despite finishing behind Orange with only two points separating them.” The women’s side return to the African showpiece having missed the last edition that was held in Nairobi.
