The High Court has dismissed an application for scrutiny of votes in a petition filed by Starehe politician Steve Mbogo. Mbogo is challenging the election of MP Charles Njagua, alias Jaguar. Justice Fred Ochieng ruled that it appeared Mbogo asked for scrutiny because he hoped to use the exercise to get more information, which could be useful in his petition. “Scrutiny must never be a process through which a party can obtain new or further evidence. I find no merit in the application for scrutiny,” he said. Ochieng also ruled that the petitioner did not make a case for the availing of polling station diaries. He said the IEBC cannot be faulted for not making available all the polling station diaries. “I also find no reason to warrant an order compelling the IEBC to make available all the polling stations’ diaries, which it had not already provided,” the judge said. Mbogo had filed for a scrutiny of all votes cast in his favour during the August 8 General Election. He wanted the court to issue orders compelling the IEBC to supply him with the original Forms 35A, 35B and 35C . Mbogo wanted printed copies of the registered voters in all polling stations and polling day diaries and access to the KIEMS kits. The petitioner had argued that there were three sets of results differing from those in Form 35B and the online portal.
