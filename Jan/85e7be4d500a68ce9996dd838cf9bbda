Isiolo governor Mohamed Kuti has called for expansion of the Isiolo International Airport runway to three kilometres from the current 1.4 kilometres, to accommodate large aircraft. Inadequate facilities such as short runways, insufficient lighting to enable planes to land or take off at night and an efficient control tower, have hindered operations at the facility. He toured the facility with LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority chairman Francis Muthaura and other board members. “I’m cautioning developers against constructing tall buildings close to the airport or along flight paths as such buildings interfere with safe landing and take-off of planes,” he said. Only one airline has been operating at the facility since it was opened last July. It operates a passenger service using small aircraft due to the short runway. The facility lacks crucial cargo sheds hence cargo planes cannot land and take off. LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority Chairman Francis Muthaura said the authority was happy with progress at the airport. Miraa businessmen from neighbouring Meru County, and flower and wheat farmers from Laikipia County, still conduct their business through Nairobi’s Wilson Airport due to the shortcomings at the Isiolo International Airport.
