US ambassador Robert Godec on Wednesday launched a guide to community engagement for power projects in Kenya. The guide, launched at the Vancouver Foreign Ministers' meeting in Nairobi, outlines how electricity producers can best engage with consumers. Godec said the blueprint is a critical addition to the US' Power Africa partnership. "It is designed to offer power project developers information on community engagement," he said. Energy CS Charles Keter said the government supports all efforts to develop electricity infrastructure in a way that respects the values and traditions of the countryâ€™s diverse communities. "This guide from Power Africa is a comprehensive and practical tool that will help developers foster inclusive and mutually beneficial relationships with communities across Kenya, and ultimately help us reach our shared goals of Universal Electricity Access," Keter said. Community concerns have impacted the completion of Kenya's dynamic, private sector-driven power projects. The guide will provide approaches on the best community engagement practices for infrastructure developers, at each project stage, as well as pitfalls they should avoid. In Kenya, Power Africa is coordinated by the US Agency for International Development (USAid). The document was developed with input from local communities, government agencies, private sector developers, finance institutions, as well as Kenyan and international civil society organisations. It is customised to reflect country-specific laws, customs and institutions that developers in Kenya must navigate. Also in attendance of the launch was Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, and UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
