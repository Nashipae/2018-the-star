Bandari Sacco allays fears members’ productivity at Mombasa port may be negatively affected BY BRIAN OTIENO @Yobramos4                                Thursday, January 11, 2018 Officials of the 15,000-member Bandari Sacco have allayed fears that squatters will subdivide their land in Nguu Tatu, Kisauni. The sacco started putting up a perimetre wall around the plot on Tuesday amid protest from the squatters. The 5,000 squatters have threatened to pull down the wall and subdivide the 60-acre piece of land. Sacco members said they will not allow their investment to go to be grabbed. “We have saved for a long time to invest in the land,” a member said on Tuesday. Sacco chairman Kenneth Sungu on Wednesday said the squatters threat had caused a lot of tension among members. “We fear this might affect productivity of our members," Sungu told the Star in his office on Wednesday. He allayed fears the squatters will subdivide the plot, saying the plot is secure. Dock Workers Union yesterday said the sacco activities cannot affect the productivity of workers. "Port management and sacco operations are distinct entities," DWU secretary general Simon Sang said.
