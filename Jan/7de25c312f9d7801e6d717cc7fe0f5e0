The Tana River government has banned county seminars from being held in Malindi and Mombasa. Governor Dhadho Godhana said all seminars should be done in Tana River to boost revenue. This also means there will be no more trips outside the county to enable the county to promote its own facilities and services. Godhana ordered all motor vehicles belonging to the government to be repaired in the county and not outside as has been the trend. Addressing residents during New Year’s Eve celebrations in Hola at the county headquarters, Godhana directed that all government vehicles in garages outside the county be towed to Tana River. “Malindi and Mombasa conferences have been banned effective from January 2. For all vehicles in garages in Malindi, I order those in charge of transport to return them. The vehicles which are not ready should be towed to Tana River county,” he said. Godhana said the move was in line with the country’s projection to boost revenue collection to Sh150 million this year. He told businesspeople in Tana River county to upgrade their garages and buy modern equipment to enable them to do the work. Godhana called for investment in conference facilities.
