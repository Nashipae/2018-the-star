Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja has awarded at least 200 students from the county with secondary school scholarships. The Samboja Foundation, under the Imarisha Elimu initiative, has selected beneficiaries from vulnerable families from all the 20 wards in the county. "Our long-term and main agenda is improving our education standards in the county," Samboja said. "Most of the students are orphans while others have been brought up by single parents and some come from very poor families." The governor also announced that he has plans to sponsor top performing students in KCSE to undertake specialised courses from June. "We want to sponsor them for courses like medicine and engineering so that they can help in building our county in the future." "We shall enter into an agreement with them so that they work in the county after completing their courses," the governor said. The scholarship will cater for students’ fees for the three terms. "I only expect one thing from you, kupita mtihani kwanzia first term (pass your exams from first term)," Samboja told the beneficiaries. He also promised to give students pocket money for those in boarding school and food items for those in day schools. Click here for the latest political news
