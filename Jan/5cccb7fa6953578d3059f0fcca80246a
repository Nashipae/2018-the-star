Uasin Gishu county has flattened more than 100 kiosks and other illegal structures on road reserves on the Eldoret-Iten road. MCAs in Eldoret stormed Governor Jackson Mandago’s office on Friday, demanding the release of a colleague arrested by Uasin Gishu county askaris following the demolitions. Nominated MCA Samora Machel was locked up in the court cells. He attempted to block the askaris from demolishing the illegal structures at Kimumu on the Eldoret-Iten road. There was a scuffle between ward representatives, led by Minority leader Ramadhan Ali, and the askaris. Mandago was not in the office, but the MCA was released after his colleagues intervened. “I went to protect my people whose property was being destroyed by the askaris. They could not understand me so they decided to arrest me,” Machel told journalists. The MCA said the assembly approved the demolition of structures on road reserves, but said owners were yet to be notified.
