West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo has scoffed at principals whose schools were involved in exam cheating. This was after KNEC cancelled KCSE results of Ortum Boys and St Cecilia, Chepareria Girls over claims of cheating. The heads of the affected schools were moved to other institutions in the recent mass principal's transfers. Ortum Boys High principal Jonathan Siwanyang was transferred to Chewoyet Boys. Mary Ruto of Chepareria Girls was transferred to St Joseph Girls in Trans Nzoia county. Lonyangapuo asked the ministry of education to cancel the transfers so that the teachers can solve the problems in their previous stations. "The principals knew the mess they had done in their previous schools. Thatâ€™s why they hurried left to their current stations." "We rejected Ortum Boys principal being transferred to Chewoyet because his performance was questionable," the governor said. The governor took a swipe at acting Education CS Fred Matiang'i for not consulting with leaders and all education stakeholders on the transfers. "Matiang'i should not pretend to know much. He should consult with local leaders before transferring teachers," he said. He said learning in the two schools may be affected if the principals are interdicted. KNEC said the schools' heads will be punished. "Ortum Boys was ranked number 26 nationally and the future of 320 boys has been ruined. Parents have lost millions of shillings due to the nullification." The governor spoke on Wednesday during a tour of Kachepmogen secondary school.
