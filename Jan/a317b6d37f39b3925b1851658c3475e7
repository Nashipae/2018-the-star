It reflects on general policies that relate to the community’s progress while outlining challenges which require attention. The plenary will take place from Monday to February 9. It  is the second meeting of the First Session of the Fourth Assembly. However, it is unclear whether Burundi and Tanzania will participate in the session. The two countries boycotted the election of speaker Marting Ngoga of Rwanda in December. During the three-week period, the regional assembly will debate the EAC Oaths Bill, 2017, the EAC Statistics Bureau Bill, 2017 and the EAC Monetary Institute Bill, 2017. The assembly will also establish and elect members to the six committees of the assembly. They are the Committee on Accounts, General Purpose and Regional Affairs and Conflict Resolution. Others are the Committee on Legal Rules and Privileges, the Committee on Communication, Trade and Investment, and the Committee on Agriculture, Tourism and Natural Resources.
