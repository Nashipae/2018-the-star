St Francis Rang’ala Girls Secondary School principal Susan Owino has welcomed a government directive for 100% transition from primary to secondary schools. Through the Ministry of Education, the state issued an order that all pupils who sat KCPE exams last year should be offered chances in form one, irrespective of the points. Owino, who spoke to the Star at the school yesterday said the move will give all candidates an equal opportunity to access secondary education. She said weak students can improve if given a conducive learning environment. Rang’ala was fifth in the county.
