Just like any other human being, singer Wahu Kagwi has had her own fair share of tears and joy in 2017. She took to social media to share with her fans her journey through 2017. She wrote, "2017.....
What oh what a year. We saw an electioneering season that put alot of
strain on the country. I lost my dear friend and brother Big Kev after a
long battle with cancer.... My husband spent 10 days in HDU after being
diagnosed with a brain haemorage. Oh the tears I have cried in 2017!  I
will not miss the tears and pain. I'm ready to leave those behind. on
the flip side however.... 2017 .... You presented me with a beautiful
opportunity to seek first the kingdom of God. To seek my Fathers face
fervently and with everything I am and have... IM READY FOR YOU! My
Father. Reign over my year... Go before my country. And bless us! Happy new year!!!! " Â
