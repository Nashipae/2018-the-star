Lamu Senator Anwar Loitiptip has said he will, in seven days, release the names of 20 individuals who grabbed more than 350,000 acres. The land ownership was revoked by the National Lands Commission in 2015. The titles were revoked after they were found to have been irregularly issued. The land was handed over to the Lamu government. But Loitiptip yesterday said the land was secretly re-grabbed by the same individuals. The senator will release the names of 10 people whom he said run a cartel that supplies Lamu with drugs. The individuals frustrate efforts to win the war on drugs at the Coast. Speaking in Lamu town, Loitiptip said the names consist of county security bosses, politicians, tycoons,chiefs and Nyumba Kumi administrators. “They are powerful individuals, respected even. I shall make the big reveal with the hope that action will be taken,” he said.
