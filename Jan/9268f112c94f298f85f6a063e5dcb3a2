Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi joined other revellers in ushering in the New Year in style at the Meru National Polytechnic. The event, titled 'Tuvukie Meru', featured fireworks and performances. MC Jesse and gospel singer Daddy Owen were the main artistes. Kiraitu, who also celebrated his birthday, said he was happy to see Meru talent grow. "We have a lot of talent in Meru and I'm proud of it. Very many people do not know Jesse is son of the Meru soil. He comes from Igoji in South Imenti," he said. MC Jesse, who arrived on stage 30 minutes to midnight, led the countdown to the New Year. After the fireworks display, Kiraitu, Deputy Governor Titus Ntochiu and Kiraitu's wife Prisila took to the stage. Kiraitu showed the young revellers that he could still do some dancing. He even referred to Jesse as MC and called out the DJ. He said he will empower the youth to grow their talents. "We will work closely with MC Jesse so he can mentor other upcoming artistes," Kiraitu said. Other Meru artistes who performed include Koffi Machete and Nassizu Murume
