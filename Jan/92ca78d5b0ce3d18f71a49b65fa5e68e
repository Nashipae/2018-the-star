The government has been urged to build latrines in all primary schools in Kiambu county to improve hygiene in the institutions. Leaders said boys and girls were scrambling for latrines with most schools having just one for the students to share.They gave the example of Kanyeki-ini Primary School in Lari, which has one latrine. During a public participation organised by area MP Jonah Mburu yesterday , residents said the learners were at a risk of contracting water- borne diseases.Teachers at the school use a latrine at the nearby Loromo AP camp. Nyambare sub-location Nyumba Kumi chairman Chege Lore said the pupils suffer because the latrine does not have a urinal for boys. “The block has three toilets and boys don’t have a urinal. They all scramble at the facility during break time,” Lore said. Mburu was accompanied by area MCA Joseph Karichu, assistant county commissioner Caroline Chepkemoi, traders’ chairman Paul Ngugi, among other leaders. Speaking at Nyambare trading center, Lore asked the government not to close the schools but improve their hygiene. Kanyeki-ini head teacher Herman Kimani said he has applied for funding from CDF to construct 20 latrines in the school. The MP said he will release the funds. Kiambu West Knut secretary Michael Muna said sanitation was key in schools. “Teachers would also love to work in stations with good hygiene,” Muna said.
