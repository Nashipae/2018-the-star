The conduct of the
MCAs and their ability to perform their roles are expected to improve
after the County Assemblies Forum agreed with a Kenya School of Government to
train them. The Forum on Friday decided to train the 2249 ward representatives to improve their
ability to perform their oversight, representation and legislation
roles. CAF chairman Johnson
Osoi and KSG director general Ludeki Chweya struck the deal at a
meeting held at the school. “We are here with
a view of collaborating with the school to train MCAs countrywide on
a standardized programme of training,” Osoi said. “It is imperative
to train them so that shift from the mentality of the councilors in
the former local authorities to be legislators that the drafters of
the constitution envisaged,” he said. The training, which
will be undertaken by KSG's Centre for devolution studies, will
mainly focus budgeting and legislation processes and culture change. Osoi, who is also
Kajiado county assembly speaker, said most of the local legislators
do not either understand or appreciate budget making yet that is one of their mandate. “Devolution is
about devolving resources. Service delivery is about resources. You
cannot deliver services if you have no resources and how to manage
them,” he said “MCAs are expected
to interrogate the budget process up to implementation,” he added. Osoi noted that some
MCAs, especially those that served as councilors in the former local
authorizes, have not aligned their practice with the new Constitution
thus the need for training. Several MCAs across
the country have been fighting in public and in the chambers.
Their conduct have been put under criticism. The EACC has already summoned some for grilling. Chweya said they
will form a technical committee between the school and the forum to
come up with fine details, including the programme's budget. The training will be
conducted at the main campus in Nairobi and across the four satellite
campuses across the country.
