Former Kisumu minority leader Eddy Anayo will run in the repeat election of the speaker in Migori if the unseated MCA is blocked from the rerun. North Kadem MCA Boaz Okoth was elected speaker on August 31 but the election was nullified after it was marred by violence. Assembly employer Charles Alao called for Okoth to be barred from contesting because he is yet to resign as MCA, as required by law. The High Court in Migori was to rule on the matter. Anayo and Okoth share the same ward and village in Nyatike constituency and are both close to Migori Governor Okoth Obado. On Sunday, Anayo told the Star on the phone that many residents urged him to vie for North Kadem MCA. “I told them I will never vie as MCA in Nyatike, which I consider below me now, but I have declared interest to be Migori speaker if attempts to block Okoth sail through,” Anayo said.
