NASA MPs on Wednesday began signing affidavits supporting Raila Odinga's oath scheduled for January 30. This will be the legal instrument binding them to the resolution of recognising Raila and Kalonzo Musyoka as president and deputy president of the People's Assembly. The leaders, who had a meeting with Opposition leader on Wednesday, asked Kenyans to implore upon their leaders to sign the document as they seek electoral justice. "Ask your elected leader whether they have signed this instrument and if they have not, we leave it to the wisdom of wananchi to deal with them politically," ODM communications director Philip Etale said. Etale said the Opposition members are brought together by a common belief in the indispensable need for electoral justice for the people of Kenya. "Kenyans are tired of this vicious cycle of electoral fraud perpetuated by unpopular tyrants to force their will on the People. It is time to call their bluff; it is time to bring down the walls of Jericho!" A section of NASA MPs have expressed discomfort with Raila's oath plan with others saying they only recognise Uhuru Kenyatta as president. Kitutu Chache South MP Richard Onyonka is among some of the key leaders who have differed with the coalition members over the plan.
