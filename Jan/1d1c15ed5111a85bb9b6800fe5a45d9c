Governors from 21 coffee-growing counties want weak regulatory frameworks in the coffee sector sorted out to improve production. With the country’s production standing at 40 million tonnes annually from 130 million, the Council of Governors identified cartels, the high cost of production and labour as the major challenges. This emerged at the end of a two-day retreat for governors from coffee growing counties, government officers and members of the coffee taskforce. Addressing the press at the end of the retreat in Naivasha, the governors said they are optimistic the sector can be revived. CoG Agriculture chairman Governor Stephen Sang said county chiefs have agreed to urgently undertake legal reforms in the sector. The Nandi senator termed the crop crucial to the economy because it employs thousands of Kenyans. “We have agreed on various interventions that will be carried out by the national and county governments as we are currently doing badly in terms of production,” Sang said. He cited a three-year subsidy programme to equip farmers with inputs. Coffee Task Force chairman Joseph Kieyah said production has dropped significantly. He said despite demand rising globally, farmers have little to show for it. Kieyah supported the subsidy programme, rehabilitation of coffee factories and phasing out of old coffee species, some of which were introduced by the colonial government. “The country has the potential of producing up to 300 million tonnes,” he said.
