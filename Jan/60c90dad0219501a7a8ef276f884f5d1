Tatu city training academy has graduated its 25 students in its pioneer six-week course in masonry. The course includes learning in masonry, plasterwork, electrical, plumbing, painting, tiling and carpentry after which the graduates are absorbed into construction jobs provided by contractors at the academy. “The Tatu city training academy has been established to bridge the skills gap in the construction sector, empowering Kenyans and providing employment opportunities,” Kenya country head for Tatu City Rendeavour Nick Langford said in a statement. The academy has set a standard for local content and training in Kiambu County and the current 2,000 workers are locals hired by various contractors involved in the on-going construction work. “Tatu city is helping us as a ministry to evaluate industrial training and test occupational skills in these graduands.” Kaplich Barsito representing Cabinet Secretary Labour and East African Community Phyllis J. Kandie said. Statistics carried out by African economic outlook show that youth unemployment is estimated to be 70 percent with a million graduates entering the job market annually.  There is inconsistency in skills available in the market and industry requirements and there is a lack of access to quality skill development programs. “The program by Tatu city is essential because with the skills offered the youth will be better positioned to get employed with the practicals carried out in the field improving their lives considerably,” project manager for arc skills Stephen Kimenye said during the ceremony. The academy aims to train hundreds of locals in preparation for employment opportunities at the 5,000 acre special economic zone. It is expected to offer tens of thousands of jobs opportunities to the trainees.
