It
is over two weeks - and 50 days after assuming office - since President Uhuru
Kenyatta promised on New Year's Eve to name his new Cabinet. Six days later the
President, instead, picked only six from the old Cabinet and omitted the rest â€“
a clear statement of his lack of confidence. That action must have damped the
morale and injured the self-esteem and reputation of those who continue to
serve while awaiting the appointment of their successors. The
same CSs - many of whom have lost hope of coming back - have to file weekly
reports to the Secretary to the Cabinet and Head of Public Service. Missing is
the swiftness and style that attended the appointment of the first Cabinet in
2013. His
dithering has kept the country guessing and triggered unhealthy intense
lobbying by prospectors amid reports of protracted negotiations over the
appointments to Cabinet and positions in the bureaucracy. This inertia is
depressing to our country, which needs energetic takeoff after the prolonged
election. We urge the President to disentangle himself from whatever is holding
his hand from concluding this urgent exercise so that the country can move
forward.
