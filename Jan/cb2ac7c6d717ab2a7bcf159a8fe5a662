The Education ministry has extended the reporting deadline for
Form Ones to Wednesday, January 17. The admissions were supposed to be finalized on Friday, January 12. Basic Education PS Belio Kipsang said in a statement that
this was to allow schools more time to enroll more students. “Due to overwhelming turn up of students in some regions,
and slow turn up especially in Coast region, and being considerate not to lock
out any child, the cabinet secretary has authorized the extension,” Kipsang
said on Saturday. Read: First group of form one students begin reporting to school Related: Matiang’i to become ‘super CS’ in changes to boost service delivery On Friday, acting Education CS Fred Matiang’i expressed
concern over low Form One uptake in the Coast region.  He cited the example of Kwale County where only 754 students
had reported by Friday against 5,568 available vacancies.  The CS spoke while addressing county commissioners and
security officers at the Kenya School of Government, Nairobi.   Kipsang said replacements for students who fail to take up
their slots by the end of Wednesday will be done on Friday, January 19. The move is part of government's efforts to achieve a 100 percent transition of students from primary to secondary schools. “Those selected during the replacement exercise will be
expected to report by January 23,” he said. Related: Arrest locals blocking transfer of school heads, Matiang’i orders cops Click here for the latest political news
