At least 21 students will receive scholarships from the Busia government. Education and Vocational Training chief officer Joel Barua said three students from each of the seven subcounties will be picked in the pilot project. “This initiative is courtesy of Governor Sospeter Ojaamong, who wants the county to boast of many engineers, doctors and lawyers,” he said. Barua urged university and college students to apply for Helb forms. “Students who wish to apply can visit the HELB website. Those who want bursaries can apply through their wards,” he said. The deadline for submitting applications is February 28. Barua said the Education committee will decide the recipients of the scholarships, grants and bursaries. Meanwhile, the Kakamega government has announced it has halted disbursement of Ward Development Fund cash and bursaries to needy students.
