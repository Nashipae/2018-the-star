The Homa Bay county assembly mace was broken after MCAs broke into a fight during a special sitting at the assembly yesterday. Some MCAs accused Speaker Elizabeth Ayoo of prejudice during the sitting. The MCAs differed with their colleagues and the speaker for allegedly calling the sitting to remove several committee chairpersons and their deputies. Ayoo was injured in the fight. She introduced a motion to remove the committee heads, which was opposed by some MCAs who started shouting. Kojwach MCA Joan Ogada then grabbed the assembly mace. “Madam Speaker we cannot allow you to conduct proceedings contrary to Standing Orders. This motion cannot proceed,” Ogada shouted as she walked away with the mace. This prompted the MCAs supporting Ayoo to attack Ogada and grab the mace before it was broken. The opposing MCAs wrestled Ogada down before nominated MCA Evaline Otieno intervened with kicks to rescue her. Homa Bay police chief Esau Ochorokodi and his officers intervened to calm the situation. Ayoo could not be reached for comment. Click here for the latest political news
