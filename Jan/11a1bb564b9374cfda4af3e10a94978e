Football Kenya Federation has released a list of Kenyan referees who will take charge of select Fifa assignments for the 2018 calendar year. Included in the list is debutant Stephen Yiembe, as well as regulars Andrew Juma, Davies Omweno, Anthony Ogwayo, Peter Waweru and Israel Mpaima. Yiembe went through a Uefa-sponsored course for two years in Zurich, Switzerland courtesy of FKF, consequently gaining promotion to the elite league. “We have had Kenyan referees represent us in the Caf Champions League, African Nations Championships (Chan) and the World Cup, which is a boost to our levels of officiating,” said referees’ manager Sylvester Kirwa. “FKF has also scrapped the Sh3,000 Physical Endurance Test fee and increased the frequency of the PET’s and referees’ courses. This helps to keep them updated on the laws of the game as well as their personal fitness,” he added. A total of 61, 75 and 60 KPL, NSL and Division One referees were trained in January 2017, with a further 106 referees trained during the FKF mid-season break. The federation also trained 13 referees instructors, 38 KPL match commissioners, 35 male referees and 35 female referees in the Fifa women Referees Development Course as well as 100 referees at the grassroots level.
