Kiambu Deputy Governor James Nyoro has said he has no intentions of resigning despite him Governor Ferdinand Waititu disagreeing publicly. He spoke on Friday when he opened a two-day workshop on etiquette, media and reputation for MCAs and the executive at a Naivasha hotel. There was speculation about his next move after Waititu publicly accused him of scolding him at a church service where the two and Deputy President William Ruto attended. “I will not resign. I say it again. Resigning is not only through a paper and pen, there are many ways to do so, but I will not,” Nyoro said. He urged the executive and the MCAs  to work as a team.  Waititu, speaking separately when meeting bursary committee officials in Kiambu town, said it is normal to disagree and it should not be taken out of context. “I am doing everything possible to ensure we walk this journey together,” he said. Waititu wants to harmonise water supply by coming up with a single water company to supply the commodity. He said this will give the county bargaining power with its partners. Nyoro said his office is open for consultation, adding senior county officials keep off his office for fear of victimisation. “Those fears are unfounded. We are a county like no other. We must do everything to keep a precedent,” he said.  He condemned the fights among Murang’a MCAs.
