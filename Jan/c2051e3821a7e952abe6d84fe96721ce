National Super League outfit Isibania FC hope to bring on board 10 more players in a bid to strengthen the team ahead of the season which kicks off next month. Coach Dan Musta said the club will hold a two-day trial at Isibania Boys High School on January 10 and 11 top beef up the squad. “The club is looking for a goalkeeper, two left backs, two center backs, one defensive midfielder, two left offensive midfielders and three centre forwards,” said the coach, adding: “At the moment, we have not lost any player but we expect movements in the next few days because some clubs have shown interest.” In their debut season, Isibania finished 13th on the log and Musta says they are targeting top four positions this season. The team will play their matches at Kenya Ports Authority’s Customs grounds this season. Last season, Isibania played all their home matches at Sony Green Stadium in Awendo. “When we played our Division One matches at home, we didn’t lose any match and we want to maintain that record in the NSL,” added Musta. Isibania start their campaign against former Kenya Premier League outfit Nakuru All Stars on February 10. The league will comprise 20 teams including Western Stima and Muhoroni Youth who were relegated from the SportPesa Premier League. Newly promoted Kangemi All Stars, Green Commandos and Coast Stima will be the other teams to watch. Palos FC’s slot will be filled by a team to be named after deliberations by the leagues and competitions committee.
