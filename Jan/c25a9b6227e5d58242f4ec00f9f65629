Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro has asked Mike Sonko to refund the money Jubilee Party spent booking Uhuru Park for a function before its indefinite closure. The county issued a notice on Tuesday saying no gatherings will take place at the CBD location. "Uhuru Park Grounds is scheduled to undergo phased improvement works in order to enhance recreation usefulness to its visitors," states the notice by acting county secretary Leboo ole Morintat. City Hall later said the move had nothing to do with NASA's planned swearing-in of principals Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka before January 31.

medical camp specifically targeting street families,” he noted at Sarova Whitesands Beach Resort in Mombasa on Wednesday. He spoke at the end of the three-day induction
seminar for three National Assembly watchdog committees - Public Investments, Public Accounts and Specials Funds. The MP further noted the venue was booked last year. “I saw [the notice] in the dailies and was surprised.
You cannot say Uhuru Park is under renovation yet we already booked it," he said. “We are asking Nairobi county to refund the cost if they want us to transfer to another place." Nyoro said they will have to readvertise the camp under these circumstances and that this will mean spending more money. “They knew we had booked the grounds but they did not inform us of any renovation."
