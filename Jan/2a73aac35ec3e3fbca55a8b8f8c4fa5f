Sonko called for cooperation, sacrifice and bravery to fight cartels in the three departments. He said together with Deputy Governor Polycarp Igathe, inherited a city in a terrible state. Cartels control crucial revenue, rates and the legal departments. Sonko warned the executives in charge of Lands, Finance and Human Resources to be ready for a battle, which they must win. If they don’t, they will have to pack and leave. “We must sacrifice our time and energies to reclaim this city. We must, therefore, work together as a team and bravely fight the cartels without fear or favour,” Nairobi’s second governor said.

Sonko said Nairobi has been choking under corrupt leaders. He said corrupt executives will not be tolerated. “I will not spare anyone engaging in corruption. Land grabbing is still rampant in Nairobi. During my tenure as senator, I fought the cartels and public utility land was repossessed,” he said. “The executive responsible for Land must work overtime to ensure all public utilities are protected and grabbed ones repossessed,” Sonko said. He said cartels lobbied residents and traders to solicit services from private providers instead of contracted firms, which portrayed the county as reluctant in collecting waste.
