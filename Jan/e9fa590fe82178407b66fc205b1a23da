Blogger Robert Alai was allegedly approached by Quincy Timberlake's ex-wife to request for help raising the family's two children, as they are now forced to beg to make ends meet.  According to Alai, Quincy Timberlake, the man who took Esther Arunga’s hand-in-marriage, left his family in poverty when he escaped to Australia. Quincy’s ex-wife is now appealing for help from the public. Quincy Timberlake was married to Rose Mueni before he abandoned her and hooked up with Esther Arunga. Quincy fathered three children with Rose during their marriage. Rose Mueni has sent a humble plea to Kenyans to help her take care of her three children. She says she is struggling to pay fees for her three sons: Trevor (17), Quincy (13) and Cassidy (11) Timberlake.
