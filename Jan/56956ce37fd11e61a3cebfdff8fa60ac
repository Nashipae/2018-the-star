Wajir South constituency MP Mohamud Omar has said parents' contributions to their children's education is wanting. Speaking on Tuesday during an education
stakeholders forum to
deliberate on the poor results registered in last year’s
national exams, Mohamud took issue with the parent’s lack of commitment in
following up on the education of their children. “Parents have become part of the problem and not solution as it should be. A
good parent should monitor and follow up on the academic progress of his or her
child. It should not to be left to teachers alone,” he said. “I
want to challenge the parents to hold the teachers accountable and continually
assess the academic status of schools their children attend”, he added. Omar said
better results can only be  achieved when
both teachers and parents work together as a team. His
sentiments were echoed by Muktar Ogle, a former KNEC national coordinator. Ogle called on parents to nurture their
children to have a positive attitude to education. According to the county director
of education Hussein Osman 62 % of the candidates were not eligible
for university courses. No
school in Wajir South constituency recorded A, A- or B+. This was attributed to exodus of non-local teachers for fear of terror attacks. Wajir
south was worst hit due to its proximity to the Somali border which
makes the area more vulnerable to Al Shabab militants’ terror attacks. According to education experts, poor performance is partly blamed on illiteracy of a big percentage of parents in Northern Kenya.
