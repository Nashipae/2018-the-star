The poor 2017 KCSE results released last month show massive wastage of resources in the education sector, two legislators have said.  Migori Woman Representative Pamela Odhiambo said the percentage of students who will proceed to universities and colleges is low.  Odhiambo said the results show that government has been wasting huge resources in finances, infrastructure and time. She urged Education CS Fred Matiang’i to convene a meeting and discuss the best way forward.  “In Migori , we reported a case where a student committed suicide because she got a C– [minus]. We have others who are doomed by the wholesale failure,” she said.  Suna West MP Peter Masara said the biggest query should be on the marking, analysis and the release of results, which he said was “way too fast.”  They spoke in Migori on Thursday.
