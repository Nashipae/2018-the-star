The Central Bank of Kenya and the Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation are now free to seize assets belonging to an Imperial Bank shareholder. High Court judge Olga Sewe confirmed an order issued in 2015 by Justice Fred Ochieng’ to freeze Janco Investments Limited’s assets and bank accounts within and outside Kenyan boundaries as they gear up to recover Sh34 billion stolen from the collapsed lender. Justice Ochieng issued orders freezing the accounts and assets of Janco Investments owned by Imperial Bank’s former managing director, late Abdulmalek Janmohamed, the chief architect of the fraud that brought down the bank. Also frozen were accounts belonging to James Kaburu, Imperial Bank former acting deputy managing director and 10 other individuals. Kaburu later went to court in December 2015 seeking to have the freeze order lifted on grounds it was unfairly made by the Judge who purportedly believed that he was part of a wider cartel that swindled billions of shillings from the bank,leading to its collapse. Janco Investments is one of eight companies that own Downstream Investments, which owns IBL (in receivership). Other Downstream Investments shareholders are Imaran Limited, Reynold & Company, East Africa Motor Industries, Momentum Holdings, Abdulmal Investments, Kenblest Limited, Rex Motors. CBK has accused the IBL shareholders of being responsible for the fraud that led to the collapse of the bank. The matter has been fixed for a pre-trial conference on April 13 where court will issue further directions. “Given the foregoing scenario, I am satisfied that the interests of all parties hereto, including the bank’s depositors and bond holders, would best be served by confirming the freezing order that was issued herein on 27 October, 2015 pending the hearing and determination of this suit as prayed in prayer Six of the plaintiff’s notice of motion; and that costs of the application be in the cause,” Justice Olga Sewe said.
