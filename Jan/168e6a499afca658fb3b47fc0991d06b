The High Court in Siaya will make a ruling on February 26 on the petition filed by former Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo challenging the election of incumbent Elisha Odhiambo. Midiwo had sued Odhiambo, the IEBC and Gem constituency IEBC returning officer Martin Omollo over alleged electoral malpractices. Judge Esther Maina announced the date on Friday during the final submissions by the lawyers representing the three parties. The lawyers tried to outwit each other’s submissions in a hotly contested legal tussle that attracted the public who packed the court. Earlier, word went round the town that the much-awaited ruling was to be made on Friday, only for the public to leave the court dejected when a new date was set. Lawyer Ezra Awino representing Midiwo said the respondents committed grave electoral malpractices that favoured his opponent. He cited where Omollo proceeded to oversee the election yet his first appointment and designation stood as a clerical officer for Alego-Usonga constituency.  “It is like an advocate allowed to practice without a practicing certificate,” Awino said. He asked the court to rule null and void the submissions by the respondents, including slapping them with Sh5 million for the cost of the suit. Counsel Willis Otieno, representing Odhiambo, dismissed Midiwo’s petition, saying it does not meet the threshold set and it was based on hearsay.  He asked for Sh5 million for the cost of petition.  Otieno said the burden of proof lied with the petitioner and he failed to demonstrate his case through the submissions. Counsel Richard Malebe for the IEBC and Omollo, described Awino’s submissions as a “dead duck”.
