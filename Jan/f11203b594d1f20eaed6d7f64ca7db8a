The only surviving brother to the three Erick Otieno, a form three student at Rapogi High School survived as he was not at home during the accident. “We have two broken families in our homestead today, we have maintained peace as a family to avoid further loses and we call on the government to help us get true justice,” Brian Osuji, family member said. Osuji inherited Aoko, her widower sister-in-law for more than 10 years and had lived happily together. Area police arrested Benter Osuji, the first wife of the man following the accident but she was later released for lack of evidence. Oyani DO Willy Murgor said police were unable to link her to the crime. He called on the public to share information to ensure the suspect(s) in the heinous act is arrested. Benter and her eight children never attended the burial. Four of her children who are in secondary school are yet to join term one following the accident. “I have taken full scholarship of the form three student and another student from the other family to ensure they finish their education,” Mark Nyamita, Uriri MP said. Nyamita said the constituency has experienced ‘the biggest mass funeral’ seen in the recent past and called on family to work with police to ensure there is peace in the family. “We will never lose more life to such attacks,” Nyamita said. Nyamita led local leaders: George Omamba (North Kanyamkago MCA), Graham Kagali (South Kanyamkago MCA), Ben Oremo (East Kanyamkago MCA) and Napthali Ochola (Korogocho MCA) in leading a fund drive in the area.
