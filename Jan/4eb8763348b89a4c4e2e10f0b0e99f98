The internet of late has gone wild over the trending topic on KDF. In
case you don't know what KDF is, it's a cousin to mandazi and 'ngumu'. It's
square and has a lot of flesh inside unlike mandazi, which is airy within. One or two KDFs and you are
good to go for the rest of the day. As always, Kenyans have taken time to put their creative minds to work, and I must say, the material is
off the chains. But one thing that has
shocked many is that Betty Kyallo doesn't know what KDF is. One of her
followers on Twitter asked her if she's ever eaten KDF and her response
was unexpected. She replied to the ninja with, "What is KDF?" Kenyans
on Twitter never waste time when they find an opportunity to comment
about a topic that has freely been presented to them. Some
of her followers went ahead to explain what it is, as others didn't
understand how she doesn't know what KDF is, yet it's a national treasure. Here are some of the responses she received: Clichy_Skill: KDF is a big issue than land grabbing here in Kenya ; KDF issa house hold name .. Issa our national heritage. They government has done alot to achieve that. How can @BettyMKyallo fail to know that. jothamhimself: It's
some mandazi made from super glue and some cement mixed with wheat
flour. You eat two and cast news for two days non stop, only needing 10
glasses of water every hour. dennisochieng: So with all social platforms lately awash with this 'KDF talk'@BettyMKyallo just landed from nowhere and wants to know what 'KDF' is/means !? Hii 'upunk' yenu itatumaliza ! wanyoikenjoroge: just try 1 KDF before news time,you won't see any need of commercial break
