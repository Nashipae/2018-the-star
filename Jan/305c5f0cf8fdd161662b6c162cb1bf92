The Mombasa Port’s total annual freight handling is expected to exceed 50 million tonnes by 2030, doubling from 24 million tonnes in 2015. The port handled 11.4 per cent more cargo in the first quarter of this year, largely due to increased efficiency. It handled 7.2 million tonnes of cargo between January and March against 6.5 million tonnes recorded in a similar period last year. President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the modern Madaraka Express passenger train service in Mombasa. Since independence, the country has been stuck with the old line, which has been inadequate and has resulted in pressure on the highway from Mombasa to Nairobi. This has caused delays and exorbitant costs of commuting and moving cargo.  The passenger train has reduced travel time between Mombasa and Nairobi to between four and five hours. It takes travellers an average of nine to 10 hours to travel by bus between the two cities. Also read: SGR commercial cargo services to start from Jan
