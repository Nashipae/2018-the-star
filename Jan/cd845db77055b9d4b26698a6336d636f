Politicians have been urged to support CS Fred Matiang’i in reforming the education sector. Ol Joro Orok MP Michael Muchira, his Kinangop counterpart Zachary Kwenya and Weru MCA Mbogo Mburu said the reforms will restore the integrity of national exams and promote national cohesion. The three leaders spoke on Saturday afternoon during the Ol Joro Orok Constituency Annual Careers Day.The event was held at Ol Joro Orok Stadium. They faulted politicians who have been stopping principals transferred to their areas from taking over at their new work stations. “Nyandarua leaders support the reforms being implemented in the education sector,” Muchira said. “We want to condemn this tribalism. It is retrogressive. We want a situation where Kamau can work in Bungoma and Wafula in Ol Joro Orok.” Kwenya said, “When you go to eject a principal because he or she does not belong to your tribe, remember your brother too is teaching elsewhere.”
