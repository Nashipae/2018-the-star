Eight students from Bondo and Rarieda subcounties have been selected for the Wings to Fly scholarships funded by the Equity Foundation.  Speaking in the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga grounds in Bondo on Friday, Equity Bank’s Bondo branch manager Javan Odera said they picked four students from each constituency. In 2016, 15 students benefited from the scholarship.  Odera said they could only sponsor a few students because of the current economic hardship. Those picked were among 170 applicants. The students performed well in last year’s KCPE exam and will get full scholarships.
