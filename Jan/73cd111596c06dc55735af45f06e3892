Marakwet elders have told illegal settlers to move out of Embobut Forest or be cursed. They backed Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos and Marakwet East MP Kangogo Bowen’s eviction plan. Members of the indigenous Sengwer community have opposed the evictions, saying they are being targeted and their rights are being violated. The community filed a petition in Eldoret’s Environment and Land court in January 22, seeking to compel the KFS and security agencies to stop the evictions. But the elders accuse illegal forest dwellers of wanton destruction of trees. Elder Richard Kipsaiya said the continued destruction of the 21,000 hectare forest has reduced water in rivers originating from the forest and fuelled fights for resources in drier areas of the Kerio Valley. Another elder Kiptisa Cherop said communities in the Kerio Valley are threatening to storm the forest to evict the illegal dwellers.
