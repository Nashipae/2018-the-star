Traders in Homa Bay town have been counting losses due to frequent power outages. Businesses have stalled for four days after area KPLC switched off electricity. Homa Bay county Kenya Power business manager George Omwaro yesterday said the outages are caused by a fault in one of the major lines. Omwaro said they have been forced to switch off the power but the problem is being solved. “We expect power to be restored after replacement of the faulty line,” he said. Led by Homa Bay Juakali Artisan Association secretary general Johannes Orao and Homa Bay Giant Traders secretary general Jack Nyambega, they said traders who depend on electricity to run their businesses are on the brink of closure. “Most electric appliances, including welding machines, get damaged when there is a power surge,” Orao said.
