The Lands ministry and the Nairobi county government are on the spot for allowing premises to be erected on wetlands. National Environment Complaints Committee Secretary John Chumo yesterday said wetlands have been encroached on, blocked and destroyed. “There’s need to have those who have encroached on them explain how they got title deeds since encroaching on them is like encroaching on a road reserve,” Chumo said on the phone. The damage already done on wetlands will cost the country heavily. He said his committee has received several complaints on encroachment. Wetlands are a critical part of the natural environment as they protect shores from wave action, reduce the impact of floods, absorb pollutants and improve water quality. They also provide habitat for animals and plants. Chumo said Nairobi county must ensure all buildings erected on wetlands are brought down. Several buildings in Nairobi have been put up in wetlands illegally. The Environment ministry says wetlands occupy about three to four per cent of the land surface.
