Embu Governor Martin
Wambora's agents stormed a vote recount hall protesting change of rules in the scrutiny process. The lot accused deputy registrar Vincent Nyakundi of refusing to give signed copies of forms containing the scrutinised results. Majority Chief whip Margaret Kariuki led the demonstrations saying the registrar contravened an agreement that all agents be given the forms. "The deputy registrar, in what we suspect to be collusion with the petitioner, announced that no copies of the
scrutiny forms would be given to agents." She said they
asked the official why he changed the rules abruptly, and were told that he "was
following orders from above". Kariuki argued that
the change was unfair and suspicious and that they would not accept it as they
want the truth and the will of the people respected. She said the truth and
the will of the Embu people can only be ascertained if the recount is done in a transparent manner. Kariuki said by being
provided with the copies of said forms, parties
will be able to track the results and also
confirm the authenticity of the recount report. Justice William
Musyoka ordered recount of the Embu governor election votes and forms 37As
and 37B. Votes from 350 polling stations in Manyatta, Runyenjes,
and Mbeere South constituencies were to recounted following claims of inflation, swapping, doctoring, and
stealing. Musyoka is the presiding judge in
the petition filed by former Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti against Wambora. He said during the hearing of the matter that there is need to find out if votes of various candidates across the board were exaggerated.
