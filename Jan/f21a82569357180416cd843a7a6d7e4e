Jubilee party has dismissed claims that it opted to drop its candidate for Kitui West by-election after sensing humiliating defeat. Secretary-General Raphael Tuju on Saturday told the Star on phone that the move came after wide consultations with the party leadership that resolved to drop Ben Mbai as their candidate. "You see this is an issue with internal party mechanism. We have widely consulted and that is why we resolved to support the Widow to the late Nyenze. Anything above that remains speculations," he said.

Edith the widow of the late MP Francis Nyenze garnered 13, 388 votes against Mwendwa's 2,663 votes during the Tuesday primaries. She was expected to battle it out with Jubilee candidate as Alfred Mutua's Maendeleo Chap Chap has not fronted their candidate. "It is appropriate and compassionate that the widow is granted a chance by the people of Kitui West to implement the development agenda championed by her late husband," Tuju said in a statement.
