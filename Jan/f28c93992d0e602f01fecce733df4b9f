A 13-year-old girl has been rescued from a forced marriage in Alale village, North Pokot subcounty. Speaking to the press in Kapenguria, the standard seven girl said her father forced her to be the fourth wife of a 60-year-old man. Her father lied to her that he was taking her to Turkwel Boarding Primary School, but took her to Alale instead.  “I tried escaping three times but I never succeeded. The third time I tried to escape but I was found and beaten. They locked me in the house, collected animal urine and poured it on the fresh wounds,” she said. Her attempts to commit suicide failed.
