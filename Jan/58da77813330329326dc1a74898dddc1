A policeman accused of raping a 15-year-old girl will be detained five days for police to complete investigations. Gatundu resident magistrate Carol Makari gave the order on Tuesday after an application by investigating officer Ekiru Ekirimon. Defense lawyers earlier opposed the application saying there was no holding charge. They also said the accused was a law abiding citizen whose continued detention would be unconstitutional. But prosecuting counsel Kerogo Matwa told the court that it was common practice for police officers to request more time for investigations. He added: "The suspect was arrested on a Sunday when a P3 could not be filled and fellow officers were yet to record statements since one of them died the same day, throwing the station into disarray." The magistrate said the application was genuine and justifiable. She added that the accusedâ€™s line of work makes it easy for him to interfere with the investigation.
