The appointment of Eugene Wamalwa as CS for Devolution has wiped off the tears of his clansmen who are mourning Yvonne Wamalwa. Addressing the press yesterday, during a burial meeting, the family led by Eugene’s brother, Robert Wamalwa, said the appointment came as a reward that will comfort the grieving family. Robert thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta for “blessing both the clan and the people of Trans Nzoia”. “We know we are mourning but we can wipe our tears because one of our own has been retained in the Cabinet,” Robert said. Burial committee vice chairman John Makete said Yvonne’s body will be airlifted to Kitale on Friday and a mass conducted ahead of her burial on Saturday. The family will conduct several cultural customs to identify which side of her husband’s grave she will be buried on. “It is an elder who will lead the customs. I don’t know who the person will be,” Makete said. Eugene and Trans Nzoia Woman Representative Janet Nangabo attended the meeting.
