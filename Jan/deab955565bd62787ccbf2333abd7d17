A Kiambu girl has appealed to well-wishers to help her join Form One after her mother was conned out of Sh10,000 she had been saving for her daughter's fees. Maureen Wanjiru scored 359 marks and has received an admission letter to join Tumu Tumu Girls' High School. Her mother Florence Nyambura had gone to Equity Bank to collect Wings to Fly forms, when she met a smartly dressed man, who said he was an employee and would help her get the scholarship. She went back home, took the money and gave it to the man. The next day she called him to ask about the progress of the application, but he was rude and told her he is part of a group of conmen who dress in suits to fool people and steal from them. "It is like I was brainwashed, as without thinking twice I went and took
money from my house and gave this man in a suit. To my shock the next
day he insulted me and hurled hurtful words at me," Nyambura said.
