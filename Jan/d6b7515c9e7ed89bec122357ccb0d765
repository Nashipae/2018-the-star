Kenya Motor Sports Federation (KMSF) will fete their 2017 achievers in an awards gala night on January 20. KMSF general manager, Mwaura Njuguna, said the venue of the event will be announced in due course. Mwaura said an online nomination process is underway and the panel of judges including retired rally ace Paul Bailey and Raju Chana are working on the awards. Among those expected to be feted are Manvir Baryan, who won the FIA African Rally Championship after winning four rallies in Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zambia as well as two KNRC rounds in Mombasa and Kajiado.  Leonardo Varese and Kigondu Kareithiwill be feted for their exploits in the season. Leo and KV hope to participate in a few regional based rounds of the FIA African Rally Championship. The duo were classmates back in the 1990’s at Brookhouse School which incidentally served as the last checkpoint of the WRC Safari Rally before KICC. “We will tackle three rounds of the 2018 ARC in Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda,” said Leo who has 18 2WD career class wins to his name. In the 2017 season, Leo racked up a rare double in the KNRC Division 2 and 2WD titles. “No 2WD driver has ever achieved this rare double. Dennis Mwenda and Asad Khan Kalulu won the Division Two in homologated Group N Subaru and Mitsubishi respectively and I don’t see any other driver achieving it ,” said Leo. The 2017 KNRC will be decided by the belated KMSC Rally which was pushed to January due to torrential rains that rendered the course impassable in Kajiado. Ian Duncan leads the KNRC log ahead of Carl Tundo and Baldev Chager.
