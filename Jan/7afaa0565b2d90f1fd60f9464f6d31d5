The government has condemned MCAs for their involvement in unnecessary fights and other uncouth behaviour. Some Murang'a MCAs were involved in fist-fights during a meeting in a Kiambu hotel on January 5. On Tuesday, 15 Nairobi MCAs were thrown out of a flight at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport after they failed to comply with aviation safety requirements. Government spokesman Eric Kiraithe yesterday said the conduct of the ward representatives violate the Constitution and put county assemblies in disrepute. "MCAs are state officers who must conduct their
affairs in a manner that promote dignity and public confidence in their
assemblies," Kiraithe said.
