A caucus of women leaders from Western region has demanded for not less than eight slots as President Uhuru Kenyatta unveils his Cabinet. Catherine Omanyo, the secretary general of the Women Candidates’ Network Kenya, termed ludicrous the fact Uhuru failed to name women in his first list. She said women make 50 per cent of the population and for a country to progress, they should be prioritised. She urged Uhuru to abide by the Constitution and uphold the two-thirds gender rule. Last week, Uhuru retained six CSs to serve in his second term and none of them was a woman.  The six are Fred Matiang’i (Education) Henry Rotich (Treasury) and Najib Balala (Tourism). Others included James Macharia (Transport), Joe Mucheru (ICT) and Charles Keter (Energy). Omanyo had vied for a parliamentary seat on the ANC ticket in last year’s General Election, but lost to Geoffrey Odanga in Matayos constituency, Busia county. She took issue with Uhuru failing to recognise Ababu Namwamba and former Funyula MP Paul Otuoma, whom she said campaigned vigorously for Jubille. Fida has also called for the upholding of the two-thirds principle in Cabinet appointments. FIDA chairperson Josephine Mong’are said Uhuru should appoint at least seven women to his team. Uhuru retained Henry Rotich (National Treasury), Najib Balala (Tourism), James Macharia (Transport), Charles Keter (Energy) and Fred Matiang’i (Interior) and Joe Mucheru (Information). Thirteen Cabinet Secretaries from the last term were not mentioned. The most conspicuous was Fred Matiang’i, who now becomes the substantive Interior Cabinet Secretary.
