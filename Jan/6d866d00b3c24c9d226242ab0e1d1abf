Police are investigating the pastor-owner of a children’s home who has been accused of sexually exploiting an 18-year-old girl. The pastor is said to have taken advantage of the girl from a poor home who was seeking school fees to transfer from a day secondary school to boarding school. The girl’s mother said the man visited their home last month and asked her to allow her daughter to visit the children’s home, saying he would help get bursary. The girl said the pastor forced her to have sex inside his church and at the children’s home several times, her mother said. She lived at the home when she was six-years-old, but left when the pastor starting making sexual advances four years later. “He took advantage of my poverty to abuse me and did not help me,” she said. Her mother said the girl went to the children’s home on December 23 and stayed there for several days after the pastor promised to help. When she returned the girl told her mother about her ordeal. “I am a casual labourer, and I have really struggled to raise my five children since the death of my husband. I keep asking myself why the pastor chose to do that to my fourth-born daughter,” she said. Kangema subcounty children’s officer Charles Maina and area deputy county commissioner William Lenaremo yesterday said they have received complaints. Maina said if the pastor is found guilty, the children’s home will be closed.
