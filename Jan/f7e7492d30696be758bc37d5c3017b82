Spectacular villains are often the most enticing characters on screen. They get on the audience’s nerves, yet viewers hang on their every word. Kenyan-born Hollywood star Edi Gathegi, 38, is one of those characters whose resume is crowded with powerful villain roles and does a spectacular job of it. Born in Umoja Estate, Eastlands, Nairobi, Gathegi moved to the United States at a young age and settled in California. He attended the University of California. You may remember him as Cheese in Gone Baby Gone, and more recently as Ronald Dacey in StartUp over the past several weeks. Either way, you’ve probably realised that Gathegi is a master storyteller. Gathegi visited the country over the Christmas holidays. In a tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte, he reveals what it is like to play the bad guy, his recent projects, the challenges he faced as he climbed to stardom and the Kenyan film industry. Question: You’ve sort of become this master at playing villain and badass characters. You were kind of an evil vampire in the Twilight saga. In The Blacklist you portrayed villain Mr Solomon. In StartUp you’re the unsavoury thug. What inspires this badass character you play? Gathegi: I was born in Eastlands. I got the hood in me. You know Italians are drawn because of the mythology of the mafia. I love a good mafia story and we got the hood and you know there are some good stories that come out of the hood.  Our dynamics and politics and communities, they are undeserved and there are a lot of stories there and a lot of characters trying to find humanity in these conditions.  That said, I think the idea is to understand that people may label these characters as villains, but at the end of the day I have to fall in love with the characters that I play. For me, they have to be real characters with real objectives, and driving forces. So they’re all different. Question: What character do you think portrayed the badass character and ruthless nature best? Gathegi: Ronald Dacey in StartUp Season Two was a real badass. He is probably the worst character I’ve played, in terms of having very few redeeming qualities and seems to enjoy every bit of his lack of moral compass.  However, he is fun to watch and unpredictable, which makes him one of the best characters I portrayed naturally too. Question: What are the recent projects you have been involved in? Gathegi: The MOST recent project is a play in LA called Jesus Hopped the ‘A’ Train. It is a religion debate, where a young boy who is a bicycle messenger awaiting trial for the death of the leader of a religious cult in prison meets a serial killer (I play the role) who is born-again.  That is the most recent project. Before that I did an NBA campaign and before that I did Jay Z’s Legacy. Now I’m working my way back up to StartUp Season 3.  Question: Do you ever consider doing less serious films, where your badass character will be less pronounced and star in let’s say a sitcom or comedy? Gathegi: I have done comedy before, in 2003. It was called Family Tools and it is the most amazing thing I did in my career. And as an actor that is where you wanna be because you get to go to work, make your cast crew laugh and you laugh too and try to make the world laugh. I love comedy and that is where I wanna be, but you know work issues, you don’t get to be picky. Question: Who manages your work and is there any Hollywood actor you look up to? Gathegi: Denzel Washington is my inspiration and many other black persons in Hollywood look up to him. I did a lot of research on the agents who managed my favourite actors, and one remarkable person I wanted to represent me was Samuel L Jackson’s agent. My dream came true eight years later. I was doing a play in LA and Sam Jackson’s agent was in the audience and she signed me. Question: You and Lupita have stolen the screen as Kenyans who have landed major roles in Hollywood, what do you think about Lupita? Gathegi: I have not been privileged to work with Lupita but look forward to working with her someday because she is a great actor. I have seen Twelve Years a Slave and I also saw Star Wars (Star Wars: The Force Awakens) and I know she’s got a lot of other projects that I can’t wait to see.  I am a fan of hard work and perseverance. That said, I think if you celebrate me, then you got to celebrate her. And when a young Kenyan looks at the screen and sees they are represented, that’s positive. Question: Do you have any Kenyan fashion attire in your wardrobe or do you embrace Ankara fashion? Gathegi: I would. You know if someone wanted to educate me on what to wear and how to wear I’d be open to it. And the big reason I don’t have that is because I got best dressed in the States back in high school and my brother too. I mean I used to be big in fashion. I got a big sense of what I wear, when I wear and I would like to get back to fashion and expand my fashion sensory.  Question: Most Hollywood actors juggle between singing, acting, modeling and production. Are you engaged in any of these apart from acting? Gathegi: I thought about modelling a little bit after I failed in basketball and before settling on acting, but it has not been my interest really. However, I would be open if someone came up with a sort of campaign that they wanted to collaborate. Question: What challenges did you experience as you climbed up the ladder in your acting career? Gathegi: You know there are too many forces that come into play, being in a different country. Hollywood is a difficult place, especially if you are a person of colour. A Black person in a society that is not predominantly Black, you find yourself working twice as hard as others and earn half the pay, but you know at the end of the day hard work prevails and that is what matters. Question: Currently is there any Kenyan project you’ve reviewed and you love? Gathegi: I have had some projects in Kenya, but they have fallen through. I think the strategy moving forward is to work on excellent material, give excellent stories and take this industry serious. I am not familiar with the industry. Question: What do you have to say on the challenges facing the Kenyan film industry? Gathegi: I have read about Nollywood, which does mass production of content. For some of the stuff, the quality is not so good, for others it is excellent, but they are learning from the things that are not so quality. From the few people I have talked to in Kenya, I hear they are afraid to produce and fail, but I’d encourage those in the industry to work, get up and get a camera and try learning from the mistakes they make.
