A court hearing a petition against Governor Martin Wambora has granted him consent to count votes in nine polling stations. Justice William Musyoka on Wednesday also granted the governor approval to scrutinise forms 37A and 37B in all the 710 polling stations in the county. Wambora moved to court on January 19 for a review of a ruling in which Musyoka ordered counting of votes in 350 polling stations where former Senator Lenny Kivuti is challenging the governor’s victory in the August 8 election. Musyoka on January 18 instructed that recounting be carried out in listed polling stations in Manyatta, Runyenjes and Mbeere South after Kivuti applied for the scrutiny. The judge approved the scrutiny and recount after it was realised there was inflation, swapping, doctoring and stealing of votes. After the recount order was given, Wambora (pictured) filed an application to review the ruling and have more stations listed. He said he also lost more than 300 votes. Other parties in the case — the IEBC and Kivuti — did not oppose the application.The scrutiny is expected to end on February 2. There was evidence that results were swapped as the entries in forms 37A and 37B differed. Candidates were given more votes than they had garnered and lost votes they had received. Both Kivuti and Wambora had votes either added to them or stolen. The narrow margin was enough to prompt the judge to order a recount. Wambora’s agents later stormed the vote recount hall protesting change of rules in the scrutiny. The lot said the deputy registrar refused to give signed copies of forms containing the scrutinised results.
