City Hall has denied claims it closed Uhuru Park so as to
lock out NASA from using the ground as the venue for the planned swearing in of
Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka. The two are expected to take oath as the People’s ‘President and Deputy
President' on January 30. The county on Wednesday announced the indefinite closure
of the historic ground to allow for renovations. Acting county secretary Leboo Morintat said the plan is to
beautify the ground to enhance its recreation usefulness to its visitors. "This is something we planned for long ago. So we are not
targeting anyone. It might just be a mere coincidence," he said. The opposition had planned to swear-in Raila and Kalonzo at
the Ground next Tuesday. Leboo said already work has begun on the ground and that the beautification
exercise will be carried out along Mombasa Road all the way to JKIA. He said the works on the ground might take more than a month.
They county is working on walkways within the park and planting grass and flowers. But addressing a press conference at Okoa Kenya offices in
Lavington, NASA politicians insisted the they will proceed with the planned oath. "I would like to
assure all Kenyans that the planned swearing in of Raila Odinga is still on
course whether Uhuru Park is opened or closed," Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala said. Read: Uhuru Park closed indefinitely with days to Raila swearing-in Click here for the latest political news
