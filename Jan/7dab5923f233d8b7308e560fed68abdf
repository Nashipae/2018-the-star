The EACC will sue public agencies that fail to submit their 2017 compliance reports. The County Assembly Service Boards of Busia, Homa Bay, Isiolo, Kajiado, Kisumu and Tana River are among public bodies that have failed to submit their reports. This year, state and public officers are expected to declare their income, assets and liabilities. The EACC said the compliance rate on financial disclosure is “worrying”. In 2015, the compliance rate was 48.1 per cent. EACC vice chairperson Sophia Lepuchirit said they are investigating officers who failed to submit their declaration forms. Those who made false statements are also under probe. “The commission expects all agencies to submit their 2017 compliance status reports after every six months verification period,” she said.
