More than 10,000 cattle have been tagged in Laikipia county to curb illegal movement and the spread of diseases. Kenya Veterinary Association chairman Samuel Kahariri said on Friday the first phase is complete. He said an electronic tag is put in the left ear of the animals so that they are easily identified and traced. Veterinary officers from Laikipia tagged livestock in community ranches and on private farms. Laikipia Agriculture and Livestock executive Dr Lucy Murugi said pastoralists responded well to the drive. “In the past, some pastoralists resisted, but this time round they are receptive to the plan. Some had to return home with their animals because the tags were not enough,” Murugi said. Livestock keeper John Maina from Segera welcomed the initiative, saying tagging will protect their cattle from theives. He said in most cases when animals are stolen, they are are never recovered. “People have lost lives while pursuing animals stolen by rustlers,” Maina said.
