Girls rescued from forced circumcision in Mt Elgon last month have been offered full secondary school scholarship.  International Christian Ministries started a program dubbed, “Mentorship, Discipleship and Family”, to save girls from FGM and early marriages. Programme director Roselyne Mairori told the Star yesterday the church organisation has an alternative rite of passage for the teenage girls.  “There were 106 girls in the programme last month. Some had done KCPE examination while others are in high school,” she said. Girls are taught life skills, they are also advised not to drop out of school to get married. Mt Elgon has been in the news for the reasons. More han 50 girls fell pregnant in Chepkurkur Primary School between 2013 and last year. Mairori said girls from poor backgrounds are given a chance to continue their studies.  This year, the organisation is sponsoring 56 girls joining form one.  Among the beneficiaries is 14-year-old Valerie Ngeywo, who was forced to repeat class eight last year, as the family could afford her form one fees. She sat the KCPE exam in 2016 and got 383 marks at Chepkurkur Primary School. She was called to Moi Girls Marsabit, but the family lacked money.  “I tried looking for help. No one in was willing to assist me. I am happy help has come at last ,”She said. Chepkorir said she despaired and went back in school in 2017. Her teachers were surprised to see her in class and asked why she hadn’t joined form one. She explained her predicament and was allowed her to stay in school. She scored 386 marks in last year’s KCPE exam and was called to Alliance Girls High School.
