Water CS Eugene Wamalwa was rejected at Maragoli Cultural Festival and not the Bukusu community, Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi said. He said if Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula had attended the event in Mbale on Boxing Day, he would have been well received. “Wamalwa was chased away because he is dining with a wrong company. He did not attend the festival as a Bukusu. He came as the CS for Water that is why he was chased away,” Agoi said. Agoi spoke Vokoli yesterday where he inspected the progress of Vokoli University. He denied coining the phrase “Eugene Must Go” Wamalwa is trying to bring in the Bukusu-Maragoli affairs to boost his chances of retaining his job, the MP said. “We know Wamalwa’s job is on the line because he and his team did not deliver in the last election. That is why he is looking for excuses,” Agoi said. Western is a NASA zone, you don’t need rocket science to know this, he said. Agoi told Wamalwa not to expect any apology from NASA leaders. He urged leaders from Bungoma not to narrow Wamalwa’s woes to a Vihiga-Bungoma battle Wamalwa tried to force his way into a festival he was not invited, Agoi said. However, Vihiga Cultural Society of Kenya have written an apology letter to Wamalwa. But he demands an apology from NASA principal Musalia Mudavadi.
