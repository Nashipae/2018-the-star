NASA senators yesterday suffered a major blow in the leadership of House committees after Jubilee members ganged up to deny them the chairperson and vice chair positions. Five committees elected leaders to play an oversight role after a long standoff between the two coalitions. None of NASA candidates defeated their Jubilee opponents for the two top seats. Jubilee senators rubber-stamped President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto’s chosen candidates. The chairpersons promised to discharge their duties diligently.
