Learning
continues to be paralysed at Kajaja Primary School in Tarbaj constituency for
the third consecutive week, following a stand off between parents and the teacher’s union. It is said the school has been posting poor results over the years, something the parents blamed on Abdullahi Hishi, the school head. They claim he has put in little effort to uplift the dwindling education standards. On Thursday
last week, angry parents stormed the school to seek an explanation why learning
was yet to start three weeks after the schools were re-opened. A bitter
argument ensued between the parents and the head teacher, leading to its closure. Kutulo
subcounty TSC boss Ibrahim Hillow withdrew all the eight TSC teachers and two ECD citing insecurity. Parent Mohamed Hussein said they decided to take the move following complains from
their children that they were not being taught. “What are we supposed to do as parents when such things occur? Whom are we supposed
to run to for help? Or are we supposed to just sit and watch as our school
collapses?” he asked. The school was
bottom in last year’s KCPE results. Parent
Amina Ali asked TSC to immediately transfer the head teacher and the entire
staff who she said had overstayed in the school. Area MCA Issa Ahmed expressed his disappointments at the turn of events saying
that TSC has no powers to down a school. “Instead of the TSC boss bringing both parties together to solve the outstanding issues, he decided to make matters worse by closing down the school,” he
said. Ahmed says he will petition the government over
closure of the school.
