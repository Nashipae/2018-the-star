Security officers in Lamu have intensified the search for Shabaab militants who fled into the Boni Forest after they ambushed a security convoy, killed a woman and injured five officers on Saturday. The attack took place on the Lamu-Mombasa road. Linda Boni operation director Joseph Kanyiri yesterday said they will not relent until the terrorists are captured and eliminated. “We’ve deployed enough security officers in Gamba, Nyongoro and the surrounding areas. We’ll continue with the hunt, as intensive investigations take place. We’ll not tire. It’s an onerous task that calls for sacrifice. Citizens must be calm and cooperate with the security agencies,” he said. Adequate troops and officers have been deployed to Nyongoro and environs to comb the area for any injured or dead Shabaab militants, he said. Reinforcements are being sent to ensure the hotspots are well controlled and the attackers are eliminated, Kanyiri added. The security team has also urged the national government to provide more military vehicles to support the onslaught. It has concentrated the search in areas around the forest. Numerous terror attacks have taken place in Nyongoro, making it a hotspot. In mid-June last year, three al Shabaab hideouts were discovered and destroyed in the area. An undisclosed number of Shabaab militants were also killed. Residents and politicians have voiced concerns that the militants may launch further ambushes. Kanyiri said Nyongoro and other hotspots have been identified and enough security barricades have been set up to help in the crackdown. The other hotspots are Gamba, Mambo Sasa Corner, Lango La Simba and Milihoi. All these areas have poor road and communication networks. They have become easy targets for militants, who know vehicles can’t move fast and residents can’t inform police swiftly whenever they raid.  Kanyiri urged the public to provide intel that would help restore security.
