Marakwet professionals and elders have said they fully support the case filed by Dr Tatu Kamau seeking to legalise FGM. They also want the Anti-FGM board disbanded because they claim it has caused them a lot of unnecessary suffering in the fight against the female cut. A group of elders told the Star yesterday said they would invite Kamau to reward her because they believe she is fighting a just course. “We have been hunted and punished for engaging in FGM which is our cultural right,” Mzee Kirior Bitok said. Prof Luka Kutto and another professional Cosmas Lotirkor said they fully support the case in court because it would liberate those who have been punished for engaging in FGM. “We have been exposed to ridicule and embarrassment as a community because of FGM. Our women have been frustrated, yet it’s our right”, said Lotirkor. “The merits are more than the demerits. FGM promotes discipline in marriages because incidences of divorce among women who are circumcised are very minimal,” he added.
