Last week, the Star revealed that despite a new police team being formed to deal with the new wave of crime, insecurity in the city is spiraling. The team, comprising officers from the Special Crime Prevention Unit and the Flying Squad, was formed to deal with cases where criminals attack customers walking out of banking halls and ATM boothes. The gangs specifically trailed customers into banking halls and the city streets and robbed them of their cash. Yesterday, Koome said,  “Our officers will not give the criminals a chance to harass the public. We must ensure the security and safety of everyone.” The briefing yesterday came amid a public outcry over rising cases of insecurity in the CBD.
