Two people died yesterday in Pipeline after a one-storey building collapsed. National Disaster Management Unit assistant director Pius Maasai said the structure left six others injured. He said the building collapsed at 11.50am. “Out of the six we can confirm one is in critical condition but the others are stable and out of danger,” Maasai said.

Witnesses told the Star volunteers pulled two bodies out of the rubble. “We heard cries from the site minutes to midday,” said the man identified only as Henry. “We retrieved two bodies and transported them in a pick-up. One group was on the ground floor and the other on the first floor.” He said the floor of the building was made of a mixture of concrete and wood. In June last year a woman and two children were rescued from a seven-storey building that collapsed at Kware area, nearly 19 hours after the house collapsed. Four people out of the seven who had been reported missing following the tragedy were later confirmed dead. On April 21, 2016, a building marked for demolition collapsed, also in Huruma, Nairobi, killing 51 people. In June, the National Construction Authority released a list of 204 unsafe residential buildings that would be demolished. The list, released by chief executive Daniel Manduku, included those in Dagoretti, Umoja, Thika Road, South B, Zimmerman, Pipeline, Embakasi and Huruma. Huruma had the highest number of condemned buildings at 58. Click here for the latest political news
