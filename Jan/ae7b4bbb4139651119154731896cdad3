The anti-graft agency is investigating 12 senior Tana River county officers for allegedly misusing hundreds of millions of shillings. The EACC is investigating irregular procurement processes in the award of tender number TRCG/030/2016-2017 for the construction of a fence. "The officials allegedly issued a fictitious contract worth hundreds of millions to construct a perimeter fence for KWS in Garsen for financial year 2016/17," said a senior officer at the county. Former chief officer Fatuma Zahra is among those being probed. Zahra and public works director Thomas Chula appeared before the EACC on Monday. Other officials who will be interrogated include Mumina Dulo, Halima Mahad, Bonaya Komora and Raymond Gwiyo. The rest are Nasir Guyo, Hawa Bakero, Mohamed Abdi, Kelvin Wafula, Fatuma Hussein, Issa Bere and Ali Dhidha. A letter from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission requested county authorities to facilitate the named officers' appearance for questioning. The county registry received the letter on January 15. Governor Dhadho Godhana had raised concerns about serious irregularities and corrupt deals by the former regime. Noting he inherited a Sh2.1 billion debt from his predecessor, most of which is owed to contractors,  he pledged to take action against the perpetrators. Click here for the latest political stories
