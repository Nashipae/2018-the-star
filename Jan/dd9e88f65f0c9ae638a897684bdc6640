MCAs from Mt Kenya region have pledged to support Deputy President William Ruto in his bid to become President in 2022. The MCAs from Nyandarua, Nyeri, Kirinyaga, Murang’a and Kiambu counties said they will fully support Ruto in the 2022 election. Speaking during a press conference at Green Hills Hotel in Nyeri town on Monday, the ward representatives said they will marshal their people to vote as a block for Ruto. They were led by County Assemblies Forum secretary general Eric Wamumbi. Nyeri Majority leader James Kanyugo said the leaders will put aside their differences and support Ruto. They also expressed support for the Cabinet nominees announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta last week. ”We shall fully support those nominated to serve in various ministries. Not everybody could be nominated because the positions are few,” Chinga MCA Kiruga Thuku said.
