Adelle Onyango is stepping into the fashion world and this time, she's launching her own clothing line. She's calling her line The Anyango Capsule Collection, which is named after and in honour of her late mother, to bring out four characteristics she had, which Adelle hopes will inspire other people. She has teamed up with four creatives to bring this dream to life. Writing on social media, she said, "Two years ago I had the idea of designing a capsule collection in honour of my late mum, Mary Anyango Onyango. A powerful, limitless and strong woman. "A collection of timeless pieces that would bring attributes of my late mum to life. So I collaborated with four creatives to achieve this, and over the next four weeks, we will reveal one item and one creative per week."
