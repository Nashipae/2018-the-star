Kisumu residents have said they are ready for NASA leader Raila Odinga’s swearing-in ceremony as the People’s President. Those who spoke to the Star said they want to see Raila take the oath, regardless of the government’s insistence that the swearing-in is illegal. They said the country was in a crisis and needed to be liberated from the Jubilee regime. “We know that Raila won the August 8 election. We don’t recognize Uhuru as our President and we are ready for the consequences of Raila’s oath taking,” Mark Ochieng said. Ochieng said they will travel to Nairobi to the historic event. “The threats being issued to NASA will not work because the people have decided. I hope the process will go on without confrontation between police and NASA supporters,” he said. Traders were fearful that business might be affected if police and NASA supporters clash. “Whatever will happen in Nairobi will also be experienced in Kisumu,” Mark Okinyi said.
