Athi River deputy county commissioner Geoffrey
Omoding’ has criticised Kenha and the Machakos government
for carrying demolitions without notice. He said it is inhuman to destroy residents’
property at night, living them with no source of livelihood. Residents barricaded Syokimau–Katani Road in Mavoko on Saturday to protest against demolition of
kiosks and other businesses  on Friday night. They were dispersed by police after many hours during which they burnt tyres. “The night demolitions were done by Machakos county
officers from Mavoko subcounty. This is wrong, these people are trying to earn
livelihoods in this hard economic era,” Omoding told the Star on the phone. “The victims have lost lots of properties, residents
should be issued with notices to move their valuables before demolitions are
effected,” Omoding said.
