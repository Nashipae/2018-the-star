A Nakuru judge said he did not grant orders for evictions at St Mary’s Hospital in Lang’ata and Elementaita that are at the centre of a dispute between Catholic nuns and an American priest. Justice Sila Munyao yesterday said he only ordered the management of the Sh3 billion properties, including three pieces of land and hospitals, be handed over to the Assumption Sisters of Nairobi and police to facilitate the transition. “The management was to be handed over to the sisters. When that did not happen, the police were ordered to execute the court order,” Munyao said. After the eviction at St Mary’s in Lang’ata, Dr William Fryda through lawyer Ester Gathoni, went to the Employment and Labour Relations  Court and obtained an order restraining the sisters from evicting the employees.
