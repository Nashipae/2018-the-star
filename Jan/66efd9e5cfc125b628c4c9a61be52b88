Three Murang'a MCAs on Thursday denied charges of creating disturbance at the county assembly. Stanley Mburu (Makuyu), Amos Murigi (Kimorori Wempa), and Jecintah Ng’ang’a (Township) were each released on a Sh100,000 bail. They were accused of storming Majority Leader Eric Kamande’s office and breaching peace on January 16. Murigi and Ng’ang’a faced a second count of creating
disturbance by storming into the assembly clerk’s office on November 27 in an
attempt to evict the latter. The three appeared before chief magistrate Margaret Wachira who scheduled the case for mention on
January 31. The three are part of eight MCAs that the police were
looking for following the fight that broke out in the assembly on January 15. On Tuesday, Wachira issued a warrant of arrest for
nominated MCAs Beth Waithira, Joyce Wambui and Stephen Chege. Kagundu-ini
