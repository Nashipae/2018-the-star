Results for Kitui West MP nominations show Edith Nyenze has won the Wiper party ticket. The final tally for 65 polling stations, as announced by constituency returning officer Francis Kivindu, indicated she got 13,388 votes.Â Her main rival Kitili Maluki got 2,663 votes. The results were announced at Maendeleo Multipurpose Hall at Matinyani market at about 11 pm on Thursday. "Thirty one per cent of the 52,000 registered voters took part," Kivindu said. He said Edith "whitewashed" Maluki in the race ahead of the by-election on March 26. Edith wants to take over from her husband Francis Nyenze who died on December 6, 2017 while being treated at Nairobi Hospital. He was 60 years old. A proposal for her to succeed him was floated during the burial at Kyondoni village in Kauwi ward. Kauwi MCA Jane Mutua said she was fit for the position but Felix Baridi Mbevo of Mutonguni ward and Munyallo Kitheka of Matinyanitwo said residets had not been consulted. Maluki is the son of former cabinet minister Nyiva Mwendwa. His father, the late Kitili Mwendwa, and his mother Nyiva once served as Kitui West MPs.
