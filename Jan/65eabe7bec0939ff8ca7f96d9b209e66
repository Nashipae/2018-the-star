The demolition of more than 2,600 illegal structures by City Hall in the last two weeks has been praised and condemned in equal measure. Residents have praised the county administration, but the owners of the structures, mostly small-scale traders, are furious with it for destroying their sources of livelihood. Buru Buru resident Peter Wandia said the structures are an eyesore and criminal hideouts. “This is what we have been pushing the county to do. This place has become ugly. Pathways and road reserves have been invaded by kiosks,” he said. But kiosk owners said they pay taxes. “We pay kanjos Sh30 everyday. These officers eat our food for free and now they are demolishing our kiosk without notice,” Jenipher Wangari, a roadside food seller in Westlands, said.  follow the law The demolitions have been carried out along Ngong Road from Dagoretti Corner to Upper Hill, around Yaya Centre, Westlands, Mombasa Road, Kasarani, Ruaraka and Roysambu. Operations director Peter Mbaya said they are meant to restore order and sanity. “If people want to do business, then they must follow the law. These structures are everywhere; in front of other people’s shops, on road reserve, on private property. That is illegal and we cannot allow it,” he said. Mbaya said the demolitions will continue until the county gets rid of all illegal structures. On Wednesday, 485 structures were demolished on Mombasa Road near City Cabannas. The operation was led by Embakasi East subcounty administrator Selina Ogalo. She said the traders had been served with notice to pull down the structures but ignored it. “Last week and last year in December and November, our officers had visited the traders and told them that they were not supposed to be on the road pavements,” she said.
