Embu university students have complained the bursaries county government and Constituency Development Funds give them is too little and only caters for fare. The students, who are members of the Embu County University and Colleges Students’ Association, said the money gets finished before it can be used for its intended purpose. Speaking in Embu town yesterday, Ecucsa officials said the county offers each of the university students Sh10,000 as bursaries. This is the same amount secondary school students get. The students get between Sh1,500 and Sh4,000 from the CDF. Association patron and county assembly chief whip Margaret Kariuki, chairperson Warren Njagi and secretary general Grace Murugil said students appreciate the assistance from the county and the CDF, but it’s too little. “Taking into consideration university education is more expensive than that at secondary school and considering students have to take responsibility for their food and accommodation, the money is far too little,” Kariuki said. Njagi said some of the students travel to faraway universities including Masai Mara, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, Kabianga and Kibabii universities and some end up using the cash as transport to go and fill bursary forms and collect the cheques.
