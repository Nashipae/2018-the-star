The Coast secession call is losing momentum among locals. Proponents Governor Hassan Joho (Mombasa) and his Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi have not held any public hearings three months after pledging. Critics, including the government and European envoys, are apprehensive about the Coast self-rule. President Uhuru Kenyatta has warned against self-determination, saying Kenya is indivisible and “rebels face  stern action for threatening the country’s peace and stability”. It is also uncertain if secession move was aimed at piling pressure on the IEBC to conduct another election after the October 26 repeat polls.  Joho said they will engage local leaders and citizens in a series of meetings on secession talk until they achieve their goal. “We already have a framework and strategies in place,” the ODM deputy leader said on November 3 at his office in Mombasa. Nothing has been heard from lawyers Kingi, Stewart Madzayo (Senator, Kilfi) and Mohammed Faki (Senator, Mombasa) who were tasked to lead the process. Nor Joho, Kingi or any other proponent of the secession was available for comment.
