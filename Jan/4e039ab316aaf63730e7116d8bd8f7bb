Fears of being being subjected to Female Genital Mutilation and forced marriages are keeping Pokot girls away from home, the Star has established. Many have run away from their villages after their parents unsuccessfully tried to marry them off. Those on the run have found accommodation at the Kamketo Girls’ Secondary School in Pokot North. The Star met 30 girls, some saying they walked for more than 200km to reach the school. “One evening, 10 men came to our home and took me  to my would-be husband’s home. He was my father’s age-mate,” a 13-year-old girl said. She said neighbours alerted the area chief, who arrested the men and the parent. All have since been released on bail. She said she ran away from home after the father threatened to kill her.The girl was supposed to join Form One this year, but the father cited lack of fees. Most of them said they ran away to escape FGM and forced marriage.  Principal Mary Raswei said she accommodates the girls because they have no place to go. “We can only empower women and girls through education,” Raswei said. She said the girls lack sanitary towels and other personal effects and asked well-wishers to support them. West Pokot deputy speaker Francis Krop said he had rescued 11 girls from forced marriage over the last three weeks. The girls are among those in the school. Kacheliba MP Mark Lomunokol said he had set aside funds to educate the rescued girls. Last week, Canadian envoy Sara Hradecky toured the area and promised to help.
