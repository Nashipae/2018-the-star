A family in Kibingor, Baringo South, is crying for justice after people purporting to be police officers raided their home and stole Sh100,000 goods. Samuel Boit, 50, said the people, who were in two police vehicles, stormed his house at 3pm on Tuesday. Only Boit’s seven-year-old grandson was at home at the time. “They told him that they wanted to break into the house. The boy got scared and ran away,” Boit said yesterday. He said he saw the armed strangers loading his property into two what appeared to be two police Land Cruisers as he returned from herding goats. “I feared going closer to them, so I stood helplessly and watched from a distance,” he said. The thieves took away solar panels and Sh20,000, cash among other valuables. Police in Marigat and Kabarnet have denied raiding the house. Kibingor assistant chief Peter Chelelgo confirmed the incident but denied ordering any police raid. “Not even an alcohol raid was conducted,” Chelelgo said. He said the matter is being investigated. Neighbours said the family’s decision to recall their daughter, Felyne Chebor, from her troubled marriage could be the reason for the raid.
