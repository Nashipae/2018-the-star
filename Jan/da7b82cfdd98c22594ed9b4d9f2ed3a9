NASA moved the Nyanza region’s People’s Assembly meeting from Migori to Homa Bay because of the rivalry between Governor Okoth Obado and Ochillo Ayacko. The NASA steering committee had planned the last rally to take place in Migori county, but the choice of venue and infighting among local leaders prompted the change. Obado (ODM) beat Ayacko (independent, pictured) at the August 8 election. Ayacko has petitioned Obado’s victory at the High Court in Migori and the case is ongoing.

It brought together the People’s Assemblies from Migori, Homa Bay, Kisumu and Siaya. “We planned the meeting for Migori, but because the local leaders there were fighting each other, I called Jakodondo [Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti] to help us have another venue,” Raila said. The division between the Migori politicians played out when it was time for Migori county to table their resolution. ODM organising secretary Joseph Nyambori, who is in the Obado camp, was stopped by Ayacko allies from issuing the statement as the two teams clashed.  Homa Bay Town MP Opondo Kaluma, who was the host, had to consult the Nyanza region NASA coordinator Bob Madanje, who allowed Nyambori to go ahead. Raila said the meeting symbolised the Last Supper, referring to his planned swearing-in tomorrow in Uhuru Park, Nairobi.
