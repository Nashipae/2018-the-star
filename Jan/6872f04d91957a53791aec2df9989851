Mandera MCAs yesterday warned the county government against taking over the running of boreholes, saying it might lead to a crisis. They said the county is only interested in the revenue generated by the boreholes, and not their maintenance and sustainability. Wargadud MCA Alinur Derow said most people depend on boreholes that supply 80 per cent of the county water. He said residents have been running the boreholes for 20 years and making repairs in case of breakdowns. Currentlythe 120  boreholes are registered as corporate bodies and are managed by water supply committees registered under the social services. “We understand that under devolution all water departments are under the county, but for such a move to be taken there needs to stakeholders involvement,” he added. He said they will introduce a bill in the assembly to streamline management of boreholes and water supply. Rhamu MCA Kullow Alio said the county isfacing severe drought and mismanagement of boreholes would lead to a crisis. The department of water has disbanded all water users associations due to what they called mismanagement.
