Kabras RFC have targeted top two positions when the Kenya Cup League comes to an end next month. The 2016 champions currently lie second on the log with 33 points from seven matches and are still unbeaten. Head coach Charles Cadovillis said they are headed into right direction in his first full year in charge of the side. A top two finish guarantees you a home semi-final and the tactician is confident of making the cut. “We want to be in the top two. We have opened gap over the third-placed team which gives us breathing space,” he added. The sugar millers are a point behind champions KCB, who are also unbeaten on 34 points “We have had a good run. The boys have adjusted accordingly to the management team tactics and it’s paying off. We are playing multi faceted approach to our rugby where the forwards can play like backs and vice versa and that makes it difficult for teams to stop us,” he added. Since their promotion to the top flight of Kenyan league in 2015, Kabras have contested three Kenya Cup finals, losing two and winning one. Cadovillis said defeats in the previous finals will hold them in good stead in the run up to the play-offs and finals in the next two months. “We can’t be complacent despite our unbeaten run. There is a lot of rugby to be played between now and March we can’t underestimate our opponents. Kabras next four matches include tough home tie against Homeboyz, Kisii RFC (home), KCB away and Blak Blad away. “All the four teams we are meeting are chasing points or playoff positions and we must bring our best game to win this matches,” he noted. Cadovillis expects Ugandan import Phillip Wokorach to be fit for the showdown against Homeboyz. “Yes he is back in training and I didn’t want to risk him in the match against Impala. However, for the deejays duel, he will be available for selection,” he noted.
