Wiper wants its leader - Kalonzo Musyoka - to lead NASA talks with Jubilee to put to an end to the political stalemate. National chairman Kivutha Kibwana yesterday said the party has endorsed Kalonzo to lead the talks within NASA given his record in fostering peace and unity. Speaking after attending a Wiper leaders’ meeting also attended by Kalonzo, the party expressed its resolve to pursue non-violent change in the midst of a political stalemate that has dragged on since last year’s protracted General Election. Kibwana said the opposition will not force Jubilee to the talking table, but will be available for talks anytime President Uhuru Kenyatta makes up his mind.

We want to talk because we are not reckless,” he added. Kibwana dismissed claims NASA’s quest for dialogue is driven by the need to share government posts with Jubilee. He said it is purely meant to address electoral justice. “NASA is not interested in having a Nusu Mkate [coalition government], all we want is electoral justice.” He, however, indicated the need to have “a system where every Kenyan is included in the running of the country”. The party however said it will participate in the controversial oath on January 30 in case Jubilee remains adamant on talks. At the over five-hour meeting on Mombasa Road, Wiper elected MCAs, MPs, governors piled pressure on the Wiper boss to take the oath alongside Raila on January 30.
