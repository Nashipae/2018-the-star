A new mobile phone application has been launched to facilitate motorists and travellers with their logistical needs. The platform, dubbed Bwala Africa, is aimed at allowing Kenyans as well as tourists to hire cars, source repairs, service and maintain by linking motorists with trusted and accredited mechanics and spare parts dealers. The Sh80 million project will also have a database of tours and travel vans and minibuses for hire. “This is a one-stop shop for motor vehicle needs. It is cost-effective to get rides, be it self-drive or driven, spare parts, accredited mechanics to fix your car wherever you are across Kenya, as well as reliable petrol stations,” Bwala Africa CEO Kennedy Nyabwala said during the launch. He added that despite the application being fairly new in the Kenyan market, the firm was already seeking out investors to drive expansion throughout East and West Africa as well as Asia. “We are in talks with the Chandaria Group for growth funds and currently we are seeking Sh100 million for East African expansion,” Nyabwala said. He said the logistics market is huge and Kenya alone has over one million cars on the roads daily. “Irrespective of the make and year of manufacture of these cars, they all need regular maintenance and servicing. It’s a menace for companies with a fleet of over 20 cars, all hired from different individuals at different times for different reasons,” he said adding that their service will help seal loopholes of fleet managers siphoning cash from from firms over unscrupulous maintenance claims. The application system will send push notifications to users on servicing, insurance, lease contract renewal among others automatically, and vetted service providers such as mechanics will be paid after satisfactory work over an escrow system. The system will only charge a commission of between 25 to 30 per cent on cars hired, services offered and spare parts sourced.
