Form one bound students have been urged to concentrate on their studies and maintain the discipline they had in primary school for good performance in KCSE. Limuru MP Peter Mwathi’s aide Alice Wambuku yesterday said only students who maintain the good conduct can pass their examinations. “It is very important for students joining form one to remember to put into practice the discipline instilled in them by parents and teachers,” Wambuku said. “We want you to remain prayerful and maintain your hard work. Chose your friends wisely and obey your teachers.” She was speaking in Limuru Town Primary School during the thanksgiving ceremony. Wambuku represented her boss MWathi at the function. The school produced the best KCPE candidate in the constituency. Maureen Wangu topped with 423 marks. She was expected to join Alliance Girl's High School this week. Headteacher Peter Mbugua said 26 students will join national schools after posting good results in the 2017 KCPE exam. “We are happy with the support of teachers and parents," Mbugua said. The best boy Peter Kinyanjui who scored 418 has been admitted at Mang’u high school while the most improved student Monicah Njeri who scored 372 will join Buruburu Girls. Wambuku told parents that the legislator thanked parents for supporting their children to perform well, urging them to support too the strategies they will employ since the will see more pupils being admitted in national schools. “The strategies we shall lay down, will see a lot of our candidates being admitted in national school even though the education curriculum is changing. Let us give our children the marks that will help them step in the next level of education easily” she said.
