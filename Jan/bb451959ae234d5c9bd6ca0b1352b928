Over 80 students of a school in
Matungulu, Machakos county, demonstrated on Thursday over their school's performance in 2017's KCSE tests. The learners of Kisikioni Secondary School want their principal Benjamin Mutiso transferred. They were stopped by police before finishing their 41km walk to present a petition to education officials. Matungulu sub-county AP commander
James Odera said the protesters left the school at 3 am and intended to trek to Machakos
town.  "I received a phone call from the principal
that the students had left the school for Machakos town on foot," Odera said. "We mobilised officers from KBC and Tala police stations who chased after the students and convinced them to return to school." Odera said most of them were already weak and tired
by the time the officers caught up with them. "Those who missed seats in the school bus were driven back in police Land Cruisers," Odero said.
