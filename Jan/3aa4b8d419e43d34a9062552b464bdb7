Schools under the Kenya Private Schools Association will be among institutions that will receive learning materials to implement the new curriculum this week. The learning materials to be distributed to the private schools will include supplementary materials (textbooks and guide books) in core subjects of mathematics, English and Kiswahili. Speaking to the Star yesterday, Kepsa chairman Peter Ndoro (pictured) said the schools were yet to receive the learning materials but had already received the curriculum designs.

The complimentary materials will include books and objects of learning interaction approved by the KICD but not the main syllabus course books. “Teachers have been familiarising themselves with the curriculum designs and trying to understand what ought to have been done and upon the release of the materials, students could next week officially start interacting with the books under the teachers guidance,” Ndoro said. Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development CEO Julius Jwan acknowledged it is running behind schedule but said the schools will get the materials as scheduled. “The process of rolling out the new curriculum should not be done in exclusion. If we are to get this system right, we have to include the private sector and they also will get the required materials to roll out the nationwide pilot,” Jwan said.
