Members of the Amusement and Gaming Society of Kenya arrested in Kariokor for engaging in betting business were released without charge yesterday. Chairman Sammy Kahiu accused police of harassment and destroying their gaming machines. Last Friday, Matiang’i ordered a crackdown on illegal gaming dens to protect schoolchildren. He said children have lost interest in education because of too much betting. Kahiu accused the police of destroying gaming machines and stealing money under the pretext of following orders. He said the society is fully registered and has a strict code of conduct that regulates its operation. The members said they deserve to be treated fairly since they too pay taxes. Kahiu urged Matiang’i to call for a meeting instead of ordering police to crack down on them. The government recently imposed a 35 per cent income tax on the multibillion-shilling betting industry, raising protests from betting companies.
