Tension is high in Nguu Tatu area of Kisauni constituency where there is a standoff between squatters and police over a land dispute. The squatters do not want Bandari Investment Company to put up a perimeter wall around a 60-acre parcel of land. The company has a court order but the protesters say the wall's construction is part of a ploy to evict them. Boniface Shikondi, a squatter, said people hiding behind the company have been eying the land. "We know them. We just can't name them," said Shikondi. Beatrice Kenga, another squatter, said they were tired of running battles with police. "How can an outsider be allowed to erect a wall with the people inside the property?" Kenga asked. In January last year, 32-year-old Mohamed Waje was shot in the left thigh as police dispersed protesters. The officers had been guarding people, said to have been hired goons, as they demolished structures. On Sunday, the squatters protested the intended construction of the perimeter wall, chairman Martin Chiponda saying they will stay put. Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo also said he will not allow the company to erect the wall. According to the court order obtained on December 19, Justice Anne Omollo said the construction of the two-metre wall should not interfere with structures on the property. Omollo also ordered the squatters, who are about 5,000 in number, not to put up any more structures. Click here for the latest political stories
