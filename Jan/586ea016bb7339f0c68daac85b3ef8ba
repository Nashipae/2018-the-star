Eric Wainaina is one of Kenya's musical icons. He has been on the down low of late but little did we know he was working on something serious. He came out strong with an amazing song, "Okay", which talks about breaking up. When asked how this song would be of help to Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko and Deputy Governor Polycarp Igathe, who parted ways a mere five months into office, he said communication is very important in a relationship. In a tweet after his resignation on January 12, Igathe said, "I regret I have failed to earn the trust of the governor to enable me to drive administration and management of the county." Eric said even if breakups are meant to hurt, sometimes it is necessary so that one can grow. He said, "This song is for Polycarp. It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be alright. Nairobi is a great city and I know we will survive and get through this. "Sometimes when relationships don't work out, the right thing to do is to break up and reconstruct. So if it wasn't working out, then they had to go." Eric added that eventually, things will be okay. "You have to trust that relationship will survive hardship, and one should be honest and stop being conflict-avert. You need to look at each other in the eye and deal with the issue to avoid screw-ups. Sonko needs to come clean to his partner, and so does Igathe, so they work things through."
