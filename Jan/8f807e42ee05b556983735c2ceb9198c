Allegations of rape at the Kenyatta National Hospital have caused uproar on social media. The KNH Chief Executive Officer, Lily Koros, has called in the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to probe the allegations. Koros also denied the reports and complained that an occurrence book in the shape of a file lacks any complaint from a victim. Koros also urged Kenyans to stop what she called “baseless speculations”. KNH and the DCI need to get to the bottom of the matter. Seven years ago the KNH invited investigators to probe the extent of the theft of body parts at their mortuary. The results of that probe are still awaited by the public. The name of the mortuary was changed to a funeral home. Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu has indicated that there will be a probe of the rape allegations. This investigation should be a public probe and its findings should be publicized and there should be prosecutions. Patients – and indeed everyone else who goes to the KNH will need to be assured of their safety while at the biggest referral hospital in Kenya.
