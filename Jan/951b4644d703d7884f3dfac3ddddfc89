The Busia county government has identified four priority projects for funding by the Public-Private Partnership Unit, a specialised unit within the National Treasury. Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi yesterday said he led the county team in talks with the PPP Unit at the Reinsurance Plaza in Nairobi on Tuesday. National Treasury monitoring and evaluation specialist Wycliffe Ondieki led the PPPU unit, with Andrew Sprott and Caroline Maina representing the World Bank. Mulomi was accompanied by CEC members Bernard Yaite (Public Works), Martin Kafwa (Lands), Leonard Obimbira (Finance), and chief officers Gregory Akide (Lands) and Ezekiel Okwach (Office of the Governor). Construction of trailer parks in Busia and Malaba are among the projects to be funded. The second priority project is an oil depot. The national government is expanding the oil depot from Kericho to Kisumu, then to Busia. Mundika or Matayos will host the depot. Construction of low-cost housing units for county workers and residents, upgrading of slums in Busia and Malaba and development of an airport are the other priorities. Mulomi said the lack of parking facilities for trailers results in large queues in Malaba and Busia, prompting the dangers associated with petroleum products.
