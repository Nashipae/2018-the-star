Over 500 Nairobi city residents from needy backgrounds on Saturday received bursaries from the National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF). The bursaries were issued by the Nairobi County Woman Representative Esther Passaris at Calvary Covenant Church, Komarock, Nairobi. Passaris said the bursaries will help the underprivileged in the county to access education. "Education is a basic need that every child within the county needs to have and together as leaders we need to help those who are less privileged to access it," she said. "During my campaign, one of the key areas I promised to make a difference in is the Education sector. In this day and age, access and provision of quality education should not be an option. It should be mandatory," Passaris said. Her focus for the next five years, she added, will be to socially and economically empower women, the youth and people living with disabilities. She said she will achieve this by ensuring there are equal opportunities in business startups, job creation and employment. The ceremony was attended by local area administration officers, Nairobi County Project Coordinator Edwin Apacha, the National Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF) Committee members and the sectional heads of the 17 constituencies in Nairobi County. They all reaffirmed the need to help the less fortunate in society. Passaris congratulated those who were nominated to various Cabinet posts on Friday saying she wishes them well in their new jobs.
