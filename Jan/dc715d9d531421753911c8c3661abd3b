Administrators in North Imenti on Friday arrested a woman with 256 litres of illicit brew at Gakoromone village, North Imenti constituency. Area chief Mercy Murithi said they nabbed 240 litres of muratina - a local brew, and 15 litres of chang'aa during the raid. "The suspect was handed over to the police station for prosecution. She has another case pending in court and was out on bond," she told journalists. Murithi said they are alarmed that the brewers have changed tactic and are now hiding the illegal substances in farms and not their homes like before. "We want them to seek another business since illicit liquor is harmful to the consumers," she said. Click
