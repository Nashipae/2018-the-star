Muthwani MCA George King’ori has broken the silence
after an assistant chief shouted him down during a public meeting. King’ori remained quiet as the drunk and
disorderly Ngelani assistant chief, John Matheka, attempted to disrupt his meeting on Thursday. "He
needs forgiveness," he said by phone on Saturday, noting the administrator has a family and other dependants. "He needs to retire to allow the family to enjoy the benefits." Matheka was ejected
from the meeting after shouting at the chief while he responded to residents' concerns. King’ori called the meeting outside
the assistant chief’s office at Ngelani shopping centre, to listen to the people's grievances
and development concerns. Read: Ngelani residents frogmarch assistant chief for being drunk, disorderly The residents frogmarched the assistant chief from
the gatherig and called for his immediate resignation. But the ward representative said it would be inhumane to fire the administrator and that "he should be pardoned until his term ends". King'ori said he was not offended by the chief's misconduct since he is a known drunkard. He recommended rehabilitation once Mitheka's term ends. "It would be dangerous to sack the helpless man and let the community deal with him." Some women described the assistant chief as a disgrace to Ngelani and a bad example to youths who had become addicts. Click here for the latest political news
