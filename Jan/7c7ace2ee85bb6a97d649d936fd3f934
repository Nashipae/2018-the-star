Principals from Murang’a county have asked the government to release development funds for expansion of school facilities. They said schools are congested following increased enrolment and students do not have enough learning facilities. Kenya Secondary School Heads Association Murang’a chairman Willy Kuria said schools no longer charge parents development fees. “We are not able to carry out any development project in our schools because we do not have any funds yet or schools are congested and our facilities overstretched,” he said. Kuria asked the government to release the Sh6.6 billion it pledged and distribute it equally to all schools. He was addressing school heads after he was elected chairman for a second term. Kuria asked the government for an extension on the deadline for painting school buses yellow. He said the March 30 deadline will interrupt the schools’ calendar of activities. “We are asking the government to allow us to repaint the buses during the April Holidays when the schools are closed,” Kuria said.
