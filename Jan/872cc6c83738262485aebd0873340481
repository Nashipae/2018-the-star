The Salaries and Remuneration Commission has moved to court seeking to lift orders that barred it from reviewing MPs pay. In a petition filed at the High Court, the SRC accuse MPs of not being candid in the matter and for concealing facts that could have convinced the court otherwise while issuing the orders. On December 17, High Court judge George Odunga temporarily barred the SRC from implementing the slashed remuneration and benefits for state officers and MPs, pending hearing and determination of the case. The orders were issued after the Parliamentary Service Commission sought to quash a Gazette Notice that reduced the members’ sitting allowances. The PSC accused the SRC of going against its constitutional mandate and seeking to cripple the functions of the 12th Parliament. Irrecoverable But the SRC says the orders against it have far-reaching implications that will be irreversible if not annulled by the court. “The effect of the leave operating as a stay is that the applicant will proceed to remunerate employees on irregular terms, which if effected, the sums will be irrecoverable,” the SRC says. According to the SRC, if the order remains in force, the PSC will proceed to remunerate its employees on irregular terms. The remuneration agency wants the injunction lifted, pending determination of a case by the PSC. The SRC in court documents says the PSC failed to tell the court the truth that they were engaged in talks prior to the gazettement of the new perks. “There was communication between the SRC and the PSC before the Gazette Notice effecting the new terms was published,” the SRC states. The Gazette Notice was published on July 7, and among other things, abolished the car grant and reduced the number of sitting allowances for plenary sessions.
