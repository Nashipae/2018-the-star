An infant was on Wednesday night mauled to death by a hyena in Garissa county. Zamzam Mahat was grabbed by the carnivore from outside their Manyatta in Farial village, where she was sleeping next to her mother. The tragedy occurred at about 11.30pm. The woman had decided to sleep outside the hut because it was too hot inside. Speaking to the press at the Garissa Referral Hospital mortuary, where the body was taken for postmortem, Mahat's father Abdullahi Sheikh he was away when the hyena struck. He said he was involved in the preparation of the burial of a relative in another village. "My wife and other family members chased the animal as they shouted for help. The hyena eventually dropped the baby a kilometre away before disappearing into a thicket," Abdullahi said. "My daughter was already dead as a result of the deep cuts inflicted on her head. Her stomach was ripped open and one eye was missing." The incident came barely a fortnight after a two-year-old boy was also killed by a hyena in Dertu village in Ladgera constituency. Salah Abdi was sleeping in their house when the hyena raided. The animal grabbed the baby and ran into a thicket. His mother, awakened by her baby’s cries, wailed and shouted for help as the hyena ran with Abdi tightly held in its mouth. Abdullahi said residents were living in fear of attack by wild animals. Drought has forced many animals to look for food and water in homes. “We will lose more lives if something is not done urgently," Abdullahi said. He said efforts for intervention from the Kenya Wildlife Service has not been fruitful. KWS officials, who visited the morgue, examined Mahat's body and left. They did not talk to the media. Mahat's body was later released to the family for burial at the Garissa Muslim Cemetery.
