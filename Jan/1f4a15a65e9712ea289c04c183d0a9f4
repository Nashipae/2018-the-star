Sixty-five former councilors will begin receiving their share of Sh10 million kit as a token of appreciation of their service to the public. Former Kitui County Council chairman Thomas Kisome on Tuesday said he was grateful finally, Governor Charity Ngilu agreed to pay them the money, which they had been pushing since the tenure of her predecessor Julius Malombe. “We are happy at last, we will have something to put in our pocket. They are preparing our cheques after Governor Ngilu authorised the payment. We have been told that by February, we will be paid,” Kisome said. He, however, said the payout to the Kitui councillors had been delayed unnecessarily since those from Machakos county and other areas had long been paid. “In fact, Governor Alfred Mutua of Machakos paid the former councilors in his county during his first term.The beauty of it is that we will now get our money, however, belatedly,” Kisome said. Kitui executive for Treasury Mary Nguli was in meeting in the better part of yesterday, thus not available to give details on the payments. But an authoritative source said all the former civic leaders from Kitui who served for two or more terms will benefit from the the kitty. The source said cheques were being processed and for those who could have died, their next of kin will get the money. But a section of former councilors who have been left out of the payments because they only served for a single term, are unhappy and say hey have been discriminated. “We should not have been left out because we also served our people,” Lazarus Muthoka, a former one-term councillor said.
