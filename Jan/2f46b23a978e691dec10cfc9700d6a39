Comedian MCA Tricky has urged the youth to leave drugs and believe in their dream. "Don't dare do drugs. If you have a dream, rehearse by yourself, believe in yourself and don't wait for other people to do it for you. Fanya kitu mpaka watu wakukujie," he told Word Is at the launch of the Oscar-nominated film, Mully. So, what's the future of the comedy industry? "It will be determined by the kind of competition we have right now. You have to be the best in what you do, to stand out." Tricky says this year he's going all digital. "I'll be entertaining people on MCA Tricky Trends. Thats where I'll be but that doesn't mean I'm leaving Churchill Show, I'm still there."
