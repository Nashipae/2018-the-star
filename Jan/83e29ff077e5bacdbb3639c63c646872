University of Nairobi students went on a rampage on Thursday protesting delays of their higher education loans. Nairobi police commander Japhet Koome said the students lit bonfires along the State House road and inconvenienced motorists. "That [HELB] delays should not result in burning tires on the roads. That is wrong and we want to remove them from the road," Koome told the Star on phone.

Koome is leading the anti-riot police in controlling the students to restore normalcy. Speaking to the star on phone, student leader Steve Chege said that HELB was disbursed in financial year 2017/2018, therefore it should have been deposited to student's accounts by now. "Students are suffering in their hostels while others are still stuck at home with unpaid fees arrears due to delayed HELB. The money was supposed to be deposited to their accounts last year or early January this year," Chege said. Koome said police have deployed more personnel in Nairobi especially in CBD and crime prone areas following the increase of muggings and robberies in CBD. Reports of people being mugged by groups of robbers who are said to have taken over certain streets emerged last week. But Koome downplayed the matter and said some of the video clips circulated in social media were not from Kenya and some pictures were taken during post-election violence. "We don't want to look like we are being defensive. We have deployed more officers and enhanced patrols. If you move around you will see our officers," Koome said.
