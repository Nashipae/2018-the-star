Hopekid took to Instagram to wish DJ Mo a happy birthday. He said the entertainer helped him reach his full potential in the industry. In the rare heartfelt message, Hopekid said DJ Mo is the guy who actually paid for his first audio recording. What a humble soul. "1 did you know that this brother right here paid for my 1st audio #DREAM 2 did you know that this brother right here called every dj personally and explained to them why they should be on my video #DREAM," he wrote. "I could go on and on and on about what this ninja did for me when I was a nobody but today just know from the bottom of my heart I CELEBRATE YOU @djmokenya YOU ARE A REAL BROTHER."
