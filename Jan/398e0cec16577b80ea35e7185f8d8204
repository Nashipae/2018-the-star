Wiper boss Kalonzo Musyoka yesterday expressed his dissatisfaction over ODM’s dominance in the parliamentary leadership. In a friendly tone, Kalonzo said ODM should preserve some seats for his party. “I ask you ODM guys don’t take all seats,” he said. Kalonzo said Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo was victimised for protesting. “My brother here (Mbogo) has been fought, but he is strong like me,” he said.

But Joho picked him to vie on ODM ticket,” he said. Twalib beat Wiper’s Mathias Shipeta, who was Omar’s favourite. Omar resigned from his secretary general post and campaigned for President Uhuru Kenyatta during the October 26 repeat presidential election. Kalonzo said he was hopeful the dispute in house leadership will be resolved. “We are a one house called NASA,” he said. He spoke yesterday in Mombasa during the second Coast convention of the People’s Assembly. ODM, whose boss Raila Odinga is Kalonzo’s flagbearer, is accused of bulldozing other NASA affiliates parties – ANC, Ford Kenya and Wiper. The Orange party has won majority seats in watch dog committees. Wiper is demanding the reversal names of the heads of the respective committees. Click here for the latest political news
