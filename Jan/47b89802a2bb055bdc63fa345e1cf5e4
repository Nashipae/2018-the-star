The government has increased electricity supply to residents on the Kisii-Awendo transmission line. The installation of a 132kV line at Kegati substation will strengthen the previous 33kV line. Kenya Electricity Transmission Company managing director Fernandes Barasa on Tuesday said the installation will reduce losses caused by inefficiency. “The replacement of the 33kV line that was susceptible to faults that resulted in power outages in Kisii and Awendo will now record reduced power outages and an increased reliability of supply,” he said. In a press statement yesterday, Barasa said the line will ensure voltage stability with the use of a transformer regulator and reduced lengths of the feeders. “This means that during the periods when the 132kV line is switched off for maintenance, the 33kV feeders will act as an alternative that will supply areas with uninterrupted power,” he said. He said improved supply should act as an incentive for the establishment of industries.
