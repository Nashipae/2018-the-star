One person was shot dead  in Suswa, Narok after youths demanded SGR jobs from the Chinese company contracted to build the railway. According to the Chinese company, around 200 job seekers approached SGR camp site demanding for employment.  "The situation got violent as the contractor was making arrangements to engage the locals over the jobs," Sammy Mwangi, the company's media executive, said. In a statement on Saturday, Mwangi said the job seekers tried to force their way into the camp site and threatened to harm those who were at the site. "At some point, the job seekers having entered the site forcefully, pelted stones at the security officers in an attempt to get deep inside the premises." "In the process, one of the AP officer’s was attacked and injured," Mwangi said. He added that the crowd surged forward forcing the APs, who were outnumbered, to disperse them. "Unfortunately, one of the locals was shot during the melee and died outside the camp," he said. "We are now working with the local authorities on ground to ensure the stalemate is brought to an end in an amicable manner." Click
