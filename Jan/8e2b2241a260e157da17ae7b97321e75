Fifteen members of the Nyumba Kumi community policing initiative in Gatanga have been charged with violent robbery in a Murang’a court. The 15 were accused of robbing Naomi Wangui of household items including glasses, plates and a television set on January 12 at Nyaitera village in Ithanga, Gatanga subcounty. They denied the charges before chief magistrate Margaret Wachira and were released on Sh200,000 bond. The case will be heard on March 5. The case was transferred from Kandara law courts over security. The magistrate also transferred cases of two of the suspects, John Kang’ethe and Andrew Kihara, back to Kandara. This was after the prosecution applied to have the two cases transferred citing security reasons. State counsel Solomon Njeru said scores of residents say the 15 were conducting a security operation, not stealing.
