Last year was clearly a rough year for Nigerian actress Tonto Dikeh. She
was in the headlines after her bitter breakup from her husband, whom she
accused of domestic violence, among other matters. Tonto and her husband
were all over social media slandering each other, and tongues wagged
even more as they unleashed evidence of the breakdown of their marriage. Olakunle
Churchill, the estranged husband, demanded a refund of bride price,
which true to her word, she refunded. Yes, and she was proud to announce
to the world, going to the extent of sharing a video as proof. Well,  the actress is turning over a new leaf, and in late December, it was
alleged she had a body makeover as she sought to get over her tumultuous
past. To shed off her past, the controversial actress underwent
cosmetic surgery and showed off the man behind the magic. Her fans, though, were not too pleased she was transforming herself. Truth be told, she doesn't care and proclaimed so by writing: "Happy
New Year to my surgeon and his crew. "Wish you all a great and fulfilled new year,Thanks for all you do for humanity..Thanks for letting God use you in my life as a great source of Joy!! For the first time I took my time to appreciate my new body(Damn too sexy by the way),I cried,I leaped with joy and all I can say is am so ready to conquer the world with my new found confidence...
