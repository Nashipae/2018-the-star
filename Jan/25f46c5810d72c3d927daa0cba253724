Seven Kenyatta University students will today formally be charged with arson. This is after a Kiambu court overruled an application to overturn the ruling to have the seven detained for five days to as investigations are completed. David Amisi, David Morara, Dominic Orwa, Eric Mutuku, George Nguru, Trevor Agoi and Victor Wafula are being held at Kiambu police station. They were arrested on January 9. Kiambu principal magistrate Justus Kituku said the application made by the suspects’ lawyer - Harun Ndubi - to overturn his ruling and release the suspects with or without conditions did not have enough grounds. He said the investigating officer had a right to complete investigations. Kituku said Ndubi’s argument the suspects should be released as there was no DPP in office cannot hinder investigations. Last November, KU was closed indefinitely after a night of unrest. Students burnt the old admission block to protest against newly elected student leaders. Kituku made the remand ruling on Thursday last week. The five days will end on today. Ndubi  had suggested the suspects could be asked to stay away from the campus or provide police with any information they may require. He said the investigating officer had infringed on the students’ rights by confiscating their phones and taking them to the cybercrime unit. This was in contempt of a court ruling that ordered the phones given back to the suspects. The court ruled that taking away the phones infringed on their right to privacy. Ndubi had told the court that since there is no DPP in office, the investigating officer should not have used a lawyer to ask for more time to complete investigations.
