Internally displaced persons in Trans Nzoia have been warned against giving money to government offices amid a compensation process. Speaking to The Star in her office on Tuesday, county commissioner Ann Gakuria refuted claims that each one is to give Sh3,000 to an office in Kitale and another Sh10,000 to one in Nairobi. “Any IDP asked to remit part of their money to any government office should report this at a police station and record a statement,” she said. Gakuria said the claim was by politicians who wish to add their people's names to the compensation list. IDPs who number more than 4,000, following the 2007/8 post-election violence, are each getting Sh50,000. Their chairman Mark Adir confirmed the claims but said it will be difficult to take legal action as nobody has complained. “We have established cartels have lied to IDPs and threatened that if they leak the information, their names will be omitted," Adir told The Star by phone. Gakuria assured that all eligible IDPs will be compensated and that families will claim amounts for relatives who died. She said the process is taking long because of thorough checks. Meanwhile, IDPs in Saboti have complained that their names have been left out of the list. They marched to the county commissioner's office on Thursday to air their grievances. Adir said they were temporarily settled in Kinyoro during Operation Rudi Nyumbani but are yet to get cash as promised.  Details: Saboti IDPs cry foul, say names removed from stipends list Click here for the latest political news
