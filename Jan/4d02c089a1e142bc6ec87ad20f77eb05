Traders lit bonfires and blocked Ring Road in Nairobi on Thursday to protest the destruction of their stalls. This was after county askaris pulled down illegal structures along Argwings Kodhek road near Yaya Centre. The officers were accused of impunity but senior inspectorate officer Peter Mbaya noted the structures were not authorised. "We gave them relocation notices last month," Mbaya told The Star, noting stalls cannot be erected on pedestrian walkways and roads. "Pedestrians find it difficult to move about since the stalls occupy parts of pavements." Mbaya said some askaris earlier visited the traders and asked them to leave as they would take actions. Some reportedly agreed to move but later claimed they were neither warned nor given enough time to find other locations. GSU officers dispersed the protesters but tension remained. Mbaya said: "We will not stop until Nairobi is clean and we will not tolerate any illegal operations. "It is risky for the traders to operate close to the road. Accidents can occur very easily. Who will be to blame?"  Click here for the latest political news
