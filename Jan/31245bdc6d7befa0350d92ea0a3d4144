The petitioner challenging the victory of Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama has urged the courts to nullify the  results and order fresh polls. Former Kitutu Masaba MP Walter Nyambati, through his lawyer Kennedy Nyaencha, told the court the results announced did not reflect the will of the people. “The petitioner has proved his case in the balance of probabilities in the whole election. The election, therefore, would not be said to be the will of the people of Nyamira county,” Nyaencha told the court on Tuesday. He said the will of the people was subverted by the actions of the first, second and third respondents and the only way for the people to exercise their will is to have the results nullified. IEBC and county returning officer David Towett, through lawyers Jackson Nyamweya and James Mamboleo, said the IEBC conducted a fair, credible and verifiable election that reflected the will of the people. IEBC midwife “The IEBC is a midwife. It midwifed the voters of Nyamira county a bouncing baby boy during the August 8 General Election. The baby boy is well and is in court,” Mamboleo said. He said the will of the people was expressed and it is the responsibility of the court to uphold the will of the electorate. No perfection Mamboleo said no election is perfect. “Even the law recognises there is no perfect election,” he said. On bribery allegations, Mamboleo said the evidence given about bribery allegations was shaky and could not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. “Administrative errors resulting from human imperfection cannot deofficiate an election result,” he told Justice James Makau. A ruling will be made on February 28.
