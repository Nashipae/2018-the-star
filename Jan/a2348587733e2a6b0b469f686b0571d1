Lameck Baraza/ Alego-Usonga MP Samuel Atandi has warned Siaya MCAs against derailing service delivery after they failed to approve the proposed Cabinet nominees. Atandi said despite Siaya MCAs being 100 per cent ODM members, they have resorted into “unnecessary hard stances, frustrating service delivery”. Speaking in Siaya town on Saturday, Atandi told Siaya MCAs not to hamper development for personal interests. The MP reminded the speaker and MCAs their performance will be judged based on how they facilitate service delivery. “We have counties like Nairobi that has a hybrid of members - half ODM half Jubilee - but they agreed to approve their Cabinet nominees to facilitate service delivery,” Atandi said. He said service delivery offered to Siaya residents affects everyone, including leaders, and no one should ask him to ‘stop poking my nose’ into county affairs.
