Police in Kwale are holding witch hunter Omar Mboni in connection with alleged extortion of Sh650,000 from poor villagers in Mkongani. He is to appear in court today. Residents overwhelmingy support witch hunting and contribute cash despite their poverty. They have threatened to demonstrate in support of Mboni at the Kwale court. Speaking to journalists yesterday, Matuga deputy commissioner Benson Maisor said the suspect was arrested on Sunday at Mkomba village in Mkongani. Mboni was at the home of an elderly man accused of bewitching residents. “We got a report after Abdallah Nyangasi ran for safety to Burani police station. We sent our officers to arrest the witch hunter,” he said. Maisor said Mboni was paid Sh650,000. Each village contributed Sh50,000 for services. Residents believe witch hunters will help them catch witches, especially elderly people whom they believe can harm them. Mboni hadvisited Mzinji and Kitenge villages, before heading to Mkomba. He claimed he retrieved an ‘evil pot’ and a tortoise buried in an elderly man’s house suspected to be practicising witchcraft. Mboni urinated on the witch’ s head and shaved him ‘to eliminate evil and to stop him from practising witchcraft’.
