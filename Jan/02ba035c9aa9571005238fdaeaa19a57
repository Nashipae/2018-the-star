Residents of Garissa who wish to travel by air can now do so following the launch of the first flight by Freedom Air Expresss in the area yesterday. The airline will be operating on Mondays and Fridays and will charge Sh5,000 per passenger. Buses normally charge Sh1,000 and take six hours from Garissa to Nairobi. Shillow Abukar, the manager of the airline, says he decided to venture into the business following numerous requests from residents. Speaking to the press after seeing off the first bunch of travellers, Shillow said the agency will be consistent, and urged residents to travel by air since it is faster and more affordable. “I am really encouraged by the big number (17) of those who had turned up to travel on the first day, I am optimistic that going forward, we will have a much bigger number who will fill the plane,” Hillow said. He said the airline plans to have daily flights depending on the passengers. Fatuma Abdi, a nominated MCA who was among the passengers, welcomed the move, saying it will go along way in reducing cost and travelling hours. “Whenever I wanted to travel to Nairobi, I would fuel my vehicle and hire a driver. This would cost me close to 25,000. But with the flight , I will save a lot,” she said. She called upon the management to introduce direct flights from Garissa to Mombasa and Lamu, saying many have business interests in the areas but it is tiresome to travel by road. Ahmed Jelle, a business man, said patients being rushed to Nairobi for treatment will get there in good time. Two years ago, Sagal Airline launched operations in the area but failed due to lack of passengers. They were charging Sh8,000 which according to many, was much.
