The multibillion-shilling Tatu City Project has hit another setback after the High Court temporarily stopped the construction of trunk, access roads and other infrastructure at a cost of Sh1.4 billion. The temporary orders were issued after local contractor Ongata Works Ltd moved to court to challenge Tatu Cityâ€™s move to terminate its contract. Ongata Works Limited had been issued with the contract on September 9, 2016 for construction of trunk and access roads and infrastructure for Kijani Ridge in Tatu City. The company was to undertake construction of roads, sewer systems, water and drainage and the street lighting all at a cost of Sh1,442,460,961. The work was to be completed in 13 months starting October 7, 2016 when the construction commenced and the contract was to end on November 7, 2017. However, Tatu City issued the contractor a notice to terminate the 18-month contract on December 13 last year citing failure to comply with certain instructions. The 14-day notice was to take effect on December 27, 2017. Ongata Works moved to court seeking orders restraining Tatu City from evicting them and taking over the site. According to the contractor, Tatu City has been frustrating and obstructing its work and changing instructions along the way, leading to delays in completion. Ongata Works claimed Tatu City had frustrated the expeditious, timely and effective performance of the contract.
