Boda Boda operators on Monday launched an online portal to keep track of those operating within the CBD. Chairman of the boda-boda association Kevin Mubadi said all operators will be given a special code which will be stuck on their motorcycles for identification. "The stickers will assist in quick identification if the rider breaks the law or is reported to bÃ¨ involved in crime," Mubadi said.

He said in a near future, the association will launch an online application called 'Juubike' where customers can request for boda-boda services online. Mubadi said they are having consultative talks with the County Government after last week's ban in the CBD. Starehe MP Charles Njagua who attended the event said it is wrong to blame the operators for the rising crime in the city. "We cannot just blame them for the crime, there are also cars involved in committing crime. I urge the Transport CS to listen to bodaboda members and work together with them,' he said.

Jaguar, in an urgent application filed at the Milimani law court on Wednesday, said the decision was reached without any consultation. The county government issued a notice on January 22 warning of hefty fines, arrest and long jail terms for riders found contravening the directive. The government stated in a gazette notice that riders will no longer access the central business district except those offering courier services. "Pursuant to the provisions of the Traffic Act CAP 403 of 2014 of the Laws of the Republic of Kenya, the county government of Nairobi wishes to inform all motorcycle operators ferrying passengers to and from the CBD that such activities have been banned with immediate effect," the notice by acting County Secretary Leboo Morintat read in part.

"The boda boda ban may result in more harm than good as the operators will be left frustrated and without a source of livelihood and may easily be indicted into the very criminal activities the ban seeks to curb," he argued.
