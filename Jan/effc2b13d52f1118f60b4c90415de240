Kanu has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to consider its members for the remaining appointed positions. West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo said the party, unlike other Jubilee affiliates, did not get slots among those nominated by the President on Friday. He spoke at St Francis Cheptarit Catholic Church on Sunday. He said they hope Uhuru will prioritise the party in other appointments. Nandi Governor Stephen Sang and Senator Samson Cherargei also attended the service. The leaders expressed fears over the planned swearing-in of NASA leaders Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka. They called it a separatist agenda and political scheme. Sang urged Kenyans to resist what he called attempts by NASA to plunge the country into civil strife.
