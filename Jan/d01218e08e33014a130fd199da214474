General Service Unit are keen to better their performance as they return to the African volleyball Club Championship from March 25 and April 6 in Cairo, Egypt. The reigning Kenya Volleyball Federation league champions missed the last edition which was held in Tunisia last year due to financial constraints. GSU manager Nicholas Kimeli believes the current squad which is a cocktail of experienced and fast-raising players have a chance to better their performance. “Most players featured in the World Championship qualifiers with the national team and this will work to our advantage. Currently, we are working on strength and conditioning of the players and they are responding well,” he said. GSU finished a distant position 17 out of 24 teams at the same venue. He added: “We finished last season unbeaten and reclaimed the league title. We won last in 2015 and the development gives us morale ahead of the Africa show. We have been to the Africa Championships for a while now and this time around, we want our presence to be felt. We are also keen to defend the local title,” he added. GSU and their local nemesis Kenya Prisons are set to represent the nation in the annual event by virtue of emerging first and second respectively last season. Kenya Pipeline and Kenya Prisons will represent the nation in the women’s version of the same event set for March 5-16 in Cairo, Egypt. Meanwhile, Bungoma County will host the first leg of the 2018 KVF national league/County Open tournament set for March 23-25 at Bungoma High School grounds. The event returns to the county after a long time. KVF secretary general Ben Juma said: “We have a busy year but all in all we hope it will end successfully. We have elections and some of our men and women’s clubs will be participating in the Africa Club Championship. We will also be staging the Under 20 women’s championship later in the year and we hope to send the women’s team to the World Championship in Japan,” said Juma.
