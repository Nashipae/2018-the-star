The Garissa government has distributed 10 portable ultrasound equipment worth Sh6.5 million to seven health facilities. Health chief officer Mohammed Gure said the equipments will help reduce maternal and infant mortality. He spoke when distributing the equipment at Dadaab Subcounty Hospital on Monday. According to the UNFPA report of 2014, although Nairobi, Nakuru, Kakamega, Kilifi, Nandi Bungoma and Kwale counties rank higher in the number of deaths, they are ranked lower in terms of maternal mortality ratio. The study indicates that nearly half of the deaths (48 per cent) occur in the country during childbirth in Lamu, Garissa, Wajir, Mandera and Turkana counties. County reproductive health coordinator Fatuma Imaan said many mothers have been losing babies due to foetus complications in remotes areas. She said the main aim of procuring the machines was to detect any complications early during the antenatal care and to correct if possible before the pregnancy advances. Fatuma said several mothers who were being referred to refugee hospitals are finding it inconvenient to attend antenatal care in public facilities. “Because of the long queues and distance, some of the mother give up on attending antenatal clinic. This sometimes leads to complications that could have been detected and corrected earlier,” Fatuma said. She said those operating the machines have been trained.
