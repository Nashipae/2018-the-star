County officers have arrested at least 45 people who were found illegally dumping garbage in a crack down that started this week. City Hall senior inspector Peter Mbaya said that anyone found doing so, especially restaurants, will not be spared. “So far we have done a crack down in Eastleigh, Muthurwa market, Kweria Road and downtown,” Mbaya said. Those arrested, including the owners of the New Ramadan restaurant in Eastleigh, were arraigned in court yesterday. Garbage collection has been passed to subcounty level to end the problem. Acting Environment executive Mohamed Dagane urged residents to report illegal dumping through the hotline launched this week. Illegal dumping has been the main cause of blocked trenches that have led to overflow of untreated sewage on roads and within estates.
