The Malindi High court
on Wednesday upheld the election of Michael Kingi as Magarini MP, slapping the petitioner with Sh3 million cost. Justice Patrick Otieno
termed the petition filed by Johnson Mutawali and Boniface Nzai as fatally
defective and not capable of
being tried by a court of law. He said the petitioner
failed to include the results declared by the Independent Electoral and
Boundaries Commission (IEBC), which automatically rendered the petition
defective. Justice Otieno struck
out the case saying it would be a lesson for future petitioners and their
lawyers to ensure they follow the law to the latter. "Even though it will
be a burden to petitioner, it is going to be a lesson for future petitioners
and their lawyers since the law must be followed." The judge held that the grievance
by the petitioner shall remain untested by evidence. He said the
petitioners had planned to withdraw the case but Samson Kazungu - a voter from Magarini, was directed to replace them in the petition. The two petitioners
were sponsored by politician Franco Esposito, who lost the parliamentary seat
on KADU Asili Party. Justice Otieno ordered
them to pay the Sh3million to the MP, constituency returning officer, and IEBC. Kingiâ€™s petition is
the eighth to be dismissed in the nine cases filed against legislators from Kilifi county. The election of Senator Stewart Madzayo, women rep
Getrude Mbeyu, MPs Aisha Jumwa (Malindi), Owen Baya (Kilifi North), and Ken Chonga (Kilifi South) have been upheld. Those still fighting petitions are Governor Amason Kingi and Rabai MP William Kamoti. Click here for the latest political news
