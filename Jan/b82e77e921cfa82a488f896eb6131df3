Numerous hitches, including broken ballot boxes, tampered seals and unaccounted for ballot papers, clouded the final day of vote recount in the Homa Bay governor petition. At Got Rabuor polling centre, the ballot box and the lid were broken and the tamper proof envelop was not sealed.Former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga yesterday got 244 votes against Governor Cyprian Awiti’s 153 votes. At Nyaundho polling centre in Rangwe, where Awiti got 208 votes against his opponent’s 115 votes, it emerged the presiding officer failed to sign Form 37A, which lacked an IEBC stamp. Magwanga and his running mate Joshua Orero have petitioned Awiti’s victory.
