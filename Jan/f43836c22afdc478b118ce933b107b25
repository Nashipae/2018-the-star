The Centre for Rights Education and Awareness will petition Parliament to reject the list of nominated Cabinet Secretaries for failing to meet the two-thirds gender rule. Executive director Leah Wangechi said they expected President Uhuru Kenyatta to at least nominate nine women to the Cabinet. “We are disappointed by the President’s move. We will be asking Parliament to reject the list though we are skeptical it will have any impact due to the Jubilee tyranny of numbers,” she said. The Federation of Women Lawyers had by yesterday morning stated it will move to court to seek orders stopping Parliament from vetting the nominated CSs. Fida chairperson Josephine Mong’are said Uhuru did not honour the two-thirds gender principle guaranteed in the Constitution. “We will be filing a judicial review today to have the vetting stopped until the President increases the number of women in his Cabinet,” she said. Mong’are said the Cabinet should have 50 per cent women. On Friday last week, Uhuru named more members to his Cabinet as some got demoted to serve as ambassadors and high commissioners. Uhuru nominated six women to be Cabinet secretaries, which translates to 21 per cent of the 23-member Cabinet that also includes the President, Deputy President and the Attorney General Among the new entrants are Public Service Commission chairperson Margaret Kobia, Royal Media Services Chief Operating Officer Farida Karoney and former Meru Governor Peter Munya. Defence CS Raychelle Omamo retained her seat, while Gender CS Sicily Kariuki was nominated to handle the Health docket. Foreign Affairs PS Monica Juma was promoted as the Ministry’s new CS while her former boss Amina Mohamed was tasked with handling the Education ministry.
