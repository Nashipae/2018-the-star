TV presenter Antony Ndiema is expecting a third child with his wife. Talking during the launch of Oscar-nominated movie Mully, Ndiema said he has decided to do it back-to-back. "We are about to get our third born. We've been married for seven years, it's been a journey, a good journey. We said we will be going back-to-back, getting babies. We have a four-year-old, a two-and-a-half-year old and the one that's coming." As host of the KTN gospel show Tukuza, Ndiema applauded gospel artistes who are doing well, urging them to use their tools for the right agenda. "The gospel never changes, Christ never changes, he is the same now and forever more. As we think about how we spread the word the millennial, let's not lose the main agenda of why we do it. For me, gospel music is a tool to evangelise. It's not a tool to become famous," he said. "If you use your creativity better, go ahead. If your agenda is to be famous, make money and show other people, we are losing it. I really applaud those who have done well, but there are also those who are on the edge, and we are here to pray for them, support and walk with them. Some of them have such interest." This year, he said he hopes to feature in one of the biggest projects in film-making. "I left full-time job in 2016 and my deepest passion is to do films. That's what cries in my heart. I thank God I've been able to do some projects, telling stories. This year, I'm hoping that I will feature in a great project meant to transform lives."
