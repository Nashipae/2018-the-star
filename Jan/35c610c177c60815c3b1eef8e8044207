Kenya lost by 243 runs to hosts to hosts New Zealand in their second match of the International Cricket Council (ICC) Under-19 Cricket World Cup. Jakob Bhula’s sensational 180 assisted by Ravindra’s 117 and Allen’s 40-ball 90 lifted New Zealand to the second highest score ever in the tourney with 436/4 against Kenya. The match was characterised with huge scores, scorching strike-rates and monumental partnerships. The opening batsman blasted 180 from 144 balls to post the highest individual score ever at the tournament as New Zealand claimed the second highest team total in tournament history. Rachin Ravindra hit 117 from 101 balls while Finn Allen posted 90 off 40 balls to put Kenya under the pump. When Bhula and Allen fell in consecutive balls, New Zealand were 401-3 with 17 balls remaining. Dale Phillips, a brother to Black Caps’ Twenty20 player Glenn, scored 26 off 12 to further boost the score. Bhula’s innings surpassed Theo Doropoulos’ 179 not out against England at Sydney in 2003. Australia still own the highest ever team total after blasting Kenya for 480-6 at the same tournament and the same ground back in 2002. In reply, Kenya scored 193-4 in their 50 overs. Aman Gandhi top-scored with 63 from 106 balls opening the innings, while Ravindra snared 2-33 from his 10 overs of spin. Kenya were poor, and much worse than they had been against South Africa. There were three drops, all by Aman Ghandi with each of the top three reprieved once. There were, in fact as many catches claimed in the crowd as by Kenya’s fielders with a snaffled Finn Allen six drawing perhaps the biggest cheer of the day. Kenya at least didn’t let their heads drop as they rallied to claim three late wickets. However, this was too little, far too late. With the match over as a contest, Kenya satisfied themselves with batting out their overs, and New Zealand were content to let them. Ghandi compiled 63, and Ravindra added figures of 2/29 to his century. Allen’s half century off 19 was the joint-second quickest in U-19 ODIs behind Rishabh Pant’s 18-ball 50 against Nepal in the 2016 U19 World Cup. Abhishekh Chidambaran’s spell of 0/82 had the highest economy rate of any spell of more than five overs in U19 ODIs while New Zealand’s margin of victory of 243 runs was their biggest in Under 19 ODIs.
