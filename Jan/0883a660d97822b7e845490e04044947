Police are hunting for a suspect who stabbed an AP officer to death at the Mariira shopping centre in Kigumo subcounty, Murang’a county, last Thursday. Deputy county commissioner Moses Mbaruku on Friday said the assailant is a suspected narcotics peddler and stabbed Constable David Wesonga at 7.30pm as the officer sought to arrest him. The suspect fled soon after committing the offence. Witnesses said they heard the officer scream before he started staggering on the road. “We thought the officer, who was in plainclothes, was drunk. When he fell at the roadside, he was groaning in pain. That’s when we realised something was wrong,” a witness said. Mbaruku assured residents that the suspect would be arrested and charged. He appealed to members of the public to volunteer information that will help improve security. Kangari MCA Charles Kahoro who visited the scene on Friday morning urged police to investigate and arrest the suspect. He said they will not allow the narcotics trade and use, and urged the youth to seek employment in tea farms.
