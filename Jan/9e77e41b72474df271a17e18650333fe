Public Service CS Sicily Kariuki has attributed the failure by many children in Embu to join secondary schools to FGM and illicit brew. The CS said Female Genital Mutilation is still rampant in remote parts of Embu. It has lowered the transition rate of children from primary to secondary school. Speaking at Mountain Breeze Hotel in Embu town, Kariuki said the practice has mostly affected primary schoolgirls who should proceed to secondary school. “Once girls undergo the cut, they are told they are old enough to marry. Therefore, they make no effort to go to secondary school,” the CS said. FGM is carried out secretly because it is illegal. The government has started campaigns to educate residents on the dangers of the cut. Kariuki added that the availability of illicit brew has also worked against school enrolment. Many bars in Embu town open at 8am. The majority of the youth can access illicit liquor from the outlets that have been licensed. Kariuki urged Governor Martin Wambora to review the licensing policy. The CS said alcohol availability has a negative impact on young people and their education. Kariuki said the government has invested in the subsidised fees for day secondary education so that children whose parents cannot afford boarding school fees can comfortably take them to school.
