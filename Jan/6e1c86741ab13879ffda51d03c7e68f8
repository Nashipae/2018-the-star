Each form one student in Kwale county will get three text books published by the Kenya Literature Bureau. KLB chairman Francis Baya said they are targeting at least 30,000 form ones who reported to school for the first time. The bureau is supplying Chemistry, Biology and English books. The rest are supplied by other publishers. Speaking during the launch of the campaign to supply the books to schools yesterday at Matuga Girls Secondary School, Baya said KLB was identified by the government to supply 18 million books countrywide. “Our books have good content written by top authors and editors in a language that a learner can easily understand,” he said. He told students to make use of the books that the government has provided them for free and reciprocate it with good performance. Baya said they will also supply books to standard seven and eight students in primary schools. Kwale county education director Brigit Wambua praised the government for the move, saying parents have been relieved from the burden to buy books.
