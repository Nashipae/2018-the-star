Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro has asked the government to make secondary education free to ease the school fees burden on parents. He said parents are still forced to pay up to Sh50,000 in fees, especially in national and extra-county schools. The high fees are locking out of school many bright but needy students. Desperate parents are forced to enrol their children in day schools, which are free of charge. “A school asking for Sh30,000 per term from a parent or Sh60,000 annually is too high,” Nyoro said on Wednesday. He urged the government to establish feeding programmes in day schools to waive the Sh3,000 students are charged for food. All that parents will have to do is to enrol their children.  Nyoro distributed CDF bursary cheques for Sh3 million to 200 needy students admitted to national and extra-county schools. “I have been forced to only consider the two, because they are charged the highest fees and the money available is too little,” he said.  The students failed to qualify for other sponsorship programmes such as Equity Bank’s Wings To Fly. Nyoro said when CDF money is released by the national government, more students will be considered. The kitty will sustain the beneficiaries through school. Many parents are worried they will be unable to keep their children in national schools after admission. The students received amounts ranging from Sh10,000 to Sh33,000, depending on the school they are admitted to and parents financial status.  “Three students admitted to Kahuhia Girls High School have received Sh33,000, because their families could not afford to pay the fees and giving them half the cash would not have helped them,” he said. He pledged to ensure all students admitted to national and extra-county schools learn uninterrupted, whether their parents are financially capable or not.
