Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga has urged those who lost in the General Election to work with winners. Kahiga said it is unfortunate that there are still politicians who make negative comments months after the election. “Let those who are causing political temperatures to rise in the county hold their horses. We have just come from a political year. It is time to serve the Nyeri people,” he said on Gukena FM on Tuesday. The governor added that he consults his political rivals once in a while since he wants the county to move forward. “But this doesn’t mean you can’t correct me or my Cabinet. I’m ready to accept criticism,” he added. Kahiga took over power in November after the death of his boss Wahome Gakuru. The former deputy governor said he is not in charge by mistake. “I’m ready to take you to Canaan. I’m committed to serve Nyeri people. I report to work at 7am and leave late at night. You will judge me after five years,” he said. Kahiga said his government will release Sh30 million to boost trade in avocados, mangoes and macadamia. Gakuru died at Thika Level Five Hospital following a grisly road accident on November 7. Gakuru, 51, was reportedly travelling to Nairobi for an interview when his vehicle was involved in a road accident near Kabati on the Thika-Murang’a highway. Witnesses said the governor and his driver were trapped in his Mercedes Benz for close to an hour before they were pulled out of the car alongside others.
