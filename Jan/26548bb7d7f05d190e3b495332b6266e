ODM members from Kericho will attend NASA leader Raila Odinga’s swearing-in as President in Nairobi today. Former Londiani town council civic leader Jonah Koech on Thurday said the Kipsigis community is a liberal and democratic. The people decide on their political destiny without being swayed. In the 2007 General Election, Kipsigis from Transmara in Narok county, Bomet and Kericho counties and voted for Raila, but the votes were cooked in favour of former President Mwai Kibaki, he said. Koech told mourners at a burial of William Koech in Kipkelion East, that Raila won the 2007, 2013 and 2017 elections, but the results were skewed to deny him a chance of going to State House. “As a people who stand for the truth we will travel to Nairobi to witness his swearing-in,” Koech said. Raila, Cotu boss Francis Atwoli, ODM chairman Bomet county Ronald Ngeny and Kericho ODM secretary Nicholas Tum attended the burial. But speaking to journalists in Kericho town on Sunday, Kanu member and a long-serving civic leader Alhaji Kiptanui told Raila to put the interests of more than 40 million Kenyans heart. He said President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto are legally in the office. Kiptanui appealed to Kalenjin community not to travel to Nairobi for the swearing-in.
