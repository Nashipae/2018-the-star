There was mixed reaction in Mandera following the re-appointment of Industrialization CS Adan Mohamed. While some residents celebrated, others thought he does not deserve the position. Mohamed’s supporters took to the streets of Mandera town to celebrate. They thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta for having confidence in him. They issued a press statement commending the President. The CS hails from Kutulo subcounty in Mandera South. Community leader Suleiman Mohamed said his retention is a big win for the people of Mandera. “We congratulate the President for his balanced appointments. We are grateful,” Suleiman said. There were fears the Cabinet Secretary might be among those on the chopping board. Mandera county, which is dominated by the Economic Freedom Party and Jubilee, overwhelmingly voted for Uhuru in the General Election. However, many of the other elective seats went to EFP. Earlier, Mandera Governor Ali Roba congratulated Mohamed and Education CS Amina Mohamed. However, those opposed to the appointment said he has done little to uplift the living standards of locals. “We have nothing to celebrate about. Only a small clique of individuals from his sub-clan know his goodness. It is unfortunate there is no project he initiated,” an MCA, who didn’t want to be named, said.
