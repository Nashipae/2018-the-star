Mbeere South MP Geoffrey King’ang’i has allocated 10 acres of public land to squatters living in a cemetery as a New Year gift to protect it from grabbers. King’ang’i gave the land in Wango, Karaba, to 75 families who have been living at a cemetery in Karuku, Makutano, for the past 20 years. They were evicted from Makutano shopping centre in 1998 and were to be resettled, but the plans failed.  The MP gave each family a 100ftx50ft plot to build their houses. King’ang’i also threw a party for the squatters. He said they learnt the land was registered in the name of a relative of a former Constituency Development Fund official. King’ang’i said the Sh3million land was bought by the former CDF committee for settlement of the families and other people evicted to create room for Makawani Polytechnic. “The land was bought with public money to resettle the families,” King’ang’i said.  Contacted former CDF officialsdenied King’angi’s allegations. They said the land is registered under CDF.
