Four people died and several others were injured yesterday after the bus they were travelling in was involved in an accident on the Garissa-Wajir road. The bus, belonging to the Subrin Bus Company, was heading to Wajir, when it rammed into a stalled lorry a few kilometres past Habaswein town at 1am. Survivors said the bus, which was carrying more than 50 passengers, was being driven at high speed. Survivor Abdi Mohamed, who sustained minor injuries, said the driver was trying to overtake another bus when he rammed into the lorry. “As you know, the road to Wajir is very rough and bumpy. The other bus was right in front of us. Our driver did not see the stalled lorry, because of the dust,” he said. The injured were taken to Habaswein Subcounty Hospital and the others were airlifted to Nairobi. It is not clear how the bus passed police checkpoints from Garissa, since the government has banned night travels. It is suspected rogue police officers are colluding with the long-distance bus operators to allow them to travel at night.
