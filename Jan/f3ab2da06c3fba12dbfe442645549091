A 2kg packet of unga should not retail at more than Sh115 because there is enough stock, Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe has said. Speaking in Mombasa yesterday, Lesiyampe said the country has enough stock of maize despite the end of a government subsidy programme last month. A 90kg bag should not sell at more than Sh3,200. “We have adequate supply of maize. There should be no reason for 2kg packet of maize flour to retail at anything above Sh115,” Lesiyampe said. He said the government will take adequate intervention should the country run out of supply. “If situation changes, we will deal with it,” Lesiyampe said after attending the induction of members of the National Assembly's Agriculture Committee at the Whitesands Hotel. Last week, millers warned that the prices of a 2kg packet of unga could rise to Sh200 by March. Currently, it retails at between Sh110 and Sh115 in many stores countrywide. United Grain Millers Association chairman Peter Kuguru said the available maize can only last up to end of February. He said supply from the North Rift was declining. “We currently have only two million bags of maize at the Strategic Grain Reserve against a monthly demand of three million. This means millers will have to rely on imports from the neighbouring countries like Uganda and Tanzania,” Kuguru said. Lesiyampe said there is no reason to cause alarm. It is believed that some farmers could be hoarding maize in anticipation of better prices. A 90kg bag sells for between Sh3,000 and Sh3,200.
