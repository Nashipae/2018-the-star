A police officer attached to Kongoni police station in Naivasha fatally shot his girlfriend in the stomach and thighs six times, killing her, following an argument. Benjamin Lelemen, a junior officer, had cohabited with Beatrice Nyokabi, 31, for two years. Police confiscated Leleman's AK-47 rifle and arrested him. The incident came barely a fortnight after a junior police officer opened fire, killing the deputy OCS of Makueni police station and injuring two others. In the Naivasha incident, the constable had retreated to the house he shared with his girlfriend when a quarrel ensued. According to a junior officer who declined to be named, there was a heated argument between the two, and the woman insisted on leaving the house. “It was around 11pm when we heard screams followed by gunshots and we rushed to the house to enquire what was going on,” the officer said. The officer added that after consultation, the suspect came out holding a gun before he was disarmed and locked up. “The woman was already dead by the time we managed to enter the house and she had bullet wounds in her stomach and upper legs,” the source said. Naivasha subcounty assistant commissioner Joseph Opondo confirmed the incident, adding that the suspect had since been transferred to Naivasha police station. Opondo, who is in charge of Kongoni division, added the investigating officers had recovered the weapon and 24 bullets. “The cause of the shooting is not yet clear, but initial investigations indicate the victim was shot six times using an AK-47 rifle,” he said. The senior government officer expressed concern over the incident, adding he had spent the day with the officer during a security operation in the nearby Kosovo area. “The body has been collected and taken to Naivasha Subcounty Hospital mortuary and the suspect will definitely be charged with murder when investigations are through,” he said.
