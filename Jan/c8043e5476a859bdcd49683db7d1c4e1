Baringo North MP William Cheptumo was on Tuesday fined Sh150,000 by a Kabarnet court for
snubbing proceedings on Monday. Cheptumo said he was comfortable with the fine issued by Kabarnet High Court judge Edward Muriithi. The MP was required in court where hearing on a petition challenging his election is ongoing. His election was challenged by rival Joseph Makilap. Cheptumo replaced his lawyer Joseph Masindet with Charles Kanjama. “Cheptumo has been
delaying this case by pushing dates and snubbing hearings since September,”
Makilap said yesterday. Masindet said Cheptumo was replacing his lawyer because he had sensed defeat. "In fact, he is getting from better to worse," Masindet said.
