Parents and leaders in Wajir East are appealing to the government to set up tertiary institutions to absorb hundreds of candidates who could not make it to public universities. Each passing year, the number of students failing to join university is increasing, a trend they say is now posing a security threat in the region. Less then 100 students from the constituency got grade C+ and above. Rashid Kassim, the Area MP, said 12 secondary schools in the area have registered an overall failure in terms of performance. The Ministry of Education recently announced major policy changes concerning higher education, but residents claim some of the requirements are a disadvantage to students from marginalised regions Kassim is not happy with the government’s decision to abolish bridging services of universities and constituent colleges, which previously allowed students with lower KCSE grades to transit from certificate, Diploma then to degree. “We have realised that there were remarkable policy changes initiated by the ministry. While we feel some of them could be useful to our children, some of them are detrimental. It is important that everyone be involved,” he said. “Matiangi will have his day in parliament whether he will be accountable to Kenyans on the policies he has introduced without making consultations with education stakeholders in the country,” he added. Wajir East, Education officer, Nur Ibrahim said that the government will set up more polytechnics to enrol those with low grades for different courses. “In one school alone, 100 candidates scored and E. Its only Matiang'i who can give direction on where such students will go to. This is a ticking time bomb, “ Mohamed Dilahow, a parent, said.
