Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua yesterday said he did not bribe voters to elect him for a second term. Appearing for the first time in court since the hearing of a petition challenging his election began, Mutua said he did not list public officers to act as his poll agents. The Maendeleo Chap Chap party leader urged the court to dismiss the petition, saying his election met the constitutional requirements. Mutua’s election has been challenged by rival Wavinya Ndeti. Ndeti ran on the Wiper party ticket. She accused Mutua of hiring county employees to act as his agents during the election.  Ndeti said the employees rigged the election in Mutua’s favour. She also accused Mutua of bribing voters.  Mutua, who was being cross-examined by Ndeti’s lawyer Willis Otieno, denied the claims. “I did not give money to anyone. I urged voters to elect me based on my development scorecard,” Mutua said. He told justice Aggrey Muchelule that he did not coerce county employees to campaign or vote for him. Mutua was accompanied in court by his lawyers led by senior counsel Waweru Gatonye. Mutua said public servants were barred from participating in active politics. He said a circular signed by the county secretary was forwarded to all employees. He also denied using a table banking programme to advance credit to small-scale traders in order to lure them to vote for him.  Mutua said the programme had been ongoing and was not linked to the election.  He told the court that his party agents were appointment by the secretariat. “I had no role in their picking,” Mutua said.  On cross-examination by his lawyers, Mutua said the election was free and fair.  He asked the court to dismiss the petition, saying it lacked evidence. Lawyers representing the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, led by Kimani Muhoro, were also present. The hearing continues today.
