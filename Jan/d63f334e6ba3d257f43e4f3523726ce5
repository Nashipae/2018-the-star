A suspected criminal was lynched in Kinangop on Wednesday morning, residents saying they had been attacked long enough. Francis Nderitu, 30, was cornered after a group of five thugs attempted to break into a house in the area. The owner raised the alarm attracting residents who searched for the criminals.Â Four escaped while Nderitu was beaten and set on fire after a tyre was put over his head. This was the account by Nyandarua South OCPD Mohammand Huka following the incident at Githari village in Mukungi sub-location. A resident who spoke to The Star said the gang had been breaking into the home and stealing property including livestock. The resident said the attackers usually flee into Aberdare forest. "We decided to lynch him since we can no longer live with such dangerous people in this village," the resident said Another resident said: "God heard our prayers as this man had been a threat to women. He deserved the fate that befell him so others can learn." Cases of burglary and the theft of livestock have increased in Nyandarua, Ol kalou and Kinangop in particular. On November 11, 2017, Nyandarua Central OCPD Wilson Kosgei warned the criminals that they will find themselves at the mercy of residents.
