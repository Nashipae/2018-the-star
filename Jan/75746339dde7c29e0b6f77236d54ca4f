Risper Faith recently revealed that her dowry was a whooping Sh 2.5 milion. She is set to walk down the aisle with her fiance Brian Muiruri after the tradition wedding that took place in October last year. However, Brian has been exposed by an instagrammer called Evon Amolo for sending her naughty texts messages. The evidence for this was provided by Evon whoÂ reveals how the fella has been texting her and just like any husband you can see how scared he is to be caught by his wife. In one salacious text, Brian asks Evon to send nudes and a video of her twerking. She obliges. And asks him to delete then after feasting his eyes. So is Brian cheating or he is just "great" friends with Evon? Our calls for comments and text messages to Brian went unanswered. However, he took to social media and posted a photo of himself and Risper captioning it, "Happy wife, happy life."
