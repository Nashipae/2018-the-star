The self-proclaimed king of bling Jackson Makini, alias Prezzo, is a happy father. The controversial father, who has been keeping a low profile socially of late, finally reunited with his seven-year-old daughter, Zahrie, this festive season after a long time. Prezzo spoke about his daughter and why he decided to show her face to the public. Asked about his relationship with the mother of his child, Daisy Kiplagat, he spoke of no ill will towards her saying, "The only love I have is for my daughter. My princess, Zahrie, whom I love so much. She has occupied all the love inside me." Prezzo is very proud of his daughter and repeatedly said so in the interview. He also alluded to the prowess of his genes. He added: "My daughter, I like for her to live a private life. My daughter is very gifted. And I said to myself that I might as well reveal her. Let the people know that the president does not shoot blanks." When asked how his relationship was with his former wife and was it easy to get time to spend with his daughter, he said: "Yes, Blood is thicker than water, and at the end of the day, she is my blood and... Her mother and me have beef, but the kid should not suffer. We are both becoming very good parents and I thank her mother for playing a good role."
