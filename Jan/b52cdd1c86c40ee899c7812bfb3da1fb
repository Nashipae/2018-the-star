An Advocacy group against the introduction of sex education in schools on Thursday handed over a petition signed by 4,024 citizens to Education CS Fred Matiangi. Advocacy group CitizenGo campaign manager Anne Kioko claimed that the UN is behind the push for the introduction of comprehensive sex education. “This is a foreign-based curriculum and it is very destructive. Apart from that, it is also rights-based and teaches children that they are sexually active from a young age.” Kioko said outside Jogoo House.

The data showed that more than 300,000 children below the age 18 dropped out of school in June 2016 to July 2017 as a result of being pregnant. “If we allow such kind of a curriculum, I think we will be heading in the wrong direction. And if it is rolled out, I am certain that parents will pull their kids out of school.” Kioko said. However, Albert Obuyi, the executive director of the Center for the Study of Adolescents, said the government should find a way of addressing issues that are affecting the youth of today. “There is an increase in teenage pregnancies which should not be the case. We must also address other issues such as Female Genital Mutilation among others.”Obuyi said. Kioko said that if the government wants to introduce sex education in the curriculum, they should first involve all stakeholders in drafting the document.   Click here for the latest political news
