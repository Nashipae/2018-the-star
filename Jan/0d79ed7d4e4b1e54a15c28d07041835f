Leaders from Kajiado, led by Governor Joseph Lenku, on Saturday welcomed President Uhuru Kenyatta’s decision to appoint Keriako Tobiko to the Cabinet. They said it is good to be represented by one of their own in the Jubilee administration. Speaking at a hotel after a weeklong conference that included MPs, senators and MCAs, Lenku said the President will not regret his decision. “We did not expect the appointment. The entire county is grateful to President Uhuru for the bold move and we recognise this gesture as exceptional,” Lenku said. The leaders said Tobiko’s strong personality has made him to successfully achieve much, having served in distinguished positions. His sentiments were echoed by Deputy Governor Martin Moshisho.  “We are happy that the Maasai community has not been forgotten in issuing of government positions. We will continue supporting the government,” he said. The MP for Kajiado South, Katoo ole Metito, also hailed the head of state for the choice. Tobiko resigned from his position as Director of Public Prosecution after being nominated as CS.
