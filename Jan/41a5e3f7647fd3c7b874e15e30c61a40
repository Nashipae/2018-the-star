 Vihiga United Queens’ striker Terry Engesha is among the nominees for the World women’s XI. The team brings together best players who have excelled and are picked to form a world team Engesha was instrumental for her side en-route bagging the 2017 women’s Premier League title. The striker netted two goals as the Vihiga County’s outfit downed favourites Thika Queens 2-1 in the final last month at Camp Toyoyo grounds.  Engesha was also feted the women’s player of the year during the Magharibi Awards last month in Bungoma. Kenya Football Welfare Association (KEFWA) president James Situma said the development is a move in the right direction.  He said this would mark the second edition World women’s XI, having started in 2015 although this was the first nomination for the country. He said: “We as Kefwa, we get the ballot papers and circulate it across the clubs that feature in the league matches and the players are entitled to vote their preferred best player,” said Situma who recently parted ways with his former club Tusker FC.  Same thing is done in different countries and the final tallying done at the FIFPro to shortlist the best 11.” He added: “Engesha got the highest votes in the country and we wish her all the best ahead of the tallying.  However, she will now muscle her way to the World XI together with other players across the world. But all the same, the nomination goes along way to prove that as a nation, we have potential to churn out good players.” The announcement of women’s World  XI is set for later this month or early next month.
