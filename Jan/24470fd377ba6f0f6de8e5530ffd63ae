The National Irrigation Board has banned grazing within the Hola Irrigation Scheme and warned that herders who defy the order would be prosecuted. Acting manager Johnson Muko said that grazing must take place at least 15 kilometres away from the scheme. He spoke during a meeting with farmers. Grazing has contributed to destruction of structures and crops, Muko said. “Farmers suffered huge losses after pastoralists grazed on their farms,” he said on Thursday. The problem has led to prolonged conflicts between farmers and pastoralists, he added. Present at the meeting were representatives of the pastoralist community, police boss Peter Ekuthi and provincial administrators. Kiriakungu chief Mohamed Abdi accused the pastoralists of taking their animals to the farms in the evening and grazing until late in the night. Herders present admitted they take their animals to the scheme, but blamed it on ravaging drought. Godana Badole, an elder of the Orma community, accused the police of failing to stop pastoralists from Bura and other areas from entering their area in search of pasture. He blamed this for inter-community conflicts. “The NIB management has also failed to fill the dam it constructed in Kalkacha,” Badole said, adding availability of water would help resolve some of their problems. Elder Ali Santuri said grazing on other people’s farms is irresponsible and uncalled-for.
