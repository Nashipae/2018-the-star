Kabras have bolstered their playing unit by signing Uganda Sevens star Pius Ogena for the reminder of the season. Coach Charles Cadovillis said the capture of Ogena will be a good addition to the side as they seek to reclaim the league crown they last won in 2016. “He will bring some good competition for our current centres, who have been massive. With us playing Quins, Nondies, Impala and Homeboyz in that order, it will really test our strength both physically and mentally, something we are working on with the boys,” said Cadovillis. The sugarmillers have also signed Brian Bango from Strathmore Leos and Quins duo of Kelly Akengo and Alfred Odawa. Cadovillis said having depth in the squad will be key. “It’s a long season and with many players at your disposal is always an advantage. Having many players competing for positions helps us keep the them fresh and ready for the playoffs,” added Cadovillis. The club have also parted ways with Levy Ochieng and Francis Mutuku, who join Nondies. Elsewhere, the Kenya Rugby Union has expanded their Judicial Panel following the addition of six officers. They include Ian Amagola, Oliver Khabure, George Mbaye, Daniel Ndaba, Aggrey Chabeda and Mwendwa Chuma who join Willy Ombisi, Bernard Itebete, Edwin Obuya and Mukite Musangi in an expanded panel of 10. KRU fixtures administrator Martin Ngunjiri said: “With an expanded panel, we will have a wider reach across all levels of league competitions countrywide and will be able to resolve disputes in an expedited manner.” “We will additionally release weekly rotas indicating the Judicial Officers on duty on each match day,” he added.
