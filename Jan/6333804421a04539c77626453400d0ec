Cabinet Secretary nominee Keriako Tobiko yesterday broke his silence over clan profiling by elected Maa leaders. Tobiko said Maasai leaders should not preoccupy ourselves with clan and age set issues that do not add value to our community. “If I am appointed CS, I will focus my leadership on unifying all our people from Kajiado, Narok, Samburu to Laikipia rather than dividing them. I will also unite the Maasai and other non-Maasai communities living in those counties,” said Tobiko in an exclusive interview. The former Director of Public Prosecution said his nomination is a win for both the Orok-Kiteng and the Odomong’i clans. “The Maa people must be united because we share almost similar pressing issues such as drought, education and health,” he said. “The narrative that my nomination was a win for Orok-Kiteng is a fallacy because even the Odomong’i clansmen also won as I have explained,” said Tobiko. The cabinet secretary nominee said unity among the people of all the Maa regions in the county should be both “horizontal and vertical”.
