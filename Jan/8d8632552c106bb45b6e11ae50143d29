COTU has welcomed the appointment of a substantive Labour Cabinet Secretary in changes announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday. Secretary General Francis Atwoli applauded the president for listening to the workers' call saying it is better than the previous arrangement where the ministry was under the East Africa Community ministry. He said Uhuru's decision to have the Labour Ministry distinct is bound to have huge and positive impact. "This will not only be to the country’s Industrial Relations’ management but equally create a conducive environment where the ministry will fully discharge off only labour matters," he said in a statement. The president unveiled Ukur Yattani as the nominee to the Labour portfolio. Atwoli said the development will allow the Cabinet Secretary to concentrate on the same. The workers' union hailed Yattani's appointment saying he has vast experience as a governor and administrator. COTU also thanked the President for considering Cleopa Mailu as the head of UN Mission in Geneva. Atwoli said this will see him combine its duties with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) issues. "As workers, we are glad that with these two key appointments by the President, they will go a long way in strengthening industrial relations practice in the country," Atwoli said.
