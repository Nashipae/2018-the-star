Boda boda riders want to meet Governor Sonko to explore ways to regulate their operations following their ban from the CBD. The ban was announced on Tuesday in a notice in the dailies. The operators said they are stationed at designated PSV stopovers and it is unfair to ban them and retain matatus and buses. “Even in the CBD most of our boda bodas are found adjacent to matatu stages since most of the passengers we carry are from the matatus,” United Boda Boda Association chairman Ken Onyango said. “If we get banned from the CBD, where will our customers come from?” He spoke at the Jeevanjee Gardens on Wednesday. He said the operators will lose their livelihoods. On a good day an operator makes Sh1,500 to Sh2,000.
