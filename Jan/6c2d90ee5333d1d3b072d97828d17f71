Angry MPs have threatened to paralyse activities in Parliament when the return from recess on February 13 if the delayed Sh30.9 billion CDF cash is not released. The approval of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s nominees for Cabinet positions, which is top on their agenda, may take longer. CDF acting chief executive officer Yusuf Mbuno told the Star they are working with the Treasury to have the money released once constituency projects are approved for funding. Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto (Jubilee) told the Star yesterday they are not going to entertain Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich’s empty promises. “Treasury said the cash will be released this week. We may refuse to approve the nominees,” he said. Uhuru submitted names of Cabinet Secretaries, Principal Secretaries and ambassador nominees to National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi for vetting. Country broke? The Speaker said vetting will begin after seven days of publishing the names in the local dailies. The public will participate in the scrutiny by submitting memoranda. The Committee on Appointments will vet the nominees for MPs to approve them. Borabu MP Ben Momanyi (NASA) told the Star paralysing the House’s activities is the only weapon they have for the money to be released. “I think the country is broke. We have been on recess since December 8 and have done nothing pertaining to the CDF projects,” Momanyi said. Before the break there was a storm in the House. MPs demanded answers from Majority leader Aden Duale who assured the cash will be out by December 1. Turkana South MP James Lomenen (Jubilee) warned they cannot vet the Cabinet nominees yet their welfare is not being considered. Kibwezi East MP and PAC vice chair Jessica Mbalu asked Treasury bosses to hasten the release of CDF cash. But Nakuru Town West MP Samuel Arama (Jubilee) asked his colleagues to be patient. t,” Arama told Star.
