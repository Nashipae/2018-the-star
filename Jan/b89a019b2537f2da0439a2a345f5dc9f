Central Bank of Kenya and
British firm De La Rue secured a reprieve yesterday after a court suspended the decision
cancelling the tender for printing of the new-look currency. High court judge George Odunga
said the decision by the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board to cancel the tender to De La Rue will remain in force pending hearing and determination
of the two cases pending in court. The judge allowed CBK and the UK-based printing firm to file further documents, even after the court was
informed that a similar suit may be filed before Friday. "Leave is hereby granted to
both applicants to file substantive applications within five days, “the judge
ruled. Justice Odunga issued the temporary
orders after parties informed court they wanted the matter expedited because it
will be in the interest of justice. "What is at stake here is
the printing of new currency pursuant to the constitution" lawyer Fred
Ngatia appearing for De La Rue said. Odunga directed parties to go
back to court on Friday January 19 for further directions. CBK and the De La Rue had filed separate cases, but the judge said
the two matters will be heard together. PPARB terminated the contract on
January 8 after hearing an appeal in which Swedish firm Crane AB, through
lawyer James Gitau Singh, accused CBK of breaching the law in awarding the tender
to De La Rue. Crane which lost to De La Rue
successfully argued before the board that a decision by CBK giving it a 15 per
cent margin preference for having local shareholding was also unfair. The PPARB directed CBK to make a fresh evaluation of the tenders submitted to it
within 14 days. Giesecke & Devrient, and
Oberthur Fiduciaire of France were interested in the lucrative contract for
printing new notes, but De La Rue won the award. CBK is expected to comply with
the constitution while issuing new currency.
