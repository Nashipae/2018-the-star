Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tong’i (pictuted) yesterday urged NASA leader Raila Odinga to shelve his oath-taking plan, saying it will not help Kenyans. Tong’i said the swearing-in planned for next Tuesday will not promote development. He spoke to the press in Kisii town. The MP said the Constitution recognises President Uhuru Kenyatta because he was elected by the majority of Kenyans. “Uhuru is the head of state. Raila must respect the Constitution,” Tong’i said. He singled out a case in which Uganda’s Kizza Besigye swore in himself as a President. “Raila should know that Besigye swore himself in as Uganda’s President but that did not make any impact. That’s because Yoweri Museveni was elected by the people as their President,” Tong’i said. He said NASA’s plans will not yield anything positive, but incitement.
