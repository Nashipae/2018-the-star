Homa Bay police commander Marius Tum said they were investigating why the couple hanged themselves. “It is very sad that two people can agree to die together,” Tum said.  Tum said cases of suicide had increased, with at least one recorded every week. Three weeks ago, two men committed suicide over domestic squabbles. ”It is unfortunate that their actions have made their children to become orphans,” Tum said.
