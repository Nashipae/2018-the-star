The Council of Governors have promised to fast-track the payment of contractors despite insistence by a section of county chiefs on audit of the billions of shillings in pending bills. Counties owe contractors about Sh90 billion and some newly elected governors have insisted on an audit of the expenditure, mostly incurred by their predecessors, before any payments are made. In a statement yesterday, COG chairman Josphat Nanok blamed the Treasury for the delay in disbursement of funds from the national government. The Treasury, Nanok said, has only been disbursing allocations for salaries, operations and maintenance from July to December last year due to transition issues. He did not promise all bills will be paid, but rather “reduced”.
