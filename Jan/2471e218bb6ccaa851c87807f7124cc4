The hearing of the Sh47 million NYS graft case against former Devolution and Planning PS Peter Mangiti, former NYS Deputy Director General Adan Harakhe and former Ministerial Tender Committee chairman Hassan Noor and 21 others will resume on January 8.  The case was adjourned to enable the last witness investigating officer Mark Ndiema, who is also a forensic investigator attached to the EACC, to wind up his lengthy evidence. He has been giving an account of how the accused persons allegedly conspired to take the money through a private company. During his last evidence, the officer told Milimani Anti-Corruption chief magistrate Kennedy Bidali the Ministry of Devolution and Planning Tender Committee erred in granting authority for use of restricted tendering of training materials for the automotive engineering faculty in the NYS. “The National Youth Service did not give proper justification or explanation for the use of restricted tendering, and the Ministerial tender committee did not seek proper reasons before approving use of the said tender method,” the witness said. Ndiema testified in a graft case in which Harakhe, Noor, Mangiti and 21 others, including the owners of Blue Star Enterprise, Betty Mureithi and Jennifer Kinoti  are charged with corruption, abuse of office and failure to comply with procurement laws in the award of a tender for the supply and delivery of training materials worth Sh47.6 million. The officer, led in his evidence in chief by senior state counsel Joseph Riungu, infromed the trial court Blue Star Enterprise is a suspect firm believed to have been set up to receive the Sh 47 million kickback at its Paramount Universal Bank Ltd account held at Koinange Branch, Nairobi county.  He said the accused persons requested for authority to use restricted tendering as an alternative procurement method.
