The hearing of the Mike Okombe murder case failed to start in a Nakuru court yesterday. Judge Maureen Odero had scheduled the hearing on Monday, but she was absent on leave.  The prosecution was ready to avail witnesses to testify. But magistrate Wilson Kitur rescheduled the hearing for April 11. The deceased’s girlfriend Maryanne Mumbi, 37, and childhood friend Calvin Okoth were charged with his murder on November 14 last year and they were released on Sh300,000 bail each. They allegedly killed rugby player Mike Okombe on November 4 on Olive-in estate, Rongai subcounty. Justice Odero said the two accused persons received a psychiatric examination and were found mentlly fit to stand trial. Two other suspects Eric Mochache and Vincent Omondi, both rugby players, were presented to the court but later released by the police after investigation.  Okombe, 27, and other friends were invited to Okoth’s house for a birthday party. He is said to have argued with his girlfriend, who went to the kitchen, took a knife and stabbed him several times in the chest. He was rushed to Mediheal Hospital, where he died.
