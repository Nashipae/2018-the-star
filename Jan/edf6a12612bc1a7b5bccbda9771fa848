Issues threatening to tear apart shippers and the Kenya Railways Corporation have been resolved, Kenya Railways MD Atanas Maina has said. "We have been engaging Kenya Shippers Council agents and Shippers Council of Eastern Africa and cargo owners on various issues and we have resolved them," Maina told the Star on phone. Maina said concerns on seamless operations between SGR and the Kenya Ports Authority, Kenya Revenue Authority and the Kenya Railways Corporation were discussed. "They wanted to know how long it will take for cargo to land in the inland container terminal Standard Gauge Railway being new. We now have one stop shop with an integrated system," he said. Head of advocacy and membership development at Shippers Council of Eastern Africa Agayo Ogambi said the two day meeting wwith the ministry of Transport yielded the promotional Rail Freight Tariff. "The total promotional rail freight package tariff which will only be valid for three months and which is inclusive of all charges by other agents will therefore be $645 for 20ft Container and $843 for 40 ft container inclusive of empty container return to Kilindini but exclusive of last mile,"Ogambi said. The package runs from January 4 to April 5. Shippers Council of East Africa and KPA have since been urged to urge Importers to seize the opportunity and avail cargo to be transporte don the SGR. Ogambi said that the railway was previously unreliable and unpredictable. The players wanted an assurance from the Kenya Railways Corporation that SGR service will be reliable and predictable. On January 1,a first cargo train arrived in Nairobi. The cargo train carried 104 containers, almost an equivalent of the trucks operating on a daily basis on the Mombasa-Nairobi highway.
