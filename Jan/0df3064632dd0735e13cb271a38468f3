Eight candidates shortlisted for the Kenya Maritime Authority top job were yesterday dealt another blow after the board cancelled their interviews. The KMA, in a paid up advert in local dailies, said the interviews that were to run for three days from yesterday have been cancelled following a court order. A human rights lobby - Commission for Human Rights and Justice - on Friday went to court to stop the interviews. The shortlisted candidates include former Kenya Ferry Services managing director Musa Hassan, KMA head of commercial shipping John Omingo and Eunice Waceke. Major (Rtd) Nishit Dhanavantrai, Container Freight Station Association of Kenya executive officer Daniel Nzeki and maritime consultant Stanley Ndenge Chai were to be interviewed today.
