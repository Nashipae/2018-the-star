Former Uchumi CEO Julius Kipng’etich has been appointed in the same capacity at Jubilee Holdings. Kipng’etich, who was appointed on Wednesday, is expected to coordinate the insurance firm’s regional operations. The company noted he brings considerable knowledge and experience in strategy and management. “I am delighted to welcome Kipng’etich. He brings on board an outstanding track record of business process re-engineering, strategic management and a deep understanding of the regional market," said Jubilee Holdings chairman Nizar Juma. "He is passionate and committed to all that he does and I am very confident that through his leadership, we will continue to deliver enhanced value to all our stakeholders." Kipngetich resigned from Uchumi last year to pursue what he termed personal interests. This came two years after his appointment to head the struggling retailer. The board hired chief finance officer Mohamed Ahmed to act until the identification of a suitable successor.
