Kenya Rugby Union championship leaders, Menengai Oilers coach Gibson Weru, has sets sights on qualification to the Kenya Cup next season. The side have been unbeaten in the longer version of the game since their formation in 2016 and Weru believes with the talent at his disposal, they can make it to the top tier of Kenyan rugby. The club sit top of the championship with 20 points from four matches. “We have had a good start to the season but we must keep improving and attain our goal of qualifying for the Kenya cup next year, which is achievable,” said Weru. Weru said there are a couple of areas the team has been working on during the Christmas and New year break to sharpen their skills. We are working on our skills, speed and game awareness. We will get there and be very competitive in the next few years,” Weru added. Oilers face Western Bulls when the league resumes on January 13 and Weru expects a tough game . “Bulls are an experienced side who will want to prove a point against us so we must be well prepared for them,” he observed. The Bulls received a major boost ahead of the showdown against the Oilers after halfback Allan Kasiti recovered from a neck injury sustained against Egerton Wasps. Bulls sit third on the log with 13 points with a game in hand and have already resumed training.
