Mwingi professionals have welcomed Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka’s return and said they are strongly behind NASA’s planned swearing-in should Jubilee reject dialogue. Coordinator Campbel Munyambu on Saturday said Kalonzo is their voice and the Deputy President-elect of Kenya. He supported Kalonzo’s comments that President Uhuru Kenyatta must allow dialogue on electoral reforms or they (Kalonzo and Raila Odinga) will take the oath of office as the People’s President and Deputy President. Munyambu said Kalonzo is determined to accomplish what he said.  “I wonder why the President told NASA to wait until 2022 to dialogue with William Ruto?” he said. He said the President must know that NASA has more supporters than Jubilee. “Jubilee has a few noisemakers placed strategically in every region, but who only lie to Uhuru that he has widespread support, yet he doesn’t,” Munyambu said, adding NASA won the August 8 presidential election, but the results were manipulated in favour of Jubilee.
