Light showers in parts of the country will give temporary relief from the scorching sun, but this will be short-lived, according to the meteorological department.  In its seven-day forecast, the weathermen said the clouds and showers may last until Saturday, after which the sun will be back.  The light rains are expected in parts of Ukambani and Taita, the South Coast, South Nyanza and the South Rift Valley.  Central Highlands, including Nairobi, Embu, Nyeri and Meru, will also have some afternoon showers until Saturday.  Head of meteorological services Peter Ambenje said the rest of the country will remain hot and sunny.  “Dry conditions are expected to continue over most parts of the country for much of the forecast period,” he said in a seven-day forecast ending Monday next week. During Christmas and New Year, most of the country was warm and dry with only a few stations including Kisii, Kericho, Narok and Suba recording minimal amounts of rainfall.  Late last month, the weatherman predicted dry weather will be dominant over most parts of the country this month. “The January-February 2018 period is expected to be sunny and dry, with very high daytime temperatures,” Ambenje said in a monthly forecast.  Most global forecast patterns also suggest enhanced warming in the next five years because of the high levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  The weatherman advised that contingency measures be enhanced to avert any deaths due to lack of food and water in the hot January-February period. He said the October-November rains were good and above average in most places.  “The good (October-November) rainfall performance over most parts of the country resulted in good crop performance in most agricultural areas,” he said. However, these benefits will diminish towards end of this month, especially in Northern Kenya
