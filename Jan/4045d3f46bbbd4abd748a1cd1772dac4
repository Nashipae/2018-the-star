Wajir residents have
welcomed the move by Jambo jet to start flight from the county to Nairobi and vice versa. They said that with more flights
venturing into the business, transport will be not only faster and cheaper, but
also convenient. Businessman Abdi Mohamed described the move as a great milestone for the people and promised to support the move. Resident Amina Abdi said
that traveling by road was hectic especially to  expectant mothers and those with young
children considering the rough and pumpy road. Travelling by road takes 12 hours to and costs Sh2,000. “I personally I don’t think 5,000
is much bearing in mind the distance and road. the advantages outweighs  the disadvantages,” she said. Passengers will be paying Sh5,200 while Jet ways, Fly sax and
Ruduku, freedom and Skywhat airlines charge Sh6,000 one way. On Tuesday, JamboJet Chief
Executive Officer Willem Hondius said the first  flight from Nairobi’s JKIA will be on February 14. The airline is targeting the
growing domestic travel market to consolidate its position in Kenya’s
foremost low cost airline market. The flights will depart Nairobi
on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6:10am and depart from Wajir on Wednesdays
and Fridays.
