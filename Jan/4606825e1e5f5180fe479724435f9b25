Most parts of the country will remain dry throughout this month, the weatherman has said. However, some parts of Mt Kenya, including Nairobi, could have light rains today morning. Counties in South Nyanza and South Rift Valley could also experience slight showers and thunderstorms. Head of meteorological services Peter Ambenje said day-time has decreased over the last week with the exception of a few areas like Marsabit and Lamu.  “Night-time minimum temperatures increased over most areas except over Wajir, Kisii and Lamu. Lodwar recorded the highest temperature of 37.7°C on January 1, while Nyahururu posted the lowest daily minimum temperature of 5.6°C on the same day,” Ambenje said.

He was giving the month-long forecast. He said drought in Northeastern is expected to worsen with sandstorms to be experienced in some areas. The regions to be affected include Moyale, Marsabit, Wajir, Mandera, Garbatulla, Garissa, Lodwar, Lokichoggio and Lokitaung. Ambenje said the Coast strip will also experience high temperatures throughout the month. Water levels in the Seven-Folks dams are likely to reduce due to the forecasted sunny and dry conditions in the River catchment areas. He said the poor October-December short rains season resulted into poor crop performance over most parts of the country. There was also reduced water resource for domestic use, drinking and sanitation in various parts of the country including the counties in Northern, Northeastern and Southeastern parts of the country.
