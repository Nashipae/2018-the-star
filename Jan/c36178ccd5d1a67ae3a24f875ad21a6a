United Democratic Party leader Cyrus Jirongo has asked the Luhya community to chart their own political course for 2022 away from NASA.Jirongo asked ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang’ula to lead their troops out of the NASA bandwagon and begin preparing the community ahead of time. “They should stop giving Kenyans false hopes that Raila Odinga will be their president,” he told the Star on the phone yesterday. Jirongo said the planned swearing-in of Raila and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka as the people’s “President “and “DP” is an exit strategy by the opposition after its miscalculations denied them power in the August poll. “We must stop wasting time in NASA and sit down and decide the political direction for the community. What we need as Luhyasis to look for friends who can help us take over power to provide proper leadership for the country,” Jirongo said. He said Luhya leaders should prepare for the presidential race and “stop shouting about how they want to be President at funerals.” “NASA’s strategy was wrong from the word go. I was supposed to be part of it, but decided to stand aside upon realising the group lacked a clear direction,” Jirongo said.
