At least 20 people have been arrested in an ongoing crackdown on shisha-smoking in Mombasa. Mombasa police boss Christopher Rotich said the arrests were made on Tuesday by a team of officers and county inspectorate askaris in an operation in Nyali. The officers stormed Wild Waters, Mamba Village, Nyali City Mall, among other popular joints and arrested shisha smokers. The suspects will be charged will illegal smoking of shisha. The government banned the sale and smoking of shisha on December 28, last year. Outgoing Health CS Cleopa Mailu cited health risks in his notice that also banned importation, manufacture and advertising of shisha. Those found contravening the ban are liable to a fine not exceeding Sh50,000 or a jail term of six months or both. “We have intensified the crackdown. Those found contravening
the law will be arrested and prosecuted,” Rotich said. On Saturday,  Tourism CS Najib Balala criticised the
government for the ban saying it was frustrating efforts to promote the sector. Balala said the ban was rushed. he accused police
now taking advantage of the ban to harass investors by closing down night
clubs. Outgoing Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa said
shisha dens must be closed. He directed police to shut down all clubs where shisha is sold. Shisha is popular at many entertainment establishments in most towns. It is smoked using pipes, which researchers say have three additional health risks over cigarette.
