A man died on Monday in Embu after his car plunged
into river Rupingazi. The driver of the white salon car lost control and veered off the Rupingazi bridge and plunged about 20 meters into the river and drowned. One side of the bridge does not have guard rails because they were knocked off in previous accidents.    Eye witnesses said the driver, whose identity could not be immediately established, was speeding towards Embu Town at the time of the accident.  This becomes the second documented accident to claim lives in 2018 after two people were killed by a trailer near the notorious Salgaa black spot Monday morning.  Read: Two perish in another accident near Salgaa Witnesses said passersby tried to rescue the driver but failed to reach him on time due to the steep banks of the river. The body was later retrieved by the police and moved to the mortuary. The accident caused heavy traffic jam on the road for several hours as the police retrieved the body and the mangled
wreckage. Kirimari Ward representative Morris Muchiri who is
in charge of most of Embu Town lamented that many people have perished on the
bridge after vehicles plunged inside owing to lack of the guard rail. He said the bridge has remained without guard rails
for years without being repaired by the Kenya National Highway authority
(Kenha) despite the deaths. Read: Survivors recount Migaa bus tragedy that claimed 38 lives Nyagah asked kenha not to waste any more time but

head-on with another car while an hour before the fatal plunge, a car that was heading to Embu Town lost control and veered off the road
and landed in a ditch a fe meters from the bridge. No one was hurt in the second accident while occupants in the first accident sustained slight injuries. Click here for the latest political news
