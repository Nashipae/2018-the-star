Judge Lydia Achode has declined to
recuse herself from hearing former Senator Hassan Omar's petition against Governor Hassan Joho. The judge dismissed the application by
Omar calling for her disqualification from determining the matter
which is almost being concluded. Achode, in her ruling on Friday, said the application was unnecessary adding that Omar should have gone to
the appeals court. She said this was if the former legislator was dissatisfied with the court decisions on
several issues he had complained of in his application. "The petitioner has never appealed
any ruling by the court to express his dissatisfaction," she said. Achode said on several occasions, Omar's
advocate Yusuf Abubakar had shown mutual agreement with court
decisions. She said it was unfair for the petitioner to term
her decisions as biased yet she had always portrayed a fair ruling. The judge held that the application was full of
personal emotions of the petitioner and his claims lacked "legs to stand". "It was not enough for the
former senator to make mere allegations. He should have given
reasonable grounds that there is bias." Omar accused Justice Achode of open bias and
ignorance saying the judge displayed double standards when treating
applications made by parties. Read: Hassan Omar wants 'biased' judge in Joho petition to step down Click here for the latest political news
