Maize farmers in Uasin Gishu have opted to sell their produce to middlemen following NCPB's delays to clear its Sh3 billion debt. The lot said they are forced to sell the produce at cheaper prices to raise school fees for their children. Timon Kosgey, a farmer, said they have been waiting for the National Cereals and Produce Board to process the payments since December 5. "Many of us cannot raise school fees," Kosgey said as farmers piled pressure for the government to release their money. The NCPB said it has bought 1.8 million bags of maize worth Sh 5.7 billion. Titus Maiyo, a spokesman for the board, said farmers have been paid Sh2.6 billion. "We are waiting for cash from the National Treasury to settle the arrears," he said on Tuesday. Moiben MP Sila Tiren demanded that farmers be paid the cash so that they can use part of the money to pay fees. Hundreds of farmers are still queuing at the NCPB depot in Eldoret to deliver more maize. "We promised farmers that they will be paid promptly for maize deliveries. We should not let them down, especially when they need money for fees and other issues." The legislator said the National Treasury should give the board all the Sh6 billion that was set aside for maize purchase. Kipkorir Menjo, a representative of the farmers, said the middlemen were offering about Sh 2,200 per 90kg bag yet the NCPB pays Sh3,200. Menjo said farmers are getting impatient because there is no clear communication from the board concerning the payments. "We need the money so we can start planning early for the new planting season this year," Menjo said. NCPB CEO Newton Terer is expected to meet Agriculture CS Willy Bett and Treasury officials with a view to ending the payment debacle. Read: Maize dryer explodes at NCPB's Eldoret depot Click
