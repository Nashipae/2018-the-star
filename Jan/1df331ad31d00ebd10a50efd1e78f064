Kenyan Premier League champions Gor Mahia are optimistic that their choice of Kenyatta Stadium as their home ground will be of great financial significance in the absence of their main sponsor. Gor Mahia were allowed back at the stadium after the Machakos County governor, Alfred Mutua, lifted a ban slapped on the club following a crowd trouble incident last season. With Nyayo Stadium and Moi Stadium, Kasarani, unavailable due to ongoing renovations, Gor Mahia treasurer Sally Bolo said Kenyatta is convenient for the Green Army and crucial in raising sufficient gate collections. Bolo was thankful to both club chairman, Ambrose Rachier and Machakos County governor, Alfred Mutua for reaching an agreement to allow the club use the venue earlier this week. The treasurer also stated on the club’s official portal that it would have been ideal playing at the Moi Stadium, Kisumu but the facility has not met minimum threshold of Caf requirements. Gor Mahia are set to represent the country at the 2018 Caf Champions League. “Machakos Stadium is appropriate because we will save on expenses at this time when things are tough for us financially. It will cost the club Sh1m to play in Kisumu, air tickets, accommodation and other expenses,” stated Sally. If the Champions League match is to be played in Bukhungu, Gor Mahia will have to take care of all expenses of their opponents from Nairobi.
