The government has denied claims that it irregularly awarded tenders for the construction of two dams in Wajir and Machakos counties. Reacting to a story published by the Star on Monday, Water PS Fred Segor said the reports were misleading. Last week, the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board annulled the termination of the tenders for the construction of water pans and small dams. In a statement to the newsrooms, Segor said the tendering and procurement for the construction of water pans and small dams is a mandate of the Irrigation department and not that of Water Services. PPARB chairman Paul Gicheru said the ministry had disregarded its advice on the tenders and failed to follow due process. The board has stated that procuring entity must obey all the lawful order issued by the board or a court of law. The board chaired by lawyer Paul Gicheru accused the ministry for disregarding its decisions and awarding tenders without regard to due process. Segor is the principal secretary in the state department of water but his name was not in the President's lineup last week and the position will be announced later.
