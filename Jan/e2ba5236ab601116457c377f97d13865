Siaya inmates got a reason to smile on New Year’s Day. More than 300 prisoners at the Siaya GK Prison were on Monday given a rare treat by Siaya Central SDA Church. Rev Shadrack Ayiko gave the inmates goodies as they marked the new year, despite being in jail. Ayiko said the move is a way of reaching out to the less privileged in society. The Reverend added that the move is aimed at improving the prisoners’ spiritual, mental and physical ability to transform into responsible citizens. “We have given them basic personal items as well as bread and juice,” Ayiko said. Ayiko urged residents to reintegrate with released offenders once they are back in the community after serving their jail term. He reminded residents that prisons are correctional facilities and offenders change their ways. “The community should know if offenders are isolated after release, chances of them going back to their previous behavious is high. They need to embrace them.” Ayiko’s move to remember inmates during the New Year celebrations was praised by superintendent Patrick Lukenya. He asked the SDA Church to keep up the good spirit of ensuring inmates do not feel isolated. Lukenya said the prison will continue to allow churches and other organisations to visit inmates.
