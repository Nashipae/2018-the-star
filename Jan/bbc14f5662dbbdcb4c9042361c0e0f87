A Court in Mombasa on Monday dealt a major blow to 900 squatters in Lamukani, Bamburi after it ruled against them. The squatters defiantly staged protests outside the court just moments after Judge Charles Yano made the ruling. The squatters, who were laying claim to a 135-acre piece of land which has since been subdivided and parcels sold to other developers, vowed to re-occupy the land. Lamukani and Kitaruni Community Based Organization chairman Alfred Chengo, who spoke on behalf of the squatters, said the ruling was not fair. “We shall not respect the ruling which was made after the hearing was done in our absence,” he said. Chengo said the squatters arrived late for the ruling because they were not even aware the ruling would be made today. “We were just informed by one of the people working in the court who knew about our cases and was wondering why we were not there for the ruling,” Chengo said. The squatters had been living in rented houses since 2010 when they were evicted from the land they claim has been their ancestral land. The squatters say the dispute over the land began when one of the five defendants in the suit, was allocated four acres by the elders in the land. The squatters say the defendant, however, started partitioning and selling more than the four acres she was allocated. According to the court papers, the 135-acre land was divided into 120 parcels. The new owners are the ones who have been harassing the squatters, according to the 900 people. Residents Land Protection Organisation of Kenya chairman of Dewelly Nyambu said the matter is still not over as they will pursue the matter further. “We are going to seek a review of the ruling,” Nyambu said. He asked local political leaders to stand with their people in this hour of need.  Click here for the latest political news
