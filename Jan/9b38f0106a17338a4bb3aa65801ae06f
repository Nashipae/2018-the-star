Preparations for this year’s World Cup in Russia could be thrown into fresh turmoil after Fifa promised to speak to doping whistle-blower Grigory Rodchenkov ‘relatively soon’. Star witness Dr Rodchenkov can provide extensive details of systematic doping across Russian football. Fifa are facing calls from Dr Rodchenkov’s lawyer to set up an independent investigation into doping in Russian football to avoid potential conflicts of interests. The extent of the evidence Dr Rodchenkov can provide, which could identify several new cases, is likely to spark fresh calls for Russia to be expelled from its own World Cup or could see what is already a weak host squad lose players to doping bans.  The World Anti-Doping Agency investigation, led by Professor Richard McLaren, have identified 34 samples from Russian players deemed to be suspect and have established that the 2014 World Cup squad were part of a nationwide system protecting Russian sportsmen and women from giving positive tests. Parties who have probed the Russia doping scandal believe there was a specialist football doping hub away from Moscow.  They have also established that Russian officials set up a clean urine bank, where sportsmen and women— including footballers—provided clean urine which coulD be swapped with drugged urine samples to avoid giving positive tests.  Dr Rodchenkov, former head of the Moscow Anti-Doping Laboratory, helped to run Russia’s doping programme.  The Russian has since fled to the USA, where he is in witness protection.  He is said to have extensive knowledge of ‘disappearing positive methodology,’ whereby Russian government agents from the FSB opened sample bottles and replaced dirty urine with clean. Fifa have previously claimed they had made attempts to speak to Dr Rodchenkov, whose evidence has been verified by two investigations and several anti-doping cases across multiple sports.
