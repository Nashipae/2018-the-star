Controversial veteran politician Jackson Kibor has been sucked into a fresh land row with his family. This was after he deflated the wheels of his daughter-in-law's tractor while tilling the farm at the centre of the dispute. He used sharp spikes mounted one of his land cruisers which he says are for protecting himself after his pistol was taken away by the police. "My sons are still misbehaving by interfering with my property and I will not allow that to happen," Kibor said. He said the land in question belongs to him and not his sons. "They want to rob me of the land but I will not accept that," the farmer said following the Friday incident. The daughter-in-law, identified as Jane Kibor, reported the incident to police at Ziwa where the matter is being investigated. Kibor was arrested last year after he used his licensed pistol to shoot at one of his sons during a row over the same land. He was disarmed and charged in court. The 86-year-old politician has a pending case in court with his son over the land. Last November, he won a divorce case against his 2nd wife Josephine whom he accused of cruelty and interfering with his land at Kipkabus.

"I am the one who will decide if to give them part of it or not. They cannot take for themselves," Kibor, who has three wives, said.
