Former World cross country champion Agnes Tirop led a Kenyan 1-2-3 sweep during the fifth leg of IAAF Cross Country Permit series on Sunday in Seville Spain. Tirop clocked 25:51 to win the 36th Cross Internacional de Itálica in Santiponce ahead of former world youth 3000m champion Lillian Rengeruk, who placed second in 26:01 with World 5,000m champion Helen Obiri finishing third in 26:03 The start of the women’s 8.265km race was led by the Portuguese pair of 2008 European cross-country bronze medallist Ines Monteiro and European Half Marathon champion Sara Moreira. With seven minutes on the clock, Bahrain’s Ruth Jebet took command of the race and barely two minutes later, only the Kenyan trio of Agnes Tirop, Hellen Obiri and Lilian Rengeruk were close to her. Spain’s Trihas Gebre was a lonesome fifth after losing contact with the African contingent—always headed by world steeplechase record-holder Jebet. Five-and-a-half kilometres into the race, Tirop injected a quicker rhythm which was followed only by world 5,000m champion Obiri while—much to the surprise of the spectators—Jebet gradually lost ground and was left with no chances of winning before the closing two-kilometre lap. Fully aware of Obiri’s track credentials—which include a 3:57.05 1,500m PB and the 2012 world indoor 3000m title— Tirop pushed hard on the closing lap. With a kilometre and a half left, Tirop had already managed to get rid of Obiri, while third place seemed to be a battle between Rengeruk and Jebet. While Tirop’s success became beyond doubt, Rengeruk first left Jebet behind to seriously threaten Obiri’s runner-up spot. At the tape, Tirop was a solid winner while Rengeruk pipped a tired Obiri 20 metres before the tape, completing a Kenyan 1-2-3 finish. “Today’s win makes me very satisfied after my second places in San Giorgio Su Legnano and Elgoibar earlier this month,” said an elated Tirop. “After this European cross-country tour, I’ll now head back home to prepare the Commonwealth Games where I plan to contest the 5000m.” In the men’s category, Uganda’s Joshua Cheptegei carried the day by posting 30:54 with compatriot with compatriot second in 30:55 with Ethiopia’s World youth champion Solomon Barega third in 31:01.
