  The county government will receive Sh650 million from World Bank for the construction of Mwariro and Karandini markets in order to relocate hawkers currently operating within the CBD. According to Governor Mike Sonko, the constructions are set to start immediately. Mwariro market is based in Kariokor, Ziwani Ward while Karandini also known as Dagoreti Shopping Centre is located in Dagoretti. Attempts to move them from the CBD have been futile, with some operating in streets down town. In November 2017, Sonko had said there have been plans to relocate most of the hawkers from the city centre to Mwariro market. However, Ziwani Ward residents have strongly opposed the move, citing that Mwariro market was occupied by Ziwani Ward locals before it was closed down back in 2008. Some said that the market was meant for the business traders who are only residents at Ziwani and bringing the hawkers to occupy the market is not a good move. The market which lies on a four-acre land has since been turned into a car wash and shelter for street children.
