 Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago led 10 MPs from the North Rift region and residents of Eldoret in ushering in 2018 during a concert at the Eldoret Sports Club. Mandago and the MPs called for unity and peace in the New Year. Kenyans should turn over a new leaf after a difficult 2017 electioneering period. Mandago said the New Year sould be a period for youth in his county to benefit.   Kapsaret MP Oscar Sudi led residents at the Pamoja Concert in prayers against accidents at Salgaa on the Eldoret-Nakuru Highway.  “God is the creator of everything we pray that we will not hear of any more accidents at Salgaa or anywhere on our roads. We plead that you intervene and that what has happened should not happen again”, Sudi said. The New Year should give fresh hope to Kenyans who have gone through a difficult 2017. “We have lost more than 300 people in December and we should do is to pray that God listens to us,” Sudi said. Those in attendance included MPs Sila Tiren of Moiben, Alfred Keter of Nandi Hills, Caleb Kostany of Soy and Deputy Governor for Uasin Gishu Daniel Chemno.   Click here for the latest political news
