Chief Justice David Maraga has asked Kwale MPs to provide more money so more courts can be built in the county. The amount the judiciary is getting is insufficient for salaries, construction and other expenses in all sub-counties, Maraga noted on Monday. This was his answer to requests by Matuga MP Kassim Tandaza and Kinango's Benjamin Tayari for a land and environment court in Kwale, and a magistrate's court in Kinango. The CJ said: "We want a magistrate's court in each sub-county in Kwale but if you don't give us money, all these projects will stall." Maraga spoke at the commissioning of the construction of Kwale's first High Court at Sh390 million. He said the structure will be modern and will have eight courts, nine offices for judges and a place for mothers to breastfeed their babies. The CJ noted that the judiciary has established 39 High Courts across the country so far. "We want to make sure each county has at least one High Court station and a land and environment court," he said. Maraga asked governor Salim Mvurya to set aside land in every sub-county for the construction of magistrates' courts. "If you get land with title deeds, inform us so we can check it with the court users committee. If the properties meet standards, we will set up courts in each sub-county."
