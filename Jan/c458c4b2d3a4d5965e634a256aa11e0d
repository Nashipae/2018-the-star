At least 20 people have been arrested in Mombasa amid the enforcement of the shisha ban. Police and county askaris apprehended them on Tuesday at social joins within Nyali area. Area police boss Christopher Rotich said the officers conducted operations at locations including Wild Waters, showground, Mamba Village and City Mall.Â The group will be charged with illegal shisha-smoking. But Tourism minister Najib Balala has criticised government agencies for frustrating investors with the ban. He said the decision, which was implemented on December 28 last year, was rash and could be detrimental to a section of the tourism industry. Outgoing Health CS Cleopa Mailu banned the importation, manufacture, sale, and use of Shisha citing health grounds. The ministry directed that anyone found contravening the new rules will be liable to a fine not exceeding Sh50,000 or six months imprisonment.
