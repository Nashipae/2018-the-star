A former programme officer at the NGOs Coordination Board yesterday accused chief executive Fazul Mahamed of scheming to have her unlawfully dismissed. Shebby Sakwa was charged with creating a disturbance and causing a breach of the peace at the board’s office on Monday. She was accused of shouting and insulting two employees who asked her to leave the office. The charge sheet against her stated that on January 9, at the board’s offices at Cooperative Bank House, she insulted and shouted “mbwa, sitoki kwa ofisi,” (dog, I’m not leaving the office) - words which were calculated to annoy Kennedy Okoth. She was also accused of calling Nicholas Otieno a “useless man”. She denied the charges and was released on a cash bail of Sh20,000 awaiting trial. Her lawyer, Lempa Soyinka, told magistrate Martha Mutoko that he will be calling Fazul as a witness in the trial. “Your honor, my client was arrested at the behest of Fazul who has ignored court orders requiring the NGO Board to allow my client to resume her duties,” Soyinka said. He asked the court to order Fazul to file a statement regarding the arrest. He said he will rely on the statement during the trial. Mutoko declined to issue any directives but told the lawyer to raise the issue during the trial. The trial begins on February 5. In 2016, Shebby filed a case at the Labour Court challenging the academic qualification of Fazul. She was later dismissed but she filed another case to bar the board from sacking her. She said her dismissal was malicious and accused the board of victimising her for questioning the academic qualifications of her boss. The Labour Court issued orders barring the board from dismissing Sakwa, pending the hearing of the case. The case will be heard on February 8.
