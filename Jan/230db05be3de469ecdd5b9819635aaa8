Nairobi Jubilee and NASA MCAs, women and youth
leaders have defended Senator Johnson Sakaja after he was
attacked by two Mt Kenya MPs for bailing out Babu Owino. Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria and his Kikuyu
counterpart Kimani Ichung’wa on Tuesday accused the Nairobi Senator calling him an opposition sympathiser. But on Wednesday, the city MCAs put aside their political difference saying Sakaja is the only politician who has been advocating
for youths and women agenda in Parliament. "This is Nairobi and not Gatundu. Sakaja is our
leader and a unifying factor. We demand respect for elected leaders," NASA
youth leader Jonah Onyango said. He said they have formed a movement- One Nairobi- to
detrabilise the city and bring all the leaders together to work for the
residents. Nominated MCA June Ndegwa warned the MPs asking them to stop
meddling with Nairobi county affairs. "Nairobi is a metropolitan county which has no room for tribalism. That is why we have a governor, woman representative, and Senator from different tribes," Ndegwa said. On Sunday, Sakaja secured the Embakasi East MP's release following his detention at Parklands police station for allegedly assaulting a parking
attendant in Westlands. Babu and his bodyguard were on Monday charged with assault before they were released on Sh20,000 bond. Read: Babu Owino released after two nights in police cells Ndegwa said Sakaja was within his rights to secure
Owino’s release adding that the police should treat all Kenyan equal regardless
of party or tribe. South MCA Osman Khalif faulted Kuria and Ichung’wa saying they showed disrespect to the senator. "As leaders, we need to respect those who were elected by the people. We don’t want tribalism in Nairobi. That is why we in NASA respect our governor and senator."
