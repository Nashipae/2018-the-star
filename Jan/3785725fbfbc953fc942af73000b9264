Most businesses remained closed in Marsabit town yesterday as an uneasy calm returned following clashes that left three people killed and 17 others with serious injuries. Marsabit leaders and religious groups have condemned the clashes that pitted protesters against police. The demonstrations took place on Saturday, following the arrest of Sheikh Guyo Gorsa, a teacher at Taqwa Madrasa. The influential cleric was picked by anti-terror police officers at about 10am. He was arrested over links to al Shabaab and radicalisation of youth. The arrest sparked off a violent demonstration in which youths, armed with stones, clashed with police. The youths destroyed the local Catholic church, the county assembly and premises of the Kenya Commercial Bank. Several businesses were also looted. Council of Imams and Preachers chairman Mohamed Galgallo condemned the looting. He said those behind the destruction of the church and looting were criminals. Galgallo said Islam does not approve of such conduct. Galgallo called on the government to protect religious leaders. He said three Muslim clerics from Marsabit had disappeared after being arrested by anti-terror police officers. He condemned police for using live bullets on protesters. Marsabit Governor Mohamud Ali and Saku MP Dido Raso condemned the violence. Mohamud warned youths against attacking places of worship. He told protesters to demonstrate peacefully. He said the attack on the church should not cause disharmony between Christians and Muslims in Marsabit. “The violence was instigated by a few criminals who have nothing to do with Islam,” Mohamud said. Raso said the destruction of business premises was uncalled for. He asked police to release Gorsa.  Similar calls were made by elders who said the destruction of property and looting of shops do not conform to Islamic teaching.
