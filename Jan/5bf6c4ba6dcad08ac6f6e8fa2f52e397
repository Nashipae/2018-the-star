Farmers in Rift Valley are piling pressure for the government to release Sh2 billion owed by the National Cereals And Produce Board. They say they were last paid on December 5 and promised more cash but that they are yet to receive it. Hundreds of them are still queuing at the NCPB depot in Eldoret to deliver more maize. The board has bought 1.3 million bags so far. MPs from the region, led Moiben's Sila Tiren, have demanded that the farmers be paid before January 10 so they can clear their children's school fees. “We promised farmers that they would be paid promptly for maize deliveries. We should not let them down especially since the need money for school fees and other needs," Tiren noted on Tuesday. He added Treasury should give the board all the Sh6 billion set aside for buying maize. The board has paid out Sh 1.6 billion since it started purchasing maize in November at Sh3,200 per 90 kg bag. Two weeks ago, Agriculture minister Willy Bett visited the Eldoret depot and said the government had enough money to buy maize from all farmers, as directed by President Uhuru Kenyatta. “We want farmers to deliver all their maize to the board. We will ensure they are paid as quickly as possible," he said at the time. Bett has discouraged farmers from selling their produce to middlemen. But Kenya Farmers Association director Kipkoror Meno said on Tuesday that farmers were getting impatient because of unclear communication about their payment concerns. “Some may be forced to sell their maize to middlemen at lower prices because they need the money as schools reopen. They also need to start planning early for the planting season." Board CEO Newton Terer was to meet Bett and Treasury officials over the payment to keep farmers from demonstrating.
