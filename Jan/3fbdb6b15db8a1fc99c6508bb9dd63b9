Private garbage collector have been blamed for the deaths caused by cholera and Chikungunya outbreaks in Mombasa. In a statement yesterday, Environment executive Godfrey Nyongesa said the waste collectors were responsible for the garbage that has piled up all over the town. "Instead of taking waste to designated dumpsites, they dump them at illegal points," Nyongesa said. He said the illegal dumping site had become breeding grounds for insects that cause the cholera and Chikungunya outbreaks. Mombasa is stinking with garbage. Residents said it had become the dirtiest county. They have blamed Governor Hassan Joho for failure to deal with the waste menace. The county has also blamed the national government, saying trucks transporting waste to the dumpsites are often impounded by police. Nyongesa said they will involve all players to "actively solve the problem". He said they will immediately enforce the Waste Management Act that was passed by the county assembly six months ago. "No unlicensed person shall be allowed to transport waste," the act says. "I therefore direct that all persons and entities involved in waste collection and transportation be registered with the department of environment within seven days beginning today (Thursday)," Nyongesa said. Nyongesa said residents and property owners must have waste bins at their premises and estates. The bins must have handles and lids, he said. "Waste generators should display the bins within 20 days, failing which the county will take action, including withdrawal of licences," Nyongesa said. A fine of at least Sh50,000 or six months imprisonment shall be imposed on offenders. Mombasa have three dumping sites in Kibarani, Mwakirunge and Shonda. There are plans to shutdown the Kibarani dumpsite.
