A Kerio Valley Development Authority board member yesterday dismissed North Rift governors’ calls to disband the authority. The governors, under the North Rift Development Bloc, on Sunday said the KVDA has never initiated successful projects. Led by Turkana’s Josphat Nanok, they said KVDA has failed to transform the North Rift and suggested that its functions be transferred to the counties. But KVDA director Nixon Boisio told the governors — including John Lonyangapuo (West Pokot), Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu), Alex Tolgos (Elgeyo Marakwet) and Stanely Kiptis (Baringo) — to support the authority’s projects, instead of calling for its dissolution. He accused the county chiefs of seeking control of KVDA’s multibillion-shilling projects. Boisio cited the Wei Wei Irrigation project in West Pokot and the Sh80 billion dams in Elgeyo Marakwet as some of their major projects.
