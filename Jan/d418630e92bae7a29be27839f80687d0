Mobile money
transfer charges across networks in Kenya are expected to drop
significantly in before end of this year once mobile money
interoperability takes effect after six month pilot launched
yesterdays  Speaking during the
launch at Teleposta Towers in Nairobi, ICT cabinet secretary Joe
Mucheru said that the initiative will inject efficiency, increase
competition and hopefully bring down the cost of transactions.  ''Mobile money users
will be able to send and receive money across networks once the pilot
window is over. The first phase of the pilot between Airtel Money
and Safaricom's Mpesa will start on Monday next week before Telkom
Kenya’s mobile money system comes on board mid-February,'' said
Mucheru  Mucheru who was
flanked by Treasury cabinet secretary Henery Rotich said that sector
regulators are working together to harmonise pricing and fair
competition  This is a huge sigh
of relief to mobile phone users in Kenya who have been paying up to
four times more to transfer money from M-pesa to other networks and
endure time consuming procedures to withdraw  For instance, it
costs Sh44 to transfer Sh101-500 from M-Pesa to other networks while
it costs only Sh11 to transfer same amount within the network. Airtel
Money scrapped off transfer fee across networks in October 2012
hoping to tame Safaricom's dominance  Currently, Airtel
and Orange Money users receiving money transfers have to go through
an M-Pesa agent in order to withdrew.  To withdraw money
transferred via M-Pesa to an Airtel Money user involves at least four
steps that includes presentation of M-Pesa voucher number and the
one time code displayed on customer's SMS notification to the agent.
The agent then uses the code to withdraw the cash on behalf of the
customer  Beyond that,
interoperability in Kenya will allow consumers the ability to access
different services in case on network experience technical hitches.  Interoperability in
the sector is expected to increase efficiency and steer fair
competition in the sector currently dominated by Safaricom which
commands 74.17 per cent of total market share, this according to
latest data from Communications Authority (CA)  It is also expected
to nurse long time rivalry and court battles between Airtel and
Safaricom, with the former accusing the later of unfair dominance.  In 2014 for
instance, Airtel filed a petition with the competition watchdog
accusing Safaricom of setting the cost of M-Pesa mobile cash
transfers to Airtel Money customers at double the price charged on
Safaricom-to-Safaricom customers.  The India based
telco complained that since Safaricom’s mobile money agents account
for almost 88 per cent of the entire telecoms industry, most
transactions take place on its network denying Kenyans choice by
charging those outside its network double the costs. It proposed
Interoperability to curb unfair unfair competition  Kenya pioneered
mobile transfer in the world when Safaricom launched M-Pesa in March
2007. The sector has since grown with the data from CA indicating
that payments hit Sh2.71 trillionin September last year, signaling
10.16 per cent rise over Sh2.46 trillion moved same period in 2016.  If successfully
launched, Kenya will become the second country in the continent to
introduce mobile money Interoperability after Tanzania which launched
wallet-to-wallet interoperability
in September 2016
