The Kenya National Union of Teachers Garissa branch has criticised head teachers sending students back home for failing to pay for food. Secretary general Abdirizak Ismail said most parents cannot afford to pay. In the run-up to the August 8 General Election last year, Jubilee pledged to roll out free day secondary school education this month. However, parents are supposed to pay for lunch and transport. pastoralists Ismael said the majority of parents, who are pastoralists, are unable to pay the amount because of drought. “Our people depend of livestock as their economic lifeline. But as things stand now, the price of these animals has gone down drastically. This has had a direct impact on their economical well being,” he said. A spot check at the Garissa livestock market confirmed this. A full-grown camel that normally goes for Sh130,000 is now being sold for a paltry Sh20,000. The price of a cow has dropped from Sh70,000 to Sh15,000. “Most parents can barely meet their basic necessitates, leave alone paying school fees for their children. This is a double disaster,” Ismael said. food He added, “I am appealing to the government to move a step farther and provide food to schools across the county and the region at large. By doing so, they will have reduced the burden to the parents.” A principal at a boarding secondary school who requested anonymity said school heads are caught between a rock and a hard place. “As much as we empathise with the parents, how  are we supposed to run these institutions when the form ones who have reported have paid Sh380,000 out of Sh1.5  million? It becomes impossible,” he said. The county education director has called a meeting with all head teachers to find a solution. Early this month, the government released Sh29.5 billion for the first term of free secondary education.
