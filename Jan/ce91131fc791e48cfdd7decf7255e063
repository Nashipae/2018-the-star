Bishop Emanuel Barbara
of Malindi Catholic Diocese is dead. The news of his demise reached the church after he failed to attend Friday morning prayers at the St Anthony of
Padova Cathedral. There was a sombre mood as senior church officials
gathered at his home to condole with members of his family. Barbara has served in the
diocese for six years. Both the church and
national flags flew on half mast in honor of the late bishop. Mombasa Archbishop
Martin Kivuva eulogised
Bishop Barbara as a person who was dedicated and committed to his work. "My sincere condolences
for the loss of our brother Bishop and friend Emmanuel," he said. "I spoke with the bishop last on December 31 before the end of the year. I
wished him happy new year. The news of his death was a shock to me." He said the Bishop had
earlier travelled oversees to seek medication. The church is yet to disclose what he was suffering from. The Archbishop said the
date and place of the burial of the bishop will be announced after decision by
the church.
