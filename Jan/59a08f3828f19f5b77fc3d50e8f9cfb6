Ryan Randiek and Derrick Ominde will spearhead the country’s hopes in the East Africa 18 and under junior tournament slated for Saturday at the Nairobi Club. The two are fresh from playing in the East Africa Junior Championships, where a number of Kenyan booked slots in the Africa Junior Championships set for March in Tunisia. Randiek hopes to carry his form from the qualifiers to the regional Under-18 tournament and will use the event as a build-up for the Africa Championships. “We have a month and half before the Africa event and we hope the next three U-18 tournaments will keep us fresh and ready for the event,” he said. Randiek said winning the East Africa event has given him a big boost ahead of the Under-18 show this weekend. “I’m playing well and I am highly motivated to do well in this weekend’s tournament. I am hoping to win the event,” he quipped. Ominde shared similar sentiments, saying the current crop of junior players, are making progress and are set to make an improvement in the rankings. “The tournament last weekend gives me an opportunity to improve my ranking. We are meeting some of the best players from th continent and it will be competitive,” he added. Some of the top players expected for the Under-18 event include top seed Thabo Ncube from Zimbabwe, Abdoul Shakur Kabura (Burundi), Aman Patel (India), Luka Petrovic (Great Britain) and Jeremy deBodt (Belgium) among others.
