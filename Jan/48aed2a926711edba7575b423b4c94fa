The ruling on an application by a respondent in the petition against Saboti MP Caleb Amisi has been pushed to Thursday next week. Justice Cecilia Gitua of the High Court in Kitale said the case was expected to continue yesterday after the Christmas break. In December last year, the court received an application by the IEBC to dismiss the petition against Amisi (ODM). Jonas Kuko(Jubilee) is challenging the election of Amisi. The IEBC, through lawyer Collins Atenga, wants the court to dismiss the case because the results on the petition were not dated and that it doesnâ€™t bear the specific constituency name. The Saboti lawmaker asked the court to dismiss the case, saying Kuko is a perennial petitioner whose hobby after every election is to complain. Amisi said after losing in 2013 to former MP David Wafula, Kuko petitioned and lost and that has been his trend.
