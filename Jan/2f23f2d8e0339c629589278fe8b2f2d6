Anglican Church archbishop Jackson ole Sapit has demanded electoral reforms but asked NASA to obey the presidency. He said reforms will lead to justice and truth, and a stable nation. NASA says it dos not recognise President Uhuru Kenyatta. Sapit’s call reflects NASA demands in the run-up to October 26 ballot that were not met. Lack of electoral reforms forced the alliance to abandon the election ordered by the Supreme Court after it annulled the August 8. “The government must be established with fairness,” Sapit said in Mombasa on Sunday. In September, Sapit called for the exclusion of IEBC staff who bungled the August vote. “The IEBC must do everything within its power to cleanse itself,” he said.
