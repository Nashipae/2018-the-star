Road accidents should be declared a national disaster so more resources can be committed to ending the loss of life, Nyandarua residents have said. Last Tuesday nine people were killed when their matatu veered off the Nyeri-Nyahururu road and rolled. This was just one in a string of road accidents that has claimed more than 250 lives since last month. The nine were buried yesterday in Kiboya village, Ndaragwa constituency, Nyandarua county. The accident happened as they were travelling home from a funeral in Nyeri. Residents Macharia Mukua and Peter Mugo outlined 15 measures that should be implemented to end road accidents. They said they will lobby the National Assembly to push for road carnage being declared a national disaster. They proposed increased patrols on the highways and major roads. The patrol vehicles should be equipped with first aid and life-saving equipment. Traffic commanders should make at least one impromptu patrol and make daily documented status reports and updates, the two said.
