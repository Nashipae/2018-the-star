Lamu Senator Anwar Loitiptip has urged the government to use modern technology to eliminate al Shabaab militants. He said the government must invest heavily in technology such as drones to deal with terrorists, especially in Mpeketoni and Boni Forest. Loitiptip spoke on Tuesday at the burial of Jackline Njeri, 40, in Thunguri, Othaya, Nyeri. He was accompanied by Lamu West MP Stanley Muthama. Njeri was shot dead by al Shabaab militants 11 days ago. The mother of one encountered more than 50 militants, who had ambushed police officers escorting passenger buses in Nyongoro, Lamu county. Njeri, a laboratory technician, was heading to the Garsen police station when she was killed. Iria-ini MCA John Theuri urged the government to boost security.
