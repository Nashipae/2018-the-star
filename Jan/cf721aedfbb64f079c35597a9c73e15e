After the completion of the deal to bring in Nairobi City Stars, Emmanuel Opiyo, Sofapaka goalkeepers trainer George ‘Joshe’ Wambugu has said the club may be spoiled for choice in picking the first choice glove-man due to the stiff competition in training. Wambugu is currently burning the midnight oil as he takes Mathias Kigonya, Reuben Juma and the club’s new signing through intensive drills. He, however, believes they are all up to the task. “For sure, the three goalkeepers have given their all in training and I must say whoever will be considered for duties will do well. I have conducted drills including saving at tight angles and penalties and I’m totally satisfied,” said Wambugu. Since joining Sofapaka, Ugandan-born Kigonya has been Sofapaka’s first choice custodian and it was least surprising when he was nominated for the Sports Journalists of Kenya (SJAK) award last month although he didn’t make the cut for the accolades. In the meantime, 22-year-old Opiyo who is one of the youngest of the three Sofapaka goalkeepers has attributed his meteoric rise to the polished coaching by Wambugu. “Wambugu is a goal keeping coach per excellence as I have a learned more from him. Since joining Sofapaka ranks, I keep on working hard and hopefully, I should be incorporated in the team’s starting line–up sooner rather than later,” said Opiyo. On his part, Wambugu, a former national women team Harambee Starlets goalkeepers’ trainer, said he is glad to work with custodians who are willing to learn, adding that sky is the limit for all of them. “My work is made easier because all the three goalkeepers are thirsting to shine. I think the goal keeping department is one of the best at Sofapaka as we speak,” said Wambugu. Wambugu, a product of the MYSA set up, has many years of experience training young goalkeepers.
