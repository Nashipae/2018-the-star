Housing Finance Group has announced that its 2017 net
profits may be 25 per cent lower than profits recorded in 2016.  The firm which reported a net profit of Sh905.8 million in
the previous year said the slowdown in profits was as a result of the law
capping interest rates coupled with a year riddled with tighter credit growth.  “The year experienced unfavorable macro-economic environment
resulting in slowdown in major economic activity, adversely affecting credit
growth,” Housing Finance Group Managing Director Frank Ireri said in a
statement.  The notice added that slow processing of transactions at the
Ministry of Lands Registries also had a hand in reducing profits citing that
liquidating some of the firm’s projects whose conveyance was in process had
been stalled during the year.  The mortgage finance provider has registered significant
profit drops throughout 2017 on the back of the interest rate cap law beginning
with a 73.02 per cent decline in the first quarter ending March compared to a
corresponding period the previous year. The mortgage lender’s year-on year profits reduced by 74 per
cent to Sh159 million as at June 30, 2017 and also dropped 81 per cent in the
nine months to September, recorded at Sh159.7 million compared to the same
period last year.  The company attributed the poor performance to defaults which
contributed to reduced interest income.  In the statement, Ireri said the Group was working on a
number of strategic initiatives including investing in the development of
digital platforms that would enhance accessibility as well as focus on customer
service and experience. The firm is also looking to deepen the full banking value
proposition and scale up on the development of decent and affordable housing.
