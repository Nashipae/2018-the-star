The Sh11.2 million fraud case against senior Trans Nzoia Sugar managing director Godfrey Wanyonyi and six other managers failed to take off on Monday. This followed the sudden illness of company secretary Benson Kwatenya who was joined in the case. Judge John Kingori pushed the case to Wednesday. He said this is was to allow Kwatenya recover before he is brought to court. The managers are John Wanyonyi (chief cashier) Kennedy Onyango (accountant), and Ben Sitati (cashier). Others are Robert Juma; Kennedy Wanjala - general managers; and Juliet Ng'ang'a - a clerk at the firm. The lot was suspended after they were linked to the loss of Sh11.2 million at the firm. Ahmed Anwar, the lawyer representing the officials, said they hope the matter will be dispensed in good time despite Kwatenya's joinder. "We know that if the court allows Kwatenya’s case to be joined, he has the right to tell the court that the hearing begins afresh," he said. The seven officials are facing charges of corruption, economic crimes, and abuse of office following the reported loss of funds. The firm’s board appointed Emmanuel Kulundu, a project implementation manager, as acting managing director.
