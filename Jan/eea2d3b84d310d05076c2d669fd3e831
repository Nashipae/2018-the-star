Confusion yesterday marred the start of scrutiny and recount of votes for Homa Bay county governor. The controversy emerged between lawyers of the petitioners and respondents over the number of polling stations in which judge Joseph Karanja granted the recount on December 22 last year. In the case, former Homa Bay governor hopeful Oyugi Magwanga and his running mate Joshua Orero are challenging the victory of Governor Cyprian Awiti and Deputy Govenor Hamilton Orata. Yesterday Awiti and Magwanga’s lawyers differed on the number of polling stations whose votes were to be scrutinised. The stalemate caused a delay of more than eight hours. The two parties agreed to start the process despite disagreeing on the number of polling stations. The drive, presided over by Homa Bay Deputy Registrar Lester Simiyu, was to be conducted in 81 polling stations. Magwanga’s lawyer Humphrey Obach objected to the number of polling stations, saying the exercise was to take place in more than 400 polling stations. Obach argued that interpretation of Justice Karanja did not mean only 81 polling stations. “We’re going to seek the judge’s intervention on Wednesday so he can clarify the ruling,” Obach said. But Governor Awiti’s lawyers, led by Steve Biko, supported the recount in 81 polling stations.
