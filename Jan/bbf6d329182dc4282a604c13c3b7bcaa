Winger Edwin Mwaura has left Posta Rangers as he seeks to re-ignite his football career with a move to National Super League outfit Ushuru.
The talented wide man, who many touted as a future national team star, has been a peripheral figure for the mailmen, leaving him seeking a move away to get more playing time.
“I really enjoyed my time at Rangers, competing for big honours each and every year but with the new signing that have come at the moment, I think it will be good for me to move to another team, where I can get regular playing time and take my career in football to the next  level,” said the Huruma-born player.
 The arrival of among others Danson Kago in addition to the presence of Kennedy Otieno has undoubtedly seen Mwaura go a notch down in the pecking order but the player  holds no grudge against his former club.
“I am still an employee at Posta but we have come to an understanding that football is my passion and it is something that I love and I want to continue playing when I am still fit and capable,” he remarked. “My main goal is to try and help Ushuru regain their place in the Premier League, which I think is where they deserve to be, particularly after coming agonisingly close last year,” he added.
Ken Kenyatta’s men tailed off in the last couple of weeks of the second tier league to finish third behind Vihiga United and Wazito—the two teams, that were eventually promoted to the KPL—whose 2018 season begins in the next ten days.  Ushuru would go on to feature in the playoffs against Thika United who they lost to, 2-0 on aggregate consigning them to feature in the Super League for a second successive season—a fact that will no doubt see some of their players leave. But with players of the calibre like Mwaura committing to play for them, this season will be of a big boost to Kenyatta as they seek to regain their top flight status
