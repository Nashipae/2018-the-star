Young, promising athlete Richard Tirop and his friend have been murdered by gangsters near Eldoret town. Their mutilated bodies were found along Eldoret-Kaptagat road in the Kipkorgot market area on Thursday morning. Tirop was born in 1974 and had participated in several marathons in the United States. He was killed alongside his friend Martin Kimutai. The two suffered multiple injuries likely inflicted with blunt objects. "It appears they were tortured severely before being killed," resident Patrick Too said, adding the murders may have taken place elsewhere. Police said pieces of clothes were stuffed into one of the bodies. Uasin Gishu deputy governor Daniel Chemno and top security officers in the county went to the scene to help coordinate investigations. "This is terrible and unacceptable. We have asked police to quickly probe the killings," Chemno said, adding police were following leads and that the killers would be found and punished. Residents said at least six people have died under similar circumstances in the area in the last year. They complained that the county has not installed street lights despite an increase in crime but Chemno said their concerns would be addressed. “We have already made plans to install security lights. We also urge residents to work with police in identifying those involved in crime." County commissioner Abdi Hassan added: "Our officers are on the ground and will ensure those involved are brought to book." He promised that gangsters in the area would be dealt with firmly.
