Kericho ODM officials have affirmed that they will attend Raila Odinga's swearing in ceremony in Nairobi on Tuesday. Jonah Koech, a former civic leader, said the Kipsigis community, being liberal and democratic, can decide the suitable political course to follow. He cited the 2007 election when the community backed Raila's presidential bid saying nothing much changed on the same in 2017. The region overwhelmingly voted for the Jubilee Party which fielded President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto. "Raila won the 2007, 2013, and 2017 general elections but skewed presidential results saw him being denied tickets to State House." "As a people who stand for honest and truth, we will travel to Nairobi on Tuesday to witness the swearing in of Raila as the people's president," Koech said. But speaking to journalists in Kericho on Sunday, Alhaji Abdullah Kiptanui - a KANU member, told Raila to put the interest of more than 40 million Kenyans at heart. Kiptanui said Uhuru and DP Ruto are legally in the office after being declared winners of the October 26 repeat vote by IEBC. "Raila should take a bold step and call off the swearing in ceremony," Kiptanui said. Kenyans, he said, are now engaged in the business of rebuilding what they lost during the 2017 electioneering period. "We cannot afford to lose any more lives and businesses during the expected swearing ceremony." Kiptanui appealed to the Kalenjin community not to travel to Nairobi for the swearing in ceremony "since no one knows what will transpire." "Your life is important than going to Nairobi to witness an outlawed meeting."
