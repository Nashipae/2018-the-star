We all woke up to sad news on January 1, when it was reported
that media personality and radio presenter Saliva Vic (Jeremy Odhiambo)
was no more. XFM presenter Nick Ndeda, who is Saliva's brother,
took to social media to announce that the celebrated presenter had
passed away. Saliva Vic died on New Year's Eve following a short illness at South B Hospital. Since
he was one of our own, there is a dire need to contribute to the
funeral arrangements, and his family and friends would like us all to
help out where we can. Here are details on how we can all offer assistance to give Saliva a beautiful send off: "To
offset the hospital bill as well as plan a deserved send off, you are
invited to the Fundraiser on Friday 5th January 2018, at Pawa 254 from
5pm.   Contributions can also be made via: Mpesa Paybill   Business No. 767631  Account No: Your Name We are grateful for anything you are comfortable sharing in form of contribution." The
emcee for the day will be Elsaphan Njora, and some of the celebrities
who have confirmed attendance are Fena Gitu, Blinky Bill, Wangechi, G
Money and Adelle Onyango. G Money will also be the guest of honour. Jeremy will be buried at his father’s home village of Dudi in Gem, Siaya county, on January 13. May God rest Saliva's soul in eternal peace.
