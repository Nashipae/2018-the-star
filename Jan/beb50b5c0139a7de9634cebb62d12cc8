Kenya national women’s polo team got off to a winning start at the third Statehood Day international tournament staged at the Imphal grounds in Manipur State, India yesterday. The Kenyan side, supported by Incredible India and captained by handicap 2 Tiva Gross trounced the hosts’ first team—Manipur Thangjing 5-2 in the tournament’s opener raced by Kenya’s envoy to India, Bella Omino. All the five Kenyan players—Gross (2), Rowena Stichbury (0), Nicola Barlow (0), Imogen Voorspuy (0) and Kaila Millar (0)— gave a good account of themselves in the showdown. Gross featured in all the four chukkas to maintain Kenya team’s handicap two status as the others played three periods each. Gross, one of the world’s illustrious female players lived to the billing and drew the match’s opening goal in the first chukka. However, the North Kenya Polo Club player’s goal was soon cancelled by opposition for 1-1 at the end of the first chukka. The two lineups entertained polo enthusiasts and spectators with some manic speed coupled with stunning twists and turns for a goal-less spell of four minutes and 33 seconds. Soon after, Stichbury, Nairobi Polo Club’s vice captain was on target for Kenya for a 2-1 advantage. This was not to last long as the Manipur side restored parity for the native outfit with few seconds to the bell. On resumption, both teams fired misses but Voorspuy checked in a third goal before the team skipper (Gross) converted a penalty for Kenya to regain the lead (4-2). Kenya survived a scare in the fourth chukka when Gross lost her other stirrups and remained with one. She, however, managed to stay on her horse. Millar, a teacher in Nairobi, went on to close the score tally at 5-2 in this chukka. In another tie, Australia beat Manipur ‘B’ side Marjing 6-2.
