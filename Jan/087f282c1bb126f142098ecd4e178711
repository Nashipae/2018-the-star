The Malindi High Court has declined to temporarily block a Kenyan and an Italian investor from taking over a Sh1 billion resort in Watamu. But judge Weldon Korir added on Monday that he will issue final orders only after hearing both parties. Korir directed the defendants to file preliminary objections to the application and set a hearing for March 1. He ordered investors Isaac Rodrot and Stefano Uccelli not to get into Temple Point Resort/ Salama Beach Resort as the matter is still being handled in court.

The dispute has gone unresolved since 2010. Since two new applications had been filed, the judge gave the respondents 14 days to file replying affidavits.
