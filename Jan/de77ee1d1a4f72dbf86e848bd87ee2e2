Community policing chairman Joseph Kaguthi has warned the government will not tolerate vigilantes in the war on crime. Speaking at Baricho ACK on Monday when he met Nyumba Kumi cluster groups in Kirinyaga, Kaguthi said vigilantes have no place in Kenya. He said the vigilantes start as groups to fight crime, but turn into gangs with structures parralel to the government and terrorise citizens. Kaguthi cited the outlawed Mungiki sect - which was notorious in most parts of the Mt Kenya region - and the Sabaot Land Defence Force. He praised Kirinyaga residents for fighting the Mungiki. Kaguthi urged residents to report suspicious activity to Nyumba Kumi administrators. He said this is the only way to ensure the country prospers. Kaguthi warned vigilantes and boda boda operators against taking the law into their hands, adding the government will arrest them. record mob justice “We have seen some boda boda operators who kill people whenever they suspect they are criminals. They have no mandate and they will be charged with murder,” he said. Kaguthi urged residents to record mob justice incidents using their phones and hand over the clips to security agencies. Kaguthi sought to assure residents the government will keep their identities confidential.
