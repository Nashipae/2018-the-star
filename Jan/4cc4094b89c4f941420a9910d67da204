The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union has threatened to call for a doctors' strike in February over failure by universities and medical colleges to pay allowances due to their members. KMPDU secretary general Ouma Oluga yesterday said the allowances were agreed in the return-to-work formula and the CBA they signed last year. The medical risk and emergency call allowances and arrears were supposed to be paid from January 1,2017. Oluga said the will give the institutions up to January 31 to honour the agreement, failing which they call a strike. “Numerous engagements with the universities, the Ministry of Education and the ministry of health have not yielded fruits. That leaves the union with no option but a collective action of strike," Oluga said in a press statement. There are more than 600 doctors teaching across various public universities and medical colleges. They also offer specialist services in referral hospitals including the Kenyatta National Hospital and the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret. Last year, doctors went on strike for a record 100 days to push for better facilities in hospitals and improved working conditions and allowances.  The strike ended in March after a return-to-work formula and Collective Bargaining Agreement was signed between KMPDU, the health ministry and county governments. Oluga gave the institutions up to end of January to forward to the Treasury the cumulative financial costs for budgeting to avert the impending strike. “We deeply sympathise with the unfortunate plight of these highly esteemed professionals who have had to endure as they wait for their allowances,” Oluga said.
