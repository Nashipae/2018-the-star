A 20-year-old man was on Sunday night stabbed to death by his friend in Loikas slum, Maralal town. Samburu county commander Alfred Agengo said the two were fighting when the man was stabbed in the abdomen. Speaking in his office at Maralal police station, the police commander said the man died while receiving treatment at Samburu County Referral Hospital. It is unclear what they were fighting about. Police are looking for the suspect, who fled on hearing his friend died. “He will be charged with murder once he is arrested,” Agengo said. The county commander urged the public to volunteer information that would lead to the suspect’s arrest. The body is at the Samburu County Referral Hospital mortuary. Elsewhere, police are looking for a second man who hit his friend on the head with a rungu at Opiroi in Samburu North on Friday.
