The National Land Commission yesterday urged schools that have not provided details of their land to so urgently. NLC vice chairperson Abigael Mukolwe told the Star the commission has so far successfully processed title deeds for about 4,000 schools. However, many schools are yet to provide their details. “Some of the schools have not given their details. However, the progress is going on and has seen about 4000 schools titled,”Mukolwe said. In 2015, President Uhuru Kenyatta gave a directive to the Lands ministry to give title deeds to all schools. The directive came in the wake of wanton grabbing of land belonging to schools. Mukolwe said several documents for some schools the commission was processing are ready. The commission, she said, has however, been slow due to some difficulties. “We have been slow because most of the schools are registered in different names either in the name of county council or the past municipal authority,”Mukolwe said. She said all public land is to be vested in the PS Treasury to hold in trust for the people of Kenya. She said the commission is in the process of executing the transfers, which must be executed by the county governments. NLC is also facing challenge sas many schools were started by religious institutions.
