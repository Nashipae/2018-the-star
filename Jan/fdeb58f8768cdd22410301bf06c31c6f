One of Kenya's funniest comediennes, Teacher Wanjiku, has for the first time opened up about her family. She walked down the aisle with the love of her life, Victor Ber, in December 2014. Born Caroline Wanjiku Tharau, the comedienne is now a mother of three. "I'm proud to be a mother and what it all takes is balance. I can't say I'm too busy to be with them because even with the busy schedule, I put them as my number one." Wanjiku has lost all the baby weight and looks really stunning. Talk of the gym, diet and eating healthy, she has made it work. Wanjiku says she is headed for big things this year, including endorsement deals. "Teacher Wanjiku will be making you laugh. It's all about the laugh. I've done a one-man show in the past and I'm considering doing it big this year." So, what's the future of the comedy industry? "I think we are heading somewhere as the comedy industry. More people are coming into the industry and it gets even interesting when young people do. I love seeing young people develop their skills and do what they love."
