The Laikipia county executive is expected to forward 14 names for the positions of chief officers for approval by the county assembly. Governor Ndiritu Muriithi and DG John Mwaniki (pictured) yesterday said more than 500 people applied. They pleaded with the county assembly to approve all the nominees “like it did with three County Executive Committee members last year”. Murrithi said the officers have undergone rigorous vetting and have met the requirements outlined in Chapter Six of the Constitution. He said the county has eight ministries and there is need to have two chief officers per ministry for efficiency. “Some departments like that of Roads, Infrastructure and Housing are large and for effective management, they require one accounting officer at the helm,” Muriithi said.
