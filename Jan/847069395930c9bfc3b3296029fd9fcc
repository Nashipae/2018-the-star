The High Court in Kisii has dismissed an application for scrutiny and recount of votes against woman representative Janet Ong’era. Justice Anthony Ndung’u said Nahashon Akunga - the petitioner, did not specify the polling stations in dispute. In his application, Akunga had also sought for scrutiny of statutory forms used in declaring Ong’era the winner. "The applicant for scrutiny and recount is dismissed because the applicant did not specify polling stations in dispute," Justice Ndung’u ruled. "He has failed to proof a prima facie case in his application by laying a basis in his application," the Judge added.
