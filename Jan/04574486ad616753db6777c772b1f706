Nairobi
Governor Mike Sonko has claimed that youths mugging people in the CBD have been
hired by his political rivals to portray him as a failure. There
has been public outrage over the rising cases of insecurity in the city centre where
groups of youths have been mugging residents in broad daylight. In a
statement on Wednesday, Sonko said he was committed to ensure that the crime rate in Nairobi streets is
brought down. "Those
suspects who are mugging people in the Nairobi streets are dangerous elements
within our society. We have partnered with the security agents to ensure that
the issue is contained." The
county has already formed an anti-mugging unit that is working with the police
trail the muggers. The city boss pledged to resolve all the challenges facing the city
residents as soon as possible. Residents
have been crippling with increased cases of crime, hawkers, garbage menace, the
street lights problem and the poor road network within the estates. On
TuesdayÂ evening, the Governor made an impromptu tour of the CBD to
assess the situation and mingled with the residents. Sonko
said he will not forcefully evict the hawkers from the streets, but he was
working with other stakeholders to see how best they can provide an alternative
area for them to do their business. On Sunday, the governor made an impromptu tour of Mama Lucy County Hospital to check
on the progress of service delivery at the facility. Read: Mama Lucy Kibaki hospital 'a joke', residents say over poor services Click here for the latest political news
