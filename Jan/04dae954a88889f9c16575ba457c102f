A form two student at Chamasiri Secondary School in Teso North won the Iteso Cultural Festival Kakemer Chapter Half Marathon on his debut yesterday. Bernard Ikunusai returned home in an impressive time of 1:23:15, beating Quinto Osirang, another form two student  at Bishop King’oo Okuleu Secondary to second in 1:32:67. Tiberius Emure, a form four student at Bishop King’oo Okuleu took third position in 1:36:13. Busia County Chief Officer for Education and Vocational Training, Joel Barua and Supply Chairman Management  Officer Teso South, Haron Papa came in last but were happy to have finished the rigorous 21km race. In the girl’s category, Winnie Asang’ire who sat her ‘O’ level exams at Aedemoru Secondary last year took the honours in 2:21:68 with Ruth Akodoi (2:36.14) coming in second position. Pamela Amojong, who finished 20th at the 2017 Nairobi Standard Chartered Marathon,  failed to finish the race. Asang’ire said would have done better were not that she was running barefoot and has appealed to well-wishers to come to her rescue. Ikunusai said he was happy with the win despite having trained for only three days. “My request to the leaders is to open a training camp within the county.” Teso North MP  Oku Kaunya, who graced the occasion, said five girls and four boys who featured in the marathon will be sponsored to attend a high altitude training camp in Eldoret. The MP said he will seek partnership with the county government to start a training camp in Teso North to help  in tapping the abundant talent, adding that they will allocate Sh2m through Constituency Development Fund to help in sports development. “I appeal to my fellow legislators in the county, MCAs, Governor and Senator to commit resources towards development of athletics and sports in general,” said Oku. “We want runners from the county to emulate those from Rift in investing in the county through money won in various races. It will also  develop their careers.”
