ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru yesterday said this will ensure work is done efficiently and conveniently in the county offices, improve technology, create employment and improve revenue collection.  Twenty-two subcounties have also been connected to the cable. Mucheru said the work of the national government is to connect internet to the county headquarters and the counties, while private companies expand to subcounties.  “Another international cable, which is on the way, will improve infrastructure and quicken internet in the country,” he said.
