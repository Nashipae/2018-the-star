 Two needy students who were worried about missing out on joining high school have received scholarships after the Star published their plight. Base Titanium mining company in Kwale has volunteered to sponsor the two brothers from Kinango to join secondary schools. The firm has offered to pay the tuition fees for the two. Their parents will cater for the other expenses. Juma Chiro (pictured) scored 332 marks, while Rama Chiro scored 311 marks in the 2017 KCPE exam. The two are expected to join Shimba Hills and Mazeras secondary schools, respectively, today. Their uncle, Juma Gube, who has been paying their primary education said the family unsuccessfully sought financial assistant from the county government, politicians and other organisations.
