The naked body of a man believed to be between 22 and 25 years old was on Sunday evening found floating in Malewa River at Kieni, Ol Kalou. Nyandarua Central police boss Wilson Kosgei yesterday said the body was found by residents. Police boss Mark Masinde led the team that retrieved the body and took it to JM Memorial Hospital mortuary, awaiting identification. Kosgei said the man’s clothes were found at the river bank close to where the body was. No identification documents were found. The body did not have any physical injuries. Investigations have been launched to establish his identity and cause of death. Police say three explanations are viable. He may have drowned while swimming, or while bathing. The third theory is that he committed suicide. He appealed to anybody whose relative could be missing or have information on a missing individual to work with the Ol Kalou OCS office. “I am appealing to chiefs and assistant chiefs in Nyandarua Central and Kipipiri to help in case there are reports about a missing person in their areas,” Kosgei said. He added that since the person is an adult, it is assumed he must have had an ID card. The police will use criminal registration records to identify where the man comes from, in case the body is not identified. On Monday, Kosgei said a family from Kiganjo in Ol Kalou whose 16-years-old son has been missing since December 13 last year camped at the mortuary hoping it is their missing child.
