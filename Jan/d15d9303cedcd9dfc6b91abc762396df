Kisumu Senator Fred Outa and speaker Onyango Oloo have accused Deputy Governor Mathews Owili of scheming to destabilise Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o’s government. They alleged Owili is out to undermine the county government in order to ascend to power.  The leaders said there is wishful ill intent thinking about the health of Nyong’o that would eventually give leeway to his deputy to take over.   They were speaking at Apoko Primary School in Nyakach constituency on Sunday during a football tournament organised by South West Nyakach MCA Gard Olima, the county assembly chief whip. The two leaders were accompanied by chief of staff Patrick Ouya, two executive committee members and 15 MCAs. Nyong’o is in the US and some people have speculated he is there for medical attention.  However, the county government has made it clear he is on an official tour. Outa said Nyong’o is ready to work for the people of Kisumu and said anybody with ulterior plans will not succeed. He said he will stand with the governor to fast track development. The former Nyando MP denied allegations he is fighting Nyong’o’s administration, terming them baseless and cheap propaganda.  “I cannot fight the government that I fought hard to ensure is in place,” he said. Outa accused Owili of crisscrossing the county saying he has his lineup for his awaiting government. Oloo said the people of Kisumu should resist anybody trying to cause division in the county government. He said meaningful development will only be realised in the county if there is unity of purpose. The speaker termed those wishing Nyong’o will not be able to run his five-year term to completion daydreamers. “We will not allow anybody to cause disharmony among county leaders. We will fight and curse him. Leaders must unite for them to deliver on campaign pledges,” Oloo said.
