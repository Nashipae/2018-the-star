Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and Senator Margaret
Kamar have backed calls to have results of this year's KCSE exams audited. Mandago also wants a meeting to discuss why there was mass failure
in the exams convened. The governor said the results have locked out many students from proceeding to institutions of higher education.  In the county county more than 4,000 students scored D- and below.  “We need to meet and discuss the challenges that led to the shocking results and
how we can help the affected children," Mandago said on Saturday in Turbo. Kamar said the committees on education in the Parliament
and the Senate should quickly investigate if there was any problem with the results
that have sparked uproar from Knut and NASA. She said it is tragic that almost half of the candidates scored D+ and
below and may not have an opportunity to pursue higher education. "We must know what happened and not allow ourselves to ruin the lives
of more than 500,000 children who sat exams," Kamar, who was speaking in Eldoret on Saturday, said. Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion and NASA leader Raila
Odinga are among those who have demanded that the exam results be recalled for
investigations. Sossion has claimed the government interfered in the exams and the
Kenya National Examinations Council does not operate independently. Kamar, however, said she fully supports measures taken by Education
CS Fred Matiang'i to deal with exam cheating. "We are happy with the new measures dealing with cheating in
examinations, but we should not allow mass failure of candidates," she said. The National Parents Association has, however, said it is impressed with the
quality and credibility of this year's KCPE exams results. Kenya National Parents Association chairman Nicholas Maiyo said eliminating exam cheating proves that the
results were credible. "We only need to meet as stakeholders and discuss the problems that led
to mass failures," he said.
