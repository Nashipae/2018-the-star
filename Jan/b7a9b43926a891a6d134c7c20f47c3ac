Jubilee MCAs in Kwale have proposed Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani should take over from Governor Salim Mvurya in 2022. Mvurya is set to join national politics as Deputy President William Ruto contests for President. Achani is a vocal politician and has many times defended Mvurya from attacks by rivals.  Achani is said to be the best choice as she has experience having worked with Mvurya. “The position of governor in 2022 needs someone who understands the job and knows what the Kwale people need,” Mkongani MCA Ndoro Mweruphe said. He said the development Mvurya has started can only continue if Achani becomes governor. “Do not throw away the opportunity to develop Kwale by choosing somebody else. We are endorsing Achani as the best choice for the position since we have seen her work with the governor,” Mweruphe said.  He spoke after distributing bursary cheques to parents at Baraza Park on Thursday. Kasemeni MCA Anthony Yama said the national schools student scholarship programme might not continue after Mvurya’s term if residents elect a different governor. Yama said Achani has enough administrative experience to manage the county. She will have served for 10 years as the deputy governor in 2022. Yama said he and other MCAs will support Achani’s bid. “We will rally behind you and you will win whether they like it or not,” he said. During his speech Mvurya ignored the issue and told MCAs the time for politics is over.
