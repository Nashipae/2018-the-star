Jubilee Party leaders yesterday said they will not engage NASA chief Raila Odinga. “Everyone knows the person who has power and is recognised globally. We cannot be in politics throughout. We will not even bother with him by trying to arrest him or give him attention,” Jubilee Party vice chairman David Murathe told the Star on the phone. Jubilee said Kenya has one President – Uhuru Kenyatta - and the Jubilee administration will focus on a national development agenda to fulfil Uhuru’s four-point plan. “In fact, those counties which have passed that funny motion that they do not recognise President Uhuru Kenyatta who is the Head of State are on their own,” Murathe said. Raila was sworn in as the People’s President at Uhuru Park in Nairobi yesterday following the disputed October 26 and August 8 polls. The opposition chief believes he won the August 8 election. The apex court called for fresh presidential polls, which the IEBC conducted on October 26. Murathe said, “For those counties which do not recognise elected leaders, their assemblies stand dissolved. You cannot pass a motion that you don’t recognise elected leaders and want to represent yourself directly.” He said JP’s focus is on its four-point agenda - affordable housing, healthcare, food security and job creation.
