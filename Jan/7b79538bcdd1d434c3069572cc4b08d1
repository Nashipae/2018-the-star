North and South Korea have agreed to hold military talks to defuse border tension, after their first high-level meeting in two years. The North will also send a delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympic Games taking place in South Korea in February. Agreement was also reached to reinstate a military hotline suspended two years ago, the South's government said. However, the North's delegation was negative on the subject of denuclearisation, the South added. After a day of negotiations, the two sides issued a joint statement which confirmed they had agreed to hold military talks on defusing military tension. The North also agreed to send a National Olympic Committee delegation, athletes, cheerleaders, art performers, spectators, a taekwondo demonstration team and media to the games, while the South would provide the necessary amenities and facilities. The statement also referred to exchanges in other, unspecified areas and other high-level talks to improve relations, the South's Yonhap news agency reports. The South asked the North to end any hostile acts that might raise tension, while the North agreed there was a need to guarantee a peaceful environment on the peninsula, a statement from the South's government said. They were held in the Panmunjom "peace village" in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) at the border. Five senior officials on each side attended and the leaders of both were said to have watched the talks via a CCTV feed.
