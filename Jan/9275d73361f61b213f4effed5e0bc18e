Security forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo have killed at least seven people at a protest calling for President Joseph Kabila to step down, UN peacekepers say. Police said three people had died and two of the deaths were being investigated. Church activists and opposition parties had backed the demonstration. Under a deal reached a year ago, Mr Kabila was due to step down by the end of 2017. That was a year after the end of his second term in office. An election to replace him has now been delayed until December 2018. Catholic activists had called for protests after Sunday church services, but the Congolese authorities banned the demonstration. Police used live ammunition and tear gas to prevent protesters from gathering at locations including churches. Two men were shot dead outside a church in the capital Kinshasa, rights group Human Rights Watch said. UN spokeswoman Florence Marchal said that in addition to the seven people shot dead in Kinshasa, another protester had been killed in the central city of Kananga, More than 120 people had been arrested, she said. She condemned the "use of force against peaceful demonstrators" and the "violent suppression of fundamental rights and freedoms by security forces".
