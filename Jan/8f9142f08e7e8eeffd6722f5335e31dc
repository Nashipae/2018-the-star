Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati (pictured) risks a six-month jail term and a further Sh300,000 fine for ignoring a court order stopping him from interfering with the county public service board. The board, through its lawyer Calitus Shifoka, on Monday moved to the Kisumu Labour Court, saying the governor had disrespected earlier court orders issued by the same court last December 11. They stopped him from interfering with the work of the board until a case they filed was heard. The board was appointed by former Governor Kenneth Lusaka. Its term is yet to expire. Resident Moses Lukoye filed a petition that concluded it was riddled with corruption, nepotism and abuse of office. Wangamati used the report to fire the board. The board then moved to the Labour Court, challenging the decision, and was reinstated.
