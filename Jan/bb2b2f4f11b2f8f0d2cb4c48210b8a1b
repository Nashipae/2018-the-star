A local bus company has cited losses to the tune of Sh15 million owing to the night travel ban effected by the NTSA. Easy Coach said that since the ban on night travel was implemented in response to road carnage that saw more than 200 lives lost in less than a month, the firm lost a lot of revenue. The firm said that during the period the ban was effected, about 50 buses from the counties and another 50 from Nairobi ceased operating at night leading to the losses. "We cancelled all our night travels at the time when we had pre-booked 6,000 passengers for the next 12 days,to cater for back to school and back to work after the New Year holidays," CEO Azym Dossa said. The firm's revenue was negatively affected, partly because the transporter does not hike fare prices during festivities. Dossa said that although NTSA was making strides in policy formulation aimed at increasing road safety, there was a lack of stakeholder involvement which ultimately takes stunts progress in the sector. Among the problems in the sector leading to increased road accidents include greed among PSV owners coupled with poor attitude and lack of courtesy by drivers. "During peak seasons, drivers get little rest time between trips hence high fatigue levels that compromise road safety," he said. Dossa said the NTSA should set up training centers in counties to coach and offer refresher courses to drivers who have been apprehended for traffic offences and subject vehicles to road-worthiness and reliability checks especially prior to peak travel periods. "The Centres would also be used by PSV operators to upgrade their drivers and perform basic health and eye checks," he said.
