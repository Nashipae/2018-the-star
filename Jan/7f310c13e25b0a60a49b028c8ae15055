A Thika court has freed parents of the 10-month-old girl who was found with 14 sewing needles lodged in her body. Senior resident magistrate Grace Omodho released Isaac Gichura and his wife Jacinta Ndunge on Sh300,000 bond with one surety of a similar amount, following their application to be accorded lenient bond terms. Justice Omodho also warned the couple that the court shall withdraw the bond terms should they abscond any hearing. The two have been accused of inserting the needles in the baby’s body, causing her bodily harm and putting her health at risk. When they appeared before the court to take a plea, Gichura pleaded that he be released to enable him to cater for his other three children, “as I’m the sole breadwinner of the family”. The father of four, who works at a quarry in Kiganjo, said his other children were suffering at home because there was no one to look after them. “I swear before God that I came to learn that my child had needles inside her body when doctors conducted an X-ray. There’s no way I can take part in harming my own child. I plead with this court to release me so I can feed my other kids,” Gichura said. Ndunge asked the court to release her so she could breastfeed her baby. “I’m aggrieved that people are thinking that I harmed my daughter. If I didn’t want her I wouldn’t have raised her to this point. Please, release me so I can go and breastfeed her,” she pleaded. The two were unable to raise the bond and are still in police custody. Their case will come up for hearing on February 12.
