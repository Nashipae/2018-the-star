Muslim clerics in Mombasa want the state to ban sale and importation of toy guns. The clerics say the toy guns promote violence in children. They also want the government to ban all violent movies from Kenyan screens. “Our screens are full of violence. What are we teaching our children when they see the gun violence on the screen and then we buy them toy guns?” Sheikh Mohamed Khalifa asked. He is the Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya. Speaking at the School of Government in Mombasa on Saturday, Sheikh Khalifa urged the Kenya Film Classification Board to ban movies that have “too much” gun violence. KFCB chief executive Ezekiel Mutua said they will consider the proposal. He said studies have shown there is a correlation between content consumption and crime. “Parents should not socialise their children into violence. The  US is facing challenges due to violent gun content on the screens,” Mutua said.
