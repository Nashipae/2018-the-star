The EU is working in cahoots with NASA leader Raila Odinga to discredit last year’s election and destabilise the country, a lobby has said. Wazalendo Huru said on Friday Raila has run out of options in his attempts to ascend to power and is using international proxies to disturb the peace in this country. The group cited the recent report by the EU Election Observation Mission to Kenya on last year’s election, saying it was ill-intended. It said the report was part of Raila’s efforts to justify his claims that the elections held in August and October were not free and fair.  Mr Odinga has reached out to his shadowy financiers, who have well-documented history in anarchy, corruption and despotism to influence the international theatre of politics and destabilise Kenya,” secretary general Miriam Njoroge said. The report released in Brussels, Belgium, said the polls were not conducted in a proper manner. It faulted Jubilee Party’s use of state resources to campaign, intimidation of judicial officers after annulling of the August 8 presidential election and violent acts by NASA supporters. Addressing a press conference at Delta Hotel in Nairobi, Wazalendo Huru faulted the report, claiming it was part of Raila’s last efforts to justify his loss in the polls. They accused EU chief election observer Marietje Schaake (pictured) of allowing herself to be used by NASA. “Schaake is no doubt being used as a tool for the forced revolution of Mr Odinga and the planned swearing-in,” Njoroge said. “Our message to Schaake and any other tools being used to bring instability in Kenya and anywhere in Africa is quite simple: No more.”
