NASA leader Raila Odinga wants President Uhuru Kenyatta to clarify his stand on free primary and secondary education. During the election campaigns last year, the President said he would transform the education sector by ensuring free primary and secondary education from September. “I want the President to come out clearly and state what he meant by free primary and secondary education. Parents are paying school fees as usual,” Raila said. Raila, who spoke on Saturday at Mululu Primary School, Vihiga county during the school’s thanksgiving said, for the country to develop it must invest in the youth. He went on,”What we only hear now is about books, and nothing is being said about school fees yet billions of shillings was set aside.” Raila said parents are yet to see the equal learning opportunity they were promised. He said countries like China, Korea and Malaysia have invested in the youth, that is why they have achieved social-economic development. “In Kenya we have not done that, it’s about time we distinguish between reality and rhetoric,” Raila said.  Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi, who accompanied Raila, together with Amani National Congress Party leader Musalia Mudavad, said all students from the constituency called to national schools will not miss their chances. “I will pay school fees for all those who lack fees,” Agoi said. Seventy five students from Mululu Primary School will join national school. A total of 205 pupils sat KCPE exam and only four got below 250 marks.
