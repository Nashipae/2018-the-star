As I arrived at the east gate, I glanced at the wall, and there in bold print was a clear message from the past in the words of the 1st President of Kenya, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. The sign reads: The natural resources of this country — its wildlife, which offers such an attraction to visitors from all over the world. The beautiful places in which these animals live, the mighty forests guarding the water catchment areas so vital for the survival of man and beast — are a priceless heritage for the future. The government of Kenya, fully realising the value of its natural resources, pledges itself to conserve them for posterity with all means at its disposal.  Mzee Jomo Kenyatta — the 1st President. If Mzee Jomo had been alive now, I believe he would possibly have been greatly saddened to the point of weeping in his heart if he could see the destructive construction of the new railway line.  Kenya is in need of infrastructure development, but not at the expense of destroying natural resources. It is a well-known documented fact that there are alternative railway routes around the Nairobi National Park. God has put many wonderful treasures on this earth, and the Nairobi Park is a priceless treasure that needs to be kept for future generations.   2018 will prove to be a critical year in the history of the Nairobi National Park. We the conservation-caring people of Kenya appeal to President Uhuru Kenyatta to honour the powerful message that Mzee Jomo Kenyatta left for future generations. He should reroute the Standard Gauge Railway around the Nairobi National Park, and leave a future legacy as the President who saved the Nairobi National Park.
