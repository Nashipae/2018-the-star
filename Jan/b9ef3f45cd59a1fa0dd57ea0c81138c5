Maa elders yesterday urged Parliament to approve the Cabinet nomination of former Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko. The elders are from Kajiado, Narok Samburu, Laikipia, Baringo, Marsabit, and Isiolo counties. Speaking at a Nairobi hotel, they said Tobiko will bring new impetus to the management of public affairs. “It is not lost on Maa professionals that nomination for a Cabinet Secretary post is a distinguished honour and a calling that requires exceptional capabilities, chairman Lantano Nabala said. He said the nomination affirms Tobiko’s high, ethical and professional standing and his leadership and academic credentials. Nabala urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to consider more people from all Maa-speaking regions for appointments to key positions. “Regardless of the political persuasion of our members, we promise to continue supporting the agenda of building one strong, united nation,” Lantano said. Uhuru unveiled part of his Cabinet on January 5. He nominated Tobiko, former Marsabit Governor Ukur Yatani and former Turkana Senator John Munyes for CS posts, but did not say which ones. The President retained six Cabinet Secretaries. They include Fred Matiang’i (Interior), Henry Rotich (Treasury), Najib Balala (Tourism), James Macharia (Tourism, Joe Mucheru (ICT) and Charles Keter (Energy). Before being appointed DPP, Tobiko served as a commissioner of the Constitution of Kenya Review Commission.
