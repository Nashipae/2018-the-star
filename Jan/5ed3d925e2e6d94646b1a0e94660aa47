Patients at Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital are complaining about poor treatment, low standards negligence and sloth. Residents who spoke to the Star have branded the hospital as a joke, saying no serious treatment goes on there. They have also questioned doctors who refer patients to pharmacies outside. Some are very far and are privately owned by the same doctors. Other complaints include wrong prescription of drugs and congested maternity ward. Former nominated MCA Karen Wanjiku said the hospital needs expansion. She also noted the facility has only two ambulances and one is not working properly. On Sunday Governor Mike Sonko visited the hospital and pledged to change it to a state-of-the-artÂ  facility. During his visit, Governor Sonko directed the contractor of a 66-bed ward block which stalled three years ago to be recalled back to site.
