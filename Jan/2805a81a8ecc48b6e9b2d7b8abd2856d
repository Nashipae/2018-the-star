The wife of renowned scholar Prof Achola Wao collapsed and died at a funeral in Siaya on Saturday. Helen Achola, 69, was rushed to the Bama Hospital in Siaya town, where she was pronounced dead on arrival.  Wao was speaking during the funeral of Kenyatta University lecturer Goretty Ofafa when the tragedy occurred. Wao said his wife could have died as a result of heart failure. Addressing the press in his Karapul home, Siaya, yesterday, Wao said Helen was in good condition when they left for the funeral. He said the death surprised him. Helen collapsed and was quickly resuscitated by a doctor and a nurse who were attending the funeral. “She said she was okay as she was being rushed to hospital for further treatment,” Wao said. He said Ofafa was Helen’s close friend. “I think Ofafa’s death greatly affected her. I can say she predicted her death because she kept on telling me that it was a bad omen when one starts to lose agemates,” Wao said.
