Kakamega County women’s representative Elsie Muhanda has lauded the exemplary performance by women’s Premier League champions Vihiga Queens and vowed to drum up support for the side. The legislator, who graced the Isukha East tournament finals at St. Phillips Primary School on Sunday said her office was willing to support women’s soccer in the county.  She said the national women’s Under-20 side performed well in 2017, putting the country’s name on the world football map. She asked stakeholders to partner with her administration in developing women football activities in Kakamega County. “Women football is fast growing and I am calling upon the clubs to embrace the sports. As a county, we shall not only give funds to support the course but we will also reach corporate bodies to support the venture,” she said.  She cited hard working female referee Francine Khamali, who rose from officiating local tournaments to Kenya Premier League matches.  The area MCA Hon Samuel Limisi Imbwaka, who once served as AFC Leopards executive officer, revealed that he will closely work with the county government to develop sport in his ward.  “As one of your elected leaders, I will get partners from within and outside the county to ensure we have several youth centres to nurture talents,” he added. During the final, Simba FC were crowned champions after edging out Blue Bombers 1-0 courtesy of Marclins Mwanzi in 37th minute goal. Spitfire beat Youngsters 1-0 in the third and fourth playoff while Maluna Queens saw off Spider 2-1 to clinch women’s title.
