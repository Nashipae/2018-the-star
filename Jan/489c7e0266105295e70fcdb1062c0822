Former Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti on Wednesday said fake agents were used to sign election materials on his behalf to deny him the governor position. Kivuti is seeking a scrutiny of Forms 37A and 37B, a recount of ballot papers and scrutiny of KIEMS kits, among other election materials. Through lawyer Alfred Kivuti in a petition against Governor Martin Wambora, he says results were doctored. He cited Gategi polling station, Mbeere South subcounty, where he said Wambora got 82 votes in Form 37A but was given 482 votes in Form 37B. The respondents have denied the allegations and opposed the application for scrutiny. Wambora’s lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi said the petitioner did not lay enough ground to warrant an order for scrutiny. A Ruling will be delivered on at 2.30pm on January 17.
