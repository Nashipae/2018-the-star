Banditry is on the rise in the Kerio Valley and four North Rift counties say the best way to fight it is to improve economic livelihoods in border regions. If life is better and pastoralists have other sources of income, there’s less need to steal cattle, the thinking goes. Elgeyo Marakwet, West Pokot, Turkana and Baringo counties each are to allocate Sh50 million, for a total Sh200 million for economic activities. The joint programme follows the resurgence of bandit attacks that have left eight people dead this month. At least 950 animals have been stolen. Deputy speakers from the four counties agreed to pass supplementary budgets to secure supplementary funds. This will fund joint projects in the border areas. GROWTH PROJECTS The leaders met in Eldoret on Saturday. Led by Elgeyo Marakwet’s Christopher Kibor, they said the funds will go into projects that will empower the pastoralist communities. They will help them to diversify economic activities, instead of relying solely on lifestock. Kibor said MCAs will work with the governors, elders, morans and religious leaders to end conflicts caused by cattle rustling and competition for scarce water and pasture. “It is unfortunate that lives of innocent people continue to be lost due to outdated cultural activities of livestock theft and conflicts related to sharing of grazing fields and water,” he said. He urged the National Cohesion and Integration Commission to crack the whip on politicians accused of promoting hate speech and fuelling crossborder attacks. Baringo deputy speaker Ameja Selemoi said projects have stalled because of persistent attacks. He said road construction and a mango processing plant in Kerio have halted. On On Saturday, a woman was killed in Kerio Valley’s Kaben location. Click here for the latest political news
