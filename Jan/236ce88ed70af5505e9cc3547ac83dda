Bomet Governor Joyce Laboso has warned Jubilee politicians against engaging in premature political debates and concentrate on delivering services. She said the time for politicking is over and all politicians should dedicate more time in serving the people. Laboso yesterday said the country is just emerging from a prolonged political period. She said it is sad that even before the country settles from the electioneering period, some individuals have started debates on who to support in 2022 to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta. The governor said all elected leaders should support Uhuru and DP William Ruto to continue on their transformational agenda to the citizenry. “The path that some of us as elected leaders want to take is not healthy to the peace. If we are not careful, we might end up dividing our people along tribal lines,” Laboso said. She said despite Jubilee living up to their fact that Ruto will succeed Uhuru as agreed in 2013, such debates are unnecessary and untimely. Laboso said since this is Uhuru’s final term in office, Jubilee leaders should help him complete his agenda. “This is the time every Kenyan is concentrating on development. Time for politics will come,” she said. The reelection of the duo during the August and October polls, was a clear indication that Kenyans supports DP Ruto to succeed Uhuru as President in 2022, Laboso said. Laboso also urged residents to unite and develop the county irrespective of their party affiliations.
