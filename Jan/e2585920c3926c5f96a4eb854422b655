Jubilee party has asked its supporters to stop speculations on the much awaited CS appointments. Secretary-General Raphael Tuju on Saturday told the Star that Kenyans should focus on other matters and allow the President to choose men and women he deems fit to serve in his cabinet. "We have a tendency of believing propaganda so much. These baseless speculations should stop and let the President do his roles. Anyway as a party we do not want to be part of Media speculations," he said.

"It is the prerogative of the President to choose whom he wants to be part of his team. If he considers me as part of them so be it but for now I take all these as mere rumours," he said. It had earlier been reported that Tuju was among key personalities that President Uhuru Kenyatta is considering to pick for Cabinet slots amid efforts to dilute NASA leader Raila Odinga's support base in the Nyanza region. Others included former Karachuonyo MP James Rege, former Rongo MP Dalmas Otieno and former Teso South MP Mary Emase, former Meru governor Peter Munya and former Taita Taveta Women Rep Joyce Lay. Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero and former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale are among Opposition stalwarts who are alleged to be considered for inclusion in the Cabinet. The list of women tipped for Cabinet Secretaries includes former Kenyatta University Vice Chancellor Olive Mugenda, former head of the Salaries and Remuneration Commission Sarah Serem and former Teso South MP Mary Emase, a close ally of Deputy President William Ruto. Another surprise inclusion on the list of those being considered is Raila's cousin and immediate former Gem MP, Jakoyo Midiwo.
