Lawmakers from sugarcane growing zones want the thorny issue of land ownership and benefits for farmers addressed before privatisation of five state-owned mills. MPs Onyango K’Oyoo (Muhoroni), Julius Melly (Tinderet), Walter Owino (Awendo) and Olago Aluoch (Kisumu West) said they are not opposed to the plan. They just want proper procedures followed. Led by chairman of the parliamentary caucus K’Oyoo, the MPs said attempts to privatise the factories without a clear policy will be scuttled. K’Oyoo said some traders and powerful people are hiding behind the privatisation to grab the factories without considering the plight of the farmers. Speaking in Kisumu, the leaders said the state must give first priority to the farmers. Chemelil, Sony, Muhoroni, Miwani and Nzoia sugar factories are set to be privatised. tell us the truth “We are not sure we will get much out of privatisation. Those pushing for it are not telling us the truth. They have something up their sleeves,” K’Oyoo said. “We want privatisation, but before it is done the land issue, true ownership of the sugar industry and benefits for farmers must be addressed,” he said. K’Oyoo said farmers and other stakeholders must be educated on the benefits of privatisation. Farmers’ interests must be addressed, he said. K’Oyoo said their concerns were presented to the privatisation commission, which must act on them. The MP said farmers are sceptical about privatisation. He said they want to know what will be done about the land on which the factories are built and the nucleus farms. He said there are glaring examples of privatisation that failed. For example, he said, Mumias Sugar Factory was privatised, but has been facing myriad challenges that threaten its operations.
