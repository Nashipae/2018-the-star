Two civil society groups have criticised the Parliamentary Service Commission for accepting to pay MPs hefty allowances. The legislators were initially denied the hefty pacts by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission. Homa Bay Bunge la Wenye Nchi speaker Walter Opiyo and Kisumu Residents’ Voice Association chairman Audi Ogada on Thursday said the PSC should have stuck to the SRC’s recommendations. Opiyo said the PSC should have put the matter on hold until a case filed in court by MPs is concluded. “It’s the MPs who went to court to oppose the SRC’s decision that denied them allowances, including mileage and car grants. They should have awaited the court decision,” he said. Opiyo said allowances would increase the national wage bill. He accused Parliament of running down the economy through unnecessary earnings, which should be allocated to development. Ogada told the MPs to lead by example and focus on wananchi’s problems.
