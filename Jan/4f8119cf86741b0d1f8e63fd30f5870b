The recount of votes in the Lamu West MP race began on Monday at the county's IEBC office in Mokowe town. Stanley Muthama of Maendeleo Chap Chap was declared winner with 11,090 votes against the 10,950 that ODM's Rishad Amana got. Amana cried foul and filed a petition claiming there were inconsistencies in tallying. His petition was successful as the Malindi High Court ordered a vote recount of all votes on January 8.  The exercise is being conducted under tight security, with supporters of both sides being asked to stay at least 600m away from the tallying centre. Speaking early Monday morning, Amana asked his supporters to maintain peace and be patient. “I know I won ... that I am confident of and I know this exercise will vindicate me and restore my victory. Let justice be done," he said. "It would only be fair for the courts to declare me winner immediately it is established that indeed initial tallying was interfered with and my rightful win stolen." But the politician promised to respect whichever decision the court makes as long as it reflects the will of the people. Muthama said he was not deterred by the recount order as he was sure he would be declared winner. “My win wasn’t accidental. It was a just election by the people of Lamu west. The vote recount doesn’t scare me. I call on my supporters to be patient and calm." The two were at the tallying centre of the constituency that has 51,559 registered voters.
