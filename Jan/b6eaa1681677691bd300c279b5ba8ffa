The implementation of the 2-6-6-3 curriculum should be done slowly because teachers are not prepared, a Knut official has said. Keiyo Knut secretary Musa Busienei said the rollout has been marred by lack of adequate materials and poor preparedness among stakeholders. Busienei said teachers were not trained well before the curriculum was rolled out. He said on Wednesday the pilot in 2017 was implemented in a few schools and its evaluation report has not been disclosed. “We need to continue the pilot in 2018 and officially rollout in 2019,” Busienei said. He said teachers only undertook a five-day training. “After the training, teachers encountered a lot of inconsistencies in the curriculum. The scheme’s work indicates five lessons per subject while the timetable showed three subjects,” Busienei said. Busienei said he has made regular visits to schools and established textbooks and other learning materials have not been delivered to schools. “If you ask subcounty directors if they have undergone any training, they will tell you they have not. We are also told textbooks are still being printed,” he said. The unionist urged the Ministry of Education to carry out termly reviews and evaluations of the curriculum.
