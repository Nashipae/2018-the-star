Fire damaged a second maize dryer at the NCPB in Eldoret yesterday, a week after a similar blaze destroyed a similar machine at the depot. Firefighters from the Uasin Gishu county put out the fire before it caused extensive damage. The NCPB suspended drying services for farmers until next week. MPs from the region, led by Silas Tiren of Moiben, have asked the government to instal new dryers, because the two damaged by fire were installed years ago and are old. The board will require more than Sh100 million to instal new dryers. Depot manager Daniel Kodonyo said the fire may have been caused by an electric fault. “Themachines have been very busy in the last three months,” he said. The NCPB downplayed the impact of the lack of dryers.
