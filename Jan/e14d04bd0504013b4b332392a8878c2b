Alphonce Mwaro on Sunday was anointed the Mombasa ACK Bishop after a month of legal battles. Mwaro took the oath to lead the Church until November 23, 2043. He succeeded Julius Kalu, who had retired. ACK Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit presided over the event held in the Mbaraki Sports Grounds. Mombasa Memorial Cathedral administrative secretary George Kuza, Emmanuel Wanje, and Tom Dawa, who moved to court to block Mwaro’s anointment, were conspicuously missing. On Friday, senior principal magistrate Martin Rabera dismissed the petition challenging the bishop’s victory, claiming it lacked merit. Sapit said he was satisfied the lecturer at the ACK Bishop Hannington Institute of Theology and Development Studies was validly elected. He said the December election, in which Mwaro floored two candidates, was fair. The bishop had 15 votes against Memorial Cathedral provost Festus Kiseu, who had nine. Richard Otieno of St John’s ACK was knocked out in the first round after getting a vote. “We allowed those that were unsatisfied to move to court. The court decided. There is nothing to debate now,” he said. Sapit asked the petitioners to return to church. “They should respect the court verdict,” he said. But jitters within the Holy House are still evident. A section of the church is afraid the division is irreparable and genuine worship is unfeasible. Fistfights rocked a Friday service in the Mombasa Memorial Diocese presided over by Kalu. It was his last sermon before he handed over to Mwaro, whose election caused the war.  There were fears chaos would be witnessed during the consecration and the church brought in 50 police officers.
