A Kwale witch hunter yesterday escaped trial after a bag containing his paraphernalia mysteriously disappeared. Omar Mboni has extorted Sh650,000 from villagers to bust witches. The paraphernalia disappeared in the morning as the police prepared to take Mboni to court. “I am surprised. The police had the bag yesterday with items, including a tortoise, which he claimed to have retrieved from the accused witch’s house. In the morning, it was lost,” deputy commissioner Benson Maisor said. ‘don’t engage’ Police are detaining Mboni until they gather evidence. Mboni was arrested when the purported witch ran for safety at a police station and set him up. Maisor warned locals against engaging witch hunters, adding they will be arrested. On Monday, a group of residents said they will hold protests if Mboni is not released and charges dropped. The majority of residents support witch hunting. A study last month showed strong beliefs in witchcraft could have frustrated the elimination of jiggers in some parts of Kenya, yet effective treatment exists. A study in Western Kenya showed many parents shun medical treatment for their children, and instead chose traditional methods.
