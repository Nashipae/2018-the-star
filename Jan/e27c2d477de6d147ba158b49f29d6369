Here comes the bride, and she is dressed in white. Risper Faith's fairy tale ends with a white wedding set for early February in Nairobi. I cannot reveal the date and venue because the couple will kill me. However, Nairobi Diaries enthusiasts will be delighted to know that Risper Faith and Brian have set the date finally and the invites have been sent out. Please note, of the entire cast, only Bridget has been invited. The female cast that claimed they had affairs with the groom, Brian, were disinvited. You will also notice that the couple did not show up for the reunion in which Mishi and Lisa exchanged words. For obvious reasons. The last thing a couple needs is someone shading their relationship and casting aspersions on it.
