Three Indian women and seven Napalese foreigners, who are still in police custody, were among those arrested at the club. The Indian women were released after recording statements following interventions by the Indian High Commissioner  to Kenya. The couple owns Sham House and Bar and is accused of engaging in drug and human trafficking that involves prominent business tycoons. In her ruling, Shanzu senior principal Magistrate Dian Mochache dismissed the application by the prosecution to continue detaining the suspects pending completion of investigation. In their submission the prosecution claimed the three will interfere with the ongoing investigations and are a flight risk, hence, likely to abscond court proceedings if released Lawyer Cliff Ombeta, who had protested their incarceration, said is satisfied with the court ruling adding that he will comply with the court orders. Ombeta claimed his clients were detained after investigators were “compromised by rival businessmen believed to be well connected with security agents”. "At that particular time when police officers blocked us from leaving the court premise, we thought the two had influenced in matter," he told journalists.
