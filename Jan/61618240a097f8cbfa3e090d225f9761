A developer at the centre of a row between Butere ACK Church and Butere Girls’ High School has denied he wants to grab school land. Julius Mwale told the Star yesterday is a devout members of the Anglican Church and wants to give back to society. He is to contribute Sh85 million towards construction of the Sh150 million Canon Awori Memorial Cathedral at Butere ACK diocese. The deal has raised suspicion among church members and the community. Mwale is also behind the Sh200 billion Mwale Medical and Technical City in Butere. “I already have 500 acres for my project, if the church is no ready to partner with us we will develop areas where the community is willing to offer land,” he said. He said that the project had gone through public participation twice including one meeting attended by the ACK Arch Bishop Jackson ole Sapit. “We’re giving the Sh85million. If they don’t want it, we’ll take the money elsewhere. We have more than 700 land owners who have offered their land for the project,” he said. But Mwale did not produce an agreement between MMTC and the diocese.  Church members have raise concern that Bishop Tim Wambunya was reluctant to make the agreement public. He blamed the controversy on political interference. Mwale said it was triggered after his brotherTindi Mwale contested and won the Butere parliamentary seat on an ANC ticket. He claimed it is an extortion ploy.
