Principal Peter Adalla yesterday told the Star on the phone that a downpour began a few minutes after 3pm and blew off the roof ofÂ  a two-storey building. Other students fled for safety. Four classes located in the building were destroyed. Adalla has appealed to well-wishers and the county and state to help rebuild the classes. Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo on Friday said he had sent a team from the CDF office to assess the situation. He pledged to support the institution so learning in can resume as soon as possible.
