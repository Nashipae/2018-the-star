The High Court yesterday declined to bring forward the hearing of bail application by Dr David Mwangi who is accused of murdering a KRA lawyer. When the matter came for mention before duty judge Grace Ngenye, she declined to allow the application by lawyer John Khaminwa, who had brought records for the accused to have bail application be heard yesterday. Khaminwa had asked Ngenye to vacate the previous orders by trial judge James Wakiaga for the bail application to be heard on January 24. Wakiaga had fixed the hearing date of  bail application by consent of all parties in the case. But Khaminwa wanted the application brought forward and heard, saying his client has been in custody for the last three months since he was arrested. In response to the defence request, Director of Public Prosecution KeriakoTobiko, through a senior prosecutor, opposed the application, saying already date of the hearing of bail application has been fixed by the trial judge and that the request by the defence has no merit. Ngenye said in her ruling,”After going through the previous orders by justice Wakiaga, it is clear the hearing date is properly set and it cannot be overturned.” Earlier the DPP had rejected plea bargaining request by the accused and directed the case to proceed to full hearing. Mwangi has denied murdering lawyer Jared Mokua.
