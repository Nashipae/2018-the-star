Public Service Vehicles have been given a temporary reprieve by the High Court after the night travel ban was suspended. Justice Chacha Mwita on Thursday issued temporary orders suspending NTSA and police service press statements. which prohibited night travel for all long distance public service vehicles from December 31, pending the hearing and determination of the case. This is after activist Okiya Omtatah moved to court to challenge the government’s directive, saying it has affected the public and the businesses that depend on night travel. He further argued the directive was a kneejerk reaction to the menace of road accidents. According to Omtatah, the conduct by NTSA and the National Police Service is illegal, unlawful and unreasonable. “There are no provisions in law to support the policy banning the night travel or long distance travelers,” Omtatah said. He also said in order for the public to conform to the directive, long distance passengers, including little children have been forced to spend long nights in the cold in vehicles parked at trading center along the roads with not special arrangements for their security and comfort. He claims that there are no scientific findings showing that road safety and long distance night travel are mutually exclusive. Justice Mwita further certified the matter as urgent and directed that the petition he served on all parties. The case will be mentioned on February 12 for further directions.
