The recount of the Lamu West parliamentary seat votes started yesterday morning at the county IEBC offices in Mokowe town. Stanley Muthama of Maendeleo Chap Chap was declared winner in the August election after garnering 11,090 votes against ODM’s Rishad Amana who got 10,950. Lamu West has 51,559 registered voters. But Amana went to court to petition Muthama’s win on grounds there were inconsistencies in the tallying of votes. Amana won the petition after the High Court in Malindi ordered a recount. The recount is being conducted under tight security. Supporters from both sides have been asked to stay 600 metres from the tallying centre. Yesterday Amana urged his supporters to be peaceful and patient as the recount process goes on. He said he is confident of winning. Amana said it would only be fair for the courts to declare him winner immediately, if it is established that indeed the initial tallying had been interfered with and his victory stolen. “I know I won and this exercise will vindicate me and restore my victory. Let justice be done,” he said. Amana said he will comply with whatever decision the court makes as long as it is just. MP Muthama said he is not worried because of the recount. He said his win will be confirmed after the exercise. “My win wasn’t accidental. It was a just election by the people of Lamu West. The vote recount doesn’t scare me. I call on my supporters to be patient and calm,” Muthama said. The two politicians were present at the tallying centre. In September last year, Amana said his loss to Muthama was orchestrated by the military and other security personnel in cahoots with IEBC officials. He lost to Muthama by 140 votes, according to IEBC Lamu West returning officer Abdalla Chikophe.
