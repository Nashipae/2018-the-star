Two Tanzanians have been sentenced to 42 years in prison for trafficking children living with disability into Kenya. Madukhu Mbashani, 26, and Kwela Manywele, 23, pleaded guilty to two counts of child trafficking and being in Kenya illegally in a Webuye court on Monday. The two were arrested by Webuye DCI officers after a tip-off from the public. They were found in Webuye town with two disabled children in wheelchairs. Senior resident magistrate Nancy Barasa sentenced them to two years for being in the country illegally and 40 for child smuggling. The two are said to be part of a syndicate that operates in Eldoret, Webuye and Western Kenya, smuggling children from Tanzania to Kenya through the Sirare border. Intelligence report Bungoma East DCIO Paul Mumo, who led the operation, told the Star they are pursuing links that will lead to the arrest of Mbashani and Manywele’s accomplices. He said they received an intelligence report on a human trafficking cartel operating in Webuye and Eldoret towns, involving young children living with disability. “Police acting on a tip-off ambushed the suspects and rescued two children from Tanzania, who were begging and receiving alms from members of the public in Webuye town,” Mumo said. He said the duo used children to beg in churches and markets. The two were interviewed and investigations showed the two children were illegally brought into the country from Tanzania. Mumo said police found out they were living in a house in Eldoret with other children who are yet to be found. “These people are inhuman. They come with people living with disabilty from Tanzania and strategically place them in marketplaces and churches to beg. They then return in the evening and take the money,” he said. The DCIO warned any person who will be found assisting, engaging or participating in human trafficking in Kenya will be dealt with. There have been many child trafficking cases and child labour in Western.
