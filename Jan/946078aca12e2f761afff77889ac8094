Environment CS Judi Wakhungu wants counties to protect key water towers and the environment. Speaking at ameeting in Eldoret on Thursday, Wakuhungu said counties in the North Rift must involve communities in environmental conservation, especially around the Embobut and Kaptagat water towers.  Governors Jackson Mandago of Uasin Gishu and Alex Tolgos of Elgeyo Marakwet said unless the environment is protected, the impact on the population would be devastating. Mandago urged the state to declare Kaptagat Forest a water tower to improve conservation. At the meeting Amnesty International and the EU called for an end to human rights violations in the ongoing evictions of the Sengwer community from Embobut Forest in Elgeyo Marakwet. The community has demanded evictions be stopped so dialogue can begin. The government says it is not targetting the illegal settlers but rustlers who hide stolen animals in the forest. EU ambassador to Kenya Stefano Dejak called for negotiations and conservation.
