President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday jetted back from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where he attended the 30th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union. The plane carrying the President and First Lady Margaret Kenyatta touched down at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport shortly after 5pm. Uhuru inspected a quarter guard mounted by a detachment of the Kenya Air Force. Deputy President William Ruto and Chief of Defence Forces Gen Samson Mwathethe led senior government officials in receiving the President at the airport. At the AU summit, African leaders focused on reforms and the move towards a free trade area. The reform measures, crafted by a panel led by Rwandan President Paul Kagame, are around enhanced financial contributions as well as ensuring greater efficiency at the AU Commission in Ethiopia. Kenya is broadly supportive of the reforms. “Kenya strongly supports the reforms at the African Union, as that is the surest way to ensure the Union, its Commission, Organs and Agencies are fit for purpose and well equipped to deliver on the ambitious aspirations of the African people as spelt out in Agenda 2063,” President Kenyatta said at the summit. Leaders also spoke against terrorism and signalled the urgency to combat the menace, which has become a major threat to peace, security and development. They assured that peace and stability will continue to be given priority in the continent. UN Secretary General António Guterres said he is working on strengthening the partnership between the AU and the UN, especially in peace and security in Africa. On South Sudan, Guterres said the UN has aligned its position with the AU and Igad, saying the partnership is important to building a safer world. Click here for the latest political stories
