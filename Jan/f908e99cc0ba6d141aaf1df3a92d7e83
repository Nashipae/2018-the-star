Security chiefs have warned in West Pokot youths against causing chaos following their differences on social media. The team said it was monitoring social media pages in the wake of warnings by two political groupings that members will go for each other's throats. Mathew Kuto, West Pokot county police commander, said those who post messages likely to spark mayhem will be prosecuted. The police boss said they will not allow differences between the groups to spill from  the social media platforms. "The two groups have been threatening each other on social media. The confrontation has moved from social media to physical fights." Kuto noted that four people arrested for posting inciting comments on social media will be charged to serve as examples to the rest. The police boss said he had instructed DCI officers in the county to monitor social media sites so as to arrest more criminals. "Those making serious allegations on Facebook will be arrested and pinned down to provide evidence or prove their allegations," he added. "We will deal with them as we deal with any other criminal offences. We cannot compromise on security because of their political alignments." He asked politicians in the county to be mindful of what they say in public and warned they will be punished for utterances that risk resident's peaceful co-existence. "Leaders should strive to unite residents for development. The two groups should challenge their leaders to deliver," Kuto added. He condemned the Tuesday clash between the two groups, which saw several people injured and property destroyed. Click here for latest political news
