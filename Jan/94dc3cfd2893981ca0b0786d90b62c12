Muhoroni MP Onyango Koyoo wants the government to stop the importation of cheap sugar. He said there is an illegal sugar influx into the local market which could lead to the collapse of the country’s sugar industry.   Speaking to the Star on Sunday in Kisumu town, Koyoo further accused a section of millers of importing and packaging sugar which has flooded the market. The sugar imports have increased from 264,570 tonnes in 2015-16 to 426,149 tonnes in 2016-17, following the opening up of importation of duty-free sugar imports from non-EAC and non-Comesa countries. He said the cheap imports were flooding in because of the failure of Agriculture CS Willy Bett to gazette sugarcane regulations to streamline the industry. “We know there are cartels who are opposing the regulations. Bett must be bold to expedite the gazzetement to lock the barons out,” Koyoo said. The MP noted that lack of regulations have given room for corruption and sugar barons to kill the industry.  “The government should establish the source of imported sugar, which is being smuggled into the country through porous borders,” Koyoo said.
