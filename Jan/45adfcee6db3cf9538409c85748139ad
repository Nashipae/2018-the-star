The taxman netted Sh62.2 million from the recent public auction held at the Kenya Revenue Authority's custom warehouse at the port of Mombasa. The sale of 53 slots of goods included vehicles, household goods, construction materials and other assorted goods. The goods were auctioned after the importers failed to pay duty to enable them to collect their cargo from the port even after the KRA issued a one-month notice in the Kenya gazette. “The auctioning of abandoned goods at the port of Mombasa is part of the Authority’s efforts to decongest the facility and enhance efficiency,” said KRA deputy commissioner southern region, Nicholas Kinoti. A second auction is scheduled on January 17, after expiry of a gazette notice published in November last year. “Unless the goods are entered and removed from the custody of the customs warehouse keeper, Kilindini Mombasa, within 30 days of the respective gazette notices, the goods therein will be deemed abandoned and will be sold by public auction,” read part of the notice. “The only way to dispose these goods is by inviting Kenyans following a legal process, to come and buy these goods through a public auction,” said Kinoti before the auction started. KRA has asked interested buyers to view the goods at Customs warehouse, Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Customs Bonded Warehouse, Nairobi Inland Container Depot and Namanga customs warehouse on January 15 and 16 for the goods that will be auctioned on January 17.
