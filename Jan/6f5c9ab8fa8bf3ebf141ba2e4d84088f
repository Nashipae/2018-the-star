Getting trolled is not a party you want to be invited to. Our
celebrities have been trolled and cyber bullied and lived to tell the tale. Lillian Muli was recently victimised, and Betty Kyallo leapt to her defence. Lillian
wrote that she stands up against trolls because, "I
don't pay attention to haters dear, I just don't want a generation of
young girls and boys growing up to become spiteful people." Betty chimed in, saying, "Love it babe. That’s the truth. Kwanza
juzi they were discussing how dark my armpit is. I was like, my
armpit is subject for a discussion. They even have a problem with my
imperfections that I don’t worry about. I love it. As they were, Love.
Waendelee." Lillian responded: "Honey, you are a star keep shining bright, no one can touch a star."
