Bahati curtain-raised for Willy Paul during the Amerucan (Ameru people) Extravaganza hosted at the Meru National Polytechnic on Christmas Eve. The organisers, Weru TV, took great care to publicise the even beforehand. They learnt a hard lesson from the flopped Glen Washington's concert hosted at the same venue a few weeks back. Revellers showed up in huge numbers. Youth and Sports executive Kiogora Daniel and county chief of staff Gideon Kimathi attended. The show started with little-known Meru musicians but popular headliners took the stage later in the night. An enthusiastic Bahati, who gave a thrilling performance, at one point asked a videographer on stage, "to move aside, I want to be close to my great fans" as he greeted and took photos and selfies with fans. Willy Paul, who was only a short time on the stage, did not disappoint either. Despite a technical hitch by DJ Kalonje at start of Khaligraph Jones's set, the rapper owned the stage and kept his fans on their feet.
