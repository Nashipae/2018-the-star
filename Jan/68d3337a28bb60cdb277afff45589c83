Unbeaten Menengai Oilers and Mean Machine seek to extend their unbeaten run tomorrow as the Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) Championship enters match Day Six. Oilers welcome University of Eldoret’s Trojans at Nakuru Showground hoping for a win and consolidate their lead at top of the championship log. The Nakuru-based team leads the table with 19 points same as Machine but Oilers have a better points difference. Mean Machine will be all out to maintain their unbeaten run when they host Catholic Monks in a battle of former Kenya Cup sides at University of Nairobi grounds. Machine and Oilers have been in imperious form, winning their four matches and three of them with a bonus point. Third-placed Western Bulls entertain Kisumu RFC at the Bullring in Kakamega, hoping to return to winning ways after going down 26-8 against Oilers last weekend. Kisumu were given a 24-0 walkover after Moi University’s Trojans. Hosts USIU Martials battle fourth-placed Ngong Warriors with the former Kenya Cup side hoping to bounce back after going down 25-15 against Catholic Monks last weekend. JKUATS Cougars play bottom of the table South Coast Pirates in Juja while Egerton Wasps and Moi University’s Arsonists face off at Njoro in an all university encounter. The Wasps will be seeking their second win of the campaign after upsetting UoE 15-7 last weekend.
