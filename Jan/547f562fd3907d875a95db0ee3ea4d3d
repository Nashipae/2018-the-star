Three public universities are set to benefit with over 24,000 hostel rooms in a new partnership between the government and private developers. A conference, organized to woo local and international investors, will benefit Moi University with 15,000 beds, South Eastern University 5,400 beds and Embu University College 4,000 beds. Each project will be marketed with prospective investors allowed to bid for more than one project as long as they can demonstrate capacity to undertake the projects. Stanley Kamau, director for Public Private Partnership said public universities have expressed interest in developing various education facilities through the PPP Model. “The model is preferred mainly due to its ability to tie in the operation and maintenance aspect of an infrastructure asset, meaning facilities can remain in great condition for the entire life of the contract,” he said. According to the Ministry of Education, universities are facing a major bed capacity shortage, which is a hindrance in availing access to higher learning both within the public and private sector. Kenya has 72-chartered private and public universities with an estimated bed capacity of 300,000, against a total enrolment of over 770,000 students. There has been a steady rise in student enrolment in universities in the last four years. In 2017, about 88,000 students were enrolled in public universities compared to 50,000 in 2013. Currently, the 31 public universities are only able to accommodate 25 per cent of all the students enrolled forcing thousands of students to seek alternative accommodation arrangement some of which have had a negative impact on students. Due to the shortage in bed capacity, universities have had to extend courses and put in place student rotation to accommodate more students.
