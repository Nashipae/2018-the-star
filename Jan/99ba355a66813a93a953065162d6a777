The Democratic Party of Kenya has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto to speed up and name the full Cabinet. Chairman Esau Kioni said the dilly-dallying game is causing  a lot of speculation rumours, propaganda and confusion, which is destructive. Kioni who was spoke  to journalists in Othaya on Tuesday said the naming of the full Cabinet by President is long overdue. “Don’t give politicians room for speculation. Release the names immediately. Let Kenyans see the whole Cabinet,” he said. He, however, urged the Uhuru to name a Cabinet that will help him leave legacy after the end of his term. A fortnight ago, the President named part of his Cabinet, which drew sharp criticism from many Kenyans.
