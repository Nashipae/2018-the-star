Budding athletes in Mosoriot, Nandi County have received training equipment from Landson Foundation. Landson director, Alfred Koech, said the foundation seeks to give back to the community that he grew in before heading to the Edit Cowan University in Western Australia, where he has been the athletics captain for two years. “Nandi County Athletics Kenya chairman Abraham Mutai gave me an opportunity, mentored and motivated me,” he said. “We are now back, focused on provision of the much-needed support like shoes and other sports apparel, partnerships and connections to ensure that talented youths continue pursuing their education while at the same time growing their God-given talent.” Primary and secondary school students benefitted from 150 pairs of running shoes and training gear. He revealed that youthful runners Nimrod Korir, Dismas Kipchumba and Vivian Chepkemei will travel to the US on athletics scholarships. They are currently training in Kaptagat with the help of the foundation. He hailed Team Landson Perth, The Running Center, Perth Distance Project, individuals for donating cash and the running shoes and kit. Koech said they are seeking to partner with county governments in North Rift regions to support sports and education. “We also want to partner with private organizations and individuals willing to walk with us through this journey. We have established athletes in our county and we know that they will be willing to join hands in this noble cause,” he added.
