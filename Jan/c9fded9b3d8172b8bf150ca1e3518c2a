Veteran Benga maestro Gabriel Omollo, best known for his zilizopendwa hit 'Lunchtime', has died. 'Omollo Gabby' died at Busia County Referral Hospital at about 9pm on Wednesday after a long illness. Omollo had initially been taken to a facility in Ugunja sub-county but his condition worsened. The disease that caused the death of the 79-year-old had not been confirmed by press time. But the chairman of the Nyanza branch of the Music Copyright Society of Kenya, said he had kidney and liver complications. Tom Kodiyo noted Lunchtime and other songs including Mr Agoya, Maro Oketho and Ugunja were popular. On Thursday, relatives and friends gathered at Omollo's home in Nyabeda village, Ugunja. Despite his fame, he lived in abject poverty and once attempted a comeback. Omollo was born in 1939 and was raised at the railway quarters of Muthurwa and later in Makongeni, Nairobi. He learnt how to play the guitar while at St Peters Claver’s Primary School where he sang in the choir.  The musician's career took off in the 1960s when he joined Equator Sound band alongside Fadhili William, Daudi Kabaka and Nashil Pichen. In 1974, he became the first Kenyan musician to be awarded an international gold disc after selling 150,000 copies of his ‘Lunchtime’ single. Friend Meshack Kobul eulogised Omollo as a "humble and dedicated musician with unrivaled talent". “Omollo was a humble mzee whose music was carefully drafted with educative massages," he said on Thursday. "He could not be compared to some of the arrogant Benga musicians of the old days who thrived on composing music that vilified their colleagues." Ugunja MCA and Siaya assembly Majority leader Peter Odero said Omollo was the most progressive musician in the region. Click here for the latest political news
