A photographer attached to the police has confirmed the body of a Briton who died while detained at a Kwale police station had bruises. Sergeant Stephen Lemai told the judicial inquest proceedings in Mombasa that Alexander Monson, son of a British aristocrat, had bruises on his elbow. He said Monson had bruises on his left elbow and the upper palm of his left arm. Lemai also told principal magistrate Richard Odenyo he also noted bruises on Monsonâ€™s testicles. He produced photographs of the bruises which he had taken at Pandya Memorial Hospital. The officer said he took the photos just before two pathologists conducted a postmortem. Lemai said he also took photos when the pathologists were conducting the postmortem. Yesterday, another witness told the court he banned Monson from his entertainment joint because of his involvement with drugs. George Barbour said he issued orders to keep Monson out of Forty Thieves and Ali Baba clubs after rumors of his use of narcotics. Barbour denied involvement in the death of Monson, despite having crossed paths six months earlier. In 2012,police detained Monson at the Diani police station after he was allegedly arrested with narcotics. He later died while chained to a hospital bed after he was admitted with breathing complications. A postmortem report indicated that the deceased had injuries on the back of his head.
