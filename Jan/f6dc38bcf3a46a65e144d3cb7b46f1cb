Zari Hassan has had it. This time there is no going back. Rumours are swirling around that Diamond had another affair, this time with socialite Tunda. Diamond claimed in a tweet that he is free to marry as many wives as he pleases and this year will be it. The tweet was later deleted. Before that furore could die down, a Kenyan beauty queen called out Diamond for sliding into her DM when he was in Nairobi for a pool party. Now, the boy from Tandale has been accused of cheating with socialite Tunda. These allegations spread like wildfire to the point where Wolper Stylish told Zari, "Tunda anapika na kupakua Mdale. Wewe endelela Kunyoyesha Nillan huko." These new rumours seem to be the straw that has broken the camel's back for Zari. She blocked Diamond in all her social media. To placate her, Diamond posted Zari's photo as his profile picture on WhatsApp. Diamond's mother has pleaded with Zari not to leave her son, despite his indiscretions. Sandra Michaels wrote on her Instagram: "Nilikuzoea Zari, mtunze vyangu visiri mwenye kunistiri fundi mitambo kinga yangu ya mwili isolipa bilii kuchoma changu simtaki kafiri."
