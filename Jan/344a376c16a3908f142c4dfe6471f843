The National Building Inspectorate department has blamed the judicial system for not punishing a single owner of a collapsed building since 1996. More than 20 buildings have collapsed in the last 20 years killing about 200 people. Sunbeam Supermarket collapsed on Moi Avenue in 1996 killing 35 people. In January 2006, a building under construction along Ronald Ngala, Nairobi, caved in killing 17 workers. Chief Government Quantity Surveyor and NBI secretary Moses Nyakiongora said it is regrettable there has never been a single conviction following the tragedies. Landlords, developers, planners and engineers involved in construction of deathtraps escape criminal liability, despite tough talk by authorities. Nyakiongora said the fact that no one has been convicted for causing deaths and made to compensate victims raises troubling questions about the justice system. “The system involves prosecutors, advocates and judges. We have never heard anyone convicted over a collapsed building since 1996. They should play part, ” Nyakiongora said. He said the Inspectorate has informed police and provided evidence of the causes for building collapses.  Nyakiongora said no one ever been found culpable for causing deaths by professional negligence.  On Wednesday two people were killed and six injured in Pipeline as a developer demolished a building — starting from the bottom, not the top floor. The structure collapsed on them. Nyakiongora only jail terms will stop unscrupulous builders. President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered establishment of NBI In 2015 after a building collapsed in Makongeni,killing seven people. Nyakiongora said the NBI was tasked with auditing and demolishing all unsafe buildings and ensuring defective buildings were regularised because “rampant” collapses.
