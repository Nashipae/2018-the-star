The Abawanga people are celebrating the nomination of Rashid Achesa as the Sports CS. If approved, he will be the first leader from the Luhya Wanga clan to hold a Cabinet position. “We have only had assistant ministers in the previous regime,” King Peter Mumia II said on Saturday. The Abawanga Kingdom was the largest historical governance unit during the colonial insurgency. The Wanga people are spread out in Mumias East, West, Matungu and parts of Butere. The most significant leader was Paramount Chief King Nabongo Mumia. Mumia II said, “We have been out of the limelight. We thank President [Uhuru] Kenyatta for considering us. It’s a great honour.” Achesa was an MP aspirant for Mumias West. The former ODM party youth leader vied on the Jubilee Party ticket and came in second.
