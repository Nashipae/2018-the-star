A
Nguu Tatu squatter fainted outside Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho's office on Wednesday during protests against Bandari Sacco's perimeter wall. Nazi Ngala
fainted when about 100 squatters attempted to pull down the office's gates in demand for an audience with the governor. The protesters administered first aid to the woman, who says she has lived in the disputed land for over 20 years, before she later regained consciousness. Bandari Sacco
claims ownership of the 60-acre piece of land in Nguu Tatu, Kisauni constituency
and have obtained a court order to construct the wall. The
squatters have accused Bandari Sacco is attempting to forcefully evict them from the plot. They sang
the national anthem and freedom songs outside Joho’s office, disrupting the activities
of the county court, which is adjacent to the office. Attempts by some county officials to address the
angry squatters were futile as they shouted them down saying they only want
to see Joho. The squatters got more angry after they were
informed that the governor was not available. "We don’t sleep at night. We are like caged
animals. These people will one day say we should vacate the area which is
rightfully ours," chairman Martin Chiponda said. Chiponda claimed there are more than 3,000
squatters on the land, which is part of the larger 314-acre Hussein Dairy Farm. The lot was addressed by Geoffrey Busaka, an official in Joho's administration. Click here for the latest political news
