Nyandarua police boss Wilson Kosgei has accused his officers of sabotage in the war against illicit alcohol consumption. “Sometimes I think I trust people who do the opposite of what is expected. That is why I changed tact and got results,” Kosgei said yesterday. He spoke at the Ol Kalou police station after leading a raid on bars operating outside the legal hours. Nine people, including a bar owner, were arrested after they were found drinking at 10am. Residents have complained of a return of the excessive alcohol consumption that forced President Uhuru Kenyatta to order a crackdown in 2015. It is not strange to spot drunkards in most Nyandarua towns and trading centres from as early as 7am. "You wonder where they get the drinks. It cannot be tolerated," Kosgei said. Ol Kalou's Kingston bar owner Wacu Karuga was among those arrested in yesterday's crackdown. Kosgei said he had arrested the man last week and took him to court where he was fined Sh15,000. "Yet today, he is again at it. I think he is getting protection from somewhere," Kosgei said. Others arrested were Geoffrey Kimuri, Peter Kang’ethe, Maurice Mutembei, Joseph Gichuki, Wilson Ndung’u, Joshua Gachuki, Peter Murigi and Samuel King’ori. Kosgei said he had put supermarkets under close watch. “We shall stop the drunkenness soon,” he said. Ends
