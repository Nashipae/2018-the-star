Eric Wanaina's new album is out. In it he opens up to the public about his past relationship experience. The album is based on four themes: Love, passion, betrayal and reconciliation. He confesses that it was the best way to share past experiences and that of others to the public. The album is important to him as it's all about something that is very close to his heart, something he can relate to. During his media tour to promote his single 'OKay', Eric explained, "I am always worried about people talking about my past and this song is about what has been in the past and also from other peoples past experiences." Eric went on to explain that 'Okay' gives the secret to getting over a nasty break-up. "Breakups are very sad and all but with good books, chill time and good series, one would be fine." He finished by making it clear that when he left the house he was not single because his lady had not left and so people should not be worried.
