FIDA will go to court on Tuesday to bar parliament from vetting cabinet secretaries nominated by president Uhuru Kenyatta. Speaking to The
Star, chair Josephine Wambua-Mong'are said the president failed to
honuor the two thirds gender principle which is guaranteed in the
constitution. “We will be filing
a judicial review to have the vetting stopped until the president increases the number of women in his cabinet,” she said. Mong'are insisted
the teamt should have 50 per cent women and 50 per cent men. Uhuru nominated six women to the cabinet which has 22 members, translating to a representation of 21 per cent. The team includes the president, deputy president and the attorney general.
