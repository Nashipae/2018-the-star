Residents of Hulugho subcounty are travelling for 90km to Masalani town to access the mobile phone network  after a Safaricom mast was destroyed  by al Shabaab last month.
They also have to travel long distance to access M-Pesa services because there are no banking facilities in Ijara and Hulugho subcounties.
During the attack on the border town, the militants also torched police vehicles.
According to residents who spoke to the press, the network problem has made life ‘extremely difficult for  us”.
Abdi Mohamed, a resident of Hulugho, said there is no network in Hulugho, Sangailu and Ijara.
“We are appealing to the network providers to come to our rescue because, virtually, everything has been grounded here for lack of communication,” Abdi said.
“We are also  appealing to Airtel and Telkom  to extend their services to these areas so that this issue of relying on one service provider ends.”
Mariam Hussein, another local, said many people have been forced to move from their villages to areas where there is network coverage.
Safaricom engineers, who sought anonymity, said they are constructing a big huge mast that will serve serve Ijara, Hulugho, Fafi, Garsen, Bura   and parts of Lamu.
The problem has, however, helped M-Pesa agents in Masalani, who are making a killing as customers from the affected areas are seeking their services.
 Taxi and matatu operators are also cashing in as they ferry the residents.
