Sonko Rescue Team CEO Joab Ogola yesterday dismissed claims its members are involved in increasing muggings in the CBC. Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, Ogolla said cartels are out to tarnish the image of the initiative which belongs to Governor Mike Sonko .They want to bring him down as he is determined to fight corruption, Ogola said. “These are just allegations. Among those arrested, none was found wearing the team’s uniform or with identifiction card,” Ogolla said . There were unconfiremed reports that muggers include former team members who now are jobless. “Those claiming our members are responsible for criminal activities in the city are wrong. Why not other initiative groups? Why point fingers at SRT?” he asked. Last month, Sonko said criminals are using the team’s uniform to commit robbery, extortion and rape.
