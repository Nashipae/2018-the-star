The Bungoma government is set to distribute free fertiliser to more than 22,500 farmers. Agriculture executive Matthews Makanda yesterday said 500 vulnerable farmers from the county’s 45 wards will receive the free fertiliser to encourage them to venture into serious farming. “We want to improve farming. Bungoma has been known as the country’s breadbasket. We don’t want to lose the title. We are empowering our farmers so we have enough food for domestic use and surplus,” he said. Makanda said the county will hire out tractors cheaply. “We are asking our farmers to visit the ward administrator’s offices and register themselves if they plan to use the tractors. We are hiring them out at Sh2,000 to plough one acre,” he said. Makanda said this is geared towards making the county food secure.
