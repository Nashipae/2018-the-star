ACK Archbishop Jackson Ole Sapit has told police not to kill NASA supporters who will turn up for Raila Odinga’s planned swearing-in at the Uhuru Park grounds in Nairobi today. Ole Sapit, who termed the oath-taking ceremony a breach of the Constitution, said police should not kill those in attendance. “There is no law allowing the police to descend on NASA supporters with live bullets even if they are violating the law. They should instead be arrested,” ole Sapit said. He urged NASA to ensure their supporters do not cause violence during the event. Police have already declared Uhuru Park out of bounds today, setting the scene for a possible clash with NASA supporters.

He told the Opposition to seek dialogue for a lasting solution to the current political stalemate. The clergyman asked Raila and his running-mate in last year’s first presidential election, Kalonzo Musyoka, to abandon the planned swearing-in, saying the event is likely to plunge the country into chaos. “I want to ask my brothers Raila and Kalonzo not to cause anarchy as that will led into bloodbath. We don’t need to lose lives,” ole Sapit said. He said Raila’s swearing-in will mean the country has two presidents, a situation he said the Constitution does not provide for. Rarieda MP Otiende Amolo and his Bondo counterpart Gideon Ochanda, who attended the service, said NASA will go on with the planned swearing-in. The lawmakers said NASA had exhausted all legitimate means to find a solution to the political deadlock. “The window of dialogue has come to a closure,” Otiende said.
