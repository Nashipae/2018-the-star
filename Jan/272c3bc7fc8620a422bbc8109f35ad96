An Embu doctor has lamented over cases of residents are dying of simple diseases for failure to seek treatment and instead praying for healing or seeking herbalists’ services. Dr Njagi Kumantha said locals have resulted in prayers instead of seeking treatment at health facilities which has resulted in deaths that would otherwise be prevented. "Many residents have also resulted in traditional healing, as some believe they have been bewitched. Some have been doing it because they can’t afford money to seek medical attention," Kumantha said. As a result, he said, there has been an increase in deaths in the last few months. Some have also opted for the traditional alternative due to poor health services in public facilities, where doctors are few and and lack medicine. According to the medic, the National Health Insurance Fund has also complicated matters as patients can only seek outpatient service from health facilities they registered with. He said this arrangement should not have been made and that treatment ought to have been open to all members so that they can access medical services from any facility without any limitation. He called upon the NHIF management and the government at large to address this challenge to make the insurance policy beneficial to all, and to enable the country achieve its universal health service provision. "There is a need to review of the NHIF policy on provision of services at the hospitals one has registered, with a vie of making it open to all members," he said. "The review will ensure individual contributors get good services since their monthly contribution is high and they can’t afford private healthcare if they don’t get services from public hospitals". Some religion fanatics have in the past refused to take their children to hospital for even basic immunization. They believe that only God heals and seeking conventional medicine equals or means worshiping idols. Click here for the latest political stories
