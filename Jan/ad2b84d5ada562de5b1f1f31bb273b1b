EACC has forwarded the file of Kiembeni deputy OCS John Shikondi, who was arrested for soliciting a Sh8,000 bribe, to the DPP. Spokesman Yasin Amaro said they were working with relevant agencies, including NTSA, to build a case against the officer. Shikondi was arrested on Monday at Billionaire Club in Bamburi by detectives who laid a trap for him as he waited for the cash. He was disarmed and detained at Port police station before he was released on a Sh50,000 police bail. Amaro said they received complaints that the officer used to detain members of the public at police stations without booking them for court. "The accused is believed to be a part of an extortion racket within Kiembeni," Amaro added. "The practice of senior officer  running extortion cartels at different police stations must stop." Click
