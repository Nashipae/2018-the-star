MC Jessy had a really good 2017. The comedian, who cut his teeth as an up and coming talent, made his break when he appeared on the Churchill Show. His regret for last year? That he could not travel much more. He said, "I had planned to visit 10 countries like Singapore, to enjoy myself. Even though there are times that the promoter wants to treat us with a hotel. Lakini sikuenda, so nimekwamaÂ Kinoo." Would he ever branch out and do his own show? "Pekee yako you can only go so far. But together you can go far. Our partnership is way beyond money. We are going to launch new shows this year, cause the Churchill Show is too small."
