Only 5,500 out of the 12,316 Form One students in Narok county have reported to school. Yesterday County commissioner Moffat Kangi (pictured) and director of Education James Nyaga said those out of school are 54 per cent of the total eligible. Low girls’ enrollment has been attributed to cultural practices such as FGM and early marriage and early pregnancies. He said child labour  and herding in pastoral parts of the county were some of the reasons why boys were not joiningsecondary schools. Kangi said officers are on the ground to mobilise students to join schools and find out reasons for the low intake. He warned parents against marrying off their young daughters and said they will be  arrested and prosecuted. Nyaga has appealed to stakeholders to work round the clock to ensure more students get enrolled.
