Two hundred Tullow Oil employees were held hostage for at least seven hours on Monday at Kapese camp in Lokichar. This followed wrangles between the community and the owner of the property - African Camp Solutions. A source said residents were dissatisfied with the manner in which the camp selected a committee to oversee operations. The owners opted to hire instead of issuing tenders. The community demanded audience with the owner of the camp - identified only as Robert - who is in South Africa for medical attention. Turkana county security personnel restored calm.
