Five people among them a four-year-old girl were yesterday killed when the vehicle they were travelling in was involved in an accident near Bangale shopping centre on the Garissa-Mwingi road. Those killed included the driver and the girl’s mother. The driver died on arrival at the Garissa Referral Hospital, while the woman succumbed to her injuries while under treatment. Two other victims who could not be immediately identified died on the spot. The vehicle had 10 occupants at time of the accident. A police source said the driver lost control and rolled severally after its tyre burst when it hit a pothole at high speed.  Talking to the press at his residence, the driver’s father, Omar Bagana, a resident of Madogo, Tana River county, said his son was taking his sister to Nakuru to pick bursary forms. “I received a phone call from my daughter barely an hour after they left informing me of the accident. She told me my son had sustained serious head injuries,” Bagana said. “I picked a boda boda from a friend and headed towards the scene but on the way I saw the vehicle ferrying my son to the hospital. I followed the vehicle but when we arrived he was pronounced dead.” He said his daughter sustained back and leg injuries. Her condition, alongside two other victims, was serious but stable. Daudi Loka, a driver, said the section of the road that the accident happened is a blackspot. Loka said it is more dangerous for new drivers plying the route for the first time. In September last year, Fafi MP Abdikarim Osman was involved in a road accident at Ukasi on Garissa-Mwingi road. He was with his driver and a bodyguard when the incident happened. An oncoming land cruiser hit the MP’s car on the driver’s side and sent it off the road. It rolled thrice before landing in a bush, witnesses said.
