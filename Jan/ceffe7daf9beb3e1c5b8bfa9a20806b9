A police officer accidentally shot and injured a colleague during a raid at a busaa den in which 10 people were arrested in Mumias. The incident occurred on Tuesday 5pm as regular and Administration Police flanked by the area chief impounded illicit brew in Ekero. Mumias West AP commandant Patrick Wambua said the shooting was an accident, and there is no need for panic. “Police had gone to arrest the owners of the den who were operating without a licence. They met resistance, and had to call for reinforcement,” Wambua said. Police were cornered. Irate patrons pelted them with stones . “Officers had to shoot in the air four times to scare away the mob that was throwing stones at them,” Wambua said. A police car was damaged and its fuel tank was spoiled. As the officers were boarding their Land Cruiser, an AP police officer, whose gun was still cocked, accidentally fired his weapon, he said. A colleague seated across him was hit in the leg twice. Josphat Pake was rushed to St Mary’s Hospital Mumias. Clinical officer Joshua Wesonga said the officer is in stable condition and was scheduled to undergo surgery. “X-rays show he took a bullet in the left leg, but he is now in the theatre for surgery,” he said. Ten people arrested during the swoop are being held at Mumias police station. They will be taken to court. Police confiscated 4,000 litres of kangara and 3,000 litres busaa. Club manager Jamal Juma claimed he has a permit and licence to operate the den. “The permit has an official rubber stamp, we don’t know why the chief and police came to attack us,” Juma said. Regular patrons said the joint along Mumias-Kakamega highway is well- known, and the raid was unwarranted. A resident caught up in the commotion was injured.
