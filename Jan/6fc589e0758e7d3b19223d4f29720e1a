The National Land Commission has promised the ongoing extension of SGR to Naivasha will continue despite increased disputes. The commission is optimistic the feuds mainly around Mai Mahiu will be solved and the families compensated. There is a dispute between members of the Maasai community and their Kikuyu counterparts over land ownership. The vast Nyakinyua and Utheri Wa Lari farms are some of the sections with disputes, some with an ongoing court case. NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri on Saturday said compensation on the contested plots will only be done once the cases are over. Speaking in Mai Mahiu, the chairman said there would be an assessment on the structures along the route before compensation is done. The route has been gazzetted. The process of evaluation and compensation will follow later. “We have reports of some people constructing makeshift structures after the project started,” Swazuri said. Naivasha MP Jane Kihara criticised the increased land disputes that cropped up after the SGR route was identified. She urged NLC and Kenya Railways to ensure only genuine families are compensated.
