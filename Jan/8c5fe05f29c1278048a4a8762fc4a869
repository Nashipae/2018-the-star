The release of televangelist Gilbert Deya on bond has been stopped by the High Court, pending the hearing and determination of an objection by the DPP. Deya was on August 4 last year deported back into the county from the UK to face child theft charges. He was expected to be released from remand at the Kamiti Maximum Prison this morning. But he will not get his freedom after Justice Luka Kimaru stopped his release. He was to be released on Sh1 million bond. The DPP, through his deputies Nicholas Mutuku and Victor Mulei, sought orders for the cancellation  of Deya’s release on bond granted on December 21. The prosecution says the chief magistrate’s decision to release the accused on bond was unjustified, unlawful and improper.  It also says the grounds for the release were insufficient since the 120 days granted by the court had not elapsed. The 120 days elapsed this morning. But Deya’s lawyer John Swaka objected the prosecution’s move the bond cancelled, saying it amounts to abuse of court process.  Swaka asked the court to strike out the application, saying it is in bad faith and malicious. Magistrate Francis Andayi last month granted Deya bond after the DPP had failed to conclude the case in 120 days as directed by the High Court. Justice Kimaru gave the orders on September 19, when he denied the televangelist bond but directed the prosecution to conclude the case in three months. Several witnesses have not testified. Last month, Swaka said he will be responsible if Deya absconds court. Deya is charged with five counts of stealing five children. He is charged with stealing the children at Mountain View Estate, Nairobi, between 2002 and 2004. All the children were under the age of 14. During the last hearing, two DNA results from the Government Chemist revealed that Deya and his wife Mary are not the biological parents of the five children found in their house on Mountain View Estate, Kangemi, in 2004. The main hearing will be tomorrow.
