The Garissa Water and Sewerage Company has urged residents to be patient as they try to unclog blocked sewer lines that have caused spillage. Addressing the press in his office yesterday, MD Yusuf Mohamed said they are aware of the problem and are doing everything humanly possible to fix it. “We have our technical crew from the sewer department and have mobilised all our resources to ensure that all the sewer lines are unblocked,” Yusuf said. He said the company was talking to sister companies in Nairobi and Nakuru to see whether they can get the services of their modern flashing unit vehicles to help in clearing the lines, which have been a menace for long. Residents have expressed fear of disease outbreaks, while public health officials on Tuesday warned food joints in Winder to close down. “As you are aware, the sewer system in Garissa is three decades old. Initially it was meant to serve a population of around 11,000, but the population has grown to about 500,000,” Yusuf said. He urged residents to stop emptying debris into the sewer lines. “Some have even sunk and connected these lines from their pits directly to the system. Let us be part of the solution and not the problem,” Yusuf said.
