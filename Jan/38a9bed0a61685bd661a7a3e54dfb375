Police in Embakasi have been accused of demanding Sh10,000 to hire a taxi to transfer a suspect from Ol Kalou police station to Tassia Police station in Nairobi. Tassia resident Hannah Wanjiru on Saturday said her boyfriend Samuel Gitau, 39, stole her Sh75,000 from her M-Pesa account on December 3 last year. She had left him in her house to escort a priest and his wife who had visited her. But police constable Mathias Mango from Tassia police station denied demanding for the money.

The suspect also accused of stealing sufurias worth Sh20,000 and a Sh15,000 TV set. “I think he guessed my M-Pesa password. One time my daughter requested for Sh2,000. I told her I changed m M-Pesa password to the date of birth of my son who died . Gitau was in the house,” she told journalists at Ol Kalou police station. Wanjiru said she reported the matter at Tassia police station, but has received no help. On Friday, a friend informed her Gitau was seen in Rurii town, Ol Kalou. She travelled to Ol Kalou and took police to his home. Gitau’s parents hurled insults at her, she said. Wanjiru paid Sh2,000 for at taxi to take the suspect to Ol Kalou police station.
