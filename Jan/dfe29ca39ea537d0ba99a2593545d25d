Gospel artiste Jemimah Thiong'o has opened up about the secrets that made her marriage a success. Speaking to Kikuyu Diaspora TV, Jemimah said, "In 2003, I was 39 years, I was just beginning my life. I married Thiong'o and he went to Mombasa, where he lived for some time. We used to have a long-distance relationship. He used to come to Nairobi to see his family. I recorded my first song in 2003. "The song 'Akisema Atakubariki' was as a result of an interesting period in my life. I believe God has given us all gifts and when you believe in him, he takes care... It's only by God's grace. For this song, I went to a producer who chased me away, saying I could not sing in Kiswahili because I am Kikuyu and suggested I go and farm instead. I was so hurt about this, but it didn't stop me. That strengthened me to want to sing more. I got sick at that time from a slipped disk and it was quite serious. I could not stand or sit, my back hurt so bad, and my doctor told me my chances of recovery were slim, so I prayed and asked God why I had to fall sick, yet I had served him. I passed out and I heard myself sing this particular song, I came out of the trance with a tune in my heart." She continued, "When I recovered, I went to a producer to record the song, but things didn't work out and I left. There were so many issues producing this song, so I didn't bother. So many other events happened much later after I went to someone who showed us the ropes on what to do. The first time I heard the song play on radio, it was on Kiss FM."
