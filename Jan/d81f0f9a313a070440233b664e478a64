Some farmers from Butere are worried after a company that helps them buy farm input withdrew without notice. The leaders of the 2,057 farmers said the company had already collected Sh1.5 million from than as a 10 per cent down payment for the purchase of farm input. Agrics Farm Inputs and Credit Company has been operating in Butere and other subcounties in Kakamega since 2013. The company was to buy seeds and fertiliser in preparation for the planting season. The farmers on Monday said they will issue an ultimatum to the company and if it doesn’t act, they will break into its warehouse in protest. “You can’t just take our millions and say you are walking away. We will soon demonstrate to demand the farm input,” farmer Hardco Anangwe said. Some workers at the company’s community sales office were sent home effective January 29, without notice. They complained of lack of proper communication and adherence to the labour laws. Subcounty sales team leader Jane Inzoberi said the company was to help poor widows and farmers, but they have now turned against residents. “We were not given any job termination letter. We just saw letters last week saying they no longer needed our services,” she said. Company commercial manager George Tenge said they do not have enough investors to run operations. He said they will refund the money collected from farmers. “We can’t continue with operations in some areas, when we don’t have enough funds,” Tenge said. “We have also been forced to cut down our workforce to one that can be sustainable.”
