NASA leader Raila Odinga is facing a fresh crisis with leaders from Kisii and Nyamira over House committees. It could cost him the popularity he enjoys in the two counties. Three NASA lawmakers Vincent Kemosi (West Mugirango), Richard Onyonka (Kitutu Chache South) and Ben Momanyi (Borabu) feel shortchanged. They missed positions they were eyeing in the parliamentary committees. Recently, Kemosi, a Ford Kenya MP, accused Raila and ODM of dictatorship and hypocrisy. He accused Raila of sidelining other NASA affiliate parties in committee leadership. Kemosi was contesting the vice chairmanship of the Transport Committee, while Onyonka, also a Ford Kenya MP, lost his bid to become chairman of the Implementation Committee. Wiper’s Ben Momanyi is also protesting after his name was dropped from the Parliamentary Service Commission list. The issue remains pending. Kemosi further threatened the party would reconsider its position in NASA. Onyonka, Ford Kenya’s deputy party leader, also issued the threat earlier. Political analyst David Omato said the ODM ‘greed’ would cost and isolate Raila. “Raila should move fast and sort out this crisis. The dissenting views are genuine,” he said.
