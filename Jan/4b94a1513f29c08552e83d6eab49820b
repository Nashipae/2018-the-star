Julius Kipng’etich is the new chief executive officer of Jubilee Holdings Limited, leading regional operations for the firm’s insurance business. Kipng’etich is the immediate former CEO of Uchumi Supermarkets having resigned last month for what he termed as personal interests. He led the struggling retailer for two years. “I am excited about my new role, the prospects it brings and I look forward to contributing positively to the changing landscape in the insurance industry across the region,” he said in a statement. During the second half of 2012, Kipng’etich, then KWS chief executive officer, left the wildlife corporate to join Equity Bank as the lender’s chief operating officer. He also served as the managing director of Investment Promotion Centre and is currently a member of the Standard Group board. The publicly listed underwriter is looking to tap into Kipng’etich’s extensive knowledge and experience in strategy and management in hopes to deliver enhanced value to its stakeholders. “He brings on board an outstanding track record of business process re-engineering, strategic management and a deep understanding of the regional market,” Jubilee Holdings Chairman Nizar Juma said. Kipng’ngetich will oversee regional operations of Jubilee insurance in the five countries it operates in including Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and Mauritius. Jubilee Holdings has several associate companies like PDM Holdings Ltd, IPS Cable Systems Ltd, Farmers Choice Holdings Ltd, IPS Power Investments Ltd and Bujagali Holdings Power Company. The insurer is shareholder in IPS Kenya, DTB Kenya, Allpack Industries Ltd among others.
