Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi has warned the NTSA he will sponsor a motion to disband it once Parliament resumes sittings early next year. This follows the alarming number of accidents in the country, especially during this festive season. “The NTSA should be disbanded and reconfigured to ensure it operates effectively since it is too reluctant,” Mulyungi said. More than 200 people have died from road accidents across the country in December alone. The latest accident was yesterday at dawn in Migaa near Salgaa, where 36 people died after a bus and a trailer collided. The NTSA is considering converting the 20km stretch between Sachang’wan and Salgaa to a dual carriageway to minimise the unending accidents. Mulyungi said the main reason the NTSA was formed was to curb road carnage.  The MP said the NTSA has allowed too many people to die in road accidents, without taking appropriate measures.
