 Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo (pictured) has said he will dismantle all the land cartels in his constituency, responsible for the grabbing of public utility land. More than 50 acres of public land have been grabbed in Kisauni. The biggest chunk is the 24-acre land in Majaoni, which has been grabbed by private developers. On Friday, Mbogo said the grabbing of land has denied Kisauni residents public utilities like schools. There are only 13 public primary and secondary schools in Kisauni, which has a population of more than 250,000 people. “Mjambere ward, for example, has only one government school – Kisauni Baptist,” Mbogo said. He spoke at Safari Hall in Mwembe Legeza, where he launched the full year secondary scholarship for candidates who passed the 2017 KCPE exam. “That is why many private schools have mushroomed in Kisauni,” Mbogo said on Friday.
