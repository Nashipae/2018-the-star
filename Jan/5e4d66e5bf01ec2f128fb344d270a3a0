The Kiambu government plans to revive all stalled water projects to increase water for irrigation and domestic use. Governor Ferdinand Waititu said no meaningful achievement can be realised if residents lack water. He said revival of projects such as Kamwamba, which he said were abandoned by his predecessor William Kabogo, will ensure residents have clean water. Waititu spoke in Chania ward, Gatundu North, on Tuesday when he toured the Kamwamba Water Project.He said his government has allocated Sh12.7 million for the completion of the project. This includes money to compensate farmers whose lands were taken. “We will compensate those whose land has been affected by this project, as well as those who spent their resources for its construction. We have to invest in water for irrigation, because we need food security to guarantee growth in other sectors,” Waititu said. He said the county is also constructing the Kariminu, Kinari, Gatamaiyu and Ruiru II dams. “We have also decided to merge all water companies to ensure they are run smoothly. We have so many water companies running on debts,” Waititu said. Area MCA Martin Githaiga said the construction of the Kamwamba Water Project started in the 1990s. “The project stalled after as the community failed to raise money to have it completed. Piping was also not properly done and we believe that its revival will help our people do farming and grow the economy,” he said. It will serve 70 families.
