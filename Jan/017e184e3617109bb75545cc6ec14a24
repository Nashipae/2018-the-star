A 77-year-old
woman was burned to death in her house after falling on a charcoal stove in Iten on Thursday. Esther
Kipkorir sustained serious burns during the 9am incident. Keiyo North
AP commander Joseph Biwott said the old woman could not pull
herself off the burning jiko. Biwott said
Kipkorirâ€™s grandson found the grandmother
burning inside her house when he returned from school. The primary school pupil alerted neighbours but it was too late. Biwott said
police were looking the manner in which the woman died. "We have been
told by neighbours that the woman was in good health. We are investigating
to determine if someone was behind the death," he said. But others said the woman
from Mindililwo village was frail and often used crutches. The
body was taken to Iten county referral hospital mortuary for a postmortem. Click here for the latest political news
