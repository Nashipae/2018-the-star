Religious leaders in Bungoma have asked Water CS Eugene Wamalwa and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi to end their political wrangles and unite the Luhya community. Addressing the press in Webuye town on Wednesday, the leaders, led by Webuye West Bishop David Walukhu, said the wrangles might cost the community politically in 2022. Walukhu said urgent action should be taken to end the stalemate or it might escalate into a big problem between the Maragolis and Bukusus. Musalia and Wamalwa have been lashing out at each other directly and through their supporters since Wamalwa was heckled at a Maragoli fete in Mbale on December 26. Wamalwa has since demanded an apology from Mudavadi, who said Wamalwa was heckled by rowdy anti-Jubilee youths. The CS has also been sent a written apology by Maragoli elders and organisers of the event. The elders urged the two leaders to convene a retreat in Western and iron out their differences. “We have been disappointed by our leaders. We want them to stop setting a bad example for young upcoming leaders,” Walukhu said. He said Musalia and Wamalwa throwing words at each other is not good for the community. “If we let this go on, it will be difficult for Mudavadi to campaign in Bungoma and Trans Nzoia during the next polls,” Walukhu said. Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi and Sabatia’s Alfred Agoi said Wamalwa was heckled for being a member of Jubilee.
