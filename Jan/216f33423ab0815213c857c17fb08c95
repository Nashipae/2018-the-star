 Former Nacada board chairman John Mututho has termed the ban on shisha smoking timely and long overdue. Mututho, who has previously raised concerns over the use of shisha among the youth, praised the Ministry of Health for banning the substance. The former Naivasha MP said shisha had dangerous effects, adding that Rwanda had set a good example by banning it first. Addressing the press in Naivasha, Mututho said the onus was now on the police to ensure the ban is implemented, especially in urban cities and towns where the substance is commonly used. He said Kenya has good laws, but the challenge is implementing them. Mututho cited the Alcoholic Drinks Control Act, which he said is not being followed. “We make good laws, but no one implements them and a good example is how alcohol is being consumed in broad daylight and even by minors,” he said.
