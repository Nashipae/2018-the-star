Co-operative Bank’s middleblocker Martin Kimondo has called it a day after a 12-year long career in Kenya’s top flight. Kimondo, also serving as Kenya Volleyball Federation deputy treasurer announced his retirement over the weekend. He has dedicated his retirement to volleyball development especially Githurai Kimbo Academy — where he played in his teenage. He became the second player to retire last month after Kenyan international journeyman James Ontere, who announced his retirement immediately after the national play-offs — where his KPA side finished third. “There is a season for everything and for me, volleyball has come to an end. Looking back, my 12-year stint in the league looks like a flash, but I have nothing to regret about it, I have something to show for it,” said Kimondo who is popular for his roof blocks. He was particularly grateful to his formative coaches Juma Walukhu, Francis Gathogo, his mentor legislator Dan Wanyama, Co-operative Bank coach Geoffrey Omondi. A banker by profession and KVF Nairobi Branch treasurer, the middle blocker recounts the most meaningful and memorable thing that ever happened in his volleyball career. In 2006, Kimondo and nine other players drawn from Kenya Commercial Bank, Kenya Pipeline and General Service Unit formed a table banking system. This table banking alignment was aimed at stockpiling their earnings, however little, which would otherwise be milked dry by the bottle. “With the table banking, we purposed to save our game allowances which would otherwise end up in the beer garden. We knew that way, we would help ourselves,” continued Kimondo. The table banking filing later metamorphosed into a ‘Chama’ and then to an investment company with portfolio in real estate, equities and the transport sector. Kimondo urged the young crop of players to adopt the same system to secure their future after playing volleyball.
