A Nairobi court yesterday ordered the prosecution to supply copies of the Cybercrime report to 11 people in a Sh4 billion KRA fraud case. Milimani senior principal magistrate Martha Mutuku made the orders after the defence said the investigating officer had not supplied them with the Cybercrime and the Ballistics Expert reports as earlier directed. In the case, former KRA IT expert Alex Mutuku (pictured) and 10 others are accused of fraud that led to the loss of Sh4 billion from the KRA. The case was scheduled for hearing yesterday, but it could not proceed because one of the accused, Albert Komen, and his lawyer Kennedy Kang’ahi were not present. The prosecution told the court they were not ready to proceed with the hearing, since the two reports were sent to them on January 16 and they needed more time to go through them. Mutuku is charged alongside former Embakasi North MP contestant Joseph Mwangi. The others are Calvin Otieno, Komen, Lucy Wamwandu, David Wambugu, Edward Langat, Kenneth Riaga, Omar Ibrahim, James Gakung’u and Gilbert Kiptala. They are out on bond ranging from Sh300,000 to Sh1 million. All the 11 have denied several counts, among them conspiracy to steal more than Sh3.9 billion from KRA and being in possession of a firearm and bullets. The prosecution says the accused committed the offences on diverse dates between March 1, 2015 and March 1, 2016.The case will be mentioned today.
