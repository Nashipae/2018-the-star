The driver of the tour van pulled the car to the side of the road, turned off the motor engine, and waited silently as the memories washed over Grevy's Zebra lovers aboard. Peter Lalampaa is among those gazing at a newborn Grevy's Zebra foal at Mpala Conservancy in Laikipia county. He remembers with nostalgia the many Grevy's Zebra that once roamed the country. Now, Grevy's zebras have decimated so much, they are listed as endangered in the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Lalampaa, the rangelands manager with Grevy's Zebra Trust, says the Grevy's are unlike the normal zebras, and as such, they must be protected at all costs. He is from Oldonyiro in Isiolo District, Northern Kenya and joined the Trust in November 2007. The manager says most people wonder what’s so special about the species. There are several characteristics that distinguish it from other zebras. For one, the ears of a Grevy's stands to full attention when it sense strange movements. Their necks are arched, muscles tensed and ready for action. Grevy's zebra adult male presides over his territory, and one starts to wonder about the majesty of this species. Indeed, in 1882, Menelik II, Emperor of Abyssinia (now Ethiopia), thought the zebra was so regal that he presented one as a gift to the President of France, Jules GrÃ©vy. And so the name Grevy's zebra was coined. Grevy's are taller with narrow stripes, a white belly, black dorsal stripe, large, rounded ears and a brown muzzle. This makes it easily distinguished from the more common plains zebra. The two species overlap in the southern range of Grevy's zebra and the northern range of plains zebra.  MASSIVE DECLINE Historically, Grevy's were found in five countries: Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti and Somalia, with some sighted in Sudan. Lalampaa says that the species is currently found in only two of the former range states: Kenya and Ethiopia. In Kenya, he says, their numbers have declined from an estimated 15,000 in the late 1970s to the present-day estimate of 2,350, individuals, representing over 81 per cent decline. Kenya holds about 90 per cent of the global population in the wild. Lalampaa says there are between 150 to 200 individuals in Ethiopia. Their dwindling numbers has now made them enter the endangered species list. Lalampaa attributes the dwindling numbers to the killing of Grevy's for meat by the Turkana community, as well as the highly degraded habitat. "There has been more bare land due to the degradation. Degradation has led to lack of grass, forcing them to move to the Southern areas of their range," he says, citing the ever decreasing level of water in Ewaso Ng'iro river. "The more we lose grass, the more we lose water. Foals are now having a difficult time because their mothers have to travel a long distance to get water. We are losing huge numbers of foals as a result of stress while straining to follow their mothers to water points," he added. Unfortunately, their data is not being recorded, since they are eaten by hyenas immediately they die. In addition, there has been a significant, very recent decline in the species in northern Kenya due to disease and drought. Tourism executive Nicholas Tirop said his department will support efforts being put in place to reverse the decline of Grevy's. "We need wildlife for us to prosper," he said. Natural Resources executive Njenga Kahiro urged scientists to put their findings in a way that can be understood by policy makers. "Research needs to analysed. It needs to be explained. How we communicate research is key," he said. Kahiro said the county has looked at the pastoral economy in the wake of violence that rocked the county for the better part of last year. "We think grass should follow cattle and not the other way round," he said. Kahiro said this year, the county will set allocations for pasture before zeroing in on livestock next year. Lalampaa had also raised concerns over the mushrooming of fences in private farms in the wake of invasions. He said there are many people currently working to reverse the trend as well as in the creation of awareness on the plight of the species. The trust already has teams such as the ambassador, warriors, scouts and school outreach programmes. The ambassadors are trained in security and surveillance by the Kenya Wildlife Service’s Law Enforcement Academy. They are trained to enhance anti-poaching and community engagement skills. "Our school outreach programme aims to teach students about Grevy’s zebra, conservation, and the Trust’s work in an interactive and fun manner. The warriors also helps in raising awareness," Lalampaa says. Previously, women were roped in as scouts, providing the much-needed data as they go about their business such as fetching water and firewood.  GREVY'S RALLY The first ever citizen-driven census of Grevy's Zebra was held between January 30 and 31, 2016, in northern Kenya. Some 118 teams, comprising about 500 people, took to the dusty roads of Samburu, Laikipia, Isiolo, Meru and Marsabit counties with one aim: to find and take photographs of as many Grevy's zebra as they possibly could. During the previous rally, citizen scientists covered over 25,000 square km — on private land, government parks, Northern Rangelands Trust and community conservancies — and took more than 40,000 images with GPS enabled cameras. US Ambassador Robert Godec took part in the rally himself. Others were former KWS director general Kitili Mbathi and WildlifeDirect's Paula Kahumbu.  Some 40,000 photographs were captured during the rally, of which 15,000 were usable. These are photographs that had captured the correct side of the animal and were clear. In those usable images, there were 16,866 Grevy's zebra that needed to be identified. The IBEIS team used specially designed software (Hotspotter) to analyse stripe patterns. It managed to identify 1,942 individual Grevy's with timestamps and locations. Mpala Research Centre hosts the software that is also accessed by Princeton University. The centre, which sits on 50,000-acre reserve facilitates, exemplifies sustainable human-wildlife co-existence and the advancement of human livelihoods and quality of life. Supported by Princeton and numerous Kenyan and American institutions, the initiative was among the first campaigns to use data collected by “citizen scientists” — members of the general public with little or no scientific training — to establish the population and range of an endangered mammal species. Image Based Ecological Information System (IBEIS) is a method of identifying zebras by their unique stripe patterns, much like taking a fingerprint. A software known as Hotspotter converts a zebra’s stripes into a unique digital identifier that can be quickly “read” from a field photograph of the animal’s right side, similar to scanning a bar code. For purposes of standardisation, the right part of the Grevy's body is photographed. From this data, the Princeton team could make an estimate of the population by looking at the number of zebras on day 1, multiplied by the number on day 2, multiplied by the re-sightings. They estimated 2,250 Grevy's zebra, plus or minus 93. This is the most precise population estimate the Grevy's zebra has ever seen (typical error bars are in the major hundreds), and key to this was the re-sightings. Some 868 animals were seen on day 2 that were seen on day 1, that is 64 per cent. Each of these animals was sexed and aged too. The Great Grevy's Rally was a collaborative effort between NRT and the community conservancies, the Grevy's Zebra Trust, the Laikipia Wildlife Forum, Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, Princeton University, and many others.  THE NEXT DRIVE Set to be held between January 27 and 28, the next Great Grevy's Rally provides an adventure to save the species. The next census will also target reticulated giraffes. Lewa Wildlife Conservancy head of research and monitoring David Kimiti says getting an accurate estimate of population sizes from aerial surveys has in the recent past been difficult. "We use IBEIS, which is a computer system that merges images from different species, specifically Grevy's zebra, to help us know their population," Kimiti said. In one of the rooms are two laptops, one being used to upload the photos, while the other is a server that connects to Princeton University. IBEIS is a large autonomous computational system. The progress starts with image collections and moves all the way until it answers ecological and conservation queries. Kimiti said the system answers population sizes, species distributions and interactions, and movement patterns. "Field scientists, tourists and incidental photographers and citizens takes images before they are transferred from camera to the system," he said. Kimiti said the system detects various species of animals in those images and identifies individual animals of most striped, spotted, wrinkled or notched species. After photos have been uploaded, they are grouped, with date and place of sighting being critical. And even if one Zebra has been photographed twice, the system detects them. The software stores the information about who the animals are, where they are and when they are there in a database. It provides query tools to that data for scientists and curious people to find out what those animals are doing and why they are doing it. WildlifeDirect communications manager Trish Sewe said her organisation will be taking about 30 school children from Nairobi to participate in the rally. This is the second time WildlifeDirect is partnering with Grevy's Zebra Trust to organise the rally. "Our main focus is to connect Kenyans to their wildlife and nature and inspire them to value and act to conserve it. To ensure a sustainable and healthy environment where all wildlife and plants thrive," she said.
