Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya (pictured) has accused Jubilee of launching “fake” development programmes in the county to get votes during the last General Election. He said Jubilee pretended to launch tarmacking of roads but the projects never took off. Oparanya was speaking at Navakholo Centre where he officially opened a Sh34 million modern market built by his government. “They came and launched tarmacking of Lurambi-Navakholo-Musikoma and Ibokolo Shianda-Nambacha roads and started in the middle and are still dragging to date. Let them bring the development now that elections are over,” he said. Oparanya asked Luhya Jubilee MPs to push the party to fulfil its campaign pledges in the region. Jubilee won four of the 12 parliamentary seats in the August 8 General Election. Oparanya has in the recent past denied claims he was warming up to Jubilee.
