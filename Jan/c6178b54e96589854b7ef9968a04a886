On Tuesday afternoon, Mishi Dorah went on an online rant against DJ Pierra Makena. Calling her a "b*#ch", the reality star says Pierra blocked her on social media after the DJ dissed her via a WhatsApp conversation. The contents of the post are way too graphic to print. We reached out to Mishi, who said Pierra was body shaming her after watching the Nairobi D reunion. Mishi said Pierra told her to invest on waist trainers, calling her fat. And no, Mishi won't pull down the post unless Pierra apologises. She says Pierra trolled her on a WhatsApp group they are in together. We also reached out to Pierra, who said she doesn't know Mishi, adding that she's left the issue to her lawyers. "First of all, I don't know who she is. My lawyer is handling it. A couple of people have sent me the post, I know what she's been saying. Well, I wouldn't body shame anybody. If anything, I empower women."
