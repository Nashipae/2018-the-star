North Imenti MP Rahim Dawood wants his rival and supporters to accept the outcome of a petition against his election and help develop the constituency. He said this in Meru on Thursday after the High Court dismissed the case by former MP Silas Muriuki saying there wasn't sufficient evidence to invalidate last year's poll. Judge Ann Ong'injo ordered Muriuki to pay Dawood and the IEBC Sh1 million each, and the North Imenti returning officer an amount not exceeding this. "The court finds the third respondent was validly elected ... the certificate issued in respect of the win on August 8, 2017 is upheld," Ong'injo ruled.

Speaking after launching the National Government Constituencies Development Fund, he called for unity and peace between his supporters and those of Muriuki. He noted leadership wrangles will derail their goals. "I thank all those who prayed for me and with me. The Bible says 'knock and the door shall be opened, ask and you will be given'," he said. "Residents are more important than elected leaders. No one should prevent development in the constituency. I urge Muriuki and his supporters to accept the outcome and get on board so we can we spearhead empowerment and development for our people." Muriuki had requested IEBC to re-tally the constituency results but Dawood was still declared winner. He claimed police dispersed his supporters who were to witness the tallying. The politician said the loss margin of 148 votes signaled a scheme was hatched to rig him out.
