Senator Njeru Ndwiga and other leaders say gambling machines from China are destroying families and turning people into zombies in Embu. Runyenjes MP Eric Muchangi and development management consultant Kithinji Kiragu said residents have become lazy. They were speaking during a thanksgiving service for Ruguru-Ngandori ward representative Harrison Muturi at Matiru Anglican Church of Kenya on Sunday. Muchangi said gaming is known locally as “the big thief”. Residents are lose money when they lose games. “When children are sent to the shop, they go and gamble, thinking they will win some cash, but they end up losing,” Muchangi said. Muchangi said women are taking their savings from self-help groups to gamble. The MP said gambling has become even more addictive than alcohol. It is ruining the society, he said. Muchanji asked the county assembly to come up laws banning gambling. He wants dealers to be denied licences to save the youth. Kiragu said according to statistics, the chance of winning a bet or gambling is very small. He said the money people are using for betting could better their lives if put to better use. He said people should not be drawn to gambling because they’ve seen someone else winning. Kiragu said people should refrain from gambling as unscrupulous traders are using it to milk cash from the poor. He said one can steal to gamble. Incase they win, they plough the money back into the game expecting to win more. Deputy Governor David Kariuki said gaming should be banned in Embu. Ndwiga told the county government not to renew licenses for people with gambling business. The senator said betting has spoilt children and broken marriages.
