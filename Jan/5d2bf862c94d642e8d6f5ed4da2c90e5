Police were yesterday allowed to continue holding a Marsabit Muslim cleric for 30 days to complete investigations into alleged involvement with al Shabaab. Milimani senior principal magistrate Martha Mutuku ordered Sheikh Guyo Gorsa to be detained for a month in any police station in Nairobi. Sheikh was arrested in Marsabit town at the weekend and flown to Nairobi for police to conduct detailed investigations on terrorism-related offences. On Monday, the ATPU said Gorsa is suspected of recruiting youths to join al Shabaab. The court heard that the Muslim cleric and his associates have been planning attacks in the country. He is suspected to have been further planning more attacks and there was a need to conduct detailed interviews to arrest his co-conspirators, the police said.
