Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has criticised Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu as the Jubilee succession battle rages on. Kuria travelled to Wambugu’s constituency yesterday and told him off, saying his recent remarks that it will not be automatic for Deputy President William Ruto to be elected as President in 2022 were in bad taste. Kuria said he was unhappy with Wambugu’s remarks over Ruto’s succession, which the Nyeri Town lawmaker is alleged to have written about recently in a press analysis.  Kuria said Ngunjiri should know such remarks are a pipe dream, and may split Jubilee Party. “I want to tell Wambugu we are not being forced to elect Ruto as the next President. It is our will since Ruto stood with President Uhuru Kenyatta when everybody abandoned him. He is also the right person for the seat. We have no option but to help him ascend to the presidency. We don’t want sideshows,” Kuria said. The Gatundu South MP spoke at PCEA Imani Church, King’ong’o, after a church service.  There was drama when Wambugu arrived at the church compound just as Kuria was being interviewed.  He refused to join Kuria and Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga outside the church. Holding his Bible and a notebook, he instead stood a few metres away, watching from a safe distance. Even after Kahiga asked him to join them, he declined. Kuria walked to the MP and shook hands briefly before Kuria left for another function at Our Lady of Consolata Cathedral Church. Kuria and the governor later left the church, leaving Wambugu alone. Efforts to contact the Nyeri Town lawmaker to comment were fruitless.
