A 47-year-old businessman from Siaya town on Monday cut off his dreadlocks to express excitement over Raila Odinga’s swearing in as the People’s President. David Oguyo, has been growing dreadlocks for 11 years. He said he decided to grow the dreadlocks following what he called Raila’s stolen victory in the 2007 General Election. Oguyo said he was angered by the election rigging and he had vowed not to shave until Raila takes the oath of office as the President. The father of six, spoke to the Star at a barber shop in Siaya on Monday. Oguyo said he decided to shave since there was hope for a better future, following Raila’s “unofficial” oath of office. He said Raila is the only person who can liberate this country from the yoke of dictatorship and perennial bad leadership. On Tuesday, Raila took a solitary oath, braving attempts by the government to suppress live coverage of the event. His running mate Kalonzo Musyoka was not present.
