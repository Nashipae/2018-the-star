JKUAT are seeking to bounce back to their winning ways this evening when they confront USIU-A Spartans at City Park in a Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) women’s Premier League duel. JKUAT lost 2-0 on Sunday to Mombasa Sports Club and head coach Sammy Oungo believes his side will put behind their Mombasa misfortunes and bag all the points. With Telkom already declared new champions, the two teams will be out to battle for respectable finish in the league. Spartans were 2-0 winners of the first leg match and will be eying a double over their fellow JKUATS, who were massively affected by the closure of universities in their last five matches, leading to a drop in form. According to JKUAT’s head coach Sammy Oungo, the current drop in form witnessed in his side was orchestrated by closure of universities but that will have no bearing in their match against Spartans. “Most of my players have dropped in form due to the closure of universities and the long festive season but that will not be used as an excuse. We are keen to win again after falling to Mombasa Sports Club on Sunday. We lost to Spartans in the first leg although it was a match we dominated and had open chances. I think it’s going to be a tough match considering these are students with skills and different ambitions.” Meanwhile, Kenyatta University Vultures eased their relegation fears with a 2-1 win over Wazalendo in a men’s premier league match played at City Park. Vultures had a turbulent weekend, where they lost 6-1 to new champions Kenya Police on Saturday before receiving a 3-0 beating from Butali Warriors on Sunday. Vultures recovered from a goal down to redeem themselves with the narrow 2-1 win over the experienced Wazalendo. Sam Wekesa was on target for Wazalendo in the 24th minute before Hillary Nkedi restored parity for Vultures in the 50th minute. Abel Jumba’s strike in the 52nd minute sealed the three points for Vultures and prevented a third straight loss.
