NASA principals are holding an impromptu meeting on the way forward following the CA's move to switch off all local TV channels. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka termed the act "unmitigated dictatorship' aimed at denying Kenyans a chance to watch their swearing–in at Uhuru Park. Kalonzo will be sworn-in as deputy president and Raila as president of Kenya, according to NASA chief executive Norman Magaya and Suba South MP John Mbadi. Mbadi said they oaths will be taken at 1pm but the developments may delay this. The event could also be called off. More on this: Raila to be sworn-in at 1pm, give NASA way forward Kalonzo said they don't understand the "panic" and that the public will be updated on their consultations. “We are going to consult to know what to do because it is so bad for the Communications Authority to do what it has done; prevent communication. We don’t know now if they are going to switch off our phones as well," he told journalists at his Karen home. “Even worldwide, people are expecting this event. So what do you do if there is a complete shutdown? This is unmitigated (dictatorship). That is what it is." The Communications Authority switched off Citizen TV, KTN, NTV and Inooro TV. It also momentarily switched off KTN Home and KTN News channels on Bamba TV. The crackdown concerns live coverage of the inauguration - the exercise has been touted by government as "high treason" punishable by death but Raila says he is not afraid to lose his life if that is what it will take for Kenya to realise electoral justice. The other National Super Alliance principals are Musalia Mudavadi (Amani National Congress) and Bungoma senator Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya).
