Embu Senator Njeru Ndwiga (pictured) yesterday told off three legislators seeking the National Assembly’s special sitting to discuss this year’s KCSE exams’ integrity. He said MPs Mark Nyamita of Uriri, Caleb Amisi of Saboti and Walter Owino of Awendo are misguided in calling for Parliament to be recalled from recess to discuss the alleged haphazard marking of the exams. Ndwiga said it is unfortunate to see MPs opposing changes in the education sector.  “We are happy that the country’s education system is being streamlined under the leadership of CS Fred Matiang’i,” he said. Ndwiga asked the trio to look for better things to focus on, instead of trying to derail the Education CS from carrying on with his good work. He said the education system in the country is in dire need of overhaul. Ndwiga said changes in quick exams marking and transfers of secondary school head teachers are positive. The senator said some principals have been having a feeling of owning the schools and dominating them. Ndwiga said leaders would like to see the teaching profession reclaim its lost glory through the ongoing reforms.
