Kisii Diocese Vicar General Jeremiah Nyakundi says the Catholic Church is not opposed to he recent mass transfer of schoo heads, but wants the Teachers Service Commission to always consult the church before effecting changes in schools. “We are not opposed to the transfers but the spirit of the transfers. As key stakeholders, we should be consulted. We have teachers from other faiths heading our schools,” added the priest. Nyakundi was reacting to the locking out of Cardinal Otunga High School principal Dennis Muyendo from office. Muyendo, formerly of St Ignatius Mukumu Boys, replaces Zachary Nyariki who was moved to Kibabii in Bungoma county. In December, 555 principals were transferred from their home areas in what Acting Education Minister Fred Matiang’i said was aimed at delocalising the schools. In June, the TSC chief executive officer Nancy Macharia announced redeployment and transfer of schools heads across the country. The commission announced it will undertake the delocalisation programme of principals and head teachers posted in their home counties to address any case of conflict of interest.
