Akothee is the mother of five kids. Quite large for the nuclear modern family that has three at the most. But she might also be the mother of controversy, if her latest offering on social media is anything to go by. From speaking about her baby daddies to
her business empire or to how much wealth she has, she has no chills.  So
what has she done now? Well, Akothee has come out to speak out
on how nunus are supposed to be used. In her rant, she goes hard
against the haters dissing her for how she uses her sex life to
benefit her. She wrote, "If am rich because of nunu then you must be broke coz of fu**ing with wrong people upgrade your sex life and stop exchanging it for champagne! business class tickets & a lifestyle better grab some land or
just #callpolis, every woman got a pu**y between her legs that all men
are falling victims for irrespective of class & education! Idiot
