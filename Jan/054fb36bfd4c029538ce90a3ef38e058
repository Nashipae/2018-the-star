The county government has devolved garbage collection to subcounty level to deal with the menace of illegal dumping and uncollected garbage. Mohamed Dagane, the county's acting minister for Water, Environment, Energy & Natural resources, yesterday said subcounty administrators will now be responsible for garbage collection within their areas of jurisdiction. In a statement, he added that the county government has also disbanded the Anti-Dumping Unit that was based at City Hall, and the officers redeployed to the subcounties. They will be expected to report to the subcounty administrators. “Twenty garbage collection trucks will also be under the command of the subcounty bosses, with a plan for each subcounty to have two trucks and enough manpower. In the medium term, the county government has rolled out a decentralisation process for all services. The 17 subcounties will be clustered into 10 service delivery unit, each headed by a minister of the county government,” Dagane said. He appealed to creditors to be patient as it is necessary to verify the large volume of invoices received at City Hall, adding that, all pending bills amounting to Sh56 billion are being vetted and validated before money is released. Dagane called on residents with information on illegal dumping and uncollected garbage to can reach the authorities by dialing a hotline number, 0720555557. In November last year, Governor Mike Sonko ordered the county inspectorate department to arrest anyone found dumping illegally especially in the Central Business District where garbage in the back street is the norm. However, this is yet to be implemented. The minister urged the judiciary to hand down deterrent sentences on people found guilty of illegal dumping as light sentences have allowed the problem to persist.
