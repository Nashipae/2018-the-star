Three people died in a grisly road accident Saturday evening along Emali-Mombasa highway after a vehicle they were traveling in collided head-on with a bus. The accident occurred at the junction of Emali-Loitokitok road when a Chania Bus that was traveling from Mombasa to Nairobi collided with a Toyota Probox that was headed to Loitokitok. Makueni Police Commander Joseph Napeyian told the Star the three victims died on the spot and several others were taken to Makindu hospital for treatment. “What is happening is that these buses are rushing on the road to beat the time set by National Transport and Safety Authority where PSV vehicles are barred from traveling at night,” Napeyian said.
