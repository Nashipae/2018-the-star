The mystery surrounding the death of British tycoon Harry Veevers  may have deepened after a toxicologist  contradicted reports  he was poisoned using a pesticide. British toxicologist Alexander Richard told a Mombasa inquest there was no trace of the cyhalothrin pesticide on samples obtained from the body of the deceased after an autopsy. Richard, who testified through video conferencing, told principal magistrate Charles Ndegwa that after carrying out a thorough analysis of the samples brought to him, he concluded there were four possibilities why the alleged insecticide was not detected. Richard said the alleged insecticide might have been deliberately added to the samples after his death. He, however, said it was highly unlikely for the samples to have accidentally been contaminated at the lab and therefore it might have been intentionally to distort the final report.
