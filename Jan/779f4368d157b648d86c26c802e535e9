Former Kitui Governor Julius Malombe has won in his first round of election petition against Charity Ngilu. This is after the High court on Friday ordered scrutiny and recount of votes cast in the August election. The court's order is seen as the first win for Malombe where he alleges that the election was marred by irregularities and it was not fair.

"Other issues raised by the petitioner which the court agreed on were some forms 34A and 37As were not signed thus the results can't be authentic", justice Nyamweya ruled. Last week an IEBC officials told the court that some forms 37A were not signed by the presiding and deputy presiding officers, but that could not invalidate the election. Gogo Nguma who was the returning officer said some of the forms had no signatures and stamps. He said the officials may have failed to sign due to fatigue since they did not take a break while working. Governor Ngilu also testified that she won the elections free and fair and dismissed allegations by her opponent Malombe that she bribed voters. Malombe has also accused Ngilu's supporters of chasing his agents at the polling stations during the voting day.
