Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni Wamuchomba yesterday denied saying rapists should be released from jail to care for their children. Speaking in Limuru town yesterday, she accused her critics of misquoting her. “I did no say that. It is painful when people damage your image. Rape is a crime and I cannot support the release of rapists,” she told the Star. Wamuchomba had reacted to a case in which a boda boda rider in Ruiru town was arrested for raping and impregnating a 15-year-old girl. She said assets of men who lure young girls into sex should be sold and the money used to care for the children they sire. Girls and babies Wamuchomba said when some of the men who impregnant girls are convicted, young girls and babies are left to suffer. “The law should be amended to have property of convicted individuals sold off and the money used to feed, clothe and educate their children while they serve their jail term,” she said. In the Ruiru case, the suspect lured the girl in a sexual relationship by giving her lifts on his motorbike and buying her food stuff. Wamuchomba and her Mama Care Initiative visited the girl after she gave birth. The girl comes from a poor background. Sleeps on the floor “She does not have a bed and sleeps on the floor. Her mother has five children, with her last born being only seven months old. The girl told us she had consensual sex with the rider. It appears the man just wanted to use her,” Wamuchomba said. “Our investigations revealed the suspect has several boda bodas and has employed some riders,” she said. Wamuchomba said it is high time men who lure girls because of their resources or wealthy men who rape girls and are convicted, take responsibility for their children. “I will fight to the end to ensure the man takes care of the child he sired, even if he is convicted,” she said.
