Millennials have increasingly adopted a culture of saving, investing in property and real estate to amass wealth for the future A Retirement Confidence Report shows 41 per cent of millennials prioritise saving, though most do not put their money in retirement schemes in the early years. This is contrary to the general perception that millennials mostly want to consume rather than save and invest. “Over the different age units there is a gradual change in the composition of investment assets, with land contributing the larger portion for those under 30 and real estate for those between 31 and 40 years. Naturally pension assets increase with age,” Enwealth Financial Service CEO Simon Wafubwa said. He said the younger generation invests in land and real estate because of perceived high returns and lower risk compared to returns from retirement schemes. The survey was conducted by Enwealth Financial Services with Strathmore University and the Institute of Human Resource Management. It indicated that 85.4 per cent of working Kenyans fear their savings may not be enough to cater for post retirement life. The report said this shows the average Kenyan may not be able to meet their expenses soley on retirement income saved in a pension scheme. The survey also showed that the average Kenyan man saves only a third of the money he anticipates he will need in retirement. Women save half the amount they will need, the study indicated.
