A 37-year-old cyclist on Saturday went home with a cash prize of Sh100,000 after emerging
the champion in the Malindi Cycling Challenge organised by Mining CS Dan Kazungu. Cyclist Stephen Sakwanda, a
father of one, finished the 44km race from Malindi town to Weru Technical Institute in Langobaya in one hour and 30 seconds. Sakwanda said he will
use the money to open a bicycle and spare parts shop. He said
cycling has been his hobby for more than 15 years. The Malindi Cycling Challenge is the first of its kind in Malindi.  Both cyclists and motorcycle
riders participated. Each participant went home with Sh2,000. Julius Safari, a
father of three emerged the winner in the motorcycle category. He finished the stretch in 29
minutes. He went home with Sh70,000 in cash. Kazungu, who participated in the cycling challenge, did not go far as he withdrew
from the race after covering less than one kilometre. Only one girl participated
in the cycling race. During the race, two people riding motorcycles suffered minor injuries after they were involved in an accident. The first accident occurred two minutes into the competition after a rider lost
control of the motorcycle due to the high speed and fell down. He still proceeded with the race. The other accident occurred
at the rough road. The rider sustained injuries in the head. He was rushed to the hospital, where he was treated and discharged. CS Kazungu said he plans to make the event an international cycling challenge like
the renowned Tour de France.
 “We want to have our own Tour de Malindi in the near
future to attract both local and international tourists,’’ he said.
