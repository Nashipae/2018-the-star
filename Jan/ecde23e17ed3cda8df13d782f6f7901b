The High Court has dismissed a petition challenging the election of Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi and Deputy Governor John Mwaniki. Nanyuki High Court Judge Mary Kasango dismissed the petition with costs to the petitioners. Kasango said most of the allegations by petitioner Sammy Ndung’u could not be proved. She ordered Ndung’u to pay Sh12 million as damages to Muriithi, the IEBC, county returning officer Agnes Mutisya and the deputy governor. “In the final analysis, I find that the election complied with the law and the provisions of the Constitution,” Kasango said.
