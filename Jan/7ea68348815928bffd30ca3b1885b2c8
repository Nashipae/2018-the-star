 An Anti-corruption case against eight traffic police officers accused of soliciting funds on the Nakuru-Eldoret highway yesterday failed to kick off once again. The case was adjourned by chief magistrate Josephat Burudi after the prosecution said it had not acquired the death certificate of one the accused who is now deceased.  The eight police officers who were arrested while soliciting bribes on the Nakuru-Eldoret highway are yet to take plea since their arrest on October 30, 2014 after a sting operation by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission officers. Through their lawyer David Mongeri, they urged the court to defer the plea since one of his clients died last year at the Aga Khan University Hospital in Kisumu and the family is yet to obtain his death certificate to avail before court as evidence.  The eight, Beldine Ngome, Raban Gikonyo, Peter Gachie, David Kantian, Esther Wadia, Arthor Hamed, John Mikhail, David Murai, Muriu Gikonyo and Muthira Gachie had unsuccessfully moved to the High Court to stop their prosecution in 2015, but their application was dismissed due to lack of an arguable case. The accused had moved to the High Court seeking orders to bar the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) from charging them with abuse of office. They were part of a team manning a road block.
