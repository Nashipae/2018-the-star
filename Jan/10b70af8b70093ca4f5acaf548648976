A couple were arrested in Samburu on Tuesday for allegedly conning residents out of their money, claiming they could help them raise school fees. The 30-year-old man and his wife were apprehended at night in Lkuroto area of Samburu central. They were accused of collecting money and promising people in the constituency that a local NGO would help them. "They had been asking for a copy of the ID card and Sh200, as registration, and promising that the office of the area MP and a local organisation would pay for their children's school fees and offer a dairy cow to each family," area OCPD Abagaro Guyo said on Wednesday. Guyo said the man and wife had promised to get residents Sh10,000 for school fees by pretending they were representatives from the office of MP Naisula Lesuuda. The OCPD told reporters that the suspects were taken to Maralal police station and will be arraigned once investigations are completed. He asked those who had sent them money to record statements. Money was sent to the suspects' phones by M-Pesa  after they were confiscated by police. The police boss did not reveal the amount of money the suspects had collected before they were arrested. Guyo urged the public not to give anyone money in exchange for help and noted the legislator's office and the NGO offer aid for free. Click here for the latest political news
