Ndichu Wainaina/A man was killed and a second seriously injured when part of a quarry in Ol Kalou collapsed and buried them on Friday. They were excavating stones. David Akilamani, 35, was pronounced dead on arrival at JM Memorial Hospital where he and Haron Mwangi, 42, were rushed by colleagues after the 9am incident. Mwangi said they arrived at the site at 7am . “There is a place we climb using ropes and then use nails and mallet to break the rocks,which we then cut into building stones,” he said. Mwangi said while he was working he felt some soil fall on him from the top of the cliff. He looked up to see a massive rock rolling down, taking him with it. He said his friend was instantly buried under the soil and stones. Mwangi said Akilamani’s brother was among the first to rescue him, not knowing his brother had been buried. An X-ray exam revealed his left leg had cracked at the ankle. He was transferred to Ol Kalou Catholic dispensary. Quarry workers said accidents have been occurring at the site but this was the first fatal one. James Kariuki said sometimes when they go to break the big rocks “they go down with you. People fall, but no one has ever died”. “We don’t know what happened. I saw rocks rolling down. The man up there was brought down and thrown on the rocks.The other was buried,” said Elijah Kinungi, a second quarry worker.
