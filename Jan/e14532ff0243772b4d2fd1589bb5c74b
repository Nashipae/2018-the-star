Two Migori MPs have broken constituency bursary committees and constituted others in polling stations to increase transparency. Uriri MP Mark Nyamita and his Rongo counterpart Paul Abuor want to do things differently from their predecessors John Kobado and Dalmas Otieno. Nyamita said calls for bursary applications ran for close to two months and ended on January 5. About 4,500 applicants applied for funds for secondary, college and university fees. “Constituency level committees will never represent the entire constituency and won’t be able to give feedback at the grassroots level,” Nyamita said. The new method will involve applicants being sorted out at each polling centre and vetting of beneficiaries will be done in open with public participation - residents will pick the most-deserving students. “This way we will stop cases where connected applicants can get bursaries across all ward, constituency and ward funds. It will also minimise corruption,” Nyamita said.
