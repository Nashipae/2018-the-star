Wildlife numbers are increasing thanks to conservation and fighting poaching but a shrinking habitat still threatens their existence. Securing more space for wildlife in their ecosystems is a major problem. Last month, Environment CS Judi Wakhungu said shrinking habitat “remains a major challenge”. “The elephant population is increasing but the habitat is decreasing because of human settlements and so on.  “If we could increase the dispersal and migration and also increase the corridors, then the prospects for elephant population increasing is even better,” Wakhungu said on December 22 at the Kenya Wildlife Service headquarters.

Wakhungu said the increase of elephant population by 2.6 per cent every year is as a result of the work by the KWS and other partners.  A recent census shows the population of wildlife in the major ecosystems has significantly increased. Within Laikipia-Samburu-Meru-Marsabit ecosystems, there has been a 12 per cent increase of elephants between 2012 and 2017. This represents about a 2.4 per cent annual increase. The aerial survey of elephants, buffaloes and giraffes in the ecosystem was carried out between November 19 and December 2. During the census, 7,347 elephants were counted, compared to 6,454 in 2012. In the Laikipia-Samburu ecosystem, some 7,166 elephants were counted, while 181 were counted in Marsabit. This is in comparison to 6,365 elephants counted in the Laikipia-Samburu ecosystem in 2012 and 89 in Marsabit. Elephants in Marsabit have increased by 51 per cent. There was an increase of 11 per cent in the Laikipia-Samburu ecosystem, translating to an annual increase of 2.2 per cent between 2012 and 2017. Seventy-six elephants carcasses were recorded during the survey. Seventy five per cent of the carcasses were classified as ‘very old’, while 25 per cent were ‘old’. No fresh carcasses were found.
