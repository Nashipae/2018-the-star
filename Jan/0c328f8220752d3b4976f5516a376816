Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i has denied allegations by the Standard that a minister is having an affair with a young member of his church where he also serves as an elder. The newspaper did not name the cabinet secretary. But in a letter on Thursday, Interior communications director Mwenda Njoka called for the retraction of the story and an apology in seven days. "In an article previously published in your newspaper, you have used adjectives such as 'no-nonsense, outspoken and strong Christian' to describe CS Matiang'i. It is for this reason that we have reason to believe the CS your article was disparagingly referring to is Matiang'i,” reads the demand letter to the editorial director. Mwenda said the article contained unsubstantiated claims that were not accompanied by "a shred of evidence". “The net effect was to defame and vilify an innocent public servant in the eyes of his peers, family, and right thinking members of the public." The article says the women the minister is having an affair with is a soloist in the church choir. He has allegedly bought a house for her within the city. The alleged affair came to light after the woman's mother and the CS's wife reportedly got wind of it. The wife is said to have confronted the girl's mother, forcing his lover to confirm the accusation which has shocked most of the church members. Click here for the latest political news
