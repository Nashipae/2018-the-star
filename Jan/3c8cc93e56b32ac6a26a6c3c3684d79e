Low-cost airline Jambojet will start double daily flights to Uganda on February 15 as part of its regional expansion plans. The airline will operate two daily flights between Nairobi and Entebbe with an introductory ticket price of Sh11, 330 for a one-way ticket. "We are going international. Fly to Entebbe," the budget carrier said via Twitter on Monday. The daily flights with depart from JKIA at 9.10 am and 5.30 pm. The flight will depart Entebbe Airport for Nairobi at 11 am and 7.20 pm daily. Jambojet currently flies an average of 50,000 passengers per month. On Friday, the airline announced plans to fly to Wajir. Last year, the budget carrier expected government approval to start flying to destinations outside the country. The airline, fully owned by national carrier Kenya Airways, was established in 2014 to cater to local travellers by offering low-cost fares of as little as 3,200 shillings ($30.99) one way. Jambojet, which carried 600,000 passengers last year using a fleet of Boeing 737s and Bombardier Q-400 planes, will consider possible international destinations after it gets approval, CEO Willem Hondius said.
