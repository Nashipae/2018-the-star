 Kitui Tourism executive Patrick Koki ,alias Kuvasila, has said the county will build a stadium to host international games and nurture talent. Speaking at Nguutani during the Nguna Cup final, Koki said staging frequent tournaments would help in identifying talent.  Nguna Cup was sponsored by Mwingi West MP Charles Nguna.  “We have talented youth who can play in international leagues,” added Koki. He said there would be an ambulance on standby during village tournaments. Injured players will be treated free of charge. He called upon players to put more effort in sports, saying the tournaments will help them keep fit as well as keeping off  bad company and drug abuse.  Koki added that the county administration would invite NACADA to talk to the youth on the dangers of drug abuse.   He said the county is rolling out plans to plant more trees and grass in  playing grounds.  I’m urging all of us to make sure we plant trees around the fields and grass.  It’s not good for playing grounds to have rough surfaces, since players can easily be injured,” added Koki. Nguna  said the tournament has attracted 93 teams in the last 15 years.  He said youth talent has been nurtured and more needs to be done for gifted players to advance their careers. Nguna  assured the youth the county government is fully involved and is committed to building a stadium in Kitui, Mutomo and Mwingi  for young people to get decent playing grounds. Nguna said the winning teams will be awarded. He promised  the youngsters more goodies.
