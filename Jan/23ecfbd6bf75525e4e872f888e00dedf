Akothee has laid bare her vulnerabilities by asking her current bae, Nelly Oaks, if he would still want her when things get tough. The Baby Daddy singer mused, "Baby now you are chasing me alone. When the baby comes, I hope you will still have the same energy to chase us while laughing the way we are now and not me chasing you while crying, and when you decide to take me to court!" Here are some interesting reactions from her fans. Ancle Elias: Welcome in Kenya where husbands at 59 are called baby where there son's at 9 are called baba. Johnie John: Kama mama ndie amechanganyikiwa na kukip one man in presence of her adolescent girls, hao watoto watajuaje kukip one man wen mum has set precedence of the larger the number the better the life. Albright Reid: Haha akothee yawa you want to be mother Abraham. But so long as resources ziko who am I to go against you? Do your thing sibuoress #yourlifemyentertainment. Elijah Mwendwa: Akothee yawa! You want to make a football club? Pregnant again? Spare me alive.
