Kwale residents are protesting the lack of water for the last two months, yet they are still receiving bills. Resident Abdallah Mwatenye yesterday said the Kwale Water and Sewerage Company has been sending them bills yet they lack water.. “There is no water yet bills are coming, what are they for? Are you taking us for fools,” he said. He threatened not to pay his bills unless the firm provides water. “I will not give you a single penny, come and disconnect your pipes,” he said angrily. On social media, residents attacked the firm, accusing it of failing. They asked officials resign and make way for other people to do the job. They asked Governor Salim Mvurya to intervention and end their suffering. “We are using untreated water. Please, our governor, come to our aid. We are suffering,” Mwanamisi Omari, from Tsimba, said. Residents now rely on water points and rivers that are far away. Vendors are charging Sh100 for a 20 litre jerrican. The water firm’s technical manager, Swalehe Chidzuga, told the Star on the phone they will settle the issue. He said the water crisis is caused by lack of power. ” Kenya Power disconnected electricity because the company owes them. We are struggling to settle the bill. We assure our customers water will be restored,” he said. On water bills, residents were told to present their complaints to the commercial manager to sought out the problem.
