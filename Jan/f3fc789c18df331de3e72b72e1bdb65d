Financial services firm Enwealth has granted seven students from different counties with scholarships to facilitate their secondary school education. The beneficiaries, picked from across the country, were selected
through a competitive process based
on performance and needy backgrounds. The  selected students will be part of 50 other
students already absorbed  in the
Enwealth Fanisi’s scholarship programme that commenced in 2011 as part of the
pensions administration company’s community development plan which was designed
to grow wealth and take care of the community. “En-wealth as a financial firm
aims at investing in youth to secure their future prosperity, stability and
growth and empower them to have a cutting edge to compete in the stiff Kenyan
and global labor market,” managing director Simon Wafubwa said
during the award ceremony. The social security financial service provider was founded in 2011. Wafubwa added
that through the scholarship program Enwealth aims at having a foundation sponsoring 1,000
students to improve lives of less fortunate people residing in rural regions of the
country and elevate them to be at par with other citizens and help them realize
their role in the society.
