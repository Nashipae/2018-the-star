The Judicial Service Commission has accused the SRC of usurping its mandate by capping its sittings. In response to a suit filed against the Salaries and Remuneration Commission, the JSC says restricting its sittings to not more than eight per month interferes with its mandate and constitutional independence. The JSC also arguesÂ  capping its remunerable sittings is unconstitutional. JSC sittings were reduced in December 2013, in a process that saw the agency review perks of all state officers. But according to jucial commission, it is a policy making institution, whose function should not be interfered with. The case came up for hearing yesterday but did not proceed as one of the lawyers was taken ill and another was handling an election petition at the Court of Appeal. Justice Chacha Mwita directed parties to appear before him on May 7. Click here for the latest political news
