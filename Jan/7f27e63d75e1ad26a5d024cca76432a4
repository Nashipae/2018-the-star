Some Borana community leaders from Isiolo and Marsabit counties have urged President Uhuru Kenyatta not to retain Sports CS Hassan Wario. They said Wario’s performance is below standard. The leaders want Uhuru to replace him with another qualified person from the region when he unveils members of his cabinet to serve in his second term. Isiolo Civil Society Organisations chairman Daud Tari and former County Council chairman Hussein Abduba hit out at some Borana community leaders who earlier said they support Wario’s reinstatement. They accused them of misleading the public on the CS’s performance. They spoke on Wednesday during a press conference in Isiolo town. This new development could impact negatively on CS Wario’s quest for a second term as a cabinet secretary. He comes from a community divided regarding his reappointment. Tari accused the CS of playing a major role in the Rio scandal that hugely affected Kenyan athletes during the Olympic games.  “ Wario ashamed the entire nation and the northern region he was appointed to represent.The CS has not been involved in any local development projects. He has not sold government policies to the residents in the two counties,” Tari said. He urged the President to choose another community representative from the people he has been working with, someone who will have a positive impact on the national and local platform.  Apart from the Cabinet Secretary position, the Borana community is also lobbying for other positions such as PS, high commissioners, heads of parastatals and board directors. “More than 80 per cent of the people of Marsabit county voted for Jubilee, while Isiolo people have been supporting the previous and current government since Independence,” Tari said.
