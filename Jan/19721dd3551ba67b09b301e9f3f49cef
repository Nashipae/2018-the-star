The Court in Kangundo has acquitted one of the suspects charged with the murder of late University of Nairobi lecture Professor Stephen Nzuve. Cyrus Mutunga was on Friday set free after the court found no evidence to link him to the murder. Presiding judge Desderious Orima said there was no evidence incriminating the suspect, “Police tracking devices established that the accused was in Eldoret on the date the professor was murdered in cold blood.” Read: Four deny killing UoN lecturer, remanded until January 11 “This makes it impossible for the accused to have been involved in the murder,” Orima said. Professor Nzuve was shot dead by thugs at his rural home in Tala,  Matungulu Sub County on December 12, 2015. Police said the gang escaped with three laptops, an unknown amount of money and other valuables. The accused had been charged alongside three others, Ronald Ngula, Dominic Mutua and Stephen Irungu. The court stated that Irungu and Mutua will continue with the case since they were found in possession of some property belonging to the deceased. They were also charged with using violence to rob Nzuve’s wife, Rose Musembi, of three mobile phones and a wedding ring, all worth Sh150,000.  Click here for the latest political news
