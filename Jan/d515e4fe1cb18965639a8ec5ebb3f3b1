A night guard was killed after a vehicle he was sleeping under in Longonot trading centre, Naivasha, ran over him. The sleepy village was in shock as police moved in to collect the body following the bizarre incident on Friday morning. Witness Sammy Kiragu said the security man was guarding several trucks when the incident happened. Kiragu said there were reports he was drunk when he slept under a trailer. “He slept there for some time. The driver came never checked at the back and ran him over as he left,” Kiragu said. He said people shouted to alert the driver to stop, but he never heard them. The security man died on the spot. “It is common practice for guards to sleep in this area because of the cold. This is very unfortunate incident,” he said. The body was taken to Naivasha Subcounty Hospital mortuary.
