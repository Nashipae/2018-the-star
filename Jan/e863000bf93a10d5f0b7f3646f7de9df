A family in Nakuru has called for speedy investigations into the death of 28-year-old Ben Kuria who is said to have drowned at a hotel swimming pool on Sunday. Kuria was a counselor at the John Mututho Empowerment Centre on the Pipeline Estate in Nakuru. He reportedly drowned after a gym session at the hotel. A postmortem on Tuesday revealed that the deceased had injuries on the back, with the county pathologist indicating there is a probability he died due to the injuries that affected the flow of blood. Addressing media at Umash Funeral Home on Tuesday where the family of the deceased had gathered, former Nacada chairman John Mututho, whom Kuria worked for at Jomec, said he was murdered. “It is time now we upgrade our CID to the likes of FBI because so many people are dying but the investigations done are shallow. Until we respect life in its entirely, we shall we continue losing our loved ones,” he said.
