Three bright boys in Kajiado who sat for their KCPE examination last year may not join form one for lack of fees. The three; Michael Ndungu,14, scored 384 marks and secured admission at Oloolaiser Boys Secondary School together with Simon Kiarie, 13, who scored 371 marks.

The three sat for their exam at Nkama Primary School in Loitokitok. Teacher Irene Oilepo, who alerted the Star about the plight of the boys, said the three were very hardworking but their future is bleak because their parents could not afford to pay for their studies in high school. “As a teacher in Nkama Primary School, I want to take this opportunity to appeal to sponsors out there to help these boys,” Oliepo said. The teacher said she feels saddened that such young souls are still at home when the majority of their colleagues have joined secondary schools. “In fact, one of them has come back to school to seek admission in class eight, saying he has nowhere to go,” the teacher said.
