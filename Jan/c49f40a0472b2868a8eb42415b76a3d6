 Lobby groups will monitor county governments to ensure they crack down on shisha dens outlawed by the Health ministry last week. The groups say the counties must support the ban to stop the rising cases of non-communicable diseases like cancer and heart problems caused by tobacco and narcotics. Kenya Tobacco Control Alliance, the umbrella body for all tobacco control lobbies, said the ban is evidence-based and in line with the WHO recommendations. “Health is now a devolved function. The Ministry of Health makes policies, but counties must implement them. We are watching the counties,” Ketca chairman Joel Gitali. He praised Health CS Dr Cleopa Mailu, saying prevention of diseases is a key function of the ministry. “When shisha victims are being treated for cancer and heart diseases the sellers don’t demand to be consulted, why should they be consulted when the CS moves to prevent these diseases?” Gitali said. International Institute for Legislative Affairs, a legal think-tank based in Nairobi, called for total ban across East Africa. “Currently, only Burundi and South Sudan, which is not a full member, have not banned Shisha. They should do so with speed to prevent smuggling across the border,” said IILA CEO Emma Wanyonyi. Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda have also banned Shisha but Uganda is notable for lack of enforcement.    Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda have also banned Shisha, but Uganda is notable for lack of enforcement. Wanyonyi urged county governments to enorce the ban and the existing tobacco control laws. “Shisha has been used to also incorporate other hard drugs like marijuana and cocaine and a ban across East Africa will help stop smuggling of these drugs as well,” she said. Mailu said the ban was among the new preventive measures being rolled out to help Kenya achieve universal health coverage.
