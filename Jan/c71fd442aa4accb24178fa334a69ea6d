Yesterday Raila Odinga swore himself in as the People's President of the Republic of Kenya, an honorific title with no legal status. After promising to seal off Uhuru Park, the state intelligently changed tack at the last minute and allowed Raila's supporters to assemble. As a result, it passed off quietly without incident. This was a smart tactical victory for government. But then they tried to block live coverage of the swearing in. Various channels for KTN, NTV and Citizen were disconnected. But the signal from Uhuru Park kept being broadcast on the KTN website, Citizen's Viusasa platform and the Nigerian channel Arise on DSTV. So the government failed to block TV coverage of Raila's swearing in but still managed to discredit itself. This was a lose-lose outcome for the government. In the digital age, governments can no longer completely block live coverage. There are just too many outlets. The government should just have let the TV stations broadcast Raila's swearing in. It was no big deal and people would have soon moved on.
