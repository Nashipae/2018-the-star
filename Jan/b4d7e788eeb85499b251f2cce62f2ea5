The Kitui county returning officer has told a court that voting in the governor’s election was mainly done manually. Gogo Nguma(pictured) said there were no pre-cast votes as alleged by former Governor Julius Malombe’s agents. He was testifying in a petition in which Malombe is challenging Governor Charity Ngilu’s victory. Nguma told justice Pauline Nyamweya he received complaints that some Wiper Party agents were chased away from polling stations. He said the allegations were not true since his officers investigated the claims. He said the election was peaceful and presiding officers were told that if there was intimidation, violence or irregularities in a polling station, voting would be stopped.

He said he was aware of accusations that some agents did not sign Forms 37A. However, he said it was only one per cent. Yesterday, statistics expert Martin Musembi said the IEBC forms in some polling stations had no stamps and signatures, as Wiper agents were chased away from polling centres. He analysed the forms and some of them did not tally, he said. Malombe has accused Ngilu of bribing voters to win the August 8 General Election.
