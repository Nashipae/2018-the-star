A lawyer in the petition challenging the election of Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has claimed his life is in danger. Kiplimo Langat claimed he was harassed after testifying in the case. He has since obtained court orders restraining police from harassing him. Langat said he and his family members had received threats from Mutua and unknown people. Addressing journalists at the Milimani Law Courts yesterday, Langat said he had recorded a statement with the police and IPOA over the threats. He also asked the Law Society of Kenya to intervene and ensure his life as a professional lawyer is protected. “The threats l have been receiving have paralysed my profession since l can’t represent my clients in court because l fear for my life,” Langat said. The High Court has since restrained police from intimidating Langat, pending the hearing and determination of the application he has filed over his role in commissioning the affidavits in the petition against Mutua. The orders dated December 18, 2017 were issued by justice Roselyn Aburili. Aburili ordered the lawyer to serve the respondents and all parties involved in the petition. Langat said a police officer and Flying Squad officers from Chumvi police station stormed his residence and harassed him on the day he testified in the petition hearing. The officers stormed his bedroom, blocked his wife from entering the room, took pictures of the premises and warned of dire consequences.
