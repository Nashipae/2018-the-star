Gone are the days when Kenyans were scared of being labeled gay or lesbian. This is according to upcoming nude art photography model Purple Bloom. The beauty says "these days people are open-minded about the issue, so there’s really no one on my side who’s treated me differently or criticised me". Bloom says she encounters people who try to persuade her to be a certain way, but she feels that gender should not be a barrier to dating. "People say I’m too pretty to date the same sex and that I should try them first. However, I'm not gender-biased; I think sexuality is fluid, so whoever I find myself connected to, I go with the flow," she says.
