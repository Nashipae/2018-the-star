Shaffie Weru has a very flashy lifestyle, and he's never shied away from flaunting what he has worked tirelessly to achieve. The radio presenter has a thing for powerful machines, and you will always spot him driving the best of the best. Many of us are literally crying because of how broke we are, but this does not apply to everyone. Well, Shaffie has acquired a brand new Range Rover Vogue, which he calls 'bae' because "I'm single and that's the only thing getting my attention now." Speaking to Word Is, he said he's not affected by the Njaanuary trend because he works hard and plays even harder. "Njaanworry is a myth to the Raverend. I work hard and play even harder. I don’t work to only party or buy sh*t in specific months... My life is a constant roller coaster," he said. Before he bought this new whip, he was driving a Land Rover Discovery. When asked what happened to the old whip he said, "That’s Nia's (daughter's) school bus!" Shaffie also has a thing for speed bikes, and of late he's not been riding his monster machine. So what happened to it? "I gave my speed bike to my kid bro who turned 30! Plus I have new Quod/All-Terrain Bike. Before I turn 40, I would want to drive a Bentley Bentyga or G 63 AmG." In other news, Radio and Television Personalities Awards (RTP Awards) has nominated Adelle and Shaffie in The Morning in honour and recognition of the exemplary service and dedication they have contributed to the radio and TV sector.
