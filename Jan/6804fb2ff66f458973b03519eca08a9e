Parents stormed a school in Kakamega county yesterday demanding the school head be transferred for mass failure in examinations. Parents protested against Ekambuli Secondary School principal Noah Akali. They said he has stayed in the school for more than 10 years and the school has posted dismal results in the period. The school in the last year examination posted a mean grade of D- of 2.5 points, a drop from 2.7 in 2016. The results left the school second-last among 23 schools in the subcounty, a position parents say has become the norm. The principal was forced to flee as the parents broke the school gate to demand his immediate transfer. Ekambuli, one of the oldest schools in Kakamega county, was started in 1965 as a missionary centre. Both infrastructure and academic performance have deteriorated over the years. Parent Joel Anyanga said the school started posting poor results when Akali took over. Akali said teachers do their best.
