A woman locked herself, her husband and their young son in their Maragua home and set it on fire on Sunday morning after the couple had a big fight. Doris Miriam, 19, padlocked the door at 2am, hid the key, poured paraffin around the house and the couple’s mattress and set it on fire. Earlier in the night she had quarrelled with her husband Daniel Mwangi, 30. Neighbours in Methi village heard the couple’s three-year-old screaming, broke down the door and rushed the three to hospital. “We later received reports that the two [Miriam and Mwangi] had passed away shortly after they were admitted at Kenyatta National Hospital,” Mwangi’s grandmother Beth Nyambura said. FIND A BETTER WAY The child is still admitted in hospital but in stable condition. Maragua OCPD John Onditi said preliminary investigations show Miriam lit the fire in an attempt to kill her family. Ondito said the young couple had been constantly fighting and on Sunday, they had had a particularly big one before going to bed. He urged couples to come up with better ways of solving their differences instead of killing their spouses and children. Since last year 20 such murders have been reported in Murang’a. “It is unfortunate that people can resort to such devastating actions over disagreements in their homes,” Onditi said. MOST FOUL On January 18 Josphat Karanja locked his wife Millicent Murugi and their nine-year-old son in their home in Kambwe village, Kiharu, poured petrol in it and set it on fire. Neighbours rescued the two before the house was engulfed in flames. They said the couple was always fighting and they had briefly separated before the fire. On January 4, last year Charles Kang’ethe, 28, hacked his wife Purity after a spat in Kandara subcounty. Click here for the latest political news
