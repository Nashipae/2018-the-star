Former Nakumatt employees have teamed up and opened a supermarket in Kondele, Kisumu. Lemigo Dala Supermarket was officially opened on Friday in an event presided over by Deputy Governor Mathews Owili. Owili said the outlet will encourage other residents to invest in similar ventures. He said they will ensure the county is conducive to investment and promote economic growth. “The opening of this supermarket by the young focussed team of professionals and the choice of location is a testament that Kisumu is the investment destination of choice,” Owili said. Ben Olang’ — one of the seven directors of the supermarket — said he and his partners worked for Nakumatt for about 20 years and felt they had gained enough experience to set up their own retail store. The ailing Nakumatt has closed nearly 20 branches, as creditors and suppliers moved in to recover their cash. The new supermarket has recruited the bulk of its employees from the closed Nakumatt Kisumu branch.
