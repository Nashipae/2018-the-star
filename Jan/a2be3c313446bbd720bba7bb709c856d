Polycarp Igathe’s resignation as Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko’s deputy took effect yesterday after behind-the-scenes attempts to reunite them failed. Igathe’s resignation notice issued on January 11 expired at 1pm yesterday. Senior Jubilee politicians have been attempting to arbitrate between the two leaders, but talks hit a snag after Igathe said goodbye to residents via Twitter, just an hour to the expiry of his notice.

It was not immediately clear about what the former Vivo Energy MD would be advising Sonko. Igathe’s phone was off. Sonko’s office promised to issue a statement on Igathe’s resignation, but this did not happen by press time. His former City Hall office remained open yesterday. Secretaries attached to the office were at work.
