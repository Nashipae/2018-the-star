Sometimes government can be excessively bureaucratic. The National Transport and Safety Authority has decreed that driving licences have to be renewed annually for nine years and after 10 years drivers will have to undergo another competence test and a medical examination ( see P10). Drivers over 60 years will now have a medical test every year. This looks like a kneejerk reaction to the horrible death toll of 330 Kenyans on the roads in last December alone. Today driving licences are renewed for three years at a time. Making it every year just creates work for nothing. If someone recklessly causes an accident, their driving licence can be cancelled immediately. Why should drivers over 60 have a time-consuming medical every year?  Older drivers tend to be slower and therefore safer. Most accidents involve younger aggressive drivers, especially in matatus. The biggest reason behind accidents is that many vehicles are in dangerous mechanical condition with missing lights, loose steering and poor brakes. The NTSA is creating unnecessary bureaucracy that will solve nothing.   Quote of the day: "In view of the fact that God limited the intelligence of man, it seems unfair that He did not also limit his stupidity." - German chancellor Konrad Adenauer was born on 5 January, 1876
