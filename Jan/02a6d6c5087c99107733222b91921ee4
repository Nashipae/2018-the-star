Who knew gospel singer Janet Otieno could make a great marriage counsellor? The 'Napokea Kwako' singer, who just dropped a new jam, 'Amka Ucheze' featuring Weezdom, opened up about her 20-year marriage to Alfred Otieno. "I have been married for 20 years now, and I can say that marriage life is sweet. I would not speak about anyone's marriage because I totally understand that there are challenges and it's a normal thing that can be solved," Janet said. "All I can say is God has been gracious to me, and so far, I wouldn't say I have experienced anything bad in my marriage life." The mother of three, who is a strong believer of respect, communication, love and trust in any relationship, went further to offer priceless words of wisdom for millions of married couples out there who are struggling with marital challenges. "In marriage, remember you meet someone completely differently from you someone who was born with different qualities and behaviours, so don't expect the two of you to always be in sync on everything," she said. "Marriage is all about getting to understand your partner. What does he or she like or dislike? Another crucial thing is communication, because we all have different understanding, and in most cases, that's where many arguments are brewed. Nothing beats the power of communication in marriage. "Also, I believe that the number-one principle in marriage is communication, since it carries many things in it. It carries love and when you love each other, you know how to communicate."
