Mercy Cherono has been branded the hottest female athlete in Kenya. She wed Edmond Ng'etich last year in January at a colourful traditional wedding held at Kipajit village, Bomet county. A few months into her marriage, the bliss was gone and Mercy's union was on the rocks. “We were having a lot of quarrels and fights. We would create something big from nothing and we would go for days without talking. My husband had a child with another woman and it was very hard for me. The baby mama used to disturb us with many calls every time,” she said. But now, it seem the love has grown and the couple's relationship is on the mend. She is expecting her first child. The photo of Mercy flaunting her baby bump has gone viral. It is not clear when the couple will be expecting their little tot.
