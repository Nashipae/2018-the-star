Kenyan attacking sensation Michael Olunga who plies his trade with Spanish side Girona FC on Saturday became the first ever player to score a hat trick in LaLiga for the club. Olunga also became the second Kenyan player to score a Spanish top flight goal in the game where Girona FC thrashed Las Palmas 6-0. The Harambee Stars forward netted the goals in a span of 22 minutes to help the newly promoted side to ninth position on the league table with 26 points. His goals came in the 57th, 70th and 79th minute at the 13,500-capacity Montilivi stadium. Olunga’s historical feat comes after a prolonged period of warming the bench for the better part of the final stretch of 2017. Prior to Saturday’s stellar performance, Olunga grabbed headlines on September 4 last year when he netted a brace in a friendly match against C.F Ripoll. The game ended 8-0 in Olunga’s debut appearance for Girona FC. The former Gor Mahia strike switched to Girona on September 1, 2017 on a season-long loan move from Chinese side Guizhou Zhicheng where he had been relegated to a reserve team. Olunga is the second Kenyan after McDonald Mariga to play in La Liga. Click here for the latest political news
