Chief magistrate Bildad Ochieng’ issued the warrant after Oparanya failed to appear for the hearing. “The defence counsel has failed to give a sufficient explanation as to the absence of the first accused. I hereby issue arrest warrant to compel him to appear in court,” he said. Ochieng said 10 other accused in the case were in court ready for the hearing, but Oparanya did not show up, despite his lawyers being present. Click here for the latest political stories
