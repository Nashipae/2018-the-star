Trans Nzoia Deputy Governor Stanley Tarus has asked the Senate to hasten laws that will outline and clearly define the role of deputy county chiefs to avoid conflicts between them and their bosses. Tarus said the resignation of Polycarp Igathe was regrettable but also served as a wake-up call on the need to have clear laws regulating the replacement of deputy governors.

It’s a key position in the county and should have legally defined roles," Tarus said on Tuesday. He also wants the current governors and deputies to avoid political conflicts that may undermine stability and growth in the devolved administrative units. Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has already said he will table an amendment bill in the Senate on the position of Deputy Governors and succession within the counties. "We need such laws very fast and we fully support the proposed amendment bill being pushed by Senator Murkomen so that we streamline such issues," Tarus said. Igathe resigned saying he had failed to attract the trust of Governor Sonko to serve in the county. However, Tarus said the county chiefs should focus on unity and deliver to the public instead of engaging in political battles that will only create divisions in the regions. "Its too early to start fights within the counties when members of the public area waiting for us to deliver services we promised just three month ago," he said. More on this: Courageous or cowardly?
