Rally aces have much to celebrate as the 2017 Kenya National Rally Championship embarks on the season finale at this weekend’s Fly540 KMSC Rally. Two-time Group ‘S’ rally champion Jasmeet Chana will take on outgoing 2WD champion Eric Bengi in a Mitsubishi/Subaru shootout. Minesh Rathod and Issa Amwari in R4 Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 10 will also renew their rivalry. Rathod hopes to cement second overall position in the KNRC Division 2 in the absence of Tash Tundo, who will skip the rally for personal reasons. The 2017 KNRC has been to Eldoret, the ARC Safari Rally in Rift Valley, Nakuru last December and Kajiado. Nanyuki Rally wasn’t held this year due to farm invasions which compelled Nanyuki Rally Group to declare it a force majure on safety grounds. Jasmeet Chana aka Iceman will be fighting to secure second position on the 2017 KNRC Division 1 log in Kajiado and Lisa Farm this weekend. In an interview Chana said: “We are eagerly waiting for the last event of the 2017 to see if we can fight for second position in our division. “Preps are on course despite having had a lot of issues in Nakuru from a broken exhaust manifold to loss of 5th gear and engine wiring gremlins. “My sibling navigator Ravi has done a good job the whole season and kept me on my tracks so we expect more from him going into 2018. Rallying is a hobby and I always try to enjoy it to the fullest.” The weekend’s rally which counts towards KNRC 8 will start in Kajiado and end in Lisa Farm area in Makueni county near Mombasa/Nairobi highway. The event initially slated for November was pushed to January due to torrential rains pounding the route course then.
