MANY Kenyans are wondering whether US Ambassador to Kenya Robert Godec is playing neutral and has goodwill in settling the political impasse between the NASA and Jubilee leaderships. There was uproar yesterday when Godec resolved to meet National Assembly Minority Leader John Mbadi in private, away from the glare of media coverage. The envoy's move to hold a closed-door meeting with Mbadi raised eyebrows over his sincerity on the dialogue calls. Last week, he met Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka and Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen in the full glare of the media. He has been taken to task to come clean on his position as far as mediation talks are concerned.  ***************** SOME leaders from the Gema community are concerned that Devolution Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri’s name is missing in the first list of ministers retained by President Uhuru Kenyatta. They were overheard at a Karatina hotel saying that Kiunjuri is not only a senior politician in the region, but also shelved his gubernatorial ambitions as a show of respect to the President. They say he traversed all parts of the country to campaign for Jubilee and deserves a seat at the high table. ***************** THE rate at which the Directorate of Immigration and Registration of Persons is issuing new work permits to foreigners expected to take up jobs that can be done by locals is worrying. A concerned junior employee at the directorate told Corridors that, in most instances, “orders are issued from above”. The employee said no one keeps track of the foreigners and some end up doing unknown business in this country. The official is now appealing to the new CS for Interior and Co-ordination of National Government Fred Matiang’i to fix the directorate. ****************** A section of residents in Kirinyaga are questioning the criteria used to rank their county boss, Anne Waiguru, among the country's top performing governors. Some have confided to Corridors that 100 days into office, the county residents continue to suffer from poor healthcare services, dilapidated roads, scarcity of clean water and unemployment. They claim little has been achieved since Waiguru took office. ******************* IS NASA leader Raila Odinga playing diversionary tactics with his supporters over his swearing-in ceremony? Due to prolonged anxiety, some of his supporters have severally attempted to persuade him to take the oath using the Bible. But Raila, who has kept his supporters waiting for the ceremony and assuring them that it is in the offing, has rejected the persuasion. “Swearing-in is not just about holding the Bible and taking an oath, it is more than that”, he told supporters recently.
