Defence lawyers in robbery with violence case against former Mungiki leader Maina Njenga and three others have accused the prosecution of delaying the trial. When the case came up for a mention before Milimani magistrate Martha Mutuku yesterday, defence lawyers – led by Evans Ondieki – said the prosecution is deliberately delaying the trial by failing to avail witnesses. The lawyers told the court the prosecution has been frustrating the case by making several applications for adjournment. But the magistrate directed the case be mentioned again on January 21 so that a hearing date can be fixed. Earlier, the parties had agreed the case should proceed to full hearing since the main complainant failed to withdraw the charges against the accused persons. In a letter to former DPP Keriako Tobiko, complainant Joseph Thuo had sought to have the case withdrawn. But the DPP rejected the withdrawal of the case. Thuo in a sworn affidavit had said he had reflected and in order to promote peace and reconciliation, he wanted to withdraw the case on his own volition. "I hereby humbly request the honourable court to permit the withdrawal of this suit and acquit the accused persons," he said in the affidavit. He said he had made the withdrawal statement without intimidation, coercion, threats or inducement from anyone. Njenga is charged alongside businessman Francis Mwangi, Wanjohi Ngare and Stephen Mwangi with violently robbing three police officers of guns and cash at his Hope Church at Thome Estate, Nairobi, four years ago. The accused are alleged to have confined the police officers for hours in one of the rooms. They denied the charges and are out on a surety bond of Sh200,000.
