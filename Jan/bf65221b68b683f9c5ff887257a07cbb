Names of new Cabinet nominees are yet to be forwarded to Parliament, more than 10 days after President Uhuru Kenyatta made the announcement. Parliament has not received any report from State House about the nominees. Uhuru, in a televised press conference from State House on January 5, said he had forwarded the names to Speaker Justin Muturi. Former Turkana Senator John Munyes, former Marsabit Governor Ukur Yattani and former Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko were nominated to join the Cabinet. “By powers conferred upon me by Article 152 (II), I have nominated and forwarded the names thereof to the Speaker of the National Assembly,” Uhuru said. National Assembly Clerk Michael Sialai yesterday told the Star they are yet to receive a letter from State House. “As of now, we have not received formal communication from the President over the three nominees,” Sialai said. Sialai said the committee, chaired by Muturi, will be legally constituted if it meets the quorum even in the absence of NASA members. “According to the Standing Orders, provided there will be quorum, the Committee on Appointments will be properly constituted to consider the nominees,” Sialai said. Muturi got back to the country yesterday from an official trip to Seychelles. The committee comprises the Speaker, Deputy Speaker, leader of Majority, leader of Minority, deputy leader of Majority, deputy leader of Minority and not more than 22 MPs. Leader of Majority Aden Duale said the House, in December, approved a motion allowing the Speaker to forward names of the Cabinet nominees directly to the Committee on Appointments without necessarily recalling MPs for a special sitting.
