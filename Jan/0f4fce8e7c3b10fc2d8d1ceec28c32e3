The 2017 Kenya Premier League top scorer Masoud Juma yesterday took his football career to a whole new level after penning a undisclosed deal with South African side, Cape Town City FC. After series of unsuccessful trials with another South African side, Bidvest Wits in July, Juma’s dream of exhibiting his goal scoring prowess outside the country came true after Cape Town captured his signature. The former Bandari and Sony Sugar forward netted 17 times in the past season, claiming the ‘Golden Boot’ which spiced up his credentials to land an overseas deal. Juma came into public limelight in June during Harambee Stars’ African Cup of Nations preliminary match away to Sierra Leone, where he made his national team debut amid heavy criticism from fans who questioned his selection ahead of the then league’s top scorer Stephen Waruru. He silenced his critics in August when he netted Kenya’s sole goal in the Fifa friendly, pitting Harambee Stars against Mauritania where the home boys rattled the West Africans to a one all draw.Juma didn’t relent in his quest to prove his worth in the national team as he found the back of the net twice in the December’s Cecafa Senior Challenge tournament, where Kenya reclaimed the regional title from arch rivals Uganda. The Premier League Soccer (PLS) side confirmed on the acquisition of the Kariobangi Sharks’ man on their official website. “Cape Town City is delighted to announce the acquisition of 21-year-old Kenyan international striker, and African top goalscorer of the year (sic)— Masoud Juma.”  Juma will be glad to rub shoulders with the former African Player of the Year and South Africa’s second best all time leading top scorer Benni McCarthy, who is the club’s head coach. He joins Harambee Stars third assistant captain and centre half Brian Mandela, who plys his trade with another South African outfit Mariztsburg United.
