The Boni marginalised community in terror-prone Basuba ward in Lamu have accused teachers of using a non-existent insecurity issue as a reason to stay away. All the five Boni villages on Basuba, Milimani, Mangai, Mararani and Kiangwe border the Boni Forest where an operation to flush out al Shabaab militants is ongoing. All the five primary schools in each village have remained closed since 2014. Al Shabaab intensified attacks that saw many teachers flee. The fate of the education of more than 400 children in Basuba is threatened. The schools remain shut a week after the new term began. Boni elders, led by Basuba chief Yusuf Nuri yesterday accused the teachers of using the security situation as an excuse. Nuri said as much as al Shabaab is a real problem, the teachers need to sympathise with the children who have not been in class for three years. He said it is unfortunate that the teachers cite insecurity as a reason not to report to work yet there has not been any major attack in a while. The government has taken enough measures to improve security in Basuba and around Lamu. Nuri questioned why the education of Basuba children is still uncertain. The Boni elders said the government should come up with measures to ensure teachers posted to Basuba schools show up for duty and studies resume. “I don’t understand why schools have remained closed others in other areas are continuing with classes. There are too many security officers, perhaps more than the residents here, but still no teachers,” Nuri said. Residents want youths to be trained as teachers so that they can teach in the schools since teachers from other parts of the country are scared of being posted to Basuba schools. They said teachers are reluctant to work in Basuba because of the lack of development. “Governments have neglected the Bonis for decades. That’s why tutors feel teaching in such a place is more like being left on their own,” said resident Adnan Barissa of Mangai.
