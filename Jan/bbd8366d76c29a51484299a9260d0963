The CA forced Bamba TV to shut down the KTN Home and KTN News channels on Tuesday, minutes after Citizen and NTV suffered this fate. The crackdown concerns live coverage of NASA chief Raila Odinga's swearing-in. At 10.30 am, police from Spring Valley station arrived at the station's main office at Lion Place, Westlands, saying they needed to switch off KTN Home and KTN News on the Bamba platform. They were with Communications Authority officer Titus Cheptoo who said live coverage had been banned. He did not provide a letter to that effect. Cheptoo instructed the Bamba head engineer to disconnect the platform, an order that was effected at 10.50 am. He then called CAK to confirm that KTN was off air but told Bamba staff to wait for instructions on when KTN could be switched on again. Earlier, the Authority shut down Citizen and Inooro TV ahead of Opposition leader Raila Odinga's inauguration at Uhuru Park. Royal Media said the CAK switched off its ADN signals at the Limuru station, disabling all transmission. Radio stations in parts of the country have also been affected. Nation Media's free to air platforms are also down because of control by the authority but access through DSTV has not been interrupted.
