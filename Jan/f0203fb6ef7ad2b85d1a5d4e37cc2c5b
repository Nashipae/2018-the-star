Many people, including admirers of Raila Odinga, did not want his swearing in as People's President to go ahead today. But NASA leaders seem determined to go ahead despite the counsel of elders such as Gen Olusegun Obasanjo and Prof Yash Ghai. And the Jubilee government also seems determined not to let it go ahead, despite it being a constitutional nullity without the involvement of the IEBC or the Chief Justice. Our hope therefore must just be to navigate this day with the minimum of violence. NASA should find somewhere other than Uhuru Park to hold their event. The state has forbidden use of the venue which may also be occupied by Moses Kuria's aggressive Nairobi Business Community. On its side, the state should issue rubber bullets rather than live ammunition to police officers. We do not want any more unnecessary deaths during demonstrations. And above all, the government should resist the temptation to arrest Raila Odinga, even if his actions are illegal. That would make him a martyr and could touch off widespread violence.
