Six people were injured after a residential building collapsed in Embakasi's Pipeline area on Wednesday afternoon. Red Cross said they were among people who had been demolishing the structure. Rescuer Dan Mutinda said the six were rushed to hospital and that teams went to the site to carry out searches. Mutinda said the building had just one floor and that it had been marked for demolition. "Police have cordoned off the area amid rescue efforts," he said by phone. But a witness claimed volunteers pulled two bodies out of the rubble. "We heard cries from the site minutes after lunch time," said the man identified only as Henry. "We retrieved two bodies and transported them in a pick-up. One group was on the ground floor and the other on the first floor." He said the floor of the building was made of a mixture of concrete and wood. Click here for the latest political stories
