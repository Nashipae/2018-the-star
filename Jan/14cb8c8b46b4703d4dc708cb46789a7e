Nairobi county has started demolishing illegal structures to prevent the outbreaks of diseases such as cholera. Selina Ogallo, Embakasi East sub-county administrator, noted on Wednesday that the structures were put up illegally. "Last year in November and December, the officers visited the traders and warned them. Some of them have built permanent structures on land meant for pedestrians' pavements," she said on Wednesday. Ogallo said some were located along Mombasa Road just right after Cabanas and next to the airport. "The airport is a central place where people meet as they jet in or out of the country. Having illegal structures does not portray a good image. Some are hotels which sell food. Which water do they use?" The administrator also noted the need to minimise congestion. Ogallo said the county will educate locals on keeping their environments healthy and putting up stalls with permits from the county. "Embakasi East has been having numerous cases of cholera ... food from the traders can be the source of this ailment and we don't know if the water is clean. We want to protect residents."
