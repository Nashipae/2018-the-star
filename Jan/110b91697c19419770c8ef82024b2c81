Murang’a residents are angered by the recent squabbles and fistfights by MCAs that have hit the headlines, depicting the county as a war zone. Yesterday they said the MCAs are yet to understand their mandate and they are prioritising their personal interests at the expense of residents. They said they will recall the MCAs or march to the assembly in Murang’a town and force it to close until the representatives cease their intolerable actions.  Led by Lukas Kiragu, residents said the MCAs first tried to remove county clerk Chris Kinyanjui for allegedly “underfunding them” during a sports tour to Machakos and failing to release allowances. The 28 MCAs accused the clerk of undermining their welfare, saying he was the reason they are poor. The clerk said the actions by the MCAs were a result of the assembly declining to approve unsecurity mortgage and car loans. “We regret voting in such greedy people. We now see their true colors. All they are demanding are hefty allowances,” Kiragu said. They were also angered by last week’s drama in which MCAs took their differences to Kiambu county. At a meeting in Sahara West Park Hotel in Ruaka, Kiambu, rival factions of MCAs traded insults. These escalated to fistfights, injuring two MCAs and a Jubilee Party official. MCAs Nahashon Gachuhi of Gatanga, Gerald Wambugu of Kamacharia and Murang’a JP deputy secretary general Charles Mwangi were ejected from the meeting by MCAs and hired goons. “They are a total disgrace to the people of Murang’a,” resident Margaret Nyokabi said. Resident Ndegwa Kiragu said rich people are financing and fuelling the wrangles in order to distract Governor Mwangi wa Iria from carrying out his agenda.
