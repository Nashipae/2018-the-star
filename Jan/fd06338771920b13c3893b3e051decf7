Machakos county will get Sh1 billion from the World Bank to support the Kenya Climate Smart Agriculture Project. The funds will be used for water and soil management and to promote sustainable rangeland management. World Bank lead agriculture economist Ladisy Chengula made the announcement when he paid a courtesy call on Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua. Mutua met the World Bank group to discuss special funding for the county’s agriculture programmes. “We will also look into improving access to quality livestock services, supporting the generation and dissemination of agricultural technology, innovation and management practices,’’ Chengula said. The World Bank will also help Machakos increase access to quality agro-weather, climate, advisory and market information services.
