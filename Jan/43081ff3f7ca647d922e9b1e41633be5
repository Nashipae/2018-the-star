Budalang’i MP Raphael Wanjala has told Ugandan marine police in Lake Victoria to respect Kenyan fishermen in line with the East African member states’ protocol. He expressed concern that the Ugandan officers harass Budalang’i fishermen.  Wanjala urged the Kenyan EALA legislators to table a bill before the assembly to end the maritime boundary dispute between Kenya and Uganda. “The persistent harassment of the fishermen from Budalang’i constituency has prompted sour relations between Kenya and Uganda. I urge Kenyan MPs at the East African Legislative Assembly to move with speed and table a bill aimed at ending the maritime boundary issue,” he said. Wanjala also urged the Kenyan fishermen to adhere to regulations and laws of the neighbouring country so they are not caught in the wrong and to promote good neighbourliness.
