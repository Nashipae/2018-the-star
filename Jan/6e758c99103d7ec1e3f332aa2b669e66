National Assembly Minority leader John Mbadi yesterday warned State House against meddling in parliamentary affairs. He waded into the crisis rocking Jubilee over leadership of three key committees. He said MPs must have a free hand to perform their oversight role. The Suba South MP said attempts by State House to force rebel MPs to relinquish their committee leadership positions amount to intimidation. “MPs have a role to oversee the executive without being compromised. They cannot perform that role under an environment characterised by threats and intimidation,” he told the Star on the phone. Mbadi, a critic of the ruling Jubilee administration, was responding to State House’s decision to summon four Jubilee MPs who have defied Deputy President William Ruto’s directive to resign from committees. Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter (Labour and Social Welfare), Moiben’s Silas Tiren (Agriculture) and Marakwet MP David Bowen (Environment and Natural Resources) went against State House’s wishes and won elections as chairpersons of the committees. Emgwen’s Alex Kosgey also defied the orders and unsuccessfully challenged Kieni MP Kanini Kega in the election for the chairperson of the influential Trade and Industry committee. Kega won by a landslide. Mbadi said there was nothing wrong with the MPs’ decision to present themselves for election as heads of the committees as that was within the Standing Orders. “They were elected by their colleagues because of the confidence MPs had in them. Parliament should be allowed to freely exercise its mandate without undue influence from outside forces,” he said. The lawmaker urged Jubilee to emulate NASA’s maturity during the 11th Parliament when former Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo was elected the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee against the wishes of the then Cord.
