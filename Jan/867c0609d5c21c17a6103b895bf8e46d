Informal transactions through Facebook groups are becoming a threat to e-commerce retailers, a Geopoll report has revealed. The poll, which sought to find out the impact of Black Friday that ran in December 2017, found out that Facebook is the second leading online retailer at 32 per cent after Facebook at 56 per cent. However, based on the 2,031 respondents who hailed from Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya, Jumia still remains the most preferred e-commerce vendor. Sales in Facebook groups are largely made by informal entrepreneurs who utilize the channel to sell through their groups or similar interest groups. “Facebook is proving to be a formidable albeit odd player in this space,” the poll states. While E-commerce in the region remains far from a success story, 74 per cent of the respondent indicated that they have purchased an item online hence a sign that the benefits of online retail are slowly trickling through.
