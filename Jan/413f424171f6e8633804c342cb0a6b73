Thirty people sustained serious injuries yesterday at Kangiga when a Transcounty bus’s brakes failed and crashed.  Nobody died. The bus was headed to Mandera from Nairobi. The passengers are undergoing treatment at Mwingi Level 4 Hopsital. The accident happened a kilometre from Mwingi town. A survivor who wanted to remain anonymous said he felt the bus had a mechanical problem. He said he raised concerns with the driver and conductor but they ignored him.  “ Somewhere at Kithimani, the driver stopped the bus and together with a mechanic who was in the bus, fastened some loose bolts in the brake pads. As we approached Mwingi, we started sensing a bad smell like that of a burning tyre. We complained, but the driver said everything was okay. In no time, we found ourselves down fully covered in dust,” the survivor said.
