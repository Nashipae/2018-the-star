The highways authority is warning the public against falling prey to an online scam purporting that KeNHA is recruiting road safety volunteers and drivers. In a statement on Sunday, corporate communications assistant director Charles Njogu said the positions do not exist under the authority's organizational structures. “We wish to clarify that KeNHA has a clear recruitment guidelines and procedures policy which includes publishing of vacancies in mainstream newspapers and on authority’s website www.kenha.co.ke,” Njogu said. According to Njogu, the fraudsters are tricking unsuspecting Kenyans to submit applications through the website getjobskiambukenya.co.ke/job.html after paying Sh250 registration fee. “The authority does not solicit any money during recruitment as indicated in the fake advert,” Njogu said. According to the alleged fake advert, 8 safety volunteers and 1 driver will be recruited per ward in every county on a first-come-first served basis. The website gives the recipient of the Sh250 registration fee as one Dr. David M. Karanja F. “The work begins on February 11 to June 30, 2020. Training of shortlisted candidates will be from February 1-10 in all counties across the country,” reads part of the advert. The scam has the potential of raking in millions of shillings given the level of youth unemployment in the country. Click here for the latest political news
