At least 35 people have been killed in a double suicide bombing in the Iraqi capital Baghdad, officials say, the second attack in three days. More than 90 were injured in the attack in Tayaran Square in the city centre. Baghdad has seen almost daily bombings and armed attacks since the Islamic State group took over large areas of the country in 2014. However, the pace of attacks has declined since the militants' defeat in December. Monday's attack was carried out by two men with suicide vests packed with explosives, the interior ministry said. The site of the attack is a busy square where large crowds of construction workers gather to find work. It has been targeted by militants in the past. An AFP reporter said there were a large number of security personnel at the site. A suicide bomb attack on a checkpoint in the north of the city on Saturday killed at least five people, police said. The renewed violence follows the announcement of parliamentary elections to be held in May.
