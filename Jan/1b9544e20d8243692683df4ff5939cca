National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi yesterday dismissed claims that MPs’ salaries and allowances would be backdated to August 30, when they were sworn in. Instead, he said the new remuneration will only take effect from December 14, when the orders were issued by the court. “A court order cannot be implemented retrogressively. Those MPs coming to my office claiming they should get their new pay from August 30 should just forget it. It will be implemented from December 15 going forward — until it is otherwise revised. That’s the day we received the court order,” Muturi said.

Muturi said MPs are justified to receive salaries of Sh710,000, car grants and other additional allowances just like officers in other arms of government. “Members of the Executive and Judiciary are given car grants of Sh5 million. Article 260 of the Constitution does not stipulate that one category of state officers should be discriminated. I don’t understand what exactly is exciting Kenyans because no increase has been done,” he said. “The function of setting and regularly reviewing salaries of state officers rests with the SRC, as stated in Article 230. I don’t remember any time when Parliament awarded themselves salaries.” Related: MPs get Sh5 million car grants, critics cry ‘greed Click here for the latest political news
