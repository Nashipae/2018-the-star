 President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto have been told to focus on uniting Kenyans, instead of adopting dictatorship. Muhoroni MP Onyango Koyoo yesterday said Kenyans are more divided, hence the need for the Jubilee administration to ensure maximum integration and cohesion. He said Uhuru and Ruto should stop chest-thumping and work on how they can bring wananchi together — irrespective of their political affiliations. “What we want to see is peaceful coexistence among the people of Kenya. But this can only be achieved if citizens are treated equally,” he said in Kisumu. The majority of citizens are very bitter with the Jubilee administration and the President must work hard to restore peace and harmony, he said.  Koyoo said Kenyans should be told about Uhuru, not UhuRuto, because the buck stops with him.
