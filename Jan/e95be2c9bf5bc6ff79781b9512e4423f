An altar boy was on Friday sentenced to serve 12 years in jail for raping a faithful at the Embu Catholic Church compound. Josphat
Njiru, 27, was found guilty of the offence committed at the Kiambuthi Catholic Church in November 2016. The court was told he raped the woman who had attended an early service after other adherents had dispersed. Resident Magistrate Jean Ndengeri said the seven prosecution witnesses proved beyond any reasonable doubt that Njiru committed the offence. The court heard that on
the fateful day the complainant found the church's
gate locked and decided to wait at a nearby kiosk. As she waited, the kiosk's owner saw the altar boy arriving at the
church and asked him to accompany the woman into the church. The two were said to
have engaged in a conversation waiting for the other faithfuls to arrive for the priest to start the service. The court was told
that after the service, the accused asked the woman to wait for him "as he had
something important he wanted to tell her." "Thus the woman trusted him and
remained behind. He took the woman to an area with overgrown grass and
raped her before he escaped," the court heard. The complainant said
he went to the owner of the kiosk and narrated to her the ordeal before
she was escorted to Itabua police station where they reported the
matter. She was taken to Embu Level
Five Teaching and Referral Hospital where she was examined and treated before
the convict was later arrested and charged. In his mitigation, Njiru told the court he was intending to marry the complainant but that she was brushing
him off whenever he approached her. The magistrate described
the offence as very serious, particularly after being done by a person of the
status of the accused. He gave him fourteen
days to appeal against the sentence if he was not satisfied by it. Click here for the latest political stories
