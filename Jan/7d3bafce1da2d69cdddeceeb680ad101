Eight worshipers were arraigned in Nyandarua on Monday following a fight that left five injured and property destroyed. The eight are members of Uiguano African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa (AIPCA), Rurii. Chaos broke out on Sunday after members of the Nyakiambi and Mugumo congregations went to Uiguano, where they allegedly attempted to prevent the priest on duty from conducting the service. They were with a pastor barred from leading the service due to ongoing wrangles. Details: Eight arrested after kicks and blows at AIPCA Ol Kalou Joyce Wanjiku, Mary Mukuhi, Lydia Njoki, David Ndung’u, Ronald Mwai, Bethwel Mugo, Stephen Muchai and John Mwai faced Nyahururu senior resident magistrate Ocharo Momanyi. They were charged with causing a disturbance in a matter likely to breach peace. Wanjiku, Mukuhi, Njoki, Ndung’u and Mwai were also charged with two counts of malicious damage to property. The court heard that on that day, they damaged three plastic chairs worth Sh2,800, that belonged to the church, and a car owned by a worshiperr. The eight denied the charges and were released on Sh15,000 cash bail each. Members of the church jammed the court for the proceedings and later held a meeting outside on how to bail out their friends. The case will be mentioned on February 8.
