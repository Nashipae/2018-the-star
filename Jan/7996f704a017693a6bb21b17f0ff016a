The Belgium government will undertake a Sh1.1 billion water project in Homa Bay. Belgium’s Cockerill Maintenance & Ingénierie director Bob Van Der Linden said the work will take three years. They will focus on zero-rating constant water shortage in the town. Linden spoke on Wednesday when he visited Governor Cyprian Awiti. “Two big boreholes are set to be dug in Rodi Kopany township, while tanks holding up to 50,000 litres of water will be erected on Asego Hill,” he said. Lake Victoria South Water Services Board chief engineer for rural water and sanitation Daniel Oronje said a design for the project has already been finalised. “We’re waiting for the implementation of the project to start since designs and structures have been laid down,” he said. Oronje said the project will replace the old water system in the county. He said they will ensure the project is completed on time. Awiti said the project will end perennial water shortage in the county. “This project is important for us because residents will have access to clean water. We hope to put a stop to constant water problems in Homa Bay town and its surrounding,” the governor said Awiti said his government is providing a conducive environment for the implementation of the project. He said the project will create jobs for the youth. “This is one of the numerous projects we want to implement through partnerships,” the governor said.
