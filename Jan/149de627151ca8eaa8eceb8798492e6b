With the Sunday night road crash where 36 died on the Nakuru-Eldoret highway, it is estimated 250 Kenyans have perished in road accidents in just one month. The social and economic impact of these deaths is far- reaching. Huge investment by families is wiped out overnight and many are left without breadwinners and benefactors. The immediate post-accident costs of sending off the deceased and treatment of survivors coupled with the trauma of bereavement are driving many families into desperation.     The Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital CEO, Dr Wilson Aruasa, says hospitals in the Rift Valley and other parts of the country are overburdened by the high number of road accident victims. This is unacceptable. The government cannot continue responding to tragedy and grief with lip service and condolences. The authorities, led by the Police and the National Transport and Safety Authority, must own up to the reality on our roads: Institutionalised indiscipline, lawlessness and corruption.  The entire rotten system of road safety and transport needs radical surgery. Only no-nonsense law enforcement will work.
