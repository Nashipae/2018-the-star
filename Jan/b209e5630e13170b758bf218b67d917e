President Donald Trump fired off a warning tweet to North Korea Tuesday night, taunting leader Kim Jong Un who said in his New Year speech that Americans should be aware he has a 'button' for nuclear weapons. Trump warned the hermit country: 'North Korean Leader Kim Jong-Un just stated that the ''Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.'' Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!' The threat came after an annual speech given by Kim, in which he cautioned: 'The U.S. should know that the button for nuclear weapons is on my table.' Kim also warned America that it can 'never start a war against me and our country' and insisted his nukes are now a reality, not a threat. Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, warned North Korea on Tuesday against staging another missile test and said Washington would not take any talks between North and South Korea seriously if they did not do something to get Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons. Haley told reporters the United States was hearing reports that North Korea might be preparing to fire another missile. 'I hope that doesn't happen. But if it does, we must bring even tougher measures to bear against the North Korean regime,' Haley said. South Korea on Tuesday offered talks with North Korea next week, amid a tense standoff over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programmes, after Kim said in a New Year's Day speech that he was 'open to dialogue' with Seoul. Kim also said he was open to the possibility of North Korean athletes taking part in Winter Olympics South Korea hosts next month. At the same time, he stressed that his country would push ahead with 'mass producing' nuclear warheads in defiance of U.N. sanctions and that he had a nuclear button on his desk capable of launching missiles at the United States.
