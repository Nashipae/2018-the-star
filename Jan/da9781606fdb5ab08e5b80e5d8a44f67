The Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital has revived its oxygen plant. CEO Dr Wilson Aruasa said yesterday the plant was installed in 2008, but failed to work. Its revival is among the key projects undertaken by Aruasa. This will improve services and cut costs of operations at the hospital. The plant will supply oxygen to all wards, the newborn unit and the intensive care unit. “This will significantly cut costs. It will improve stability of oxygen supply in the hospital,” Aruasa said. Over the years, support from donors and partners has increased to Sh3 billion annually. This has helped the management invest in modern equipment and specialised services. Aruasa has reformed the hospital and improved staff welfare. He gave 700 permanent jobs in July last year.
