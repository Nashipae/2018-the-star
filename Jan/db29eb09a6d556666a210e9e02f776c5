The votes recount exercise for Lamu West MP began for the second time on Wednesday at Mokowe tallying centre. When the exercise was carried out last week, only 43 of the 123 ballot boxes were opened and papers counted and scrutinised. Stanley Muthama of Maendeleo Chap Chap was declared winner after garnering 11,090 votes against ODM’s Rishad Amana who got 10,950 votes. Amana however cried foul and went to court to petition Muthama’s win on grounds that there were inconsistencies in tallying. He won the petition after the Malindi High Court ordered a recount of all votes on January 8.

It is expected that a total of 80 ballot boxes will be opened by the IEBC in the presence of all the litigants and their legal teams. Lamu West MP Stanley Muthama said: "In order for the true will of the people to be realised, and since this win was valid and only needed to be reaffirmed in the most transparent manner, the High Court judge has granted an additional 10 days starting January 17. "I urge the people of Lamu West constituency to remain calm and peaceful as we set to clear all doubts from our opponents. The people did make their decision freely”. Politician Rishad Amana expressed confidence that he will be vindicated and his victory restored. “I know I won, that I am confident of, and I know this exercise will vindicate me and restore my victory. Let justice be done,” said Amana. The exercise is being conducted under tight security with supporters of both sides being asked to stay at least 600 metres from the tallying centre. Lamu West has 51,559 registered voters. Click here for the latest political news
