A Nairobi court wants the Kenyan finance controller of a company based in Kigali, Rwanda, arrested over the theft of more than Sh2.7 million. Milimani senior principal magistrate Martha Mutuku issued the warrant on Tuesday after the DPP made an application. The order was issued against Amos Chomba, so he can appear in court for the hearing of extradition proceedings. While seeking the order, senior state counsel Victor Mulei informed the court that Chomba is wanted in Rwanda for the alleged theft of the amount from Kgali's Earthenable Limited. The warrant for Chomba's arrest was issued by Rwandan prosecutor general Jean Mutangana. The prosecution was also granted orders for the DCI to investigate Chomba's personal bank accounts through which he allegedly received the amount from the Rwanda-based company. Mutuku further granted the prosecution's request to freeze Chomba's accounts at Equity bank, pending the hearing and determination of the extradition case. The court heard that the suspect committed the offences between September and October 2017 in the course of his duties. It was said that the accused fraudulently transferred Rwandese Francs (RWF) 11,853,142 and an extra $12, 658.43 through Equity Bank to his accounts in Kenya. The case will be mentioned after two weeks for further directions. Click here for the latest political news
