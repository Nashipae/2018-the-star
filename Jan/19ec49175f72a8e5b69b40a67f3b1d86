Christian hip hop in most cases comes in two different forms: First, there’s the legion of rappers who simply drop well-organised, enlightening bars over beats, and then there’s the lot that is about what’s hot and what’s not. Eko Dydda somehow perfectly fits in both categories. He is a pedantic minister delivering lyricism influenced by biblical references, and at the same time, he knows how to get a crowd into a frenzy. His faith has never been something to doubt ever since he jumped into the scene with hits like “Niko na Reason” and “Me and My House”. It was at the same time that the Kenyan gospel scene was starting to catch on fast and, perhaps, it was the perfect moment for Eko to release his music that is not really aligned to what was typically considered as Christian music. Well, his sound has been through some ineluctable metamorphosis, and for over seven years now, we’ve witnessed Eko’s growth. At one point in his career, the rapper seemed rather jaded and his shine somehow faded. But in 2015, he had to revamp his stuttering style of rap and get his career back on track,  a decision he doesn’t regret. Track after track, he is still among the few early contemporary gospel artistes who have still managed to maintain their form. Eko Dydda has ensured that not only does he spread the gospel, but also sensitise his fans on social and political issues, with his greatest message being against tribalism. He has even inspired his kids Keep It Real and Am Blessed to join the art at a very tender age. With tracks like “Cheki Vile,” “Vidole,” “Bow” and his latest drop, “Amen,” he doesn’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon. As the current holder of the Groove Awards Male Artiste of the Year title, he remains aware of Christian norms. Eko’s authenticity — his willingness to mix sacred themes and party tunes — has reinvented his brand. He is his own mind and sound.
