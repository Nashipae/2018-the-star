The swearing-in of NASA principals Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka will lead to chaos, Maendeleo Chap Chap party leader Alfred Mutua has said. The Machakos governor on Friday said the country cannot have two presidents. He said this will plant seeds of civil war and turn Kenya into a failed state like Somalia. “This talk of two Presidents is bad for the nation. We’ll have another shithole country,” he said outside his office in Machakos. NASA has said they will swear in Raila and Kalonzo as the People’s President and Deputy President on Tuesday in Uhuru Park, Nairobi. Yesterday NASA released a report on the results of the August 8 General Election on which the swearing-in will be based. NASA lawyer and Siaya senator James Orengo said Raila got 8.1 million votes compared to President Uhuru Kenyatta’s 7.9 million. The electoral commission declared Uhuru winner with 8,203,290 votes against Raila’s 6,762,224. Deputy Governor Francis Maliti and Machakos MCC chairman Timothy Kilonzo accompanied Mutua. The governor said politics should lead to development and not scare away investors. He said those pushing for the swearing-in are wealthy, unlike millions of Kenyans. “I urge our friends to forget about this shenanigan and work towards developing our country,” he said. “Our neighbours are telling us: Come on, can’t you learn from what we have gone through.” “This talk of swearing-in is not only bad for our people, but also makes us look bad to the international community. If others hear that Kenya is having another swearing-in so we have two Presidents, they’ll look at us and say there goes another failed nation.” On Tuesday, the MCC said it would seek to be included in a suit filed by AG Githu Mungai that seeks to stop the establishment of the People’s Assembly. Mutua said the party will ask the court to have the MCAs who voted the People’s Assembly motion resign.
