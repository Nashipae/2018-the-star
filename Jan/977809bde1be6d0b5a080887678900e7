Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati yesterday defended the county’s bursary allocations against claims of bias and lack of transparency. Through his communications director Tim Machi, he said that the programme is undertaken in phases. Wangamati said Sh400 million was allocated to bursaries — of which 30 per cent is meant for college students. “The awards will follow the same process of public participation to ensure transparency at all levels,” he said. The county boss said the cash will be distributed equitably across the 45 wards. He said a team, led by Education CEC Richard Sabwami, has liaised with officials of other funds — the CDF, the Affirmative Action Fund and those given by corporates such as Equity Bank — to prevent double allocations to students.
