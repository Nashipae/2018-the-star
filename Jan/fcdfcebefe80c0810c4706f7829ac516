Governor Wilber Otichilo on Monday called for investigations to establish why Musila bridge in Central Bunyore ward in Emuhaya sub county has stalled despite the project consuming Sh20 million. Ottichilo was shocked that most of the projects including Ebukholo dispensary had stalled after millions of tax payer’s money invested in them. He assured residents that he will complete the health facility and equip it to provide services. “Sh20 million was too much for such a small bridge in the village,” he said. He directed the infrastructure department to immediately take up the matter, and ensure the contractor who had abandoned the project returns to the site to complete it by June. He said stalling of the bridge has subjected residents especially students to danger since they have been forced to use a makeshift footpath bridge to cross the river. The county boss was accompanied by his deputy Dr Patrick Saisi, Emuhaya MP Omboko Milemba, CEC Infrastructure Engineer Kenneth Elvuna Keseko and MCAs. The projects he visited include, Emurembe- Emunichia-Ebunangwe road, Ematsuli dispensary, Emusire, Isava, Ipali and Ebukhaya health centres among others. Saisi and Milemba said that time for politics was over and asked leaders in the county to support Otichilo’s administration deliver its promise.
