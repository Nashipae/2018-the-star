Three MCAs were yesterday charged before a Murang’a court with creating disturbance in the Murang’a county assembly. Makuyu MCA Stanley Mburu, Amos Murigi (Kimorori Wempa) and Jecintah Ng’ang’a (Township were accused of storming into Majority leader Eric Kamande’s office and breaching the peace on Tuesday. They were each released on Sh100,000 bail. Murigi and Ng’ang’a faced a second count of creating a disturbance by barging into the assembly clerk’s office on November 27 in an attempt to evict him. They both denied the charges and were each released on Sh100,000 bail by chief magistrate Margaret Wachira. The case will be mentioned on January 31. They are part of eight MCAs that the police are looking for following the fight that broke out in the assembly on Monday. On Tuesday, Wachira issued a warrant of arrest for nominated MCAs Beth Waithira, Joyce Wambui, Stephen Chege and Kagunduini MCA Peter Mburu and deputy speaker Samuel Kihurunjo. Jubilee Party secretary general Raphael Tuju has said the party will form a committee to handle the differences that have cropped up in the party leadership in Murang’a. Speaking after meeting with MCAs in the assembly, Tuju said the differences will be resolved at the party headquarters. “After listening to the MCAs and the leadership of the county, it is encouraging that the differences are not too deep-rooted and can be resolved,” Tuju said. He added that the MCAs complained that they are yet to have an induction course on the party and assembly procedures. “Other issues that have been raised can be dealt with at the Senate level. The entire country is undergoing transition in regards to devolution and it requires patience,” Tuju said.
