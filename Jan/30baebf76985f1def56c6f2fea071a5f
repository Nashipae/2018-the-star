The Mombasa ACK diocese will know the fate of consecration of their new bishop on Friday. Mombasa senior magistrate Martin Rabera is expected to give his ruling on whether to suspend the confirmation of the new bishop or not. Bishop-elect Alphonce Baya’s consecration was scheduled for Sunday. A faction of the clergy in the diocese led by Mombasa Memorial Cathedral administrative secretary George Kuza are challenging the election of Mwaro who is to replace the outgoing Bishop Julius Kalu. Kuza and three other church leaders accuse the church of downplaying their plea for a free and fair election. Through their lawyer Wandai Matheka,they told the court it was that ignorance that made them move to court to seek assistance. Matheka dismissed claims they had not followed due process in presenting their concerns to the diocese leadership. He told the court they had exhausted all dioceses machinery to solve the issue, including the formation of the diocese synod of 14 members, but they were ignored. The lawyer, through an oral submission, argued the formation of the synod was the bone of contention alleging that it influenced the election in favour of the bishop-elect.  Matheka argued the outgoing Bishop Kalu ignored them when Kuza and others protested the formation of the synod before selecting of an electoral college.  Click here for latest political news
