 Sugar cane farmers have begun reaping the benefits of a new technology that guarantees high yields and disease resistance. Crop yields have increased from 25 tonnes per acre to 35 under the Sustainable Sugar Initiative that began in 2015. The farmers, contracted to West Kenya Sugar Company, are paid Sh4,200 for a tonne of cane delivered to the factory. The SSI eliminated diseases and improves yields. The system works by scooping buds from the cane and developing them into  seedlings. The seedlings are developed in green houses before transplantation. “The method
increases crop population in the fields thereby guaranteeing higher yields compared to the older one," the company's agricultural officer Margaret Isiye said. Isiye said 15,000 farmers have adopted
the new technology, which was borrowed from India. “It puts emphasis
on developing early maturing cane varieties with high sucrose content," Isiye said. The new varieties include D 8484, which matures within
14 months. The older CO 421 variety takes 18 months to mature. Other
early maturing varieties include N14, Ken 83-737 and CO 945. The company has rolled out a field training programme for the farmers. The company's public relations manager Joseph Koech said they have alo created a bulk SMS platform to manage cane farming in the zones. “Through the platform, we update farmers when their cane is ready for harvesting, tonnage and the amount credited to their
account,” Koech said. Malava farmer Joyce Nafula said she was happy with the returns of the new technology. "The new method has brought back farmers who had abandoned cane farming for other crops," Nafula said.   "The new
method is promising as fields per acre are higher than what I used to get using
the traditional method. My harvest rose from 25 tons to 35 tons per acres,"
said Joyce Nafula, a farmer in Malava. She said that
SMS updates by the company ensures proper management of the crop. Ends……
