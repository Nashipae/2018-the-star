Detectives have arrested 10 Pakistani nationals in Mombasa over links to terrorism. The foreigners were arrested following a tip off from the Pakistani intelligence. A senior officer leading the operation said Kenyan authorities raided the residents of the suspects within Kizingo area. Among those seized is the father of a terror suspect arrested in Pakistan on Monday. He was identified as Mohammed Tasleem. The 50-year-old owns company that imports rice from Pakistan.

County commandant Johnstone Ipara said detectives were investigating if the foreigners were engaged in money laundering and drug trafficking. "We suspect they were carrying out illegal commercial activities," Ipara said. Mombasa CID boss Washington Njiru said they were working with different agencies to investigate the suspects. They are expected to appear in court today. Police are planning to ask the court to allow them detain the suspects for more days as they complete their investigations. "No one could give a satisfactory account of their status in Kenya. They are detained at Central police station," Njiru said. Sources told the Star that Tasleem could be deported to Pakistan to assist with investigations. It is suspected that the proceeds of his business is used to fund terrorism activities in Pakistan.
