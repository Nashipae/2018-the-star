Rehabilitation of Ngong road from Prestige to Dagoretti Corner is set to start in March, says Kenya Urban Roads Authority. According to Kura director general Silas Kinoti, tenders for the next phase will be awarded next week and is set to start in the next three months. "Already the section between Dagoretti Corner to Karen shopping centre is under construction," said Kinoti Kura completed phase one, which runs from Kenya National Library to Ring Road Junction. The project which started in February 2016 was intended to decongest the western part of Nairobi which would eventually lead to Ngong town. "Under the Vision 20130, the government plans to improve Upper Hill and its environs to meet the expected status of being a regional financial hub" said Kinoti. However, Kinoti said that relocation of service, traffic management and heavy rains which delayed construction were some of the challenges faced while working on the project. He said there will be future improvement of phase one, which includes installation of footbridges to enable pedestrians cross the road and full installation of Intelligent Transport System. Kura has urged motorists and pedestrians to observe traffic signals and traffic laws to curb road accidents.
