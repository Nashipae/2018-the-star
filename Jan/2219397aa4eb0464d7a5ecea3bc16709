Claims as a result of human-wildlife conflicts will now be transferred to a yet to be named insurance company even as Environment ministry seeks to tighten the Wildlife Act. Natural resources PS Margaret Mwakima, told the Star that talks to transfer risks associated with human-wildlife conflicts are at an advanced stage. “We want to see how best the claims are settled in the fastest and easiest way possible,” Mwakima said. The ministry has been struggling to compensate a long list of claims with a thin budget. While addressing the press last month, Environment PS Judi Wakhungu, said her ministry has been allocated Sh250 million only for compensation since 2015. Most claims arise from snake bites, with 62 per cent received between 2014-2016, and whose claim is almost hitting Sh1.5 billion. Other wildlife accounted for 38 per cent.  To date, the ministry has received 13,000 general claims from across the country. According to Section 25 of Wildlife Management and Conservation Act 2013, in the case of death, Sh5 million is paid to beneficiaries while injury occasioning permanent disability attracts compensation of Sh3 million. For cases of any other injury, a maximum of Sh2 million will be paid depending on the extent of injury. As at December last year, the outstanding compensation claims stood at over Sh4 billion. The new proposal seeks to compel the Treasury to set up an insurance scheme to cater for compensation of wildlife-linked injuries and deaths. Mwakima said conflicts between lions and human beings have reduced drastically, thus leading to an increase in the number of cubs in both protected areas and national parks, since lions are important in the ecosystem. Declining range,habitat loss and diseases are some of the challenges facing the big cats.
