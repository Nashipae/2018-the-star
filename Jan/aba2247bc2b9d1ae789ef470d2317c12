Kenya Sevens have received a major boost with the return to training of skipper Andrew Amonde ahead of the Sydney and Hamilton legs this month. Amonde missed the two opening legs in Cape Town and Dubai after undergoing hernia operation in October. Amonde, who rejoined the squad late last month, said he is delighted to be back after missing out on the tournament opener. He vowed to work his way up to regain 100 percent fitness and be in perfect shape for the tournament down under. “Being back with the boys is great. We have quite a tough season ahead and it is great to return early enough,” the experienced Amonde said . Amonde said the side must correct the mistakes from the Cape Town leg, where Kenya picked a paltry three points if they are to be back in contention. “We had a couple of issues with game management and if we can correct that, then we can be in contention. Our strength and conditioning is great and as we stated early, the boys are in good physical shape,” he noted Kenya face Argentina, France and Wales in Pool ‘B’ in Sydney and Amonde said the pool is wide open. “We are targeting a place in the Main Cup quarters which means we need to win two out of three matches. Argentina are physical side and we have had close encounters with them in the recent past. France are a tricky side but we are evenly matched with them while Wales are good side who on their day can beat anyone,” noted Amonde. He said the weather conditions in Sydney and Hamilton will favour them. “It’s going to be hot just like it is here and I expect the boys to adapt quite easily. The team will be named next week with departure to Australia set for January 20. Shujaa lie 11th on the standings with 13 points and have set themselves a target of 100 points and two tournament victories in the ten-leg series.
