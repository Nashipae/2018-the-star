The stage is set for the Soldiers Salute Cup as Jamie Hayward seeks to win the annual tournament for a second time at the Nairobi Polo Club in Jamhuri today. Handicap 0.5 Hayward won the inaugural edition when he turned out for Barbour in 2017. As Hayward savours the excitement of winning the first edition, the British Army Major (retired) hopes the RJ Polo combination of captain and one goaler Lorenzo Soriano, handicap zero, Arnie Lustman (-0.5) and himself will click fast enough and deliver the gong. RJ Polo start their title hunt against Space and Style who comprises of handicap one Mike du Toit (skipper), former NPC chairman Devin Shretta (0.5), Moses Wainaga (0.5) and Abbany Karim (-1) in a two-chukka tie. They will then face an on-form Samurai in the knockout two chukka showdown. Samurai, the winners of last weekend’s Maria Bancivenga Cup have made slight changes to the line-up as Amani Nzomo gave the tournament a wide berth. Handicap -2 Magda Jurkoweicka steps in Amani’s place to partner with team patron, Raphael Nzomo alongside his daughter Hiromi Nzomo (0) and son Jadini Nzomo playing off -1 goal. The side will also face ‘Space and Style’. Samurai will battle all their opponents with a fraction (0.5) goal advantage as all other line-ups have a team handicap of one, while they have -0.5. NPC chairman Phillip Arungah (2) once again captains Mombasa Island Cargo Terminal and alongside Anthony Wahome (0), Taru Mwamto (-0.5) and Natasha Tisminiesky (-0.5) hunt for a second trophy in 2018. MICT won the Davis Cup, the first Club tournament of the year. MICT lock horns with Royal Salute (Vishal Somaia 2, Sammy Kiarie 1, the steadily improving Louis Roumeguere -0.5 and Miranda Romijn -1.5) in a four chukka game from which the winner proceeds to the Cup finals.
