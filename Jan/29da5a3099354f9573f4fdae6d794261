Sorrow and pain continued to engulf survivors and relatives of the Migaa road accident that killed 38 people near Salgaa blackspot  on the Nakuru-Nairobi Highway on Sunday morning.  Among those who cheated death in the grisly road tragedy is 35 year old Phoebe Achieng who lost her husband and four children in the 3:30 am fatal crash.  “I’m lost for words. What did I do to deserve this? Where did I go wrong?,” Achieng said amid sobs as she narrated the ordeal to the Star at Nakuru Level Five Hospital on Monday.

She escaped with fractures on her limbs, lower abdomen and chest. The family was travelling from Kisumu to Nairobi when the tragic accident happened.  “We had traveled to my husband’s maternal home in Kisumu for Christmas and we chose to travel back to Nairobi on Sunday in order to prepare the children for the reopening day on Tuesday,” Achieng said while fighting back tears.  “We boarded the ill-fated bus four hours before it left the Kisumu stage. It took time to get full but we finally left at around 11.30 pm. After an hour, the driver started speeding.  On reaching total petrol station, few kilometers to the black spot, traffic police stopped the bus. The driver alighted and embarked after about two minutes. He seemed to have ‘sorted the police’” Achieng said.

"But it seems the cries fell on deaf ears. He continued driving carelessly while overtaking some vehicles before he finally rammed into a trailer," Achieng said.   Another survivor, 40 year old Jecinta Mbinya, echoed Achieng's story about the driver having ignored passengers' pleas to slow down.  “It seemed like he was rushing to Nairobi and be back to Kisumu on time to make a boom during the festive season,” she said while writhing in pain.

He said they had traveled home during the festive season and but the wife had picked an early bus back to Nairobi. He was scheduled to take the trip several days later.  “We had a merry festive season than the years before. After escorting her and ensuring she had boarded the bus, she called me at 4 am to tell me she had been injured." Migire said he made his way to the bus stage before dawn and took the next available bus to Nakuru.  "On reaching Bondo town, I heard about the sad news on radio. When I arrived at the hospital, I could not believe it. "Her face (Mbinya's) and entire body was very bloody. It took time for doctors to stitch her but we thank doctors at the hospital for the care and quick response,” Migire said.

His father, Francis Ogangu said he was called and told about the fatal accident and immediately made the trip to Nakuru.  “I was in Vihiga when I heard my second born was involved in an accident. I have been forced to transfer him to Kenyatta for further treatment,” he said. Oganga and two of his cousins Kevin Omondi (32) and Collins Ochieng (31) were on board. Ochieng is fighting for his life in the ICU. The nurse in charge at the Nakuru Level Five Hospital Alice Barasa said two survivors had been discharged while 18 others who include children are still on treatment.  “We are trying the best we can to ensure they get the required treatment and x-rays. Most of them are in stable condition and I know they will get better as time goes by,” Barasa said. Click here for the latest political news
