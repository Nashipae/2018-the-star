Fifteen-year-old Afifah Sheikh who scored 354 marks in the KCPE exams at Lafey Primary School may not report to Alliance Girls High School because of lack of fees.  A tearful Sheikh told the Star  yesterday she is happy to have scored high marks, despite the numerous challenges she faced. “I am glad to secure a place at the prestigious Alliance Girls High School but I cannot afford the Sh75,000 fees,” she said. She went on: “I worked hard so that I can join a national school and pursue my dream of becoming a doctor, but now my hopes have diminished since it seems no one will pay for my school fees.” Shiekh who comes from a polygamous family is appealing for assistance . According to her uncle Siraj  Hassan, said the family is struggling to meet its basic needs and cannot afford to pay the  school fees.
