  Posta Rangers continued to make their statement of intent ahead of the new Kenya Premier League season next month after adding Danson Kago to the list of their new recruits. Kago joins Calvin Odongo (Kariobangi Sharks) , Suleiman Ngotho (Thika United) and Marcellus Ingotsi (AFC Leopards), who were recruited 24 hours earlier. “We’ve acquired the services of Odongo, Ngotho and Ingotsi, who have signed three-year deals. As if this acquisitions weren’t enough, we’ve just roped in yet another sensational winger Kago, who also joins on a three-year deal from Tusker FC,” the club posted. But it is the arrival of Kago that shows the ambition the mailmen have for the campaign ahead. Not only have they snapped a Kenyan international but they have done so from a team that is considered the destination for many local players, Tusker. Kago was instrumental in the brewers title triumph in 2016 and it is that sort of winning mentality and championship experience that coach Sammy Omollo will be hoping to inject in his team If they are to challenge for the league title. The club is also said to be hot in pursuit of Nakumatt defender Kennedy Onyango. Odongo, a striker, was key part of the Sharks team that finished third in the league in what was their debut season last year. Ingotsi, meanwhile, was also crucial to AFC Leopards, finishing the season strongly but failed to nail down a place in the first team hence his departure.   Posta started the last campaign strongly before fading off to finish sixth overall.
