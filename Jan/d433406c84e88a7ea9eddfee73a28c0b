Former International Bernard Musumba has retired from volleyball. The experienced left attacker said he will now venture into coaching. Until his retirement, the former Kakamega High School student has been playing for the Kenya Ports Authority in the Kenya Volleyball Federation national league. Musumba, who made his debut in the national team in 2005 and having been a regular until 2014, said his exit is meant to pave for upcoming players to also excel and make a name for themselves. “It reaches a point when, as a player, you realize you have done enough and it’s time to quit. I have made the call to retire and try my foot in coaching. I whole heartedly gave my all during the time I played either at a club level or the national team and looking back now I can say I leave the scenes a better person,” said Musumba, who also played beach volleyball alongside Alex Kariuki. He added: “Volleyball in the country is doing good but it can be better. I hope to contribute towards the betterment of the sport in the coming days.” The left attacker, alongside well traveled James Ontere, were the force behind the Mombasa-based outfit en-route finishing third during last season play-off at their backyard at the Makande Hall, in Mombasa. The porters finished third behind Kenya Prisons and eventual winners General Service Unit. Musumba also had stints at Kenya Commercial Bank, KVF champions General Service Unit, Buffalo and Kampala City Council both of Uganda. Musumba exit brings to three the number of former national team players who have recently retired. The others are Ontere (KPA) and veteran Co-operative Bank middle blocker Martin Kimondo who quit late last year.
