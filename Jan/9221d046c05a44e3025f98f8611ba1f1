A High Court has granted bond to a
man who was charged with killing his girlfriend in 2016 in Kakamega county. The man has been in custody for almost two years. The accused G A J, 36, a football coach, was granted
bond of Sh300,000 by Justice Ruth Sitati after
his successful application. While delivering the bond ruling, Justice
Sitati said, “The accused shall also report to Khwisero police station on the
first Monday of every month until the case is heard and determined or until
further orders.” Court documents show
the accused was charged in court on July 4, 2016. He is accused of killing a woman believed to have been his girlfriend after a
quarrel on June 22, 2016
in Khwisero subcounty, Kakamega county. Before plea taking the accused was referred to Mathari Mental Hospital for a psychiatric checkup. A report dated August 31 last year showed he was certified fit
to stand trial. G A J applied for a bond application
after taking a plea in which he denied the murder charge. The application was
opposed by the state who asked for a prebail report to enable the court make
an informed decision on the application. A pretrial report was tabled in court on October 19 last year, showing the accused is a National
Youth Service trained mechanical engineering graduate and is also a football
coach. The report said G A J suffers from
intermittent mental illness since his primary school days and has been on
treatment from 1996. “He is a father of four children but
no wife, has four siblings. When not on treatment, he behaves abnormally by
walking around aimlessly and addressing non-existent crowds,” the report said. Sitati in her ruling said a report
filed by Abisai Kiyunzu showed the accused is however not known to be violent. Kiyunzu
recommended bond on the ground the accused is not a flight risk.
