Eastern is likely to experience an aflatoxin outbreak, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network has said. A report released last week lists Kitui, Makueni, Tharaka Nithi, lower Meru and Embu as the areas likely to be affected. “Inadequate on-farm storage and limited preventive measures could cause aflatoxin poisoning in maize and pulses. Loss of crop could happen from February to May,” the report reads. Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation director general Eliud Kireger said an aflatoxin outbreak could also occur in Machakos, lower Meru and parts of North Rift, where temperatures are above 25 degrees Celsius. Kireger said in bid to address aflatoxin poisoning, the government developed an aflatoxin lab in 2014 to produce a bio-pesticide, Aflasafe, at Kalro-Katumani, Machakos, at a cost of Sh70 million.  lack of funds But farmers are yet to feel the lab’s benefits as it has not been operationalised because of lack of Sh40 million for building a storage facility and buying a generator. The lab was developed through funding from USAID and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in partnership with the government. In 2004, more than 100 people died after consuming toxic maize. The Aflasafe is expected to serve farmers in Machakos, Makueni, Kitui and Taita Taveta counties. In 2010, the government estimated 10 per cent of maize harvest was contaminated by afaltoxin, leading to Sh89 billion losses. Some 155,000 90kg bags of contaminated maize valued at Sh465 million were collected. Aflasafe prevents aflatoxin infection in maize, sorghum and groundnuts when applied to crops after flowering. This could control infestation by 90 per cent and to minimal levels if applied for three years.
