The week-long event has received a major boost with the Ministry of Sports forking out Sh5 million towards the event. Other sponsors for the event include the Chandaria Foundation, Safaricom, Insteel Limited and Kenya Institute of Special Education This the first time the event is being held in the country and will run concurrently with the IPC coaching and athletes training camp featuring 50 participants from various African countries. Maina said the camp is supported by the Agitos Foundation, the development arm of the IPC to the tune of Sh2.5m. She said the event is one of the 31 Para Sport development projects that will receive funding through the 2017 edition of its Grant Support Programme (GSP). The programme is targeting young swimmers and their coaches from the East African region, who are seeking to take part in international competition but lack the resources to attend. Athletes will also participate in Proud Paralympian Workshops, designed to support their development as athletes.
