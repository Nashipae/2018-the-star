Samples from the body of the Briton who died at the Diani police station five years ago have never been analysed. A witness told the inquest proceeding that the samples taken from the body of Alexander Monson were left at the Pandya Memorial Hospital mortuary and no one knows anything about them. The officer attached to the Tourist Department in Diani, Gideo Rono, said he was present when the postmortem was conducted. He told senior principal magistrate Richard Odenyo two pathologists —one representing the family and a second from the government — conducted the postmortem. Rono said two other officers and two mortuary attendants were also present. He said after the postmortem, everyone, including a family friend and pathologist, left without the samples which had been sealed in a box. The officer said he was unaware whether there was any follow up done on the samples left behind under the custody of a mortuary attendant. Rono said the reason why no one, not even the other officers, bothered to take the samples was that they were not given such instructions by their seniors. The officer said the postmortem was also conducted in the presence of a family friend identified only as Dominic. Rono said the external inspection of the body revealed bruises on Monson’s ribs and scrotum. The government pathologist informed him that the bruises on the upper ribs were as a result of resuscitation efforts. The pathologist also said the bruises on the scrotum were as a result of oral sex. Rono said the right side of Monson’s head had a blood clot that could have been caused by a blunt object. It is unclear whether it was inflicted by an individual or was self-inflicted.
