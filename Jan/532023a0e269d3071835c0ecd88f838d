Parents stormed a school in Kajiado on Wednesday demanding that the institution produce a former pupil said to have eloped with a teacher. They said Kikayaya Primary will not be opened for first term until head teacher Daniel Solyo produces the 16-year-old who has been missing since November 20 last year. Richard Ntusero and
Elizabeth Koileken said their daughter obtained 293 marks in last year’s
Kenya Certificate of Primary Education exams. "We have reported the matter to the police in
Isinya but are yet to receive any positive information regarding the girl's whereabouts."
 Jason
Kusero, a member of the school board, said Francis Ayoo, a teacher employed by the board, may have eloped with the girl. "After the matter was reported to police, the
suspect switched off all his phones. He left the school the day the pupil went missing," Kusero said. He claimed the head teacher started a boarding programme at the school without the knowledge of board members and parents. "He allowed Ayoo to manage the institution. This was very wrong because the accused teacher was not qualified," Kusero said. Area MCA Joshua Olowuasa claimed the suspect was caught red-handed last year in a compromising situation with another pupil. Olowuasa added it beat logic for education officials in
Isinya not to have taken action against the head teacher yet the matter was reported to them. "I am pleading with parents to allow the
school to open on Thursday, under the leadership of acting head teacher Solomon Saauinah," the MCA said at the school. Parents said they will not allow their children to stay at the school in Kaputiei North ward, Kajiado
East constituency. Click here for the latest political news
