The conflict at the Murang’a â€‹county assembly is fuelled by the executive, which is undermining the House’s independence, two MPs have said. MPs Muturi Kigano (Kangema) and Alice Wahome (Kandara) did not mention names on Wednesday but condemned the wars that have persisted for more than a fortnight. “The independence of the assembly must be encouraged, enhanced and respected,” Wahome said. Speaking in Mombasa, she criticised the Jubilee leadership for “issuing letters and taking positions”. On Wednesday, Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju nullified the changes to the House leadership that triggered the fights. Tuju said the party disciplinary committee will decide what action to take against the offenders. But Wahome said, “It will be premature to rush to give letters and directives without listening and hearings from MCAs.”  politician injured She said the conflict is being fuelled by individual(s) with “personal or isolated interests that cannot advance the county forward”. “Normally there is line between the executive and assembly where there must find a way of working with each other without undermining the other and making the assembly non-effective,” Wahome said. She said the conflict has been generated by nominated MCAs to undermine the elected ones. “The resolution is for the MCAs’ caucus to agree how the assembly will be run in conjunction with the speaker. Where there is a disagreement, the assembly can vote,” she said. Tuju dismissed the MCA caucus meeting in Kiambu where the new assembly leaders were elected.

On Tuesday, a fistfight broke out in the assembly, when the ‘new’ leaders went to take over ‘their’ offices.  reconciliation On November 26, some nearly exchanged blows as they attempted to evict the assembly clerk. Led by deputy speaker Samuel Kihurunjo, they accused Chris Kinyanjui of violating tender procedures by buying substandard sports kits and uniforms. Kigano said it was wrong for the feuding factions to move to court. “Some grievances will lead to court, but before we rush, we should first of all try to exhaust any reconciliation mechanism,” he said.
