Some Bungoma MCAs yesterday stormed Friends’ School, Kamusinga, a national school, to eject new principal Alex Maina labeling him a ‘failure’ from outside the county. They stopped short of harming him before Police arrived as they escorted him out of the school. (see P36). This is criminal and offensive to public policy. The government has laid out criteria for principals and teachers serving in any school. Principals cannot serve in their home county or last more than seven years in one station. However, politicians including governors, MPs, senators and MCAs in some counties are increasingly appropriating to themselves the role of deciding who should be the principal of a school. Local communities and parents have their role in the administration of schools but it does not include deciding the leadership, which is the prerogative of the employer, TSC. Maina was called a “failure” because Olo Leisser School in Narok county, where he was principal, did not perform as well as Kamusinga, where Edwin Namachanja has served as Principal since 2010. Principals generally do not teach but, through leadership, influence the performance of schools. Whatever its merits, if any, politics must not be allowed in school compounds.
