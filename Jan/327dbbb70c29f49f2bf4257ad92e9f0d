Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi has taken a swipe at Wiper saying the party's demand for the PSC commissioner is "greedy". He said Wiper, a member of the National Super Alliance, had got lucrative positions in Parliament hence should not complain about anything. "Wiper should understand that coalition politics is about "give and take", not bulldozing every time," Otsosi said told The Star on Monday. He said despite ODM qualifying for more slots, it had sacrificed for other partners in the opposition coalition. NASA comprises Wiper, ANC, ODM, and Ford Kenya parties. "If we were to consider party strengths in the August House, ODM would have taken everything but they sacrificed for all of us to get slots," Osotsi added. The legislator said Wiper should be content with the Senate Minority Whip which is held by Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior (Makueni), the nomination of Jessica Mbalu to the speaker's panel, PAC vice chair among other influential committees.

He added that apart from NASA being a coalition, it was important to factor in regional balancing despite the fact that Ford-Kenya, ANC, and Wiper having regional blocks. "If we concentrate on matters of parties alone, we lose as NASA. We need to factor in even regions that didn't give us massive representation," the legislator said. Otsosi said the matter should be handled by the principals in their meeting today (read Monday). "This is a small matter being overblown by a few greedy guys but it can be sorted by the principals." He held that unless some people were being used in Wiper to create a wedge in NASA, the matter is solvable.
