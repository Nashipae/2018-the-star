A trader killed by a stray hippo in Nyahururu will
be compensated, Nyandarua KWS senior warden Jacob Orahle said on Tuesday. Peter Kairu, 38, was killed on Sunday night. He was with a friend, Samuel Wambugu, when they decided to walk to Wambugu’s home
in Mairo Inya, Ndaragwa, at 9pm. Wambugu noticed the animal following them. He said they both tried to escape but Kairu was unlucky. Later that night he tried calling him but he was out of reach. The following day he went back to the scene and found Kairu's injured body. The attack was reported to Nyahururu police and
KWS offices. Speaking when he accompanied Nyandarua officials
to a tour of Lake Ol Boro Osat, senior warden Orahle said the Wildlife Conservation and
Management Act, 2013, provides for compensation when a person is killed or
injured by a wild animal. The individual's family will receive Sh5 million in the case of death. Injuries attract a Sh3 million payout depending on the nature of the injury. The Nyandarua Wildlife Conservation and Compensation Committee will discuss the matter and forward it to the headquarters in Nairobi for processing. “The process should take less than a year, but it depends on whether the money is available," Orahle said. In seven months, six people have been killed
in Nyahururu alone by stray hippo from Manguu Dam.
