Bungoma Education executive Betty Mayeku and chief officer Monica Fedha on Tuesday could not answer bursary queries from the assembly’s Implementation Committee. The nine-member committee is chaired by Khasoko MCA Sitati Makhandia. It summoned the two to explain how the scholarship was being awarded across the county’s 45 wards.
The committee also sought to know why there has been delayed bursary distribution. Khalaba MCA Majimbo Okumu questioned the criteria used to distribute the money. “How is the Sh20 million being issued in the scholarship programme?” he said. The newly sworn in executive excused herself from most of the questions. She has been in office for a day. Sitati asked the two to provide within two days the laws and guidelines used to distribute the bursary.
