Some 50,000 livestock in Laikipia will be fitted with an identification device in an effort to minimise theft, control disease and ease movement. The Low Frequency Identification Device transmits the animal's history and its owner's identity to a database. This will help in marketing livestock products, especially in international markets, and enable consumers to track down information about the animals. The Sh10 million project is a collaboration between the Laikipia government and Kenya Veterinary Association. It was launched on Monday. KVA chairman Samuel Kahariri said the project will be launched countrywide to give Kenya an edge in the local and export meat market. One of the changes the Laikipia government is aiming for is to have pastoralists shift from traditional ways of keeping livestock. It will set up disease-free compartments and fodder reserves to improve the quality and quantity of livestock.
