Tana River Governor Dhadho Godhana has dismissed claims of witch-hunt in the ongoing EACC probe of fictitious tenders at the county. He said the investigation is meant to unearth corrupt deals suspected to have been engineered during Hussein Dado's time in office. The governor said EACC detectives are not investigating the Sh2.1 billion debt but were invited to probe any irregular contracts. Senior county officials have been interrogated by the team led by EACC Coast regional director Simon Cherpka. One of the issues under study is the claim that county officials issued a fictitious contract for a KWS perimeter fence in Garsen. There are also two projects worth Sh78 million which were paid for but were not implemented in Garsen and Bura constituencies. The funds were meant for construction of a weighbridge in Hurara and a modern market in Madogo respectively. Funds for the ventures were wired to the relevant banks accounts of the
beneficiaries. Godhana said no specific individual is being targeted in the ongoing investigation further asking EACC to deal with the matter without portraying his administration as being on a revenge mission. "If there are grounds that will make
them (EACC) to stay, we will not stop them. Ours is to ensure the job is done
well," he said on Saturday. The governor said the Auditor General will
also start reviewing in the county's finances. The presence of the EACC officials as
created panic among some county government staff following the move which could
land some in trouble. Click here for the latest political news
