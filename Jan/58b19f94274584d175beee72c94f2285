Nyamira governor John Nyagarama has dismissed as propaganda, reports that nine senior officers have been barred from resuming their duties. Reports indicated that county secretary Eric Onchana and eight chief officers have not been able to access their offices but Nyagarama said they were 'inaccurate, outrageous and misleading". He said the nine senior county officials reported back to work after exhausting their annual leave days. “So far, none of the officers has reported to me about being unable to get back to work for whichever reasons. Any of the officers who feel aggrieved should bring their issues to my attention,” he said in a statement on Wednesday. “So as to bring them up to speed with ongoing activities at the county, my deputy Amos Nyaribo and I held a meeting with the officers last [Tuesday]. We discussed how to continue working so as to achieve the county’s development agenda," the governor said. “Through such steps, as a county government we have shown our commitment to continuing to work with each and every officer serving the people of Nyamira." He addressed a press conference in Kisumu during the county executive committee members' retreat. Vincent Omao went to court in November last year and obtained an order barring the county from replacing the officials after the positions were advertised in newspapers. The order by the Employment and Labour Relations Court barred the county from sacking the nine without following due procedure. The county government signed the consent order. The court has ordered Nyagarama to appear personally in court on January 25 to face contempt of court charges for not implementing the order. Click here for the latest political news
