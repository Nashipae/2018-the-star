The water shortage in Nanyuki town and environs is expected to end in three years when a water storage facility is completed at the foot of Mt Kenya. The 5.9 million cubic metre reservoir at Likii Central River will cost Sh6 -Sh9 billion.  Speaking during a tour of the Nanyuki Water and Sanitation Company intake on Thursday, Laikipia Water executive Njenga Kahiro said a feasibility study is being undertaken by the World Bank and the national government. The project is expected to supply enough water to residents of Laikipia, Meru and Nyeri counties for the next 25 years. “This is a long-term measure to cushion residents against water shortage. We expect construction of the project to begin any time now,” Kahiro said. He was accompanied by NAWASCO managing director Kennedy Gitonga and chairman Mohamed Yussuf. Kahiro said the county was constructing 15 medium-capacity dams across the wards to enhance water supply.  “Water levels in major rivers have declined and people and animals living downstream are already strained,” Kahiro said.
