 The Murang’a government has warned smokers against lighting up in public places. They face jail terms if convicted. Health executive Joseph Mbai (pictured) yesterday said some residents are disobeying the Tobacco Control Act, which prohibits smoking in public places. Mbai said smoking in public places the health and lives of thousands of peopleat risk. He said from yesterday, anyone found smoking in public in towns will be arrested and prosecuted. “We will strictly enforce the ban safeguard lives because smoking has become rampant in public,” he said. The action was prompted by a public outcry. Delayed enforcement of the Act was caused by shifting enforcement from the national government to the counties. There is a sharp increase in cancer, hypertension and asthma cases attributed to smoking. “The Act is to be implemented by counties. Now we will now swing to action,” Mbai said.
