More than 2,000 former employees of Bomet county have promised to appeal a decision by a Kericho Employment and Labour Relations court to uphold their sacking. Through their lawyer Sigei Bett, the Kericho court dismissed four petitions filed by enforcement officers, community administrators and directors. The group said there was no explanation for their sacking. Bett termed the decision by Judge Njagi Marete unwarranted. He said most of his clients are depressed as a result of the sacking. Most of them had unpaid bank loans. No reason was issued on why the sacking was upheld. “The judge should have kept himself abreast with the complaints raised by his clients first, other than issuing an unfair judgment,” Bett said. The lawyer said he will move to the Court of Appeal next week to challenge the verdict and seek stay orders to have the former staff placed back on the payroll.  Click here for latest political news
