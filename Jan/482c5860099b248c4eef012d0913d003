There are many examples of justice delayed and therefore denied in the Kenyan courts, two of which are reported in today’s paper. The first is an anti-corruption case against eight Traffic police officers that has dragged on in court since October 2014 and which was again deferred to January 25 yesterday (see P13). Four years down the road, the officers have yet to take a plea. The second case concerns the National Building Inspectorate and the National Construction Authority and why it takes so long to demolish dangerously uninhabitable buildings (see P17). The owners of condemned buildings rush to court and start cases that take so long the NIC and NCA cannot actually demolish them. The Judiciary needs to have defined timelines to hear and conclude cases. The timeline guidelines used in the hearing of political petitions should be applied in all cases. Lawyers should not be allowed to plead that they or their clients are sick by way of delaying justice, or any other excuse. Once a case has begun, it should be expeditiously heard to conclusion.
