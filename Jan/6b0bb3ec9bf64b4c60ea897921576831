Pyrethrum farmers from Lelan area, West pokot county have threatened to uproot the crop due to delayed payments and mismanagement of the sub sector by middlemen. Led by former North Rift region director Stephen Yakan, they claim the Pyrethrum Board of Kenya owes them over Sh10 million. The farmers complained that they are unable to meet basic needs and pay school fees for their children. They have given the government a one week ultimatum to act on the issue. The number of farmers in Tapach area has reduced to 200 from the 10,000 since most have decided to grow onions and engage in dairy farming as a way of sustaining their livelihoods. The pyrethrum from the area has been rated the best in the world because of its high content of pyrethrine. “We urge the board to pay our arrears. We want them to pay us every month as it used to be. We are looking for ways to quit this venture because it is useless for us to plant this crop and in the long run we are not paid by the board,” Yakan said. They said the agriculture sector has been devolved and urged the county government to start a processing plant so that they can become independent. Yakan said things have not been working out well since 2002, but they want to ensure they attract private investors in the region, arguing that the board at the moment cannot guarantee farmers quality planting materials nor prompt payment. Tapach, Sonday, Sina and Kameloi areas have favourable climatic condition for pyrethrum which are estimated to produce more than 40000 tones  annually.
