Garissa residents who have encroached on ring road land in the town have been given two weeks to vacate or be forcibly evicted. Those with illegal structures have been ordered to pull them down. Speaking to the press in Garissa yesterday, Lands executive Mohamed Shale said the administration has developed a plan for the land, and would allocate plots afresh to members of the public who genuinely need them. Shale said the county government plans to allocate over 10,000 parcels in the next six months. “Some people have grabbed land and are sub-dividing it. It is illegal,” he said. “Any structure on the ring road is illegal. People claiming to own that land must know it is belongs to the government,” Shale said. “We have application forms and those in need of land. A committee will determine the criteria for application. It will be transparent. Nobody will be shortchanged,” he said. Meanwhile, residents who have put up structures along the Kismayu and Lamu roads have also been given two weeks to demolish them, failure to which the county them at the owners’ cost. The ring road was established by the defunct Garissa Municipal Council to regulate land following growing demand. The ring road was referred to as Usalama Scheme. Land cartels and private  developers colluded with corrupt county officials to allocate land outside the ring road. During Jamhuri Day celebrations, Governor Ali Korane promised to allocate land to Garissa residents. He said there was enough land in town, but a few greedy individuals had fenced off a huge chunk for speculation purposes.
