Japanese football international midfielder Keisuke Honda will launch the ‘Africa Dream Soccer Tour’ in Kenya on January 27 at the Ligi Ndogo grounds along Ngong Road, Nairobi. The charity tour is aimed at identifying and nurturing 100 football talent from among the less fortunate and vulnerable children at Kibera slums. The program has already been launched in Rwanda and Honda is set to extend the initiative to Uganda and Kenya. Honda, through his manager Motoki Futamura, have already formed partnership with a school in Kibera and Ligi Ndogo football Academy. “Two Japanese coaches will be attached to the program and will provide free football education. We are already in partnership with Magoso School in Kibera and we support children from this institution,” said Honda. The program, which has been sponsored by leading Japanese automobile exporter to Africa Car-Tana.com and an international NGO- SATO, will seek to scout for top talent to enroll at Ligi Ndogo Academy on a long term basis. Honda turns out for Japan’s national team and C.F. Pachuca, a top league side in the Mexican football and is under the management of Honda Estilo.
