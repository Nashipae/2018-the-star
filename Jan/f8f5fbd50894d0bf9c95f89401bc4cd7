The Ministry of Education has released colour codes that schools are expected to use in painting their buses. In a circular dated January 25, the ministry said the paint must be chrome and unleaded. Schools have to adhere to the recommended yellow. The yellow has been described as “pantone solid coated 012c: C 1.75 per cent M 12.23 per cent Y 100 per cent K0”. “Schools are required to seek the services of a qualified painter for the work,” the circular reads. In line with the Traffic (Amendment) Act 2017, CS Fred Matiang’i ordered that all school vehicles be painted yellow by March 31. School names have to be written in black and the buses fitted with safety belts designed for use by children. The changes are meant to improve the safety of pupils and teachers.
