The judgment on the petition challenging the election of Garissa Township MP Aden Duale will be delivered on February 27. High Court judge Hedwig Ongudi set the date after parties concluded their submissions on Thursday. Duale, who is also the Majority Leader in the National Assembly, asked the court to dismiss a petition. He said the claims of irregularities committed during the election were not true. Duele asked the court to award him Sh5 million in costs. His lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi said petitioner Farah Maalim made massive allegations of anomalies but failed to back them with evidence. Maalim said there was improper relay and transmission of results during the August 8, 2017 election. Maalim said the irregularities affected the results of the poll. Duale said the election was free, fair and transparent. He said there was no evidence of unfair treatment of either of the candidates. “There is no evidence of campaigns during the election day. The campaigns ended on August 5, 2017. No one adduced evidence on behalf of the petitioner that she was an agent and was ejected from any polling station," he argued. Duale said the appointment of Retuning Officer Boru Duba was procedural and there was no objection from any political party, including Maalim's Wiper party.
