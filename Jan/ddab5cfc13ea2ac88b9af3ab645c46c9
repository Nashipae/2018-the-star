Dozens of youths in Teso South subcounty have threatened to torch lorries used to build the 28km Busia-Malaba road. On Tuesday they held demonstrations at Amase Bridge, disrupting transport for more than five hours. They accused the contractors of conning them.  Yesterday, they told the Star they have worked for three months as casual labourers, but have not been paid their dues. “We will chase away the contractor and burn the vehicles if they fail to pay us,” casual labourer Joseph Emojong said. “They are just buying time and making empty promises. We had been contracted to clear the roads for expansion, but we have not been paid.” The youths accused Kenasia Holdings Ltd management of not listening to their pleas. But company manager Joseph Ochock denied the claims, saying those contracted have been paid. Locals and businessmen have been criticising the contractor for being too slow and applying poor workmanship. “They have not erected any signage and many accidents have been reported. Recently, a vehicle belonging to the firm knocked down a motorcyclist with two pillion passengers on board, killing one on the spot,” resident Richard Okoit said.
