They are bishops Philip Kubai, Stanley Karuru and Moses Ntoeruri. They were laid to rest in church compounds within their respective dioceses. Present were Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi, Halima Mucheke (nominated), Moses Kuria (Gatundu South), Kubai Kiringo (Igembe Central), speaker Joseph Kaberia (Meru), John Mutunga (Tigania West) and Beatrice Nkatha (Tharaka Nithi Woman Representative). Others are MPs John Paul Mwirigi (Igembe South), Moses Kirima (Imenti Central), Maoka Maore (Igembe North), Mpuru Aburi (EALA), Kawira Mwangaza (Meru Woman Representative) and Mithika Linturi (Meru senator).
