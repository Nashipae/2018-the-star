Former Kenyan Premier League champions Tusker are trailing free agent Kenyan international, Joseph Okumu as they seek to replacements for Martin Kiiza and James Situma. Okumu, 20, terminated his contract with his South African PSL side Free State Stars in July and breweries are understood to be interested in offering a home to the club-less centrehalf. Okumu, formerly of Chemilil Sugar, made his Harambee Stars debut in May 2016 where Kenya held Sudan to a one-all draw in a friendly match at Kasarani. He returned to the senior team in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier away to Sierra Leone where Stars succumbed 2-1. An unusual sixth finish by Tusker in the 2017 season received a sour welcome from the big boys in Ruaraka, occasioning a massive overhaul of the playing unit where nine senior players were let go. Tusker also leaked in the goals, finishing with a difference of -1, forcing the club to do away with Kiiza and Situma, the skipper who led them to the title in 2016. Tusker chairman Daniel Aduda said Okumu will be an ideal signing for the club as he has both local and international exposure to the game. Aduda exuded confidence in landing the rookie alongside Ugandan prospect, Lawrence Kasava. “We are in talks with Okumu, a player who is young but experienced. We are also in talks with another Ugandan, Lawrence Kasava, where I believe the two will solve our defensive crisis. They have shown their calibre at their clubs and impressed us and we are confident they will pen contracts with us.” Aduda further disclosed that the club are close to landing a new coach following the deaprtute of Ugandan George Nsiimbe. “We have worked on our list of applicants who were more than 100 and soon we shall reveal our new coach,” said Aduda.
