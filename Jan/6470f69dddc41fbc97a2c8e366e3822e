The chairperson of Bumulusi, a CBO which advocates for safe abortion in Navakholo subcounty in Kakamega on Thursday said 20 students have procured safe abortions and returned to school. Addressing parents at Nambacha market Pamela Wambongo said that the school girls conceived during Christmas holidays. “They were referred to us and after counselling them, we referred then to health facilities we are working with in promoting safe abortions," Wambongo said. According to her, this has avoided possible deaths or permanent complications that could results from them using crude methods to procure abortions. Wambongo said the pregnancies were caused by local dances popularly known as disco matanga. She also noted that boda body riders take advantage of young girls not just in Kakamega alone but the whole country. Bumulusi is one of the CBOs supported by IPAS Alliance Africa in Sexual Reproductive Health Rights (SRHR). Medics from health facilities offering comprehensive abortion care in Khwisero and Navakholo subcounties of Kakamega said in November that stigma associated with abortion continues to keep away women in need of safe abortions from visiting hospitals for the services in the county. They said that young women fear seeking the services from them because working hours of health facilities are unfriendly to them. The medics said they receive an average of 10 women seeking to procure safe abortions every month. There is raging debate as to whether abortion should be legalised in Kenya or not. The Constitution outlaws abortion in the country, unless recommended by a qualified a doctor to save either the life of the mother or the child. Wambongo said the organisation should not be misconstrued to promote abortion. She said the campaigns are meant to ensure that abortions are safe, if they are to be performed for whatever reasons.
