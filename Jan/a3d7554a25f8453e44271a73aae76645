Despite his victory in an election petition, Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o still faces other battles. Former Governor Jack Ranguma yesterday received a blow after the High Court in Kisumu dismissed his petition against Nyong’o. But Nyong’o will still have to tackle an array of issues to ensure he realises his development agenda during his first year in office. The issues include the setback over the relocation of the Kachok Dumpsite to Kajulu area in Kisumu East constituency that was stopped by the court. This is after two residents sought the court’s conservatory orders stopping the county from relocating the dumpsite to the area. They argued transferring the site to Kajulu could expose residents to toxic substances seeping from the dumpsite to River Kibos and boreholes in the neighbourhood. Being one of the flagship projects he had pledged to fulfill within 100 days in office, Nyong’o is facing a challenge implementing the project as residents watch how the issue unfolds. The Kachok dumpsite has been a menace for decades with its transfer remaining a major topic and was one of the tools that was used against t Ranguma during campaigns. Nyong’o also faces the hurdle of solving internal wrangles within his administration that have been spewed into the public glare. At the start of this year, local leaders, including Senator Fred Outa and Speaker Onyango Oloo, renewed attacks against the county government, accusing Deputy Governor Mathews Owili of scheming to destabilise Nyong’o’s administration. They accused Owili of working with some MPs in the county to undermine Nyong’o. Outa said Nyong’o was ready to work for the people and anybody with ulterior plans will not succeed because he will stand with him to fast track development. This has not gone well with the residents who claimed that constant bickering by the county leaders would affect service delivery. All this has been happening in the absence of Nyong’o who is in the US on official duty.
