A Catholic school at the centre of a protracted ownership dispute pitting Catholic nuns and an American missionary has launched a legal bid to remain open. Students and teachers at St Mary’s High School, Langata, were chased out of the school on January 3 by auctioneers, and policemen acting on a court order in the ongoing ownership tussle. This was after a Nakuru court on September 29 declared Assumption Sisters of Nairobi (ASN) the legal owners of St Mary’s Mission Hospital, which includes the institution. The ownership dispute between the nuns and Dr William Fryda has been in court for more than six years. The school, through the board has now filed a new application in which it seeks orders to compel the sisters to reopen the school. When the matter came up before Justice Joseph Sergon (pictured) yesterday, the nuns sought for more time to file and serve more documents that will show they legally took over the management of the property located in Lang’ata and Elementaita. Consequently, the judge gave the Assumption sisters three days to respond ahead of a hearing on February 6. Principal Alexander Kimanjara says the closure has jeopardised the future of the students and staff. “The nuns have taken over the principal’s office with all records and books belonging to the students and school,” Kimanjara says in an affidavit. The nuns, however, term the case an abuse of the court process and have asked the court to dismiss it.
