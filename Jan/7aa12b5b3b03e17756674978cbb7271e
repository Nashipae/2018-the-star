Kalenjins in Nakuru have demanded an apology from Governor Lee Kinyanjui over sentiments of Kikuyu hawkers being "mistreated" in Uasin Gishu. Andrew Yatich, Nakuru county peace coordinator, said the governor must stop balkanising communities ahead of the 2022 succession politics. "What came out of the Governor's mouth is unfortunate and shocking
for a leader who all the communities voted for overwhelmingly." Franciscah Kamuren, a former MP aspirant, said she regrets the governor failed to appreciate the county's fragility after the 2007/08 post-poll chaos. "This county has had a dark past. It is regrettable that he (Kinyanjui) had to
invoke the names of the communities," she told The Star on Monday. "We are trying to enhance cohesion that can help all the communities live harmoniously for
the common good of their prosperity," Kamuren added. Kinyanjui, during the homecoming of Bahati MP Kimani
Kiunjuri last Saturday, told Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago to "accommodate hawkers the way Kalenjins are being hosted
in Nakuru county." In a statement, he said that he
stands by his remarks adding that the issues he raised should not be ignored but
solved through dialogue. But former Kuresoi MP James Koske said the governor seems confused about the role he was elected for. A section of Kalenjins from Nakuru says the governor has confessed what he has at heart. They said the sentiments confirmed that the county chief views Kalenjins as visitors in Nakuru. The lot cited that this is revealed on how the county administration shared top jobs among them county secretary, chief of staff, finance and roads CECs.
