The Siaya government will pay for one million youths to attend NASA leader Raila Odinga's swearing-in on
January 30 in Uhuru Park, Governor Cornel Rasanga has said. They will be given a meal of soda and bread.  Rasanga was speaking on Saturday in Tingare village, Ugunja constituency, during the
funeral of seven family members who perished at Sultan Hamud in December
22. He said the swearing-in will not be postponed. “Even today before I came here, Raila told me to
tell you that the swearing-in ceremony is for real,” he added. He said the swearing-in would jump-start
the process of seceding from the "autocratic" Jubilee government, "which has perpetually
orchestrated wanton corruption, among many other vices". Sigomere ward MCA
Erick Odawa said for the country to be peaceful and to enjoy the fruits of devolution, Raila must be sworn in.
