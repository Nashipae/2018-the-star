A High Court judge has summoned Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to explain why he has failed to arrest the Defence PS over payment of a former KDF commandant. Justice George Odunga gave the orders after PS Peter Kaberia was issued at least two warrants of arrest and the IG was told to execute them, but they were not honoured. “Following failure of the PS to appear in court and explain why the ministry has no paid former Kenya Defence Forces commandant a sum of Sh5.3million, I summon the IG to come and explain why the warrant of November 14, 2017 has not been executed,” Odunga said. However, the defence lawyer told the court he was not aware of the proceedings that gave right to the notice of motion. Former KDF commandant Silvanus Otieno, who is the applicant,  through his lawyer told Odunga he had written severally to the IG and the Defence ministry and copied it to the DOD raising the issue. Wrongful termination Otieno in the affidavits said he filed a suit in 2009 citing wrongful termination from his post as a commanding officer in the Armed Forces Ordinance Depot. He said High Court judge Linnet Ndolo heard the suit and awarded him Sh5 million on July 2014. There was also a taxation ruling of costs on Sh335,550 on November 21, 2014. “The respondent has failed to honour the debt hence the instant judicial review proceedings and he has not demonstrated any legal reasons why they have not honoured the decree,” the affidavit reads. Affidavit In February last year, Kaberia filed a replying affidavit saying he was informed by the Attorney General Otieno had moved to court seeking orders to have him committed to civil jail for alleged disobedience of orders issued by the court on June 2015. Kaberia said he is the accounting officer in the Ministry of Defence, but did not owe Otieno any sum of money. “I am aware any liability or expenditure incurred against the government can only be defrayed from money provided for by Parliament,” Kaberia said.
