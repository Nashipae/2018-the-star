The county government has started permanent resettlement plans for hawkers from the City Centre. Lands executive Wachira Njuguna said the county has done all the groundwork for Mwariro market in Kariokor. It will be ready in three months. “Groundbreaking should be on February 1 and the project is scheduled to be ready in 12 months,” he said. Njuguna said Karandini market in Dagoretti is also part of the project and will be completed in 90 days. The county also aims to complete City Park market and create 1,200 stalls. Njuguna said the new Wakulima market on Kangundo Road, which is scheduled for completion mid-this year, will also accommodate hawkers from the City Centre. Mwariro and Karandini markets had been earlier identified by Governor Mike Sonko as designated places where hawkers will be relocated. The county government received Sh650 million from the World Bank for the construction of Mwariri and Kariokor markets. Sonko said he will engage stakeholders on the hawkers issue.
