A chief, her assistant and three members of Nyumba Kumi Initiative will be held at Naromuru police station to allow police officers complete investigation in a matter they could be charged with murder charges. The five were yesterday arraigned before Nanyuki Chief Magistrate Lucy Mutai where they could be charged with the death of a chang’aa dealer Wachira Kabui two months ago. The State told the court that it intends to institute murder charges against Gakawa location Chief Lucy Wanja, Equator Sub-location assistant chief Getrude Koki and three members of Nyumba Kumi initiative, Loyford Mwirigi, George Wachira and Mary Nyambura. Kieni East DCIO Richard Kioko told the court that only Five suspect out of 12 have been arrested, and that he needed more time to apprehend the others. Kioki also noted that the Five needed to be taken to a psychologist for mental examination. When the five appeared in court, they were first accused of causing grievous harm to a man who was in the company of the deceased on November 31 last year. They were accused of causing grievous harm to Duncan Gitonga Mbuthia, 50. However, before they could plead guilty or not to the charges, the prosecution told the court that the State intends to prefer murder charges against them. On the grievous harm charge, each was released on a Sh100,000 bond with a surety of similar amount or a Sh60,000 cash bail. The case will be heard on March 20. “We intend to file a miscellaneous application to have the accused persons who are murder suspects detained at Naromoru Police Station for 14 days to allow detectives complete investigations,” Kioko told the court. Kabue,46, was clobbered to death at his Ichuga village home, Nyeri County on the night of October 31 last year during a crackdown on illicit brews. He met his death at the hands of people who were telling him to produce chang’aa he was alleged to have been hiding in his compound. Click here for latest political news
