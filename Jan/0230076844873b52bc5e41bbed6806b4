The High Court has ordered giant soft drink maker to put nutritional information and customer care details on its glass bottles within six months. Justice Joseph Onguto while delivering his judgement said that by not giving full details on the glass bottles that the plastic bottles has, amounts to discrimination. He directed Nairobi Bottlers company to ensure that the nutritional information, email address and storage directions are displayed on the soft drinks including Coca-Cola, Fanta, Krest and Stoney. In the case, Mark Ndung’u moved to court accusing the bottler of denying its consumers the much needed information. He said as a consumer of Coca Cola drink in glass bottle, he felt discriminated by failing to display nutritional information, email address and storage directions on glass bottle. He argued that all consumers are equally entitled to access the information on the labels and as such, there was no justification as to why the information was not available in the glass bottles. Ndung’u complained that the size of the bottles, both plastic and glass, was equal, but instead of giving the said information in both, the soft drink maker was using the available space for brand names in big print. He argued that the relevant nutritional information was critical to consumers in exercising a healthy drinking habit with the right amounts of calories which is critical in avoiding lifestyle diseases such as obesity. Nairobi Bottlers however argued that Ndung’u should have first exhausted the mechanisms available, to address the matter, before moving to court. The company said the attempt by the petitioner to give the case a constitutional claim dimension was wrong.
