Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi has criticised President Uhuru Kenyatta’s New Year’s message, saying it was hollow and full of lies. Mulyungi said the number of jobs created, water supplied, kilometres of road tarmacked and the number of households supplied with electricity were Uhuru’s “greatest lies” because “none of it is evident at his constituency.” During his statement at State House Nairobi, Uhuru listed his government’s achievements during his first term. “For the last five years the Jubilee government has been in power, my constituency has not gotten a single kilometre of tarmac or any mega project. “I am inviting the President to tour my constituency and show residents the massive development he claims to have actualised across the nation,” Mulyungi said. He called Uhuru a dictator and said said many Kenyans have died on his watch. The MP said, “The only achievement Uhuru has made is seeing Kenyans lose billions in corruption as well as undergoing immense suffering due to endless labour strikes.” Mulyungi said the ongoing political wrangles will scare away investors and hurt the economy. He called upon Uhuru to show leadership.
