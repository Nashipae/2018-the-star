Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua now wants his Maendeleo Chapchap party to be allocated key positions in Jubilee's Cabinet. He said it will be a good move to show gratitude for the support the party offered to Jubilee during the campaigns and elections. Mutua wants President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto to reserve positions for his party members in the Cabinet and Parastatals. "We are going to ask very strongly that our participation is felt in terms of members of parliament in committees, in county assembly and also in appointment of cabinet secretaries, ambassadors, permanent secretaries and other high officials," he said.

The county chief said corruption and embezzlement of public funds are the biggest challenges the Jubilee administration faces. “We are aware that President Uhuru Kenyatta was a man under siege in his first term. He was under siege because when you are running for re-election you have to do something we call a balancing act. "We feel that he may not have been able to hit hard on the agents of corruption because of political considerations," Mutua said. Click here for latest political news
