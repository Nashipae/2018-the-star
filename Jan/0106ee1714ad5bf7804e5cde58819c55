DK Kwenye Beat was a guest on Classic 105 with Nick Mudimba. He talked about hitting the gym now that he has been body-shamed, and his 2018 plans for music. "Unajua kila mtu akona different view on kila mtu ako na weight," DK said, "And you know the best thing my fans wanaona maybe inaweza affect my health na vitu kama hizo. But kama kitu hamjui, niko mzuri sana." Dk is currently on a media tour for his latest release, Kijana wa Kayole. "This is a song that people should know where I'm coming from. And also to motivate and encourage the guys from that area. You know, they face drug abuse, unemploymentÂ and such, but the good thing is, you can make it in life, without toppling over to the dark side. Coming from the same background and making something of myself, shows that you can make it." Nick then asked him if gospel music is really glorifying the Most High. And if the current crop of musicians have lost their way. "I cannot say they have lost it, because I'm still in the same generation, so we've lost it in one way or another. But the good thing is that people have realised and we are back on course and we're ready to transform the gospel to the next level," DK said.
