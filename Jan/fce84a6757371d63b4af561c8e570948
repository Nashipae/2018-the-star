Starring: Édgar Ramírez, Darren Criss, Ricky Martin, Penélope Cruz Genre: True crime Based on: Vulgar Favors: Andrew Cunanan, Gianni Versace, and the Largest Failed Manhunt in US History, by Maureen Orth Premier: 17th January 2018  The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story is an anthology TV series documenting real and high-profile crimes. The first season, The People vs OJ Simpson: American Crime Story, took us through the painstakingly long and controversial court trial of OJ Simpson. For the second season, the creators have come back to narrate the tale of the infamous murder of Gianni Versace. The story also gives a in-depth insight into Versace’s murderer, Andrew Cunanan. The show opens with Versace walking up in his Miami mansion, having breakfast and going on a morning stroll. Meanwhile, Cunanan has been sitting at the beach, watching the sun rise. Cunanan waits outside the Mansion for Versace. When he sees Versace returning from his walk, he walks up to him and shoots him twice at point-blank range. The show then moves back and forth in time, exploring the meeting of the two and their relationships. In the aftermath of the shooting, we are introduced to Donatella and Santo Versace, who take up the running of the family company. We also follow the FBI on their manhunt for Cunanan, who was listed as one of the most wanted people by the FBI, for murdering four other people. The show is an extravagance of fashion and style, as is befitting of the Versace dynasty. Part of the show was filmed in the original Versace mansion in Miami. And whilst the glitz and glamour certainly bring authenticity, the main attraction is Darren Criss’s mesmerising portrayal of the psychopath Cunanan. Although only one episode has aired, this show has signs of a great production that will be exceedingly successful.  Star Rating: 4/5
