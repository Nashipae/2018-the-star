Drummer Amani Baya and guitarist Jack Muguna have still not been released after they were arrested by Nema on Sunday night for alleged noise pollution. They were performing at an event hosted at Marquee Sky Bar & Lounge, Westlands. The latest update is that they appeared before the judge at about 3.45pm on Monday after a whole-day wait, and were slapped with a Sh200,000 bail, which could not be processed in the time they had till the end of court business. Their friends have managed to get legal representation from some well-wishers and from the venue owner at Marquee Lounge as well, who has also been working to get them out.
