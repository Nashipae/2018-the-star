South Sudanese rebels have refused to release two Kenyan pilots until compensation is paid to the family of a civilian killed when their plane crash-landed. The rebel’s deputy spokesman, Lam Gabriel, yesterday told Reuters that the plane crash-landed in the Greater Upper Nile region two weeks ago. A woman and some cows were killed during the incident. “When the plane crashed, it took a life. A lady and some animals were killed. The relatives of the lady and the owners of the cows are complaining and they want compensation,” Gabriel said.

Machar, the country’s former vice president, is the head of the largest rebel faction but has been held under house arrest in South Africa since 2016. South Sudan’s military spokesman confirmed the two pilots were being held. “The plane had a technical problem. It crash-landed and killed a person on the ground,” said Brigadier General Lul Ruai Koang. “The rebel-appointed governor of the area has demanded the ransom of Sh20 million, which is beyond normal compensation for any person killed,” Koang added. The Kenyan foreign ministry said it was unable to comment. Oil-rich South Sudan has been riven by civil war since 2013. The conflict has displaced a third of the population, shut down most of the oil production and wrecked the economy.
