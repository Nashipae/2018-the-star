Chiefs in Western have been asked to ensure students who got admission to join Form One go to school. Speaking to the press from his office last week, Western regional coordinator Mongo Chimwaga said there has been low enrolment this year, compared to the past years. He cited Mt Elgon as the most affected, with only 40 per cent of the students being admitted. Chimwaga said local politicians and education stakeholders should intervene. “Students who sat the KCPE exam last year should be in school as soon as possible.” Chimwaga cautioned illicit brew traders, saying the business picked up after the election. “Last year we had succeeded in bringing down the brew sales in the region, but we have observed an upsurge lately,” he said. Ugandan spirits and liquor have also flooded the market. “We are in discussion with the team in Malaba and Busia to seal the porous border and ensure no illicit liquor comes from the neighbouring country.”
