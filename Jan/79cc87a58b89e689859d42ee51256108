A funeral in Siruti village, Awendo, was called off after family members exchanged blows over the arrangement on Sunday. Mourners scampered for safety as family members exchanged blows and attacked each other using chairs. Police had to intervene and take the body of the 13-year-old girl to Rapcom Mortuary in Awendo town. The family was fighting over her coffin. Her father Charles Obange did not involve his ex-wife in the funeral plans. She is the girl’s mother. Siruti chief Orpa Otieno said the disagreement had been going on during preparations and only became worse on the burial day. “The family was divided into those supporting the husband and those on the wife’s side. When the body was brought for burial the previous night tension was already high,” Otieno said. Family member Oluoch Obange said the decision by the girl’s father was unfortunate and that he refused any attempt to make peace in the homestead.
