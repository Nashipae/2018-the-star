Politicians who come from areas where FGM is prevalent have been accused of failing to fight the vice for fear of losing their seats. Outgoing Kenya Women Parliamentary Association chairperson Cecily Mbarire said the leaders’ stand frustrates the fight against girls’ circumcision.  Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, Mbarire said the organisation applied pressure for eradication of the outlawed practice, but faced stiff opposition in areas where it is commonly practiced. “You find in communities that practice FGM, many politicians from those areas are shy to fight it head-on for fear of losing support. That makes it difficult to fight it and it takes us backward,” Mbarire said. She said the government is proactive in fighting the practice that has numerous health and social problems.  The nominated Jubilee MP and National Assembly Deputy Chief whip said the fight against FGM is also curtailed by the fact that it’s a cultural and private issue.  She said it’s private in the sense that people who practice FGM are able to hide. The MP said during the just-ended holidays, cases of female circumcision were rampant.  Mbarire said she will not defend her seat as Kewopa chair because she does nots want to cling to power like former Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe.
