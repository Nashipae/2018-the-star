The Ministry of Education has created a new department to handle teacher education and training. The directorate seeks to help in implementation of the new teachers’ training framework and outline the standards required for a practicing teacher. The framework’s main focus will be to make the teacher a facilitator. The directorate dubbed ‘directorate of teacher education’ will oversee in-service teachers and those in teachers training colleges in the Early Child Development Education and primary school level. For in-service teachers, the directorate will be responsible for coordinating teacher training in digital skills, new curriculum and improving the numeracy level. The training will be part of the government plan to improve the teaching in pre-primary and primary schools.
