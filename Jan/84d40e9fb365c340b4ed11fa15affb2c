As the country waits for President Uhuru Kenyatta to name his Cabinet, a Nyandarua MCA urged him not to shortchange Nyandarua “as the case has been”.  Wanjiku Muhoho on Friday said up to 90 per cent of registered voters turned out to vote and 99 per cent voted for Uhuru. Muhoho spoke in Ol Kalou.  He said the county is yet to be rewarded for its loyalty.
