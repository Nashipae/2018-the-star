Kenya Shooting Sports Federation have quashed the previous selection of full-bore marksmen for this year’s Commonwealth Games and will instead hold fresh trials at the Defence Forces Rifle Range in Nanyuki at the end of this month. The incoming captain Sanford Otundo, three-time Kenya open holder Christopher Saina and John Ihugo had been short listed for the games by the previous full-bore leadership but KSSF reversed the decision. The three—Otundo, Saina and Ihugo—still have a chance to qualify as they will be joined by Anthony Dodds, Michael Lekalaile and the fast-raising lady Grace Rantile of General Service Unit. The above firers posted top six percentiles per shoot last year, ranging from 93.521 by Saina and 91.898 of Rantile. Once again, it is a no show for the soldiers. The six will be vying for the single slot allotted to full-bore division. The trials will be based best of five under the Commonwealth Games score format. In the meantime, the full-bore captain Otundo is positive the Kenyan full-bore team will exhibit brutal competition and in turn improve on their overseas performance this year. “We will fly in one or two professional coaches from abroad to train our shooters (at a fee) and I am sure this will ameliorate our scores across all distances. Last year, the ladies were fired up and I hope the coaching will boost their skill levels,” said Otundo, the Kenya Open defending champion. Last year, the national team—fully drawn from the National Police Service— represented the country at the UK Bisley and hauled a total of 48 medals but without a single gold. They garnered six silver medals and one Bronze medal, three HPS (Highest Possible Score) crosses and 38 bronze.
