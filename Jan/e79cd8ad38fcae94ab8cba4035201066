Homa Bay speaker Elizabeth Ayoo has urged politicians to stop early campaigns and let MCAs deliver on their election pledges. She claimed some politicians, whom she did not name, have began their bid to take over MCAs’ seats in 2022. “It is too early to start campaigning against somebody who is just three months old in office. Instead of doing so, you should join hands and develop our county,” Ayoo said. She spoke yesterday in West Kasipul ward after meeting ward development stakeholders. Ayoo said persistent politicking in the county will paralyse development. She said, “You will also need others’ support if you’re elected. You should wait for the right time.” Ayoo urged locals to ignore early campaigners, adding they are not interested in development. She said, “I appeal to our people to give them a deaf ear since they are only interested in wasting other people’s time so they don’t discharge their mandate.” Ayoo urged residents to attend public participation fora and give their views on the development agenda.
