Vihiga Senator George Khaniri yesterday said NASA is focussed on achieving electoral justice, not sharing government with Jubilee. He said NASA leaders are not interested in a national unity government. “We have seen Jubilee has named a partial government in the hope that opposition may come in, but we’re telling them we are not interested in sharing,” he told the Star on the phone. Khaniri said pushing a national unity government by diplomats is a ploy by Jubilee to conceal electoral fraud. He said all NASA leaders are still committed to have Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka sworn in as the People’s President and Deputy President, respectively. NASA has set January 30 for the swearing-in at Uhuru Park, Nairobi. NASA principals Raila, Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetang’ula have said they are ready to dialogue with Jubilee. Khaniri urged Kenyans to support the push for electoral justice, saying the reforms will benefit future generations. “Elections were stolen in 2007, 2013 and 2017. You never know whose victory will be stolen next,” he said.
