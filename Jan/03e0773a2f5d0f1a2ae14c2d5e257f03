Many Mwingi locals are still stranded after fares were hiked to Sh1,000. The had hoped the fares would drop. The current bus fare is the highest that has been witnessed in Mwingi. The highest it had ever been was Sh800.  Passengers expressed concern they will be late for school, while others missed work. Some borrowed money to top up what they had. “It has been two days since schools opened. The bus fare started at Sh800 on Tuesday, but on Wednesday, it shot to Sh1,000 from Mwingi, Thika and Nairobi. This Sh1,000 is what the passengers from Mwingi to Mombasa usually pay on normal days. I’m just wondering if the distance has doubled. Why all this extortion?” wondered Muli Mutisya, a stranded passenger in Mwingi. Muli said it is unfair for bus owners to extort struggling passengers. He said the owners should be considerate of the fact many parents are taking their children back to school. He called upon the government to regulate bus fares. “The fuel cost is just the same so I cannot understand why there is a hike of fares,” Muli said.
