Blue Bombers floored Tukoyo FC 6-5 to be crowned the new champions of the Muteshi Cup. Bombers had their win sealed from post-match penalties after battling Tukoyo for 1-1 draw in the regular time.                                               Bombers trailed until the last 10 minutes when forward Nixon Ambeyi rifled in the equalizer to force the game into post-match penalties.  Tukuyo, who impressed in the 16-team tournament, were the better side during the first half with Benson Atsango and Victor Shisundi terrorising Bombers defence with tricky dribbling skills and electrifying pace that exposed keeper Stanislaus Atsango.  Nixon Shiceheyi put Tukoyo ahead in the 35th minute with a brilliant volley that  hit the roof of the net. Tukuyo would have doubled their lead with few minutes to the break when Eliud Kibet pounced on a long ball inside the box but his shot went off target with the goal keeper already beaten.  With three minutes to full time, Loyan Ikumilu lifted a cross the from the right wing and Nixon Ambeyi was rightly placed to head the ball home sparking wild celebrations from the Bombers side. Loyan Ikumilu, Geoffrey Atsango, Nixon Ambeyi, Carlos Mukabwa and Moses Muhanji converted for Bombers while Julias Kirerei, Nelson Shichenje, Eliud Kibet and Edwin Doo scored for Tukuyo.  Earlier on Samba FC edged Simba FC 4-3 in post-match penalties for the third and fourth playoffs after the two teams laboured for a one all draw in the regulatipn time. Bombers received Sh20,000, a trophy and while Tukoyo pocketed Sh15,000 and kit.
