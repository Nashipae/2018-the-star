The Mandera ssembly has threatened to sue Attorney General Githu Muigai for allegedly listing them among the counties that passed the People’s Assemblies motion.
Speaking to the Star on the phone, speaker Aden Khalif said it was unfortunate the AG relied on social media to arrive at the decision. On Monday, the AG moved to court to challenge the formation of the People’s Assemblies in a case filed under the certificate of urgency against 15 county assemblies and the council of governors.
The AG asked the court to declare the formation of the entities illegal and unconstitutional.
“I want to make it very clear the Mandera county assembly has never discussed the motion leave alone passing it. We are demanding an immediate apology from the AG’s office, failing which we will seek legal redress,” Khalif said.
“I personally feel saddened by the AG’s actions. As the government’s legal adviser, he ought to know better. By going to court without seeking clarification from us, he shows how clueless he is,” the speaker said.
Speaking separately, Majority leader Abdi Hassan wondered how they would have passed the motion on January 9 while they went  on recess on January 7 and the Hansard can prove that.
“This is a conspiracy orchestrated by the Mandera executive. Somebody is hell-bent on maligning our name by making it look like we are anti-government,” Hassan said.
MPs from Mandera county also dismissed the claims. Through Mandera West MP Adan Yusuf, the legislators also demanded that the AG retracts the remarks lest they seek legal action. They spoke in Nairobi yesterday.
The counties that have passed the motion include Siaya, Vihiga, Homa Bay, Kakamega, Busia, Bungoma, Migori, Kisumu, Mombasa, Kitui, Makueni, Kilifi, Kwale, Machakos and Mandera.  
Khalif said the claims could hurt the reputation of the Economic Freedom Party, which is the majority in the assembly.
