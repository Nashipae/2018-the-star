The memory we have of 2007 as Kenyans is still a fright to many. The post-election period, which turned out to be full of serious tribal violence, caught many people off-guard. Jalang'o was no exception. He narrated what he went through back then. He used to live in Mwiki, where his landlord and neighbours were Kikuyu. He remembers sending his neighbours to buy him food, as he could not leave his house because everyone knew he was a Luo. He was locked up in the house during the post-election violence. The area was unsafe for him, yet he was well-versed with the Kikuyu language. At that point, he learned to live in an area of people away from his tribe. His roommate was a Kikuyu, who housed him there before he could afford his own pad. He remains grateful to his neighbours and his late landlady,  whose burial he attended after she succumbed to a chronic disease.
