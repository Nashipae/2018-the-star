Ijara MP Sophia Abdinoor has urged the government to improve security in Ijara subcounty, which was attacked last week hit by al Shabaab militants. Almost 100 militants set fire to two police stations. They then escaped with a police Land Cruiser after vandalising a Safaricom mast, cutting off communication.  Civil servants and county staff, including teachers and health workers, are mostly non-locals. They have fled the area, citing danger. Touring the area, Abdinoor expressed concern over the safety of workers, saying more needs to be done to guarantee their safety.  “My biggest worry is the collapse of social services after the attack. Chances of more teachers leaving, especially non-locals, are high,” she said. The lawmaker said the teachers’ exodus will hurt the development of education in the constituency.
