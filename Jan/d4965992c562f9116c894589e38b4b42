Former Kelele Takatifu member Didi Man has explained why Moji Short Baba and him decided to go separate ways.  
They had ruled the music industry with their energy and well-crafted
songs for a long time, and their split came as a shock to their
fans. Speaking to Adelle Onyango and
Shaffie Weru, Didi said they both have different talents and
projects they wanted to pursue. "We
just had to take a short break for some time and do solo projects
because we realised that we need to try and concentrate on our
individual strengths. Like Moji is a really good MC, as people know, and
he's also very good host, and being in a group, it's very hard to try and
explore those avenues; but now it's easy for him. "And for me, I'm a
song arranger and I do other things like working with a children's home, and so we decided let's concentrate on these stuff. So there's no drama
between us," Didi said.
