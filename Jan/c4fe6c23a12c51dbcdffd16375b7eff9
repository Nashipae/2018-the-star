Three people were killed and several heads of cattle stolen after suspected bandits attacked Kamuge village in Turkana East on Friday. County police commander Ronald Opili said the about 300 suspected Pokot bandits engaged Turkana herders in a shootout. "The security personnel recovered a mobile phone belonging to one of the assailants that will help in the investigations of arresting the culprits." The attacks were experienced barely days after the six North Rift governors met to discuss the resurgence of deadly raids in the area. The talks were led by Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok and his West Pokot counterpart John Lonyangapuo. Governors Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu), Stanley Kiptis (Baringo), Alex Tolgos (Elgeyo Marakwet), and Stephen Sang (Nandi) attended the meeting at Kainuk. Several MPs, MCAs, community representatives and reformed warriors from Pokot and Turkana were also present. The meeting came after Nanok led a Kenyan delegation to Uganda for negotiations on peace and unity. The county bosses said they have identified nine causes of conflict, some of which we found solutions for. "The agreement is to unite all elected leaders from Turkana, West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo counties for talks on the remaining issues."
