Families who have been living on a public cemetery for 20 years since being evicted from Makutano town in Embu have said ghosts torment them. The residents live in Karuku Public Cemetery in Mbeere South. Yesterday they narrated how ghosts they believe are from the cemetery give them sleepless nights. Squatter Elias Kimani said they hear people screaming and talking at night but when they search they find nobody. The ghosts are especially active at night but are invisible. Kimani and the rest of the 75 families were evicted from Makutano in 1985 to allow for its surveying and mapping. Kimani and other squatters spoke to the press at a time when Mbeere South MP Geoffrey King’ang’i distributed to them plots at Wango area in Karaba. They were expected to move from the graveyard. The 10 acres was bought by the previous Constituency Development Fund committee to resettle the squatters. Resident Sospeter Mbugua said the plots in which they live are too small. He added that they find human bones when they dig latrines. “My family and I live on a 50ft by 15ft plot, which is too small,” he said. Jane Wangui said instead of helping, politicians use the land issue as a campaign tool.
