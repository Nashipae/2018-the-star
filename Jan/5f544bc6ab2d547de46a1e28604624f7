Criminals are now placing syringes on seats in a bid to drug passengers and then steal from them. Kenya Bus issued a stern warning about this on Wednesday after finding one that appeared to be a syringe. "New crime alert in buses. Share with your friend. Look before you seat, please," read the alert shared on social media. The bus company circulated the photo after one Lee Elly posted it on a group known as Matatu Galore. In most cases, the substances in the syringes cause victims to be drowsy or unconscious for considerable time periods. The effects are almost immediate and those affected usually have no recollection of what transpired and take time to recognise their surroundings. The criminals alight before the victims regain consciousness. Criminals have used this and many other tricks to rob many people in Nairobi and its environs. Some victims are approached on streets while in some cases, the criminals drop money and ask their targets to pick it for them. As this happens, items such as phones and wallets are stolen. Most victims are shocked by the quickness of the acts. Related: Crime rate in Nairobi almost twice national average – Ipsos Safety options Click here for the latest political news
