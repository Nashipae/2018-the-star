Police in Mbeere South on Saturday arrested a former MCA and another person for allegedly leading youths to torch Tana River Development Authority’s properties. Former Kiambere Ward MCA Martin Mwangi and Joseph Muriuki were arrested after residents protesting alleged exploitation and harassment by Tarda officials burnt down a Cess collection booth and demolished another one.   The irate residents who were protesting the destruction of their crops which they had planted on the land under the management of Tarda descended on the structures at around 4 pm on Saturday. They burnt one of the structures built with corrugated iron sheets and pulled down the other one demanding that Tarda stop collecting revenue from traders buying sand harvested from the land under its control. They claimed the officials have been charging Sh2,000 per lorry of sand while they have not repaired the roads network in the sand mines. Following the violence, the police hunted down on Mwangi and Muriuki and locked them at Kiritiri Police station where they spent the night. They were released on Sunday on Sh20,000 bond and asked to report to court on Tuesday to answer to charges of incitement, damage to property, and arson among others. The police at the same time thwarted a plan by the area MP Geoffrey Kingangi who was planning to lead a demonstration to the police to force the release of the two. Mbeere South Sub-County police boss Ahmed Muhammed confirmed the incident and the arrest of the two. Speaking to the Star Muhammed urged leaders to refrain from inciting residents to take the law into their hands.  Click here for the latest political news
