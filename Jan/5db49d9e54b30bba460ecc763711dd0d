Police in Migori county are looking for a Tanzania witchdoctor. His revelation and work on Tuesday led to the lynching of two suspects in Kwa area, Suna East subcounty. Daniel Taabu and Alfred Misala were part of the crowd gathered to look on as the witchdoctor identified only as Ogwang worked to name suspects in an earlier arson attack. The two were shocked when the witchdoctor named them after he picked ashes from a house burnt at night two weeks ago. The house belonged to Odoyo . It was burnt in the night, killing his teenage son who was inside. “Chacha’s family brought the witchdoctor to help find the suspects. The mob turned against the two after the witchdoctor named them,” said Philip Kisiagro, the Suna Rabuor chief. The administrator said the two tried to escape on foot. But they were caught and hacked to death using pangas and other crude weapons. “One of them tried to escape into his brother’s house to seek refuge but it was also set on fire. The mob later turned to his house and torched it too,” Kisiagro said. Click here for the latest political news
