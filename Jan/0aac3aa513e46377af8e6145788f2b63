Parents in Thika Town constituency have been urged to keep poultry in groups and supply eggs to schools. MP Patrick Wainaina, commonly known as Wajungle, made the remarks when he unveiled a programme dubbed “Jungle Egg Monday”.  Children studying in public schools will be given a boiled egg on Monday mornings. Speaking after launching a training for self-help groups in Thika town on Tuesday, the MP encouraged parents to form more groups and begin rearing chicken because there is a ready market. “This is one way to empower our people financially. Parents will benefit two-fold. They will supply eggs in schools and others will be employed to cook,” Wainaina said. He said the programme seeks to generate income, boost children’s health and motivate them to attend school. Wainaina told self-help groups to apply for loans from Uwezo Fund and Youth and Women Enterprise Funds to finance their projects. The MP said he will work with a team of consultants and experts to train groups on effective poultry rearing for maximum production. “They’ll be trained on entrepreneurship to prepare them for the project. They will be given tenders to supply the eggs to schools,” the MP said.  He promised to roll out other projects, like shoe making and will help residents find a market. Constituents welcomed the project, saying it will assist to fight poverty in the region.  “This is a well-thought out plan that will provide jobs for many residents,” resident Mary Njoki said. “The ‘Jungle Egg Monday’ programme will raise education standards in Thika, as our kids will be motivated to stay in school,” she added.
