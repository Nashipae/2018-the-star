The use of shisha remains illegal after a judge yesterday declined to temporarily lift the ban imposed by Health CS Cleopa Mailu. High Court judge Roselyn Aburila instead granted leave to petitioners to file application for stay orders to be heard inter partes today morning. The petitioners, through their lawyers led by Victor Savula, told the court the ban is unconstitutional and violates the rights of employees and would lead to the loss of billions of shillings from manufacturers. On December 29 last year, Justice John Mativo directed the 15 applicants, who had sought orders to lift the ban, to file the main case and serve the CS and Attorney General with court papers before the hearing yesterday. The 15 applicants, led by Kennedy Langat, Maurice Obunga, Stephen Irungu, Vivian Shikweya and Henry Gitau, moved to court a day after Mailu imposed the ban on the importation, promotion and use of shisha. They said they are among importers, manufacturers, sellers, promoters and users of shisha. The use of shisha is regulated under the Tobacco Act of 2007. The practice is defined as an oriental tobacco pipe with a long flexible tube connected to the container where tobacco smoke is burned then cooled by passing through water or another liquid. The Act allows the use of tobacco products in secluded or specified places, but does not ban the use of the product. Shisha smoking has been legal until the notice issued by the Health CS. But the 15 applicants argued the outright ban demonstrates selective application of the law and unfairness to the users of shisha because other tobacco users have not been affected.  Langat, who runs Shisha Place Bar and Restaurant in Westlands, said he has a licence to carry out the business.
