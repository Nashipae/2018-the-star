Street children and the less privileged in Maralal town, Samburu, were given a chapati treat on Sunday evening.   Maralal town residents and leaders raised cash and cooked more than 3,000 chapatis.  Jackton Gachuguma, a resident, said many families failed to celebrate Christmas due to poverty. “Being Christians, we are inspired by the Bibilical teaching that when you give to the needy you are lending God,” he said.  Samburu leaders including Governor Moses Lenolkulal, Senator Steve Lelegwe and Deputy Governor Julius Leseto also assisted in preparing and serving the meal.
