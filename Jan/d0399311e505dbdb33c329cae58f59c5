Some Meru MCAs yesterday defended Governor Kiraitu Murungi’s termination of 1,030 casual workers. They are Majority leader Victor Mutuma, DMK Kiogora (Abogeta West), Romano Mwito (Kangeta), Makasi Martin (Nkuene), Priscilla Karauki (Nkomo), Emily Makena (nominated) and George Kimathi (Timau). Mutuma said most of the sacked workers were hired illegally. Most of them are in the payroll but do not perform any duties. Genuine workers in revenue collection, hospitals, finance, firefighting and housekeeping will be reinstated. Kiogora said those aggrieved should seek help from the assembly’s Labour and Public Service Committee. “More than 60 per cent of the casuals were not rendering services to the government, they have been operating their own M-Pesa shops and salons. Some are students,” Mutuma said Gatimene Gardens, Imenti North, Meru town. The monthly Sh15 million paid to workers will be reviewed to slash the wage bill. “We support the governor’s sacking. We want him to implement the recommendations of the audit report. As elected leaders and the voice of the people we won’t watch taxpayers’ money being misused,” Mutuma said. But deputy speaker Elias Murega and MCA Partrick Muthuri (Abuthuguchi West) said some of those sacked were genuine staff.
