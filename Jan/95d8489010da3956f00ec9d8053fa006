The Financial Times group has named Patrick Njoroge as the Central Banker of the Year in Africa. The group, through The Banker Magazine lauded Njoroge for his swift action in cleaning up the country’s banking sector, improving supervision and guidance measures as well as pushing for the country to become a hub for green finance. “Monetary policy has remained stable and effective since late 2016 and inflation has generally remained within or close to the banks’ target range,” the magazine cited. “The governor’s prudence and long-term vision for Kenya’s economy and banking sector ensured that he scooped the Central Bank Governor of the Year award for Africa.” Since he took over in 2015, Njoroge has had to see lenders through turbulent times which saw Dubai Bank cease operations in the country with Chase Bank and Imperial Bank put under receivership. This was followed by the 2016 Banking Ammendment Act which required all banks to cap commercial interest rates at 400 basis points above the Central Bank’s benchmark rate. This saw a significant drop in the banks’ profits which are now starting to stabalise. The sector has also been hit with the new International Financial Reporting Standards-9 which came into effect at the beginning of the year. Lenders have expressed fears that the new accounting standards may further weaken the sector with experts predicting a 25 -100 basis points reduction on capital, following implementation of these standards while provisions will increase by up to 30 per cent. In May 2016, Njoroge was named Africa's central bank governor of the year during the 10th award ceremony held in Lusaka. In October of the same year he received yet another recognition in Washington DC.
