It’s a scene Kirichu residents in Nyeri county only see in movies – a mysteriously disturbed grave, the cross tossed aside. Suspected grave robbers attempted to exhume the body of Veronica Wambui, 74, who was buried last month. Villagers suspect the robbers were trying to steal Wambui’s expensive coffin. The casket is said to have cost Sh80,000, while the granny herself is said to have been buried in expensive imported clothes. Villagers stumbled on the half-dug grave yesterday morning. Daniel Mwangi, who discovered the disturbed grave, was heading to work when he came across a fresh heap of soil and a discarded cross a few metres from the grave. So why did the thieves, if that is what they were, leave the job half done? Some villagers speculated they might have run out of time and energy. Could the mission have been to desecrate the grave? It is taboo in Kikuyu culture to disturb the dead, one that is so serious, it might invite a curse. Villagers came from far and wide to see this unheard of evil. Nyeri Central deputy county commissioner John Marete said police have launched investigations, but no suspect has been arrested. The family has built a concrete slab over the grave.
