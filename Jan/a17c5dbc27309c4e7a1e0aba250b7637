  Kenya will host this year’s under-20 women’s Africa Nation Championship at the Safaricom Indoor Arena, Kasarani. The championship is a qualifier for the FIVB World Championship later in the year. Kenya Volleyball Federation had bid to host both U-21 men and U-20 women last year but they were awarded the rights to host the women’s event by African Volleyball Confederation (CAVB). KVF secretary general, Ben Juma, confirmed the new development but was quick to note that they are still open to host the men’s event should Namibia fail to stage it. “We got a confirmation from the CAVB that Kenya will host the women’s championship between July and August and as the host nation, pick dates that are favourable for us,” said Juma, who doubles up as the Beach Volleyball Federation (BVF) chairman. “At the same time, we have been asked by the CAVB to be on standby should Namibia fail to host the men’s event. As a Federation, we are ready to host both events. In previous years, we have successful staged other events and I don’t think if the two will be any different.” He said CAVB officials will tour the country next month to inspect the facilities at Kasarani Indoor Arena before giving the green light. Meanwhile, Egypt will host the women’s Africa Club Championship between March 5-18. Kenya will be represented by regulars Kenya Pipeline and Kenya Prisons. They will feature in the annual event by virtue of finishing in the first and second positions respectively in the local league. Pipeline, who have won the league titles back-to-back from 2014 finished in the fifth position during the last year’s event held in Monastir, Tunisia while Prisons finished third.
