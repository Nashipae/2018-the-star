 Former Football Kenya Federation (FKF) president Sam Nyamweya has been apointed patron of a Sports Stars Foundation formed by football legends with the aim of empowering sportsmen after their active years in sports.  The foundation, which is open to all sportsmen across all disciplines, is mooting a grand plan of forming a Savings and Credit Association (SACCO) in future to financially help the sportsmen. European Football Association advisor Dr. Michael Hopkins, who is a world renown CSR advocate, has already accepted to fundraise for the foundation while Mathare Youth Sports Association (MYSA) founder Bob Munro will sit in the board as one of the advisors.  Several former footballers among them Joe Kadenge, Allan Thigo, Mickey Weche, Josephat Murila, Rishadi Shedu, Josiah Ougo, John Bobby Ogolla, George Waweru, George Sunguti, Marshal Mulwa, Abdulla Shakir, Mahammoud Abbas, Elly Adero, John Nyawanga and Victor Onyango met before the Christmas festivities at a Nairobi Hotel to come up with the foundation.  “Our initial concern was the dwindling standards of Kenyan football, the lack of passion for the game by current players and the poverty status of former footballers. The objective of the foundation is to use sports to preach peace and break the yolks of tribal division created by politics,” they said in a statement. The founding members added that the foundation will also work towards making sports an income generating venture by encouraging youngsters in schools to venture into different sports disciplines. They will also approach the government to create an environment where sports can grow by setting up infrastructures in all corners of the republic. “As role models in the society,we will also work closely with federations, clubs, Olympians and other sports stakeholders to build a sport,” they said.
