The president has urged Kenya’s representatives to EALA to champion the country’s interests as they work to accelerate regional integration. Uhuru Kenyatta told the East African Legislative Assembly MPs to forge a united front that will guarantee their success in promoting Kenya’s interests at the regional parliament. “Express yourselves as a united team as you represent Kenya’s interests,” he told them during their meeting at State House, Nairobi, on Monday. Uhuru also asked the MPs to ensure local political differences do not interfere with their performance while they serve at the Tanzania-based assembly. He assured he will work closely with them and that he will hold quarterly meetings to ensure they yield desired outcomes for the benefit of Kenyans and other East Africans. The president affirmed his support for integration noting it will benefit the whole region. "Kenya’s commitment to the EAC and regional integration will run hand in hand with the promotion of the nation’s own interests." The EALA MPs are Simon Mbugua, Kennedy Kalonzo, Fatuma Ibrahim, Wanjiku Muhia, Nooru Adan, Florence Jematiah, Mpuru Apuri and Abdikadir Omar Aden. National Assembly majority Leader Aden Duale and Phyllis Kandie - the Cabinet Secretary for East African Affairs, Commerce and Tourism - also attended the meeting.
