Eldoret Water Company CEO Jimmy Kemboi said the firm is rationing water because of the shortage. “We have water shortage because we lack enough sources. We have stepped up effort to increase production,” he said.  Rationing Kemboi said the town requires more than 50 cubic metres of water daily, but the company has only 36,000 cubic metres. “We have opted to ration water and serve all residents in phases. The rationing will go on for some time until the situation improves,” Kemboi said. The firm is working on new projects that will increase water supply from next year. The national government and the county government are also working on Sh1.5 billion water projects to boost supply.
