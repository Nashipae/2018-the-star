Saboti MP Caleb
Amisi has suffered a major setback after the court rejected an
application by the IEBC to have his case dismissed. Justice Cecilia
Gitua said the respondent filed the application late. "The motion by
the respondent is hereby dismissed," the judge ruled on Wednesday. IEBC,
through lawyer Collins Atenga, asked the court to dismiss the petition because the
results on the petition are not dated. In December last
year, the court received an application by the IEBC to dismiss the petition
against Amisi (ODM). Jonas Kuko (Jubilee)
is challenging the election of Amisi. In the August 8 election results, Amisi was announced the winner after garnering 19,138 votes against Kuko’s 18,191
votes. At the same time,
Kuko through his lawyer Peter Kiarie, on Wednesday filed an application for scrutiny of votes and results of 23 polling stations. He alleges that some statutory
documents were tampered with, were not signed by agents, and other missing. Amisi, through his
lawyer Anthony Oluoch, however , wants the court to reject the application He has asked the court to
dismiss the case saying Kuko is a perennial petitioner "whose hobby is to complain after every
election". Amisi said after losing in 2013 to former MP
David Wafula, Kuko petitioned and lost the case. The petitioner, on the
other hand, told the court the election was not free and fair and that his victory was stolen. "I pray that
this court should nullify this election because it was not free and fair ,I don’t
fear facing my competitor at the ballot again." Click here for the latest political news
