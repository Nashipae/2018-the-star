The 14 poorest counties are set to benefit from the Sh8.4 billion Equalisation Fund in the 2018-19 financial year. National Treasury CS Henry Rotich (pictured) has proposed a Sh700 million increase to the Sh7.7 billion the marginalised counties received in 2017-18. The Sh8.4 billion, which is contained in the Budget Policy Statement released recently, will benefit Turkana, Lamu, Mandera, Wajir, Marsabit, Samburu, West Pokot, Tana River, Narok, Kwale, Garissa, Kilifi, Taita Taveta and Isiolo. The counties get the funds to be at par with the other 33 devolved units. The funds are used to improve water services, healthcare, roads and electricity. “A contingency of Sh5 billion is provided for in the 2018-19 Budget. In addition, Sh8.4 billion is provided for as conditional grants to marginal areas — an increase from the Sh7.7 billion provided in the 2017-18 Budget,” Rotich says in the statement. The marginalised counties received an accumulated Sh12.4 billion in 2017-18, following the Treasury’s failure to disburse Sh6 billion from 2010, when the Constitution was promulgated. The targetted counties are, therefore, to receive an accumulated Sh20 billion in the next financial year because of several challenges that have undermined disbursements. The Treasury blocked the county governments from managing equalisation funds and thwarted the MPs’ efforts to have the funds managed at the constituency level under the multimillion-shilling National Government Constituency Development Fund. The sum allocated to the 14 counties varies depending on their populations and poverty levels. The Commission on Revenue Allocation, which identified the marginalised counties, pointed out that Turkana was the most marginalised. It received the lion’s share of the allocation in the last financial year. The Governor Josphat Nanok-led county received Sh605.1 million for water, Sh320.1 million for roads and Sh125 million for healthcare. Mandera, Wajir, Marsabit and Samburu got a huge share of the Sh12.4 billion. The funds are from the 0.5 per cent of the total national revenue. The counties are supposed to receive the funds for 20 years from 2010.
