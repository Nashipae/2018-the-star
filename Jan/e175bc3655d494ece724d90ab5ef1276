Six Coast MPs will have to ensure 50 per cent of the land problems in the region are resolved by 2022 or risk losing their political seats, Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo has said. The MPs are part of the 19-member National Assembly Lands Committee.The others are Lunga Lunga MP Khatib Mwashetani, who is the committee vice chaiman, Omar Mwinyi (Changamwe), Teddy Mwambire (Ganze), Mishi Mboko (Likoni) and Owen Baya (Kilifi North). “This time if we don’t save our land, it means we are asleep on the job. We must solve 50 per cent of the land problems at the Coast,” Mbogo said.  He continued, “This is the only opportunity we have to solve these problems. If we don’t solve them now, we will never solve them.” He spoke in Junda on Sunday when he and Mwashetani met squatters from the entire Kisauni constituency. The Coast region has the highest number of land disputes and is home to the largest number of squatters. Kisauni has more than 80,000 squatters, according to Mbogo. Mwashetani called for unity in addressing the issue.
