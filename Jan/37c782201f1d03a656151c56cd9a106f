SportPesa has suspended sponsorship of local sports after a tax on turnover of 35 per cent came into force on January 1. Some have interpreted this as blackmail to get the new tax reversed. However the tax is punitive and far higher than the global average of 7 to 15 per cent. For every bet of Sh100, the government will now take Sh35. Then the betting companies have to give another Sh25 to social causes. Then the winners get Sh50. So SportPesa will make a loss of Sh10 on every Sh100 bet. Obviously a betting company cannot continue in business on that basis. We are now in a lose-lose situation. Kenyans will continue to bet because they are not saints. If the Kenyan companies go out of business, Kenyans will still bet on the Internet or go underground. Then the KRA will lose the massive tax revenue that it has been receiving and local sports will lose its sponsorship forever.  This foolish 35 per cent tax on betting turnover should revert to the former 7.5 per cent.   Quote of the day: "I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people." - English scientist Isaac Newton was born on 4 January, 1643
