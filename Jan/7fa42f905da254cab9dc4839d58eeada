Vanessa Mdee has been in the country for days now, promoting her new album, 'Money Mondays'. As much as the album launch has been a success, bringin it together was quite challenging. Speaking to Adelle Onyango and Shaffie Weru, Vanessa that she had so much challenges while making the album, with one of the challenges being when she got arrested and spent seven days in jail. "So last year, I got into a little situation where I was remanded for an accusation. At some point I was like it's funny when a woman is successful or is deemed an achiever, it has to be attached to something that's negative. I don't understand why people thought I wasn't doing legit music or I was dealing in other things. It broke my heart a little bit. I didnt' go to the studio for a while after. I was like what is it for? All this hustling and then someone comes and tells you aah!! Wewe ni mkora. I was in jail for seven straight days," she opened up. When asked if she ever thought of scrapping off the album, she said, "I was having a conversation with Walshyfire one time when we were doing a project for Major Lazer and he said, why are you doing an album? Literally that's what he said to me and I was dead shocked. But he comes from an industry where singles is what's doing best. But for me it was because I wanted it to be something that I did, that I've done, that I've successfully completed as an artiste and I successfully did it on my own. And then I was in a little situation and I didn't want to do the album anymore. I was like this stuff is hard."
