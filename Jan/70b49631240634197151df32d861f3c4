Homa Bay county has started fish farming to save stocks in Lake Victoria from over-fishing. Agriculture executive Aguko Juma said they were partnering with experts to promote cage fishing to ease the pressure on the lake.  Demand for fish is high.  Speaking when he toured a fish farm on Nyatambe beach in Suba on Saturday, Juma said they contracted Rio Holdings Ltd, a cage fishing company, to invest and promote fish farming in the area.   “The company has erected 16 fish cages on the lake for Tilapia fish. It is part of our campaign to save the lake,” Juma said. Each cage holds 5,000 fingerlings, which are ready for harvesting after six months. Juma said the industry will employ about 20,000 people.  “Cage fishing will take this county to the next level and supplement the ongoing construction of 120 fish ponds. Three ponds will be built in each of the 40 wards,” Juma said.  The  county will  set up and stock fish breeding ponds.
