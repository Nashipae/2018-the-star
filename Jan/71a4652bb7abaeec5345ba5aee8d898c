A video of former Nairobi deputy governor Polycarp Igathe using the 'F' word while on a drinking spree has emerged. The video, circulating on social media, was recorded immediately after he was sworn in. This was during campaigns for the October 26 repeat presidential poll. Also in the video are multi-millionaire and business mogul Chris Kirubi and other friends. The DG is shown wearing a Jubilee jacket with an UhuRuto label. It appears the clip was shot in someone’s backyard.

He says he learned of this when he got his first job in the State Government of Queensland. "Here is to you, here is to me. The best of friends, we will always be. And if by chance we disagree, well, F@*%k you, here is to you!” Igathe says as they toast. Another of Igathe’s friends adds: "We never miss our wives, we never miss our ‘concubines’." The comments bring more laughter as the group makes merry. It appears they were mocking Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko. Sonko and Igathe are said to have disagreed on some matters during the campaign period, culminating to his resignation last Friday. The Deputy Governor is said to have demanded too much including slots in the appointment of top county staff, an issue Sonko is said to have vehemently objected. It is further claimed he wanted executive powers so as to take charge of the administration and management of the county. The deal, according to insiders, was to see Sonko focus on politics in what the creators fashioned as a power-sharing deal. "I regret I have failed to earn the trust of the Governor to enable me to drive Admin & Management of the county," Igathe said in his resignation letter to the governor.
