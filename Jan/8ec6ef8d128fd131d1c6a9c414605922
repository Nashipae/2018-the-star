Conservationists are alarmed by the rising cases of wildlife and being knocked down by speeding vehicles along the Isiolo-Marsabit highway. Grevy's Zebra Trust Wamba region coordinator Andrew Letura on Monday said a week cannot go without two or three animals being knocked down. "Livestock and young children have not been spared by speeding cars. This is set to increase as there is an increase in the number of cars plying the region," Letura warned. Despite having several signages as you near Archers Post warning motorists about wildlife crossing especially elephants, drivers disregard the signs. Speaking with the Star at West Gate Community Conservancy in Samburu county, Letura blamed Kenha for failing to come up with adequate mechanisms for the wildlife crossing. "We told KeNHA to erect speed bumps along the highway but they declined,"Letura said. Elephants, giraffes, Dic Dic and hyenas are the most affected. The Isiolo-Merille-Marsabit-Moyale road is part of the Lamu-Port-South Sudan Ethiopia Transport corridor funded by the government and the European Union for Sh13.7 billion. He at the same time said fences that are currently coming up within the expansive Laikipia county are a threat to wildlife as they block the corridors and dispersal areas. But KeNHA assistant director for communication Charles Njogu refuted the claims and instead blamed motorists for failing to adhere to road signs. "We have adequate signs in all wildlife crossing areas. Motorists should always obey some of this road signs,"he said. Njogu said wildlife such as gazelles may not be in a position to cross the road using tunnels. "In roads such as Mwatate-Taveta, where we have migratory route for intelligent wildlife such as elephants, we have provided tunnels for them,"he said.
