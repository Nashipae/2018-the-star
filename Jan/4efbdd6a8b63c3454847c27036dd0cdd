Limuru MP Peter Mwathi has urged the opposition to put politics aside and concentrate on developing the country. He spoke yesterday in Limuru town. In his New Year message to residents, he wished them well. Mwathi told legislators to ensure more jobs are created. He said too much politics has force people, especially traders and investors, to put their plans on hold for fear of incurring losses. “Our friends in opposition should remember we have a task of developing the country together,” Mwathi said. “We need to create a conducive environment for investors and traders to do their businesses. We need to come up with bills that will help businesses all over in the country to thrive,” he added. “By doing so, our people will get employment. Individuals can also start their own businesses and earn an income,” Mwathi said. He said campaigns for last year’s election started in 2016, and people are tired of politics. They need economic growth, he said. The legislator urged Kenyans and clergymen to pray for the country’s leaders. “It is our duty to pray for one another. We pray for peace, co-existence, prosperity, blessings and security,” Mwathi said.
