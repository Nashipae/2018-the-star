HAS President Uhuru Kenyatta offered Cabinet slots to
some allies of Opposition politicians? Well, Corridors has heard that some
figures close to Wiper leader Kalonzo
Musyoka, Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang’ula
and ANC's Musalia Mudavadi are
warming up to the idea. It is said, however, that Mudavadi has rejected the
idea outright and is now being described as “the most difficult man”. ***** ONE of the 13 Cabinet
Secretaries 'not retained' by President Uhuru
Kenyatta early this year is bitter. The CS has gone on overdrive in
fighting one of the three nominees who he believes is the reason why he stands
no chance of being retained as they come from one area. The CS has been sighted
in night meetings with elected leaders, according to our mole, scheming how
to pile pressure on the President to change his mind and allow the area leaders
to suggest a name. The lobbying that started last week has an elaborate budget. ***** A former MP from the South
Rift who was defeated in the last election has resorted to drinking cheap
liquor in roadside pubs at shopping centres in his county. The one-time high-flying
politician who held several positions in Parliament is reported to have run
broke after spending most of his fortune on women and alcohol. And he hardly
visits Nairobi. ***** The
planned medical camp to circumcise boys on January 30 by members of the
Nairobi Business Community has tongues wagging? Corridors yesterday
eavesdropped on a conversation between a first-term Nairobi ODM MP and a host
of politicians. They claimed that members of the business community are out to
'forcibly circumcise' members of one particular community in Uhuru Park, where
the planned swearing-in of Raila Odinga and a “medical camp” are headed for a
clash. The situation was not helped when photos of Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria wearing a white laboratory
coat and holding a pair of scissors surfaced on social media yesterday. ***** SOME policemen at the
weekend held a mini-celebration within Nairobi's CBD. Cause? To toast to the
swearing-in of their new bosses: The officers were overheard saying if the new
top cops work hand-in-hand with Inspector General Joseph Boinnet, then their welfare, including better pay, housing
and allowances for suits, will be looked into. ***** Click here for the latest political news
