Three banks have expressed their interest to invest in the defunct Imperial bank, the Star has found out. The Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation CEO Mohamud Mohamud confirmed that the banks have submitted their bids and are undergoing review. “We cannot disclose the names of the banks at this point but they are currently doing their due diligence, we expect to conclude this process by March this year,” Mohamud said. Imperial Bank depositors' lobby group told the Star that Diamond Trust Bank, Kenya Commercial Bank and State Bank of Mauritius (SBM) submitted their bids early this week. Mohamud said that depositors expressed interest in seeing a similar arrangement like that of Chase Bank and SBM carried out. Lobby's chairperson Mohamoud Khambiye said depositors are hopeful they will get their money once the new investor comes on board. They want 80 per cent of their deposits to be paid immediately the investor takes over. “We want atleast 80 per cent of our deposits and in a short period of time because when the bank went on its knees it was liquid. We are aware that some loans have been serviced and the bank has been collecting money,” Khambiye said. For the remaining 20 per cent, they want Central Bank to go after directors to recover the money from them. Last October, CBK said that selection of the final investor will happen or before January 27. Established as State Commercial Bank by the government of Mauritius in 1973, SBM today operates 45 branches in the country with oversee branches in India and Madagascar. According to the Mauritius Bankers Association, SBM controls at least 25 per cent of Mauritius's banking sector which has 22 banks. It is under the SBM Group, the second largest company listed on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius with an asset base over $4.2 billion (Sh417 billion).
