Kwale county will for the first time have a High Court after Chief Justice David Maraga commissioned a foundation stone. The court will cost Sh390 million. The CJ said the premises will have eight courts, nine judges’ offices, and a section for nursing mothers . He said the Judiciary has so far built 39 High Courts in the country. “We want to ensure each county has at least one High Court and a Land and Evironment Court,” he said on Monday. The CJ asked local MPs to champion for allocation of more funds to the Judiciary to help it construct more courts to bring legal services closer to the people. Maraga said the money the Judiciary is getting is not enough to pay salaries, to cater for expenses and construction of courts in the subcounties. He was responding to questions from Matuga MP Kassim Tandaza and Kinango’s Benjamin Tayari, who want to have a Land and Environment court in Kwale, and a magistrate’s court in Kinango. “We want to have a magistrate’s court in each subcounty in Kwale, but if you don’t give us money, all these projects will stall,” he said. At the same time, Maraga urged Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya to set aside land with title deeds in every subcounty for the construction of magistrates’ courts. “If you find land with a title deed inform us to check it out. If it meets the standards, we will set up a court,” he said. He later handed over the Kwale Kadhi’s Court built at Msambweni using cash from the Constituency Development Fund.
