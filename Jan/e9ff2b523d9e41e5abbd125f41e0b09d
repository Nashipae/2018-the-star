Siaya MCAs finally bowed to pressure from the executive and approved four names of Governor Cornell Rasanga's Cabinet nominees. The CEC nominees are Charles Ogada (Agriculture), Joseph Warega (Finance), Bernard Mboha (Public Works), and Elizabeth Odhiambo (Tourism). The MCAs had been categorical that they will not approve any nominee who fails to meet the jobs' requirements. The stance that saw them reject nine nominees Rasanga had forwarded to the assembly for approval, and only approved one.

They came under sharp criticism when they rejected the first list of governor's nominees to the county Cabinet. Area MPs questioned the representatives' loyalty to the party following their decision. Samuel Atandi of Alego Usonga accused the MCAs of derailing county government service delivery due to their personal interests.
