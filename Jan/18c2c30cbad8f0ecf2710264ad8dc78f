There was a sombre mood in Siaya as the bodies of seven family members who perished in a road accident in Makueni arrived at the Siaya County Referral Hospital mortuary on Saturday. Residents and relatives thronged the mortuary to view the bodies of Alfred Kasango, his wife Alice, Charles Wandala and his wife Roselinda, Charles Osama, Joseph Ombadi and Angelina Akinyi. They died on December 23, when their vehicle collided with a truck at Sultan Hamud on the Nairobi-Mombasa highway. The family was on their way to the burial of an in-law in Makueni, when the accident occurred.  They died on the spot. Their bodies were initially taken to the Machakos Level 5 Hospital mortuary. Sigomere MCA Erick Odawa, who organised the transfer of the bodies, thanked Siaya county for financial support. Odawa appealed to well-wishers to support the family’s burial arrangements. He said they will organise a fundraiser. Some Sh2.1 million is required for the burial expenses. “We have estimated that each burial will require Sh300,000,” burial committee chairman George Okuku said. The expenses include transport charges for ferrying the bodies from Siaya to Ywaya-Tingare village in Ugunja, where they will be buried. “We are passionately appealing to well-wishers to donate funds in order to help us bury our loved ones,” relative Judith Odhiambo told a funeral gathering in Mombasa last week.  Nyali politician Said Abdalla promised to assist the family. He urged other leaders to help. “We are going to play our part as leaders. Other Kenyans of goodwill are also free to extend a helping hand,” Abdalla said. Odhiambo said the victims had left behind children, some of whom are set to join Form One this month.
