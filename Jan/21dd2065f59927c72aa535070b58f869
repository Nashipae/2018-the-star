Kenyans artistes have devised a fool-proof way of giving an appearance of success. They boost their social media posts and pay for views on YouTube. Several artistes have admitted to doing this because "Everyone else is doing it." Well, Pacho Entertainment CEO, Naiboi, has raised an issue with that practice. "I have asked asked myself this question over and over again. My progress is based on my legit numbers, I can see the growth. Is it that the industry is unfair or guys just wanna look like winners out here but don't wanna put in work? I was like, how come I don't hear the song around as much and the artiste ain't that big, but the numbers are crazy high? Anyway you can lie to everyone else but you can never lie to yourself. Or maybe I am just taking this music too seriously..."
