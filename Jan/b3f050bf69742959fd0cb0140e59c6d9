Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos yesterday backed the evictions going on in Embobut Forest. This is three days after Marakwet East MP Kangogo Bowen supported the evictions. The endorsement of the operation, which is criticised as eviction of the indigenous Sengwer community, leaves the minority community with only one ally – the human rights activists. Tolgos said security agencies should be allowed to rid the forest of armed criminals, who have used it as a safe haven. He said the community irregularly registered themselves as owners of a gazetted forest. Tolgos said it is ironic for the community to go back to the forest after receiving Sh1.1 billion from the state as compensation. In 2014, each member of the Sengwer community was given Sh410,000 to leave the forest. “No one has a reason to go back to the forest. The Sengwer community received 90 per cent of the compensation money to leave the forest,” Tolgos said. “Every member of the Sengwer community who was -18 years and above received the payouts.” MP Bowen is accusing the community of claiming ownership of a gazetted forest.
