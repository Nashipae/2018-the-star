Some 350 children in Thika Town constituency have yet to join Form One. Thika West deputy county commissioner Tom Anjere on Monday said every pupil who sat last year’s KCPE exam is qualified to join a secondary school. He said the government is seeking 100 per cent transition rate from primary school to secondary school. “The minimum requirement for a candidate to join Form One is just having sat the KCPE exam and having the proper school uniform. Tuition has been paid for by the government,” Anjere said. He ordered all chiefs, assistant chiefs, and village elders to ensure every child who sat the exam enrols in a high school.  Legal action will be taken against parents who defy the order, he said. Anjere warned principals against soliciting money from parents to enrol their children. Culprits will be arrested and prosecuted, he said. “Anyone sabotaging the exercise will be dealt with accordingly. It’ll be a criminal matter. There’s no way we can hamper the government’s efforts,” he said.
