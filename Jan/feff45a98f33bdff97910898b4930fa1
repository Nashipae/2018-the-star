Safaricom last Thursday launched the Safaricom 2018 calendar at an event attended by among others Taita Terer, Head of Center for Bio Diversity - National Museums of Kenya, Director- Consumer Business at Safaricom, Sylvia Mulinge and the Head of Advertising and Research at National Graphic Baleseng Dlamini. The calendar launch falls under #thisismykenya campaign which is in its fourth year of showcasing the country through the Safaricom calendar and #thisismykenya website. Every year, photographers are tasked with going round the country and capturing Kenya in a raw and undiluted form. This year Safaricom has partnered with National Geographic for that purpose. From January to March 2018, NatGeo wild will feature vignettes of animal species found in Kenya that are almost extinct. The same animals are featured on the Safaricom calendar. In 2018, Safaricom will also partner with Story Moja and Wildlife Direct to roll out a school programme that will sensitize school children on endangered species.
