The Kenya Forest Service has denied claims that Mt Kenya and Aberdare forests were under destruction. Allegations that the two main water catchment areas had been invaded by illegal
loggers had caused concern among environmentalists. After conducting an aerial survey, KFS said no illegal logging was taking place in the forests except the harvesting of mature trees. Speaking in Kabaru on Thursday, KFS director Emilio Mugo, only licensed saw millers were cutting down tree authorised by the agency. Mugo said tree
harvesting was an annual activity targeting trees that
are more than 25 years old. Kieni MP Kanini Kega,
who accompanied the KFS team, dismissed illegal logging claims as baseless rumours. â€œAllegations that there is mass deforestation are not true. From my
assessment, the situation is not as it was reported. My concern is the rate at which they are replenishing the affected areas," Kega said.
