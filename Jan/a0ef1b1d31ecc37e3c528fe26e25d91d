Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua (pictured) has cautioned residents against being duped into buying shares for land belonging to the International Livestock Research Institute next to the proposed Konza City. In a press briefing after a meeting with ILRI director general Jimmy Smith and county security bosses in his office yesterday, Mutua said unsuspecting buyers have been conned of more than Sh50 million. He said there was a court order restraining people from interfering with the ranch. He told police to enforce the order. “No one should buy or sell Kapiti land because it belongs to IRLI,”  Mutua said. Governor Mutua accused Mavoko MP Patrick Makau of being involved in  land invasion. He said the same group of people was involved in land disputes in Syokimau and Portland. He spoke a day after Makau addressed residents at the site and assured them he would help them to acquire 32,000 acres. The MP, accompanied by three members of the county assembly from his constituency, addressed a crowd of about 3,000 people on the land on Saturday. Makau said the land should be allocated to locals to develop it as a residential area for the Konza Techno City. He said the allocation would address historical land injustices as the land originally belonged to the locals. Makau asked Governor Mutua to join efforts in ensuring the land is reverted to the residents. Click here for the latest political news
