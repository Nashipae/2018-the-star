Transport was interrupted on Mai Mahiu-Narok road on Wednesday as SGR workers blocked it to protest poor working conditions.  The 300 employees from Satellite centre in Mai Mahiu, Naivasha, said they will not return to work unless their transportation problem is addressed. One identified only as Wakaba said the contractor had been ferrying them for long using open trucks. He noted that as a result, many had chest complications so there was need for buses. “We have complained for long about the poor means of transport but the Chinese contractor has ignored our plea. That is why we decided to strike." Wakaba added many of them were afraid following the accident that left two of them dead and three injured. “We are exposed to many dangers as was proven two weeks ago. The Labour ministry should intervene."

But Naivasha sub-county commissioner Isaac Masinde said the workers' concerns had been addressed. Reached by phone for comment on the strike, he said that after consultations, the contractor agreed to provide buses. “It’s true that the area has a lot of dust and that the workers deserve to be transported in a better way. But this has been resolved." Masinde added the contractor was keen on safety and quality. “Workers should stop blocking nearby roads as motorists do not have anything to do with their grievances. They should use the laid down mechanisms." Click here for the latest political news
