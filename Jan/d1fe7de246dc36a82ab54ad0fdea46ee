Paul Tergat Foundation has entered into a one year partnership with Kenya Power in support of activities and initiatives associated with the five-time world cross country champion. Under the 12-month program Kenya Power will support some of the major programs associated with the National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOC-K) President including the annual Safaricom Sports Personality of the Year Awards (SOYA). The 2017 Soya awards ceremony is set for January 17. “Thanks to partners like Kenya Power, we will not only promote healthy lifestyles among Kenyans but also fete the finest sports personalities through initiatives such as SOYA. I am particularly excited to welcome aboard our new partner,” said Tergat. “The partnership with Paul Tergat Foundation is a huge encouragement in urging Kenyans to take up sports. SOYA stands to benefit greatly since part of the resources will go a long way in organising the gala dinner set for Wednesday next week.” Kenya Power managing director, Ken Tarus said: “Kenya Power sets aside 1% of their profit after tax to support corporate social responsibility projects. Some of the projects under this include the company encouraging Kenyans to take up sports as a way of promoting good health and a good lifestyle.” “As we seek to grow, nurture and pass on the mantle to the younger generation, let us invest more in sports and make it worthwhile for individuals and the nation at large,” he urged.  Paul Tergat Foundation was formed by the former world marathon record holder to support sports activities in Kenya. Some of the 2017 Soya sponsors include Safaricom (title sponsors), Kenya Power, Supersport, Multichoice Kenya, Lotto Foundation, National Social Security Fund (NSSF), Communications Authority of Kenya (CA), Kenya Pipeline Corporation (KPC), National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) and New KCC.
