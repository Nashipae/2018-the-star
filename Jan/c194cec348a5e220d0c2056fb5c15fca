Limuru police on Saturday treated the public to a party at Tigoni police staiton to express thanks for help in crime fighting. Kiambu county AP boss Josphat Kinyua (pictured), the chief guest during the ceremony, said police and the public struck up a mutual partnership that has reduced crime.. Police earlier had criticised the public for what they called failure to cooperate with security agencies. Kinyua had blamed residents of Ngecha, Kabuku and Rironi for abetting crime by failing to report criminals. The area had frequent murders, hijackings, muggings and house break-ins. “Residents didn’t want to report anything for fear of victimisation by the criminals, most of whom lived there,” Kinyua said. But the situation has drastically improved over the last year. More residents alert police about crimes and plotting. The officers keeping the information confidential. “Our officers move with speed after receiving a tip off and we do not reveal our sources,” Kinyua said at the party. He was accompanied by Limuru OCPD Eunice Githure, DCI boss Mwenda Itheiba, Kabete OCPD Joseph Ongaya, Kiambu community policing chairman Peter Kiugu, among others. Githure praised the residents for their cooperation with police to strengthen security. She announced that Tigoni OCS Isaiah Lang’at had been moved to Trans Nzoia police station in the same capacity. He will be replaced by Karuri OCS Ronald Asava. “These are normal police transfers. We are grateful to Lang’at and we wish him well in his new workstation,” Githure said. She called for the cooperation between police and residents to continue to end crime.
