A middle aged fisherman is recuperating in Naivasha Subcounty Hospital after doctors amputated both his legs after a vicious attack by a hippo in Lake Naivasha over the weekend. Three men were attacked by a pack of hippos in Kasarani and Overran areas, leaving one dead and two seriously injured.  According to nurse Susan Kamau, the men with deep wounds were wheeled into the facility in serious condition. The victim, Enock Romano, had both legs crushed making amputation the only solution. “The victim had to be rushed to theatre as his legs were literally hanging from the skin and they had to be amputated as we did not have any other option,” she said. Kamau was optimistic that Romano would recover and later be fitted with artificial legs. This came as environmentalists and medics expressed concern over increasing cases of wildlife attacks around the lakeside town.
