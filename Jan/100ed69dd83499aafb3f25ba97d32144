Fourteen passengers were yesterday morning injured after a City Shuttle bus overturned on Kenyatta Avenue in the CBD. Survivor Bisman Eric said the 52-seater bus overturned after hitting a saloon car. The bus had come from Kawangware. Eric said the bus was speeding and one passenger who sustained serious injuries on her ribs had asked to alight after her pleas to the driver to stop speeding fell on deaf ears. The driver is said to have jumped traffic lights before causing the accident. The injured were rescued by firefighters and Red Cross paramedics who rushed them to KNH. KNH spokesman Simon Ithai said the majority of the patients sustained soft tissue injuries. “That is what we can confirm physically, but they are going through extra assessment by the entire team to determine the extent and type of injuries,” he said.  Ithai said the majority walked into the hospital without help. “It is just maybe two or three who were brought in on stretchers,” he said. Ithai said all patients are stable. “There is one patient who is very sick but is still stable. We are assessing them. Most will be treated and discharged,” he said. Ithai said the injured will be discharged after undergoing medical tests. “We cannot discharge a patient until all procedures are done. Someone might have a soft tissue injury on the forehead, but we still have to do a CT scan so that we can determine whether there is any other injury. If you have pain at the back and chest, that will require two X-rays or even three which will be seen by specialists and that takes a bit of time because we have several assessments,” he said. Ithai said patients will pay for some of the services while others will be absorbed by the hospital.
