A majority of Kenyans believe there are two parallel justice systems in Kenya, with senior state officials and wealthy politicians less likely to be prosecuted if they committed a crime. A new opinion poll shows that 88 per cent of Kenyans believe ordinary citizens will face the law if they committed a crime, compared to only 22 per cent who say senior government officials and wealthy politicians would be punished for committing a crime. “Most citizens believe there are parallel justice systems in Kenya,” Twaweza senior programmes officer Victor Rateng said. The survey released yesterday shows theft is the greatest security concern, ranking above terrorism, drug abuse and political instability.
