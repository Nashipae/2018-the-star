There is light at the end of tunnel for 15-year-old Afifah Sheikh who feared her dream of joining Alliance Girls High School was lost because of lack of fees.  Well wishers including the area MP Abdi Mude promised to assist her. Sheikh scored 354 marks in KCPE exam at Lafey Primary School, Mandera. Her story was highlighted exclusively by the Star. During an earlier interview at their grass-thatched house, she cut a dejected figure. She said she may not accomplish her dream of becoming a doctor. But yesterday, Sheikh was all smiles. Speaking to the Star on the phone, Mude said he was in touch with her parents and will ensure she goes to school before the end of next week. Another well wisher Hassan Abdi promised to pay her entire form one school fees.
