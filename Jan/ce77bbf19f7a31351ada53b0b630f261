Two infants have died in an incubator at a private hospital in Mavoko, Machakos county. The two died at Athi River Medical Hospital yesterday. Relatives of one of the family that lost their child accused the hospital’s management of negligence and lack of proper facilities for emergencies. Wycliff Mwanza said the children shared a faulty incubator before they died. “Our child was born on Friday. Everything was okay until the single incubator the two children were sharing broke down. It stopped for five to seven minutes since it had overheated,” Mwanza said. He blamed the hospital for operating the incubator inside a ward. “The facility has no nursery. The incubator was in a ward,” Mwanza said. He added that their child died after it was removed from the incubator for the other who was in critical condition to be transferred to Machakos Level Five Hospital. “They removed our child from the oxygen supply. Unfortunately they both died. The other never made it to Machakos,”Mwanza said. “We will take legal action against the facility. Why did they have to remove the child from the oxygen supply? We can’t let such unnecessary deaths occur in this century.” Hospital’s doctor in charge David Omega confirmed deaths of the two infants but dismissed the claims on the incubators. He said the hospital has effective incubators with enough oxygen. “It is true we lost the two babies last night, both were born prematurely through caesarian-section on Friday and Saturday,” Omega said. “We have enough oxygen with two concentrators and several cylinders,” he added. Omega spoke to the Star at his office in the hospital yesterday. He said they did not remove any child from the oxygen supply as claimed. “These are unfortunate things and they happen when babies are premature. I am depressed that I can lose two babies in one night,” Omega said. He said it was unfortunate but they did their best tos ave the babies.
