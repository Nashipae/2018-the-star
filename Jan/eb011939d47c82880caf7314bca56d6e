A group stormed the Kisumu government office on Monday demanding transport to Nairobi for NASA chief Raila Odinga's swearing-in. Raila and Kalonzo Musyoka are to take oaths of office as Kenya's president and vice president at the closed Uhuru Park on Tuesday. The youths said the county led by Anyang' Nyong'o had disappointed them in their quest to attend the ceremony. Led by Bunge la Wananchi speaker Peter Omondi, they noted counties such as Homa Bay, Migori and Siaya have already transported their people.

We are reading mischief in this because it's like they don't care about Raila taking oath of office," Omondi said. He added about 400 people are to travel and that the county should cater for transport, accommodation and food. “It's unfortunate that we were only given Sh100,000 which cannot cater for all this." Bunge la Wananchi vice chair Felix Juma said they were "very disappointed" as some people carried their bags in readiness for travel but were told the county did not know of any such plans. "We are wondering why county leaders are silent on this yet during campaigns 'it was Raila everywhere'," he said. “We have the county govenment, MPs, a woman representative and even MCAs who could have come together and produced the Sh1.5 million to cover all expenses." The group warned of unspecified consequences should Kisumu fail to provide buses. Others said taxes will not be collected anywhere from Tuesday. Nyong'o and deputy governor Mathews Owili were not immediately available for comment. Click here for the latest political news
