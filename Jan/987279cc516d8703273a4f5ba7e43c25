Governor Martin Wambora
exclaimed excitedly when he received news that doctors at Embu Teaching and Referral Hospital had conducted the county's first brain surgery. “Well, well, well! We
have seen wonders! We have seen wonders! We have just witnessed a major
operation by the neurosurgeon and his team to remove a blood clot in the
brain," he said. The governor came close to jumping up and down with excitement. "These are things that could not have happened in Embu before,” he gushed. “From now on no more
Kenyatta, no more Moi Referral Hospital, no more India, it will be in Embu.” Wambora was speaking at the
hospital when he officially launched a rental unit, Intensive Care Unit, High Dependency Unit and heart and neurosurgeon unit on
Friday. He said the county
government will spend whatever is required and
join President Uhuru Kenyatta in providing better health services.
