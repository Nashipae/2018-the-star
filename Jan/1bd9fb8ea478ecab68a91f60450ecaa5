The High Court on Thursday quashed the Sh1 million bond granted to controversial preacher Bishop Gilbert Deya by a lower court. In his ruling, Justice Luka Kimaru ordered that Deya remains in custody until his child theft case is concluded. The judge dismissed the preacher's application to reverse orders stopping his release from Kamiti Maximum Security Prison.

The DPP argued that Deya was a fugitive who even forged a court order to ward off his prosecution. "That the trial magistrate exercised his discretion wrongly,
illegally and improperly in granting bond and in issuing the orders to
have Deya released." Through his lawyer John Swaka, the preacher had informed the judge that he was sick and wanted to seek treatment while out of prison remand. But the judge rejected the request saying he can get treatment at Kenya National Hospital. The judge at the same time gave the prosecution 90 more days on top of the previous 120 days to conclude their investigation. Deya was recently deported back to Kenya from the United Kingdom to face child theft charges. He was expected to be released Kamiti Maximum Prison remand on January 17, 2018, but the judge stayed the bond issued by the magistrate court. However, lawyer Swaka asked justice Kimaru to consider reversing his earlier orders and confirm the lower court's decision.
