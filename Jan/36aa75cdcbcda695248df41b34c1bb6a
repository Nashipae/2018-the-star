ANC women leaders have endorsed their leader Musalia Mudavadi for the 2022 presidential race. The leaders from across the country said in Kisumu on Saturday that they will popularise Mudavadi among voters. Led by Women’s League chairperson Immaculate Shamala, they said they are “super-energised to drum up support for Mudavadi hut-to-hut, door-to-door and man-to-man”. Shamala said they will urge Kenyans to join them “in this noble quest to ensure Kenya recovers its lost glory and becomes a vibrant economy through Mudavadi”.
