The European Union has said it will increase funding to nutrition programmes targeting children under the age of five, as they have been neglected. EU programme manager for nutrition Titus Katembu on Tuesday faulted both the national and county governments for concentrating on other health programmes at the expense of nutrition. Katembu said proper nutrition is important for children under five, pregnant women and lactating mothers. He said the group should be properly fed because they face a lot of challenges. “It is high time we supported nutrition projects which have been neglected for a long time. MPs and MCAs need to initiate bills that will make it possible to concentrate on nutrition,” Katembu said. Katembu said many resources have been allocated to maternal health and family planning programmes. He spoke in Siaya during the launch of a four-year county nutrition action plan. The EU donated Sh235 million towards the project. Katembu called for a multi-sectoral approach to addressing nutritional challenges. “We intend to narrow down to nutrition programmes that have been neglected by the government for years. We shall leave maternal healthcare in the hands of the counties,” Katembu said. Governor Cornel Rasanga asked the EU to continue supporting projects aimed at fighting malnutrition in the region. He said Siaya ranked third among the five counties worst affected by malnutrition. Rasanga said the county will launch a Sh27 million nutrition programme for children in ECD centres. The EU is funding NGOs to implement nutrition programmes, including encouraging mothers to breastfeed their babies for at least six months, improving child-feeding practices, treating commmon illnesses and encouraging pregnant women to deliver in hospitals. Rasanga asked private partners to focus on poverty alleviation, saying it was a key contributor to malnutrition.
