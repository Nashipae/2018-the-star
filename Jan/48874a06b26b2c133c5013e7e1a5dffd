Kakamega has the second largest population and must have its fair share in national politics, Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said. Speaking on New Year’s eve in Shinyalu, he said the county follows Nairobi in population. “The people of Kakamega must organise themselves to ensure we are felt in national politics,” Oparanya said. Kakamega has been ignored by the Jubilee administration and has never been given a Cabinet slot, he said. Oparanya pledged to unite all elected leaders in the county, regardless of party affiliations. “Our focus will be quality services,” he said. Oparanya told Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i to resign over the mass failure in Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exams.  He blamed highhandedness for the poor performance. The results were released last month. “In the developed world, Matiang’i would have left office long ago, but it’s unfortunate he is still chest thumping because of impunity,” he said. Oparanya said he would prioritise completion of projects he started in his first term. Among them are Kakamega County Teaching and Referral Hospital and Level Four hospitals in Shinyalu, Mumias and Likuyani subcounties. The remaining two phases of renovation of Bukhungu Stadium will finished. Oparanya promised to open more roads to ease transport and fight poverty.
