The counties will have to wait longer to enjoy increased access to healthcare services. Health CS Cleopa Mailu (pictured) on Tuesday said the mobile clinics programme will be fully rolled out at the start of the next financial year in July. This is a blow to some counties, especially Mombasa, which has been hit by an outbreak of cholera and chikungunya virus and is struggling to control them. The mobile clinics programme is still on and 99 mobile container clinics were acquired at a cost of Sh800 million. But the container clinics have been lying idle at the National Youth Service yard in Miritini, Mombasa county, for more than one year. He spoke after meeting with the National Assembly Health Committee at Pride Inn Beach Resort in Shanzu, Mombasa county. The programme stalled because a parliamentary committee failed to allocate funds to it, Mailu said in Mombasa. The investigations into the allegations of impropriety in the procurement of the clinics also play a major part in the programme stalling. He said despite the funds being factored in the 2017-18 budget through the National Assembly Health Committee, the Commission for Revenue Allocation did not allocate the funds to the Health ministry on advice by another parliamentary committee. “Therefore we could not go on with the programme,” Mailu said. The CS wants governors to act fast and provide land where the clinics can be situated. Nairobi county has already put in place measures and programmes to have the clinics start operations. The county will receive 20 of the 99 mobile container clinics. “Yesterday, I had a meeting with the governor of Nairobi. Nine sites have been prepared,” Mailu said.
