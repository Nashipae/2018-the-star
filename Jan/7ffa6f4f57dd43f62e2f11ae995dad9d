Liquor sellers whose premises are within 300m of schools in Nairobi will lose their licenses, Nairobi liquor board vice chair Rosalid Nyawira has said.  She said the newly appointed team will work in partnership with local administration and the public to identify who deserves to be issued with licenses.  She said it was wrong to issue a license to a pub or wine near a school or estate, adding that was a health risk to the youth.   “We are mandated to control licensing outlets and we can also cancel. We shall not entertain cases where the youth are misled in indulge in bad behaviour.  We shall work in partnership with the local administration starting from the chiefs for guidance before issuing selling licenses to business spots like bars, wines and spirit joints among others,” she said.   She made the announcement during a youth sensitisation meeting at Nairobi’s Mbotela social Hall.
