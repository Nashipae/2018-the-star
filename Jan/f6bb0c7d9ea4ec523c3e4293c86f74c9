Coffee production in Othaya has decreased by 1.4 million kilogrammes over three years because of climate changes, growers have been told . Chairman of the 10,000-member Othaya Coffee Farmers Cooperative Society James Gathua on Saturday asked farmers to replace old crop varieties with improved ones. He urged the adoption of Ruiru 11 and Batian varieties, saying production cost is lower. “The two varieties are resistant to Coffee Berry Disease, Leaf Rust and produce high yields,” Gathua said during the AGM in Othaya town. Gathua said the society will also start growing Ruiru-grafted coffee seedlings by next year. The seedlings are already in their nursery. He also said they will start value addition to coffee husks and make briquettes from the waste using new compacting. Last year, the society got a Sh3 million machine from former MP Mary Wambui.
