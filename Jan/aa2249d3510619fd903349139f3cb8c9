The petition challenging the election of Budalang’i MP Raphael Wanjala was dismissed yesterday with costs. “I find that the election of August 8, 2017, in respect of Budalang’i constituency MP, was conducted in accordance with the Constitution of Kenya and the electoral law as provided under the Elections Act and the Elections (Parliament and County Elections) Petition Rules,” High Court Judge Waweru Kiarie said in Busia. Two petitioners, both residents of Budalang’i, had said the election was marred by violence and intimidation, mishandling of electoral materials, presence of illegal and alien voters, election malpractices, and voter bribery. They said polling stations where there were malpractices included Omena Beach, Port Victoria, Sisenye, Bunyofu and Rukala. But Kiarie said witnesses did not give the same account of what happened. He said the evidence provided was contradictory. “Nothing has been proved to warrant a declaration that will annul the results declared by the second respondent. The petition is accordingly dismissed,” the judge said.
