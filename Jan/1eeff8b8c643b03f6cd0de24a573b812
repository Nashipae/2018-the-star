The weekend started out with Timmy Tdat and Otile Brown being best of friends. After all, they are enjoying airplay for their musical collaboration, "Wembe". But that did not stop them from fighting. Timmy and Otile were guests at Vanessa Mdee's dinner party on Sunday night hosted by Royal Entertainment. The guest list included Juma Jux, Prezzo, Shaffie Weru and Habida. Before the fight broke out, Timmy posted on his Instagram. "Eaaaaasy Sunday..na ivo ndio vile ime die!" While, Otile Brown wrote, "Bossed up ma G Timmy Tdat always a happy moment... we royal." Clearly these two were peeps before the now infamous fight. The fight broke out after Otile Brown stepped out to receive a phone call. He came back into the house and called Timmy Tdat aside. Since they came into the event together, no one thought anything was amiss until they heard a scuffle going on outside at the parking lot. The two artistes had been drinking. "No one really knows what they were fighting about. All Otile kept saying was 'Lazima watu wahesimiane'," a source told Word Is. Prezzo tried to separate the two but he was overpowered. That is when Shaffie Weru stepped in and tried to calm the situation. The two are yet to comment on the Sunday incident.
