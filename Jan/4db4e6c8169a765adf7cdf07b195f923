Octopizzo went through a rough life in Kibera but is now living on the fast lane. One thing many people didn't know, though, is that his great grandfather was the first black Kenyan Cabinet minister in the colonial period. Appolo Ohanga was born in 1913 at Got Regea in Siaya, Nyanza provinc. He was a keen musician and an accomplished organist. In 1943, he was elevated to the same rank as graduate teachers in recognition of his outstanding ability. While at Maseno, he got married in 1943 to Truphosa Margaret Okinyo, a school teacher, and they had 10 children. In 1986, he was awarded the Order of the Grand Warrior of Kenya by President Daniel Arap Moi. Ohanga died on January 23, 1992, at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi.
