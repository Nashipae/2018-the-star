Bura MP Ali Wario has urged leaders to tone down their utterances to avoid breeding animosity between communities. He was reacting to comments by Kitui East MP Nimrod Mbai who two weeks ago ordered Somali herders to leave the area within 10 days. Speaking to the press in Madogo in his constituency, he said it is inappropriate for the MP to issue such a directive. The deadline has elapsed. The herders are waiting to see what Mbai will do next. The Kamba and Somali communities have been at loggerheads for years, following claims that the herders deplete water and pasture, leaving the host community to suffer. Leaders from Garissa county, where the majority of headers come from, reacted sharply to the comments. They accused the legislator of creating animosity between the two communities. Garissa Woman Representative Annab Subow and Balambala MP Abdi Shurie criticised the comments. They called for sobriety in dealing with the “sensitive matter”. Wario said talks between leaders from the two counties are underway to resolve the conflict caused by herders crossing into Kitui during drought. “I have talked to my people. We are in agreement that we are neighbours and we have to accommodate and accept each other,” he said. Mid last year,  over 100 camels were allegedly killed in Kalabah area of Bangale division by security officers who were patrolling the border between Tana Tiver and Mwingi.
