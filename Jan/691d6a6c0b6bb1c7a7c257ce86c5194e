We all
need energy to survive in the world. In nature, plant eating wild animals can
only survive and thrive if there is enough flora, such as grasses, leaves and
stems. They need this to give them enough nutrition and energy to sustain them
through the annual cycles of dry and wet seasons. It is literally “food for
life”, also known as biomass. The
total amount of potential food energy available in kilograms per square kilometre
is also known as the biomass. In the Nairobi National Park, scientific studies
have been conducted in the past (JB Voster and MJ Coe from 1960-66) to
determine the estimated sustainable biomass of the Nairobi National Park. In
the dry season, the biomass was estimated to be about 5,690kg per sq/km, and in
the wet peak season, it was as high as 12,775kg per sq/km. Optimum
biomass is also known as the carrying capacity, or the amount of species that
can live in the park without downgrading the ecosystem. This is very important
for the park, as the total area is only 117 sq/km, and the herds cannot migrate
as before due to blocked ancient seasonal routes. Naturally, the herbivores
like zebra, eland, wildebeest, coke’s hartebeest, impala and buffalo also
attract interest in predators when they prefer to feed in certain parts of the
park. In my
experience, the Kingfisher area plains, Eland valley, and the Athi basin are
typical areas where the soil type is fertile and able to sustain larger
populations of herbivores and associated predators like lions, leopards and hyenas.
When visiting the park, try to focus on the areas where the herbivores are
feeding, and sooner or later, you could be rewarded with a predator sighting.
