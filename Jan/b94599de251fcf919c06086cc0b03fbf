Aga Khan Univerity receives grants for innovative research aimed to assist Kenyan women living with Metastatic breast cancer. The grant from Seeding Progress and Resources for the Cancer Community Metastatic Breast Cancer Challenge was received by the head of Medical Oncology Division at Aga Khan University, Asim Shaikh. The grant worth USD 25000, is as a result of a partnership between the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) and Pfizer Oncology.  Asim says he applied for the grant since he saw an opportunity to address issues of an ignored breast cancer population. Aga Khan University was chartered in 1983 as a private, autonomous university that promotes human welfare through research, teaching and community service initiatives.
