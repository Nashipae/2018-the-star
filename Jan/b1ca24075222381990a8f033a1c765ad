South Korea's President Moon Jae-in says his US counterpart, Donald Trump, "deserves big credit" for talks between South and North Korea. The talks, held on Tuesday, were the first in two years and led to the announcement that North Korea would send a delegation to the Olympics in Pyeongchang later this year. Moon said he wanted to show Trump his gratitude. The US president tweeted a week ago that he had brought the talks about. He said he had done so by being "firm, strong and willing to commit our total 'might' against the North". Â Moon told reporters on Wednesday: "I think President Trump deserves big credit for bringing about the inter-Korean talks. "It could be a resulting work of the US-led sanctions and pressure," he said. Later on Wednesday, a lone North Korean representative arrived at the International Olympic Committee headquarters in Switzerland to formalise the agreement to send athletes to the 2018 Games. BBC correspondents in Seoul say Mr Moon is treading a difficult diplomatic line between wanting dialogue with the North but not wanting to annoy the US, an ally, or undermine economic sanctions. Russia's foreign ministry welcomed the agreements reached to negotiate over military issues. "We hope that their implementation will serve to de-escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula and foster stability in this region," the ministry said.
