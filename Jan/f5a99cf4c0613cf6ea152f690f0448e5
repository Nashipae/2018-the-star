KDF soldiers on Sunday evening killed five al Shabaab militants and recovered assorted weapons in a gunfight in which several militants fled into Somalia. The militants had earlier conducted a series of attacks, including a raid on Ijara police station in Garissa county, and made away with a police Land Cruiser.  KDF spokesman Col David Obonyo said the troops caught up with the militants as they tried to get to the Somalia border. In the ensuing firefight, suspected bomb-making materials that were being ferried exploded, destroying the vehicle. “However, a motorcycle also suspected to have been stolen in Ijara, five AK-47 rifles, 13 magazines with 370 rounds of ammunition, two grenades, bomb making materials and personal items were recovered,” he said. Obonyo said the the KDF is still pursuing the militants and appealed to the public to forward information regarding suspicious people with bullet wounds seeking medication. He assured the public the KDF’s operations against al Shabaab will continue until all the militants are eliminated to ensure the locals enjoy peace and security.
