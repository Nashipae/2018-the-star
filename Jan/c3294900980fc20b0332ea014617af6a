Kenya loses an average of 3,000 lives through road accidents annually, placing it among countries with the highest numbers globally. As a result, the government, through various players, has tried to put mechanisms in place to reduce these incidents. This started in 2014 with the introduction and publication of the Legal Notice No. 23 in the Kenya Gazette which outlines guidelines on management of public service vehicles.
