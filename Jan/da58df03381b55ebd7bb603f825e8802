Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi has asked Jubilee to punish three MPs from the North Rift region who had defied the party and refused to resign from House committees. The three Sila Tiren, Bowen Kangogo and Alfred Keter were elected as chairmen of various committees but Deputy President William Ruto asked them to step down. Nandi Hills' Keter was elected chair of Labour and Social Welfare committee, Moiben's Tiren (Agriculture) while Marakwet's Bowen won the Environment Committee chair vote.

The MP said the president, the DP, and Jubilee Party are justified in taking action against the defiant MPs. Sudi said the defiant legislators are on the wrong and should respect the party decisions to share out parliamentary positions nationally. "They are my friends. But on this one, they are wrong because they have to respect their party as we do all of us." Speaking in Eldoret on Friday, the legislator said the position taken by Keter was meant for leaders from the coast region. "We campaigned as Jubilee telling Kenyans that we are equal and we will share what will be available we should not go against that," he said. He said Jubilee had the right to punish the MPs if they will not back down. The legislator in question defied the party and have refused to resign saying they were elected procedurally and will not bother be forced to quit. "My three friends should know that as a region we can not take up all positions as if the other parts of the country does not exist," Sudi said. Sudi is a close ally of the MPs and DP Ruto.
