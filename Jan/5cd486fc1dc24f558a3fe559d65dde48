Panic has gripped Tana River county employees after the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission began investigating 13 officers involved in tender awards. The officials include former chief officer Fatuma Zahra and Public Works director Thomas Chula. They are alleged to have irregularly awarded a tender to construct a fence in Garsen town. “The officials allegedly issued a fictitious contract worth hundreds of millions for construction of a perimeter fence for Kenya Wildlife Service in Garsen for financial year 2016-17,” a senior county official said. Other officials to be interrogated include Mumina Dulo, Halima Mahad, Bonaya Komora, Raymond Gwiyo and Fatuma Hussein. The rest are Nasir Guyo, Hawa Bakero, Mohamed Abdi, Kelvin Wafula, Issa Bere and Ali Dhidha. Zahra appeared before EACC officials on Monday. Chula will be interrogated on Thursday. All the officers will be questioned this week. In a letter to the county authorities, the EACC requested the officers to be made available for questioning. Acting county secretary Salim Bagana received the letter on January 15. When he took office, Governor Dhadho Godhana said he inherited a Sh2.1 billion debt from his predecessor Hussein Dado. Most of the debt was owed to contractors and suppliers. Godhana has threatened not to pay the contractors until an independent audit determins how money was spent and if the claims are genuine. A team spearheading the audit has already presented its report to the governor.
