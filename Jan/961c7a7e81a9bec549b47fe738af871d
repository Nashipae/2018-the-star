A 17-year-old boy in Limuru constituency, Kiambu county, who had gotten a job as a tea picker after losing hope of joining high school has joined Njoro Boys High School in Nakuru. Ashley Nyakundi was the best KCPE candidate in Kiawaroga Primary School, Limuru East ward, with 345. He wants to become a neurosurgeon. Nyakundi’s mother - Mellen Bosibori - is a single parent and could not afford to pay fees for day school. Nyakundi often skipped classes for lack of fees. He said, “The [admission] letter was brought home from school. I didn’t even go through it. The following day, I went to a friend to connect me to get a job, even if I am under the age of 18. I was lucky to get a placement. I started working on January 5, I am yet to receive my wages, but it’s ok, let me go to school.” Kiawaroga head teacher Keziah Wanjiru gathered friends of the school, alumni and leaders to raise money for Nyakundi. Wanjiru on Friday said she met Limuru East MCA Ngige Karuga who lobbied for funds from his friends and raised Sh50,000. “I could not believe people would raise money for a leader to take a student to school. I am overwhelmed they did it so fast,” she said. Karuga said Sh26,700 was paid for the first term, excluding uniform and other apersonal effects, which cost Sh36000. Karuga did shopping for Nyakundi and took him to school. He pledged to support Nyakundi throughout his education.
