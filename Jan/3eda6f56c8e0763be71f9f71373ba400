NASA supporters poured into the streets of Kakamega town to celebrate the swearing-in of Raila Odinga as the “President”. They danced through Kenyatta Avenue to Cannon Awori street, shouting “Canaan is real”, as vehicles blared pro-NASA tunes. After the Communication Authority of Kenya switched off all national television stations to stop them from airing the NASA event life, they resorted to the Internet to follow the ceremony. Sheywe MCA Job Mwamto condemned the Jubilee administration for gagging the media. He said Kenyans had a right to follow the NASA event live on TV. In Mumias, residents complained about the media shut down and the absence of Kalonzo Musyoka at the ceremony. In Busia, scores of NASA supporters celebrated in the streets. “These are some of the dictatorial tendencies by Jubilee we’re talking about,” In Mumias own, it was business as usual as locals complained of the medial shut down and the absence of Wiper Leader Kalonzo Musyoka in the swearing in ceremony. Over in Busia county a handful of opposition supporters celebrated the swearing in with songs and dance. They marched from the Busia bus park to Busia Agricultural Training Centre (ATC) and back. In Vihiga county, it was business as usual as major towns of Mbale, Chavakali and Majengo remained calm as business continued as usual. A few youth celebrated at Chavakali for less than five minutes and dispersed. Vihiga county is the home of ANC leader and NASA founder Musalia Mudavadi. Mudavadi did not attend the swearing in ceremony at Uhuru Park. Though Kakamega and Vihiga counties have ODM governors, their loyalty to the coalition has been doubted because of their body language. They have been linked to Jubilee. Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega) and Wilbur Otichilo (Vihiga) have however denied links with Jubilee.
