The National Environment Management Agency will crack down on those involved in illegal and secret importation of banned plastic bags into the country. John Chumo from the task force receiving complaints on environment pollution yesterday said they have received reports on the illegal imports through the Kenya-Uganda border. “We are partnering to ensure we seal off the areas where such illegal business is going on,” Chumo said in Eldoret town. The majority of Kenyans have largely supported the ban and use alternative bags and packaging materials. Most traders in Eldoret, Kitale and Kapsabet say the ban on plastic bags was beneficial, despite the problems they faced in adopting new packaging materials. Small-scale Traders Association chairman in Eldoret James Maina said they have complied with the ban. However, some traders said the alternative bags introduced in the market are expensive.
