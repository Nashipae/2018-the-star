The first batch of form one students under the Free Day Secondary Education programme to school from today. The second selection of form ones is set to begin next week. This comes as the government prepares to complete the distribution of textbooks to all secondary schools by Monday next week. It will cost Sh7.5 billion to print and supply six core textbooks. They are for mathematics, English, Kiswahili, Chemistry, Physics and Biology subjects. In a statement, Principal Secretary of Basic Education Belio Kipsang said, the government has already sent out Sh29.5 billion for the programme. This will help to achieve a 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary school. “The ministry wishes to advise all form one students to report to the schools they have been selected on January 9 (today),” the statement reads. The funds disbursed to schools will cover tuition and other operations as per guidelines.  For schools with boarding facilities, national schools and extra-county schools in Nairobi, Nakuru, Mombasa, Kisumu and Eldoret will charge Sh53,554. All other boarding schools will charge Sh40,435. According to Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development chief executive officer Julius Jwan, the books distribution will be done from national schools downwards. “Those reporting on Tuesday will find the books ready and will get the copies as promised by the government,” Jwan said. Jwan further revealed support materials including curriculum designs, textbooks and teacher guides for the second-phase pilot of the new curriculum will be available to all schools by end of this week. The Competency Based Curriculum materials are being distributed by KICD and contracted publishers.
