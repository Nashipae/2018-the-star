Siaya county has donated Sh35 million for the renovation of Odera Akang’o University College in Gem. Speaking at the institution on Saturday, Deputy Governor James Okumbe said the fund was part of the pledge made by Governor Cornel Rasanga during the campaigns. Okumbe said the county was committed to boosting education. He was in the college to commission the renovation, expected to be complete by the end of February. He warned the contractor about shoddy work. “The exercise must continue progressively from inception to completion,” Okumbe said. Acting principal Philip Nyangweso thanked the county for their donation. He said the Commission for University Education had threatened to close down the institution over dilapidated structures.
