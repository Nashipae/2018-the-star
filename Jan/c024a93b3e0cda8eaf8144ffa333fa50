Pwani School for the Mentally Challenged is looking for a 16-year-old boy who is mute and suffers from autism. He climbed over the school’s wall on Sunday at around noon. Head teacher Ruphert Mwamburi yesterday said David Makoti left as though he was headed to the washroom. Nobody expected him to escape. Makoti was spotted by a security guard who tried to catch him, but when he got closer he had already jumped over. Mwamburi said though Makoti is still young, he is a strong boy and well-built. It would require several men to stop him from jumping over the fence. The school has alerted the police, chiefs and mosques to help in the search. Photos of him have been plastered in the streets. His father Samuel Makoti said he is scared his son is not safe. “We asked around and we were informed that he was seen around Naivas supermarket in Nyali,” he said. This had given them hope of finding the boy but until now he is still missing. Samuel and the teachers have urged the public to contact the head masters or alert the police if they spot the boy. “We have given out our contacts and his picture to the police and in hospitals,” Mwamburi said.
