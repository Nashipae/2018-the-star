Transport on the Mai Mahiu-Narok road was temporarily paralysed yesterday after 300 SGR workers blocked it protesting against poor working conditions. The workers from Satellite centre in Mai Mahiu, Naivasha, said they will not resume work until the issue of their transportation is resolved. Motorists were stuck on the road until the striking workers agreed to meet the government and the contractor’s representatives to resolve their differences. The incident comes barely a fortnight after two workers in the area died and three others were seriously injured after a section of the railway line collapsed. According to one of the workers only identified as Wakaba, the contractor has been ferrying them using open trucks. He noted that as a result, many had contracted chest complications, adding that they needed a bus to ferry them from their homes to the site. “We have complained for long over the poor means of transport, but the Chinese contractor has ignored our pleas, hence the strike,” Wakaba said. He said many of them were still living in fear following the accident that claimed two lives, adding the contractor had failed to address the issue of safety. “We are exposed to many dangers as it was proven two weeks ago and we are asking the ministry of labour to intervene so the issue of safety can be addressed,” Wakaba said. Naivasha sub-county commissioner Isaac Masinde confirmed the strike, but was quick to note that the emerging issues had been resolved. Speaking on the phone, Masinde said the contractor after consultations had agreed to provide a fleet of buses to be used to ferry the workers. “It’s true that area has a lot of dust and the workers deserve to be transported using a better mode of transport and this has been resolved,” he said.
