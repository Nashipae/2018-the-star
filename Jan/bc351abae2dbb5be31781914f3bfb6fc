The Bonis in Lamu county yesterday blamed successive governments for their marginalisation, poverty, lack of education and development. The minority community has depended on the Boni Forest for its survival. They gather wild fruits, roots and honey and hunt wild animals. The Bonis occupy six villages — Pandanguo, Basuba, Milimani, Mangai, Mararani and Kiangwe, which border the forest. In 2015, the government launched Operation Linda Boni to flush out al Shabaab militants hiding in the forest. The Bonis then were banned from setting foot in the forest until the operation is over. They have been moved to camps and encouraged to farm but say it’s difficult to adapt to farming and a modern life. On Wednesday, members of the community said in Bargoni, Lamu West, their problems include lack of education, insecurity and lack of functioning health facilities. In a statement, they blamed “a leadership that continues to despise and ignore us”. All five primary schools and dispensaries in Boni have remained closed for more than three years after teachers and medical staff fled for fear of Shabaab attacks.
