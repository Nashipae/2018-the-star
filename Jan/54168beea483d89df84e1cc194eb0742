Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka must have shocked and disapproved some Jubilee diehards when he said he is ready to be sworn in as the Peoples' deputy president together with NASA leader Raila Odinga upon return from Germany. Word has it that most Jubilee politicians have been dismissing the much postponed and controversial swearing-in of Raila as Peoples' president as an ODM affair in the belief that Kalonzo won't be party to such an "illegality". Kalonzo, however, seems to have been careful not to sing a discordant son, especially after many weeks away from the action. He seems not to have forgotten the NASA leadership's rhyme on electoral justice. ****** Are MPs that broke? Well, two MPs — one serving first term and another in his second — were yesterday overheard plotting how they will backdate their mileage claims. According to the legislators, the claims will amount to Sh 2 million following Justice George Odunga's order that suspended SRC's new perks. The lawmakers were also full of praise for the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC) for "coming to our rescue at the time of need". Corridors learnt that backdating mileage allowances has been a popular topic among MPs in the past two weeks. ****** Will the new regulations for teachers not to stay in one working station for nine years work? As schools opened their gates for this year's academic calendar, many heads who have stayed in their current stations for more years — some 13 years— reported back to their stations on Tuesday despite the Matiang'i's directive. Many, especially primary heads, told Corridors they are yet to get communication from their employer, TSC, on their new stations. ****** MCAs of a county in Mt Kenya region are unhappy. Reason? The county legislators are yet to be paid their December salaries and they suspect that the delays could be traced to the office of the governor. One of them whispered to corridors that the governor who has close ties with the clerk of the assembly has been issuing directions to him not to bank their salaries in their accounts so that the MCAs would "become loyal". ****** The governor survived in the past assembly because the MCAs then were afraid of losing out on several goodies but this time we have decided we will focus on what Wanjiku deserves not us", one was overheard saying over Christmas. He was at a famous high end hotel in the county.
