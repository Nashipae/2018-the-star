A Nairobi court has issued a warrant for the arrest of blogger Cyprian Nyakundi over a social media post said to have defamed Fred Matiang’i. Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi gave the order on Monday following a request by the prosecution. The team noted Nyakundi failed to appear in court to answer to charges related to the post on Twitter page that is said to have targeted the Interior minister. The charge sheet states the blogger posted the tweet on January 23. It was linked to an article by The Standard titled ‘Vocal Minister in illicit affair with choir girl'. The description of the minister in question, the blogger said, fit that of Matiang'i. It is said he also published his own article with a different title. CID officers arrested Nyakundi on Friday but later released him on a police bond and asked him to present himself to court to take a plea. The case will be mentioned on February 13 for confirmation of whether the accused was apprehended to answer to the charges. Following the article by The Standard, Matiang'i denied having an affair with a church girl and demanded an apology. On January 25, Interior communications director Mwenda Njoka called for the retraction of the story and an apology in seven days.
