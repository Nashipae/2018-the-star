FAITH MATETE/Nairobi lawyer Nelson Havi has said he will seek postponement of the February Law Society of Kenya elections, citing lack of preparedness to conduct the poll. Havi (pictured) said on Monday he will press the court to give an interim order stopping the election. He said LSK wants to continue with the elections, despite not having regulations and an election board to conduct it. “We will be asking the court to stop the entire exercise so that we determine the main issues to have a franchise where all members can elect as much they can vie for positions,” Havi said. He added, “We do not have proper arrangements to undertake the election. What we have is a single decision by LSK secretary general Mercy Wambua who has taken charge of the entire exercise.” Havi is running for LSK president.
