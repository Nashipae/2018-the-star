Song and dance broke out on Kisumu's streets on Tuesday, the people saying they couldn't wait for NASA chief Raila Odinga to take his oath. Raila and Kalonzo Musyoka will be sworn-in at Nairobi's Uhuru Park as president and DP, according to officials in the Opposition coalition. The Opposition leader earlier reiterated that he does not recognise president Uhuru Kenyatta and that he will lead Kenyans to 'Canaan'.

That is enough for us to know that our dreams are about to come true,” said Michael Oleng'. “We have people representing us in Nairobi and sending information on what is going on at Uhuru Park Grounds. Even if they shut down media, we will still get information," another supporter shouted as a group marched towards the main bus terminus. Another resident told The Star that the day was meant for Raila and celebrations. Minimal business activities went on within the town - which is usually a beehive of activities - following announcements of the ceremony. Traders opted to stay away for fear of losses due to raids by rowdy crowds - this has been the case in the past when deaths, injuries and destruction of property were reported. There was also minimal traffic in the town as most residents opted to take precautions in case of protests.  But some supermarkets and banks remained open. A number of those who did not travel to Kisumu were seen following the events at joints with DSTV connections. This was after the state disconnected Citizen TV, NTV among other broadcasters who use Signet channels to beam their signals. On Monday night, residents poured on the streets in celebrations, especially in Kondele area. Read: CA shuts down Citizen, NTV ahead of Raila swearing-in Click here for the latest political news
