A police constable accused of raping a 15-year-old girl will be remanded for five days to allow for investigations,  a Gatundu court ruled on Tuesday. Constable Paul Rotich was arrested on Sunday. Investigating officer corporal Ekiru Ekirimon told the court the victim could not fill a P3 form at that time. Fellow officers are also yet to record statements as a colleague died on the same day, throwing the station into disarray. Defence counsel opposed the request for more time to complete investigations, saying the suspect is a law-abiding citizen. He said it is unconstitutional to hold a suspect without preferring any charges. Prosecuting counsel Kerogo Matwa said it is common practice for police officers to request more time to conclude investigations. In her ruling, resident magistrate Carol Makori said the investigating officer’s case for extension of time was justifiable. She concurred  that the accused’s work makes it easy for him to interfere with the investigation. “This being so, I give orders as prayed,” she said. The case will be mentioned on January 23.
