An additional 1,000 police officers will today be deployed to city streets to provide security during the banned NASA swearing-in ceremony in Uhuru Park. The officers will include the DCI, AP, GSU and regular police. Police anticipate there will be confrontations with NASA supporters and are taking no chances. The newly acquired water cannon, teargas and rubber bullets are some of the equipment the anti-riot police squads will use. Police will also provide both aerial and ground surveillance.
