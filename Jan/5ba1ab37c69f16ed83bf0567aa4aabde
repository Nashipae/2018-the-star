No bright students in Kitui county will stop learning because of lack of money, governor Charity Ngilu has said. Ngilu announced on Saturday that she will ensure all the learners get help. "I assure that as long as I am governor, no children will fail to go to school because their parents are poor. The county has already set aside Sh180 million to help needy students." Ngilu addressed the media on Saturday after presiding over the issuance of school fees cheques to 31 clever but less fortunate students. "We have secured slots for all the children who almost missed their chances in national and other schools. Since we have now given them the bursary cheques, they will all report to their respective schools next Monday," she said at the Kitui Agricultural Training Centre. Noting more parents cannot afford to educate their children,the governor promised the county will reach out to them and offer support. One of the beneficiaries was 15-year-old Neema Bonareri who was called to Kenya High School. She attended the ceremony with her mother Bretta Mwende. Five of the beneficiaries who scored at least 350 marks were awarded full scholarships by Cooperative Bank. Click here for latest political news
