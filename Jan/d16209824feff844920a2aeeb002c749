A pregnant woman in France has died after being electrocuted by her phone, which she was charging as she took a bath, authorities say. The 21-year-old woman was just two weeks away from giving birth when she died on New Year's Eve in the town of Saint-Martin-d'Hères near Grenoble, France. Her husband found her submerged in the water and unconscious on Sunday. The man had left the home without his keys while his wife was in the bath, and had to break through his front door when she didn't answer his knocks or phone calls upon his return. The woman, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant, suffered cardiac arrest while in the tub, according to The Local. Her husband called emergency services, but medics were unable to save the woman or her baby. The woman and her husband have not been publicly named.  Officials have launched an investigation into the cause of death, but it is believed that the woman was electrocuted. The victim's mobile phone was found charging 'in the immediate vicinity' of the bathtub and is believed to have caused electrocution, Le Dauphine Libere reported. It is not clear what exactly happened to cause the electrocution. The woman's husband was taken to the hospital and treated for shock after finding his wife dead.
