Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet), Narok County chapter has asked the Kenya National Examination Council (Knec) to immediately pay teachers who administered and marked national examination. County Kuppet Executive Secretary Charles Ngeno said it is wrong for Knec to continue withholding the teachers’ dues yet the exams have been administered, marked and released. Speaking to the press in Narok office yesterday, Ngeno challenged Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi and Knec Chairman George Magoha to show the same seriousness they showed during the administration of exam when it comes to payment. “It is now three weeks after the release of KCSE and a month after the release of KCPE. When the Cabinet Secretary released the KCPE he had given his commitment that the examiners will be paid before they leave for their various homes,” said Ngeno.
