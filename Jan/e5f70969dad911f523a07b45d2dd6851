About 200 schools face closure over water crisis in Baringo county. On Friday, Pokot residents stormed
Riongo Primary School in Tiaty subcounty, demanding immediate
closure of the school because of lack of water. Teacher Victor Nakomer confirmed there has been water scarcity in the school. "The taps are dry. We are left with no option but close the school
any time from now,” he said. Nakomer said rains stopped in May
last year and the pupils are hungry since the government is yet to
roll out the school feeding programme this year. Parent Hosea Kipkukat demanded
immediate closure of the school, saying they are ready to move
with their children to look for water and pasture for their livestock. “The lives of our children are at stake. If
nothing is done to address the matter, then it is better the school is closed," he said. Riongo primary is among 11
schools facing imminent closures in Silale ward alone. A total of 118 schools face similar challenge in the entire seven wards
in Tiaty subcounty. A neighbouring Naudo Primary School was on Monday last week closed indefinitely owing to the water problem. Other affected schools in Tiaty are
Orision, Nasorot, Akule, Toplen, Silale, Napeikore, Nalekat, Napukut, Kitailem,
Cheptamas, Kangoria, Nakoko, Cheptunoyo and Chemukutan. Silale MCA Nelson Lotela pleads with the residents to calm down as
the county and the national government looks for solutions to retain the
children in school. He appealed to NGOs in the area to address the emergency.
