The Kisumu government is building a Sh12 billion fish cage farming and processing plant. Economic Planning executive Richard Ogendo yesterday said the project will increase fish production for local consumption and export. “We have signed an agreement with investors from China, and we expect the implementation to start within 90 days,” he said, adding that the investors target to cover more than 1,000 acres of water on Lake Victoria. “We expect to introduce hatcheries to produce enough fingerlings to be distributed to farmers in the region.” Experts say Lake Victoria can no longer sustain the high demand for fish. The cage system will best ease the pressure, Ogendo said. He said the mega investment will create more than 2,000 jobs, with 300 people directly employed in the fish plant. It also aims to reduce fish imports. Ogendo said Governor Anyang Nyong’o will finalise the deal with the investors once he is back in the country. The agreement, he said will run for years to enable the investors and county realise the amount of money they have invested. The cage aquaculture will enable fish farmers to exploit the resources and help grow its fishing industry, he said. “The cage fishing will further ease pressure on Lake Victoria.” Ogendo said fishermen will trained on how to come up with ways of conserving the lake to reduce the high rate of fish depletion. “The cage system will enable easy, controlled and healthy growth of the fish, without depleting stocks in Lake Victoria,” he said. The officer pointed out that the project also entails capacity building to locals on environment and fish farming aimed at improving fish production in the region. The investment will also see proper environmental management that will reduce direct discharge of raw effluents into the lake.
