A private security guard was shot and injured by suspected gangsters who raided a house occupied by two Chinese nationals, before robbing the occupants on Sunday night. The victim was in a team of security guards who responded to a distress call raised during the attack. Karen Divisional police commander Cunningham Suyianka said the two were robbed of Sh200,000, 2,000 USD, Australian dollar, laptops, Ipads watches and other accessories. They are herbal medicine dealers. "The problem with people around here is keeping too much money in their homes. There must be someone who knows they have money and where it is kept. This must have been an inside job," Suyianka said. Suyianka said the two had not installed CCTV cameras in the compound and there is nothing to help the police trace the suspects. The police boss was among the officers who arrived at the scene after the attack was reported, but the criminals had already escaped on foot.
