Kitili Mwendwa, who lost the Kitui West Wiper primaries on Tuesday, has conceded defeat and offered to support Edith Nyenze ahead of the March 26 by-election. This followed Edith's win in the nominations. The widow of the late Francis Nyenze got 13,388 votes against Maluki's 2,663. Kitili said: "To my worthy opponent, congratulations Madam. You ran a great campaign and have my full support going forward." He welcomed the results of the primaries saying although they did not play to his expectations, "the people of Kitui West have spoken." Some voters, who spoke to journalits, said they rejected Kitili, a son of former cabinet minister Nyiva Mwendwa, because he was more or less a stranger to them.. A section of voters, specifically Matinyani area where Kitili hails from, said the candidate was disadvantaged since he is viewed as a political novice. "The late Nyenze's wife has been moving around the constituency and interacting with the locals unlike Kitili who is hardly seen," Joyce David, a trader, said. Other said he only appeared on the stage when the IEBC announced plans for the Kitui West by-election.
