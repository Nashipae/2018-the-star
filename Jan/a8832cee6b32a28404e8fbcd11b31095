The fast-rising rifle woman Grace Rantile and sailor Joyce Chebii are on the run for the ‘Next Best Lady’ honours at the Bob Morgan Memorial Trophy today at the Defence Forces Rifle Range in Nanyuki, Laikipia County. Last year, the two ladies from the General Service Unit and Kenya Navy respectively, shared spoils at 69.005 points but Chebii was elected to take home the medal. As it looks, Super-X firer Rantile leads a host of female competitors to give the Mtongwe-based mariner a good run for her money. After the Eleanor Malik and Gun Score trophies, Rantile has taken the a four-point lead as the soldier closely chases for a place at the top of the women’s league. Rantile grabbed the ‘Next Best Lady’ medal in the Eleanor Malik Trophy after she carded 493 points for 30 vee-bulls of the possible 600, while her closest challenger, Chebii, had 487. Gun score tally depicts tough weather conditions at the Range as Chebii downed 462 for 36 and Rantile recorded 459. Other ladies, who are poised to turn the table on Chebii include Brendah Ajiambo, Sarah Sintoi and Pendo Dzombo. But they have to pull significant surprise in today’s shoot to prevail. Meanwhile, former Kenya Open multiple holder Christopher Saina is en-route to win the first Kenya Shooting Sports Federation’s Full-Bore circuit of 2018. He is the overall winner of both the Eleanor Malik and Gun Score trophies. Saina scored 512 points for 35 vee-bulls and 513 for 36 in Eleanor Malik and Gun Score correspondingly. Philip Kipchumba (495,30) and Peter Muli (494,36) took the first and second Super-X positions in the Eleanor Malik whereas captain Sanford Otundo (487,36) and David Kirui (485,27) settled for the same places in the Gun Score respectively.
