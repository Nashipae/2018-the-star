At least 600 hundred university students from Kilifi county have been forced to defer their studies for lack of fees. Kilifi University and Technical Training Institutions students’ union chairman Jacob Fikirini on Sunday said some students have had to drop out. Speaking during a meeting with 158 university dropouts at Ganze Primary School, Fikirini said the number could increase if the county and national governments do not address the issue. Ganze MP Teddy Mwambire attended the meeting. The association is setting up a database of students struggling to pay fees in all the seven subcounties. “We have more than 600 students from Kilifi who are currently home when they are actually supposed to be at the university. Some have deferred for the past five years with hopes that help will come their way and they will continue with their studies, but nothing has been forthcoming. They are all home because they have no fees to pay for their various semesters, with some required to pay as much as Sh100,000,” Fikirini said. The big number of university dropouts is sending a disheartening message to youths in the county already facing issues including poverty, hunger, famine and a high rate of unemployment. To add to this, the tourism and agriculture sectors are struggling to pick up. Esther Nzaro, from Kachororoni village, who is studying for a Master’s degree in computer systems at JKUAT, had to defer her studies three years ago. She said she sees no sign of completing her degree soon. Nzaro works as a computer lab technician and has been saving up to complete her research, but she says it has been tough. She said she had taken a loan to fund her education, but defaulted midway. “I joined JKUAT in 2014. I got a Sh500,000 loan but had to look for more cash to do my research,” Nzaro said.
