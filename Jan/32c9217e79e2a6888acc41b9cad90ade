A man who died after his car plunged into an Embu river has been identified as a Human Resource officer with KenGen. Harrison Kamau died instantly when his car plunged into Rupingazi River on Monday. He worked at KenGen in the hydro-power generating seven forks stations in Embu. His colleagues condoled with his family and expressed shock and sadness at his loss. They said he was hard working and friendly. Kamau was travelling from his rural home in Murangâ€™a after the festive season. The accident occurred at around 4pm. He lost control of his car and veered into the river on the right side. There were no guard rails following several accidents in the past. Whatever remained was vandalised by scrap metal dealers. Witnesses said Kamau was travelling towards Embu town and that on reaching the Rupingazi River Bridge, he lost control. The witnesses said passersby who saw the car dipping into the river tried to rescue him. Before they could reach him through the steep banks and disentangle him from the mangled wreckage, it was too late.
