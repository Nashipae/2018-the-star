Treasury bosses are expected to explain to a Senate committee why they failed to allocate Sh200 million for special audit of Sh99.2 billion outstanding bills in 47 counties. The Senate Public Accounts Committee chaired by Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang’ yesterday was asked to summon Treasury CS Henry Rotich to explain why the funds were not given for a thorough audit to establish validity of the bills. He said Treasury should explain why it is difficult to release the money to help the Auditor General carry out the audits on pending bills. “We also want Kenyans who are suffering after supplying to counties helped,” Kajwang’ said.

Ouko said he had agreed with Treasury bosses to conduct the audit, but Rotich failed to give the Sh200 million needed. “We had a meeting with the Controller of Budget and the Treasury raising concern on the huge pending bills, especially in Nairobi county and we agreed on a special audit,” he said. Odhiambo raised concern over growth of pending bills in five years. She said the figure shot to Sh99.2 billion in the 2017-18 first quarter from Sh96.5 billion on June 30 last year. Recurrent expenditure bills stand at Sh54 billion, while Sh45 billion is for development. Nairobi leads in outstanding bills estimated at Sh60 billion. Odhiambo said unpaid bills always increase because governors have been violating procurement laws. “The problem of huge pending bills is caused by counties overstating local revenues, yet none have attained their revenue collection targets,” she said.
