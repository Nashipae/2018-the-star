Lecturers have threatened to go on strike if negotiations for a new Collective Bargaining Agreement are delayed beyond January. The University Academic Staff Union has protested a decision by the Inter-Public Universities’ Consultative Council Forum to push the start of negotiations from January 10 to January 15. In a protest letter to IPUCCF dated January 10, UASU secretary general Constantine Wasonga (pictured) said the change of dates reneges on the agreement reached in December last year. “UASU promotes industrial harmony and it would be extremely unfortunate if actions by IPUCCF provoke a fresh round of industrial unrest from February 2018,” Wasonga said.

The agreement also stated that negotiations for the 2013-17 internal CBAs for individual universities were to be concluded by February 28. “The IPUCCF letters reveal a lack of commitment to the agreed CBA negotiation calendar and show an intention to dishonour the clear provisions of the parties’ return-to-work formula in violation of Kenya’s Labour laws and the ILO Convention,” Wasonga said.
