Kenyan-born Australian Senator Lucy Gichuhi has praised devolution, saying it will nurture leaders. Speaking in Nyeri yesterday, Gichuhi said devolution will promote the growth of leadership at the grassroots level. She promised to make Nyeri become a model county where people can learn about leadership and empowerment. Gichuhi also promised to promote the relationship between Kenya and Australia. "I want to tell Kenyans that Australia is a welcoming destination with many opportunities for education and individual growth," Gichuhi said. The senator, who was accompanied by her husband William Gichuhi, spoke when she paid a courtesy call on Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga yesterday. She urged Kenyan politicians to be patient with democracy, saying the county is just 54 years-old. Australia got her independence 200 years ago. The husband lamented that Kenya was lagging behind in terms of aid and trade between Australia and other African countries. He asked Kenyan leaders to improve the situation. Kahiga said they will seek for ways to establish exchange programmes between locals and Australia. Kahiga praised the senator, saying she served as role model to many women and Kenyans in general for conquering the world. "She is in the league of the later Nobel Prize winner Professor Wangari Maathai and marathon champion Catherine Ndereba who have conquered the world," Gitahi said. Gichuhi consoled Nyeri residents for the loss of two governors in one year. Nyeri lost former Governor's Nderitu Gachagua and Wahome Mutahi who died in February and November last year respectively. The visiting senator is scheduled to address the Nyeri county assembly this week.
