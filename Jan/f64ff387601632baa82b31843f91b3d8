Kenya Civil Aviation Authority has suspended all commercial flights to and from Garissa barely two weeks after Freedom Air Express launched its first flight. The notice seen by the press instructed the airline to immediately suspend all commercial flights to Garissa and Moyale airstrips. It was sent to the airline’s Wilson airport offices yesterday morning. Airline manager Shillow Abukar said security risks and cracks on the tarmac runway were cited as reasons for suspension. Abukar said engineers from the authority had thoroughly inspected the airstrip before giving the go-ahead, and questioned what had suddenly changed to warrant such extreme measures. “This is a country governed by rules, procedures and regulations. We should have been notified in advance of the impending suspension of our flights. As we speak we have already booked 18 passengers for Friday (today),” he said. Abukar said business had started picking up and on one flight they carried 44 passengers from Garissa. Most passengers are elderly and ailing and cannot travel by road, he said. The cancellation process was malicious, he said, demanding the letter be withdrawn until all stakeholders involved when the airline was seeking clearance to operate from Garissa are informed and reasons given. Shillow said airline lawyers have been instructed to take up the matter. Garissa has been relatively peaceful for two years, he said.
