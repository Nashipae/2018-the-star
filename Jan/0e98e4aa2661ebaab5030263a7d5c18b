Six environmentalists and mountain climbers plan to summit Mt Kenya in five days to create awareness on the need for a national environmental day. World Environment Day will be on June 5. The environment enthusiasts from Kajiado and Laikipia counties decided to climb Mt Kenya - one of the largest water towers in the country - following the destruction of forest cover. Team leader and retired mountain guide Chris Muriithi, 58, said rivers emanating from the mountain are usually dry between January and March. This has led to water-related conflict with downstream users going upstream in search of the resource. Speaking at Sirimon Gate on Monday afternoon before the group started the journey, Muriithi said Laikipia has experienced conflict because of the lack of pasture. Herders from neighbouring counties moved in with their animals in search of pasture and water. Muriithi said the conflict is a transborder issue. He cited a case where the Tanzanian government auctioned livestock belonging to Kenyan herders last year. “This can be prevented and reduced  if Kenyans were educated to conserve the environment and protect water towers through planting trees and protecting riparian areas instead of them being grabbed,” Muriithi said
