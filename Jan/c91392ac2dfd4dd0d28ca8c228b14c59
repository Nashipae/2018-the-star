Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko’s family has said their three-acre firm in Kilifi is under threat. The family said they were attacked last Friday by a group targeting the land. Earlier reports indicate the tussle that sucked-in Sonko saw the governor allegedly brandish a gun. But yesterday, the governor’s cousin Dominic Mbatia said seven men stormed their home with land documents and demanded they vacate. He denied guns were drawn, saying a man identified as Joseph Lenguris had claimed ownership of the land. Kilifi South Lands Control Board member Abdulkarim Hassan said the plot was sold to Caroline Mwelu. Her family claimed to have been attacked during the Friday fracas. Mwelu is related to the Nairobi governor. Hassan said German Monicah Herta  sold the parcel to Mwelu seven years ago. The family said Sh8 million was paid for the land. Reports indicate Lenguris was Herta’s boyfriend before she permanently moved to Germany. “Lenguris applied for a provisional title deed which he used to call for eviction,” Hassan said. The family claimed they were kept hostage Friday night from 10pm before police and Sonko arrived hours later. Mwelu’s son Carol Bachi said he was blocked from accessing the house that night. He added that the seven men with crude weapons killed their dog. Bachi reported the matter to Kijipwa police station. Jane Mwende who lives in the house said she was threatened with rape. But Lenguris said Mwelu paid him Sh2 million for the plot, whose price was Sh23 million. “They threw me out in August 2013. I went to court and an order was given that I should reposess the land. That is why I came on Friday and took over,” he said. Contrary to Mwelu’s family account, Lenguris said he was the one inside when Sonko arrived and “fired 10 live bullets”. He denied he held the family hostage and said Sonko was not accompanied by police, but “goons”.
