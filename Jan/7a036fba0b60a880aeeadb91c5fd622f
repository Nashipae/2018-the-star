Members of county assembly will continue
pocketing hefty perks after the High Court yesterday issued orders temporarily
barring the Salaries and Remuneration Committee (SRC) from slashing their
salaries and benefits. Justice Chacha Mwita, in orders
that dealt the Salary agency a blow said the commission should not affect the
new salaries pending hearing and determination of the suit. In a gazette notice dated July
7, 2017 ,  the commission proposed new
salary cuts for state officers in a move aimed at saving the taxpayer Sh9
billion annually. But the agency’s bid to reduce salaries hangs
in balance as similar orders have been issued by the court stopping it from capping
salaries for members of parliament. The commission is defending a similar
case filed by the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC). PSC went to court after the Gazettement
of its members reduced salaries and sitting allowances among other benefits. The ward representatives says
the decision by Salaries Commission to review their pay and benefits downwards
has affected effective functioning of devolution. “The decision is unreasonable,
discriminatory, arbitrary and against their legitimate expectation” they say in
a suit filed through County Assemblies Forum. The MCA’s also argues that decision
denies them the right to annual salary increment, mortgage, transport and other
benefits accorded State officers. “The implementation of the
impugned decision will unduly undermine the due and efficient operation of the
47 county assemblies as well as governments,” they argue. Last week the Agency filed an application in
which it accused PSC of failing to disclose relevant information to the court
before obtaining the orders against it. SRC now wants the High Court
order, which barred MPs from receiving new reviewed pay perks, set aside. That case will come up today for
directions. Justice Mwita also directed the suit by the
county wards to be placed before the judge as it involves similar issues.
