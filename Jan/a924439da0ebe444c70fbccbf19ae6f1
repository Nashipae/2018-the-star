Gerald Mutethia/Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi (pictured) has formed a seven-member committee to scrutinise and audit Sh1.3 billion pending bills.  Kiraitu promised not to use any public coin to pay contractors who did shoddy work or none at all. Speaking in his offices on Thursday, Kiraitu said this will help to flush out rogue contractors and suppliers. Kiraitu said the committee will present the genuine claims and make recommendations on work done. The team will also confirm compliance with the procurement process and if services rendered were within the approved budget. The committee is also tasked with checking if certificates were issued for work done, invoices, receipts and contract sums. Kiraitu said it is important to confirm whether goods were delivered in the right quality and quantity. Committee members are Riungu M’ikieni (chairperson), Beatrice Baariu (vice chairperson) and members Kainga Mitu, Mbaya Karichu, John Murithi, Nyamu Nyaga and Kimathi Muthomi. Kiraitu said the committee will work with the CID to nab those who present fraudulent claims to the committee. The team has 90 days to complete the job. Deputy Governor Titus Ntuchiu said the measures have been taken to safeguard public finances and ensure they are well managed. “One of the biggest challenge our adminstration is committed to tackling is the pending bill inherited from the previous administration. It is only fair that we verify the authenticity and validity of these bills to service the genuine ones,” he said.
