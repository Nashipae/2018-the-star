The
High Court is presently hearing a case seeking to legalise same sex relations
between consenting adults in private. Eric
Gitari, director of the National Gay and Lesbian Rights Commission, wants to
decriminalise sections 162 and 165 of the Penal Code. Many
Kenyans will feel outraged that we could even consider legalising homosexual
behaviour. But
they should reflect more carefully. No one is defending defilement, paedophilia
or rape. The discussion is only about what goes on behind closed doors between consenting
adults. What
is special about consenting gay sex behind closed doors? What about infidelity
behind closed doors? Or masturbation? Or sex toys? All
these 'unethical' things happen but should they all be criminalised? We
all know gay people in business, politics, and society. We accept them because
they are our colleagues, acquaintances or friends. Why then do we want to
criminalise their private lives? Pope
Francis says we are hypocrites if we believe we are better than gay people.
Kenya should remove the repressive colonial legislation that outlaws gay love
between consenting adults in their own homes.
