Residents of Ugenya and Ugunja constituencies have been cautioned to beware of conmen pretending to be recruiting people for road construction. Ukwala MCA Peter Omondi said there are cartels lying to unsuspecting youths that they are recruiting people to work on the Ugunja-Ukwala-Rwambwa road. The construction is yet to start. Omondi said the conmen masquerade as officials of the Chinese company that has been contracted to build the road. He said the cartels are sending short text messages, instructing people to pay Sh370 to a certain pay bill number in order to be recruited. The MCA spoke to the Star in Ukwala town on Saturday. Omondi said he spoke to the management of the Chinese company and they said workers are yet to be recruited.
