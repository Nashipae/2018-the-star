Pregnant women in Turkana are looking forward to improved emergency services after the county government unveiled two ambulances. The ambulances, which were donated by UNICEF, were flagged off by Governor Josphat Nanok on Monday at the Lodwar referral hospital. Werner Schultink, UNICEF country representative to Kenya, said the
donation will serve to strengthen the community confidence in the
county's health sector. The vehicles were bought by the UK government, through UK Aid. Health CEC Jane Ajele, said the ambulances will be dispatched to Turkana South and Turkana West sub-counties. "One ambulances is for Kalapata and Lokichar and the other for Kakuma and Letea Wards in Turkana West," she said. Gilchrist Lokoel, Lodwar referral hospital boss, said the demand of ambulances has increased due to additional
number of health facilities constructed by the county government. "The ambulances will contribute a reduction of mortality rate as
well as save lives of mothers in case of complications during
childbirth, gunshot victims and other cases." Lokoel said the ambulances are well equipped to handle medical cases before they are referred to a health facility. "They
are moving hospitals because they have been fitted with oxygen,
equipment to shock the heart for such cases and are equipped with fluids
and drugs," he said. For his part, Nanok asked residents to apply for NHIF cover adding that his administration will improve stocks of medicines in local health facilities. "I don't want to hear cases of patients being sent to purchase medicine in chemists yet the government spends money to equip hospitals with medicine." Residents will be required to pay Sh500 every month to be enrolled in the NHIF program. "We will introduce the program in collaboration with the national government," Nanok said.
