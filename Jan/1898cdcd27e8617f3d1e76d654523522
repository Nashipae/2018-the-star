Police in Nguutani have arrested drivers of two newspaper distribution Toyota pickups belonging to the Nation Media Group that were loaded with charcoal. Officers were tipped off by the locals in Sosoma, where the drivers were loading the charcoal. Residents alerted the police as the cars were heading to Nairobi after dropping newspapers at Garissa. County enforcement officer David Muthami said they were at Nguutani when they got a call from residents of Sosoma and  with the help of the police, they arrested the two pickups. “When we stopped them they removed Nation newspapers. They had refused to open the pickups, but finally they had to after we took them to a police station,” Muthami said. Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has imposed a ban on charcoal trade.
