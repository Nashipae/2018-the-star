Starring: Will Smith, Joel Edgerton, Noomi Rapace, Lucy Fry, Édgar Ramírez, Ike Barinholtz Directed by: David Ayer Release: December 22, 2017  One of the biggest debates on social media over the Christmas holidays was on the differing reviews of the Netflix film, Bright. Professional critics were punitive in their reviews, which ultimately earned the film unfavourable reviews on sites such as Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. On the bright side, fans took to social media in support of the film, saying it wasn’t as bad as the critics made it out to be. While a tug-of-war ensued between the fans and the critics, the film became the most-streamed release on Netflix. Naturally, I was intrigued and set out to find for myself what the fuss was all about. Bright is a fantasy film about an alternate time, where several races (humans, orcs, elves, centaurs, etc.) live together in ‘forged’ peace. At a police station in Los Angeles, human police officer Daryl Ward is forcefully partnered up with the first Orkish police officer. Tensions are high in the precinct about letting Jakoby, an orc, serve on the force. Jakoby is not only ostracised by humans but also by his own race for betraying them. In one of their raids, the two arrest a young elf named Tikka in possession of a wand. The wand can grant wishes to only the few that can touch it, known as a Bright. If a non-Bright touched the wand, they would explode. Jakoby and Ward are caught in the middle of a power struggle between good and evil. The film is extremely demanding of focus. You need to be highly involved with following the plot or you’ll just get lost. All the races and myths and magic is too whirlwind for a less-than-two-hour movie. But is it horrible? Maybe a little dull. Overall, the script does injustice to Will Smith’s talent.  Star Rating: 2/5
