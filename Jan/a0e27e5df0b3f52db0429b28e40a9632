The Kuppet national executive board has allowed union officials who won various elective seats to serve on a part-time basis. Secretary General Akelo Misori said MPs Omboko Milemba (Emuhaya), Ronald Tonui (Bomet Central), Catherine Wambilyanga (Bungoma county) will still work for Kuppet. "They will serve the union on a part-time basis with immediate effect," he said in a statement on Sunday. Misori said this was decided in a meeting held on Friday, January 26, 2017. He said functions of the said officers which require full-time engagement will be delegated to other union officials. "Of paramount importance is the function of the national chairperson as the leader of union delegation which shall be forthwith performed by the national vice chairperson." The remarks came days after Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion was removed from TSC payroll after ODM nominated him as MP. In a gazette notice on December 13, Labour CS Phylis Kandie said trade union members who are now
state officials by way of nomination and election to Parliament
respectively must leave office. "This notification to
vacate office applies to all trade union officials holding either
nominated or elective positions in any county assembly or Parliament,"
Kandie said.
