A chief, her assistant and three Nyumba Kumi members are to face murder charges following the death of a suspected changâ€™aa dealer at a village in Nyeri county. The five appeared before Nanyuki principal magistrate Waititu Gichimu who directed they be detained at Nanyuki Prison until January 16, when they will plead. When they were arraigned in court yesterday, Caroline Muriu for the prosecution told the magistrate police had completed investigations and were now ready to prosecute the case. Gakawa chief Lucy Wanja, Equator assistant chief Getrude Koki and three members of Nyumba Kumi Initiative - Loyford Mwirigi, George Wachira and Mary Nyambura - are accused of killing 46-year-old Wachira Kabui at his home in Ichuga village on October 31 last year. They first appeared in court last Tuesday.
