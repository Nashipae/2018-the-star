Little-known Muhuri Muchiri are among 28 schools (girls and boys) enlisted for the 2017 Safaricom Sports Personality of the Year Awards. Muhuri defied odds to lift their maiden title having finished third at the nationals. The debutants under the tutelage of coach Kikechi Kombo weathered stiff competition from regulars to emerge champions at the East Africa games in Uganda, an achievement that has arguably secured them a place in the nominees.  The event is also being sponsored by National Social Security Fund, Kenya Power, Communication Authority of Kenya and Lotto Foundation among others. The rookie will challenge for the top three schools in boys’ category alongside Nakuru County’s Menengai Mixed, who won the national rugby 7’s title and finished third at the East Africa and Laiser, who reclaimed the rugby 15’s East Africa and national basketball titles.  Also to watch will be the national 15’s champions Kakamega High and national rugby 7’s losing finalist Chavakali Boys. Kakamega’s ‘Green Commandos, who finished third at the East Africa show, are also in race alongside Upper Hill who presented three teams both at the national and East Africa competitions posting mixed fortunes. Upper Hill emerged the national football boys’ champions but was no show in Uganda while the school’s hockey team settled for silver at the nationals and fifth at the East Africa State. Upper’s basketball team finished second at the nationals. National hockey boys’ champions St Anthony Boys Kitale and East Africa champions Kisumu Day are also lined up for the accolades. Also on the list are national volleyball boys champions Sengera SDA, national handball boys champions St Ignatius Mukumu Boys, Dr Ribeiro (hockey) and Kanyawanga (handball). In the girls’ category, national and East Africa football girls’ champions Wiyeta Girls’ have secured their slot in the nominees list after making a major come back last year.
