WHO has pledged to support Kenya as it plans to roll out universal healthcare in five years.  Director general Tedros Adhanom made the announcement yesterday during his first official visit to Kenya. He also said WHO is ready to partner with the government to improve healthcare as well provision and strengthen Kenya’s position as a regional hub for health services. “I am looking forward to working with you to improve the people’s health outcomes not only in Kenya but also in the region,” Adhanom said. In a meeting with President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House, Nairobi, the global health agency also pledged to work with the government to bring in health experts who will help develop a model that will be efficient and effective in providing universal healthcare. Uhuru welcomed the move and said that since Kenya has a relatively young population, achieving UHC will not be problem. “But it is not just about access, neither is it about infrastructure or management of the health systems. We are looking at ensuring that it is affordable and efficient, otherwise it will collapse.” he said. Uhuru added, “I am keen to develop a health model that will be acceptable to the devolved units. A model that will guarantee our people better services.” When Uhuru was sworn into office last year, he said his administration will focus on food security, affordable housing, manufacturing and affordable healthcare as key pillars during his second term in office.
