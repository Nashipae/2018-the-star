More than 850 IDPs from Kinyoro ward in Saboti subcounty yesterday said they have been left out in the government compensation programme meant to give them stipends.  The IDPs matched to the county commissioner’s office in Trans Nzoia and lodged their complaints.  Their chairman Mark Adir said they were temporarily settled at Kinyoro by the government in operation Rudi Nyumbani, but they are suffering.  “Life has become so frustrating. Our children are suffering yet the government has gone silent,” he said.  Adir said they depend on Red Cross to donate food and other items.  The chairman said it is the third time they have been left out of the compensation plan by the government.  “We are not going to sit back anymore and watch in silence,” he said. Adir said when the compensation programme started the IDPs from Kinyoro were not included.
