The petition challenging the election of North Imenti MP Rahim Dawood will be determined on January 25. Meru High court judge Ann Ongi'njo said this on Monday after lawyers in the case filed by ex-MP Silas Muriuki concluded their submissions. The lawyers are Mwanzia Muai (for the petitioner), Joseph Mwangi (IEBC) and Mwangi Kibicho who is holding brief for Dawood. During the submissions, Muriuki's lawyer asked the court to order a recount of votes cast at the constituency's 177 polling stations. "We have demonstrated to the court that there is need for an examination of ballots by way of a recount," Mwanzia said. He said Muriuki’s agent was unable to verify the results at the constituency tallying center after he was arrested for an unclear offence. "Justice will be served after a recount of all votes cast at all polling stations in North Imenti constituency." The petitioner argued that the irregularities and illegalities committed during the August 8 vote affected the results, hence a violation of the constitution. But lawyer Mwangi said the petitioner did not demonstrate how the constitution was violated. He said the recount could only be confined to specific polling stations where there were specific disputes and discrepancies, not all polling stations. "The petitioner has not named any polling station where he alleges his votes were deducted. He is basing his argument on the narrow margin." Kibicho said there was no connection between the arrest of Muriuki’s chief agent and the results. He said North Imenti returning officer Sheikh Abdi testified before court that he had already finished tallying by the time Muriuki's chief agent was arrested. Kibicho further said Muriuki’s agent was charged with an electoral offence so he should prove his innocence at that particular court. He urged the judge to strike out the petition with costs on the former MP. Read: Dawood wants court to dismiss petition challenging his victory  Click here for the latest political news
