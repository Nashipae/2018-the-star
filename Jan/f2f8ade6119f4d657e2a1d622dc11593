City Hall plans to recruit about 300 askaris to improve operations and deal with the hawker menace. They will receive one-month training next month. In an interview with the Star yesterday, senior inspector Peter Mbaya said the county is desperately short of askaris. “We’re overwhelmed. The number of askaris in the Central Business District is very small,” he said. The county has 97 askaris and needs about 300 more, he said. The night operations team has only 15 members and it is almost impossible for them to handle all the traders in downtown, he said. During the day, county askaris can arrest up to 150 traders, but at night, because of the shortfall, they only arrest about 10-15, Mbaya said. The Inspectorate department also faces the problem of elderly and ineffective askaris. “The last time the city employed askaris was in 1988. The majority of askaris are aged, hence, they cannot perform well,” Mbaya said. He said most of them get tired easily.
