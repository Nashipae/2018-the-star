Mandera North MP Major (Rtd) Bashir Sheikh Abdullahi has asked the court to throw out a petition filed by his rival Hussein Herin for it is a "waste of time". Bashir said a recount of votes cast in August 8 elections as requested by Hussein will not make any difference. "I will object to the scrutiny because the voting patterns and results for the entire constituency show that I won. The petitioner got zero votes and asking for scrutiny would be a waste of the Court's time," he said. He asked the court to strike out the petition filed because the margin between them was too wide to make any difference. Bashir was testifying before Justice Hedwig Ong'undi . The MP also denied that the IEBC Commissioner Professor Abdi Guliye is his cousin saying he was just a fellow clansman. "Professor Guliye is not my cousin, he is just my fellow clansman, there is a huge difference between the two, we just come from the same Degodia Clan", he stated. The lawmaker is being represented by Lawyer Nelson Havi. Bashir was declared the winner after gunning 24,999 votes. Herin is challenging the election of Bashir over what he terms as massive elections malpractices. He wants the Court to order for a fresh election.   Click here for the latest political news
