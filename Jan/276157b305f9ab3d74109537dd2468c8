A drunken Marakwet man turned against his friend after a drinking spree and fatally shot him, an official and witness said. Christopher Komen, 27, is said to have argued with Raymond Chesir, 35, before shooting him three times on Sunday night. After news of the death spread, some youths retaliated and torched Komen’s house and property belonging to his relatives in Kasui village, Marakwet East. Resident Hosea Kanda said the deceased and the suspect were friends. They had been herding their cattle together in Mogil before they went drinking in the evening. “The suspect asked the deceased to escort him to his home after drinking, but he refused. That is when he shot him. I don’t know if they had other differences,” Kanda said on the phone. Marakwet assistant deputy county commissioner Wilson Tangus said the police arrested the suspect moments after committing the offence. He said they hunting for the youths who retaliated. “Police officers are investigating to establish whether the gun used is legal,” Tangus said. Security agencies say thousands of illegal firearms are in the hands of criminals, exacerbating crime and fuelling cattle rustling. Tangus urged residents to remain calm. He said Komen was being quizzed by Kapsowar police and would be charged in court as soon as investigations are concluded. The body of the deceased was taken to Kapsowar Mission Hospital mortuary for a postmortem.
