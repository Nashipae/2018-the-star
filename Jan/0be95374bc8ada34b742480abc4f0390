The Siaya county government has suspended the recruitment of 400 ECDE teachers, citing change of curriculum. The development came after the government replaced the previous 8-4-4 syllabus with the new 2-6-3-3-3 curriculum, which has scrapped the baby class unit. Education executive Charles Akello said they will wait for the adoption of the new curriculum before any recruitment is conducted. Current ECDE teachers will have to undergo refresher courses to familiarise themselves with the new system. “The county will train the pre-primary teachers for the new curriculum in February so that they become pioneers of the new curriculum before we recruit new tutors,” Akello said. The new curriculum has reduced the years learners spend in ECDE centres from three to two. Akello said they were assessing various ECDE centres for data on teachers handling Final and Middle so that they are put on the county’s payroll system. “Of the 600 teachers we employed, the county intends to either redeploy those handling Baby Class to manage Final and Middle classes in other centres or they be left in the hands of parents,” Akello said. County director of the Teachers Service Commission Samael Marigat said the training will be jointly conducted by the national and county governments. The teachers will be equip with necessary skills to effectively implement the new curriculum. “We are enlisting all ECD instructors for a massive training and workshop,” Marigat said.
