We will not beg Deputy Governor Polycarp Igathe to reconcile with Governor Mike Sonko, MCAs have said. Majority leader Abdi Guyo said the resignation was an act of cowardice and the highest form of betrayal. He urged Igathe to reconsider, but warned that the county government can still run without him. “We are urging Igathe to reconsider his decision because it was not a wise one. But if that will not materialise, then we want to tell residents not to be worried because we have competent people in this county,” he said. Guyo said Igathe’s resignation was premature as he did not consult the party or the assembly leadership. Guyo and other Jubilee MCAs had volunteered to mediate between the two leaders, but it seems they have hit a snag. “The governor picked Igathe as his running mate because he had trust in him. Nairobians also trusted them and that was why they elected them. But now he has betrayed them,” he said. Igathe was picked by State House operatives to be Sonko’s running mate. The pre-election agreement was that Igathe would run the county, while Sonko would be the political face of the administration. But Sonko is said to have regarded his deputy as a State House project and has been stamping his authority. Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, former speaker Alex Magelo said Igathe’s demands were unrealistic as his roles are well defined in law. “You cannot demand more than what the law stipulates. The deputy governor acts as governor when the boss is away or the governor may delegate some functions to him and that is all he can do,” he said. Magelo opposed the proposed amendments to the County Governments Act to give the governors a free hand in picking their deputies. “Some governors will abuse the law. They will fire their deputies on flimsy grounds,” he said.
