The National Environment Management Authority has issued a warning to flower farms near riparian land in Lake Naivasha. With water levels dropping to alarming levels, small-scale farmers have encroached on the lake, while others have dug canals. Nema served a notice to top facility Camp Carnelley’s to cover a canal it dug into the lake. Environment officer Jessica Kahura yesterday said cases of investors setting up on riparian land have increased. She said Nema will sue any investor who encroaches on riparian land. “We have issued Camp Carnelley’s a seven-day notice to cover the canal, failing which, we shall have no option but to charge them in court,”Kahura said. She said the lake is crucial to the economy. “The harsh weather conditions have seen water levels in the lake drop sharply,” Kahura said.
