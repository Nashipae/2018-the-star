Nyeri Senator Ephraim Maina has urged NASA leader Raila Odinga
to respect the Constitution and shelve his swearing-in plans. Maina said the law only recognises one President who is Uhuru Kenyatta. Raila is scheduled to be sworn in as the People's President tomorrow. Speaking to journalists at a funeral in Lusoi in Kieni East on Saturday, Maina said the move will affect the unity of Kenyans. “There cannot be two presidents in this country. We can’t afford to
have anything that is unconstitutional,”
Maina said. Maina asked religious leaders to pray for the country, saying Raila's oath plans will slow down development. He also urged Kenyans to support efforts by former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo to break a
deal between Uhuru and Raila. “Obasanjo was sent by the African Union and United Nations since he is a
respectable man. He is skillful in diplomatic issues and commands respect across
continents. He therefore  deserves audience. It is good to welcome him as he may
have a good advice for  the unity of our
country,” Said Maina. The Jubilee Party Senator said leaders of both political divides
should listen to Obasanjo before dismissing his mediation mission in the
country. Obasanjo was sent by the United Nations last week to seek truce in the
current political stalemate in the country, which was occasioned by last year’s
Presidential elections where Odinga claimed he was rigged.
