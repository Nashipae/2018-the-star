Mombasa residents want NASA leader Raila Odinga to name his Cabinet as soon as possible. Yesterday, they celebrated in the streets after Raila Odinga took the oath as the “President” of Kenya. Sadiq Hassan said he hopes the oath will mark the beginning of a better Kenya. “It marks the new beginning where electoral theft will be dealt with firmly,” he said. Philip Mutei from Changamwe said Raila must act fast to name his Cabinet. Victoria Tunje described the Uhuru Park event as historical. The residents had crowded clubs and restaurants to follow the short ceremony, which Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka did not attend. Though optimistic, they demanded to know why Kalonzo, Moses Wetang’ula and Musalia Mudavadi did not attend to avoid “unnecessary rumours”. Raila said the three could not make it to Uhuru Park because of reasons that would be made public later. The oath was administered by Ruaraka MP TJ Kajwang’ and former Nairobi Governor candidate Miguna Miguna —both lawyers. Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho invited Raila to take the oath. Residents said he is the perfect replacement should Kalonzo bolt out. Earlier, Mombasa Deputy Governor William Kingi said the Communication Authority’s shutdown of local TV stations was “draconian, intemperate and totally uncalled-for”. He said it was a violation of media rights and the freedom of expression. Kingi said NASA’ plans are unstoppable. “By scapegoating the media, the Jubilee Administration is only demonstrating its incompetence in dealing with matters of national interest.
