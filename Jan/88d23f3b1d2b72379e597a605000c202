The Uasin Gishu county mobilized police and county askaris to carry out the eviction but the hawkers refused to vacate leading to a confrontation. County Security advisor Paul Ruto said the hawkers had refused to use a new market put up for them and were instead operating in the town CBD. "We have talked to them to use the market that the county put up for them but they have been unwilling and operating on the streets against county regulations", said Ruto. The hackers have been operating on the streets since last December but the county wants them to keep off from the streets.

"They came abruptly and shot carelessly injuring so many people," Njenga said. One of the hawkers claimed that he had been beaten on his private parts.   Click here for the latest political news
