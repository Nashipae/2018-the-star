The 2017 Safaricom Sports Personality of the Year Award received a further Sh6m boost from two corporate entities yesterday. National Hospital Insurance Fund and Multi-Choice Kenya donated Sh4m and Sh2m respectively for the showpiece set for tomorrow at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre. The two companies are among several others who have enriched the 14th edition of the Safaricom event. NHIF are supporting the event for the second time and have increased their investment by Sh3m. Last year, they injected Sh1m into the awards. MultiChoice contribution saw GOtv and DStv donate Sh500,000each with SuperSport giving Sh1m in broadcast form. Jeff Mwangi, the NHIF chief executive officer, indicated that not all the money will be channeled to the prizes. He said part of the amount will be used to facilitate a drive to have sportsmen and women to register as members with the health insurance scheme. This is critical given that in sports, some injuries can be career-threatening if they are not attended to well and in time. MultiChoice’s Philip Wahome said: “We just want to appreciate and encourage the players, who generate most of our content.” Former world marathon champion, Douglas Wakihuri, said apart from the recognizing and honouring excellent performances by our sportsmen, they are designing ways Olympians can contribute in talent development in Kenya. “We are thankful for the sponsorship towards these efforts to motivate Kenyan sportsmen and women. As time goes by, we are thinking in a futuristic angle as Olympians. We are looking for ways to make good use of our Olympics diplomas to develop and ameliorate young players and athletes,” said Wakihuri.
