A new Sh7.5 billion medicines manufacturing plant will be constructed at the Export Processing Zone in Athi River, Industrialisation CS Adan Mohammed has said. Construction of the plant, to be owned by Bangladesh-based Square Pharmaceuticals, was launched by the CS yesterday. The construction is expected to be completed by end of July 2019. The plant will manufacture a range of 2 billion tablets/capsules and 60 million bottles of liquid medicines for both local use and export. The drugs include those for communicable diseases such as HIV/Aids, Malaria and Tuberculosis. Drugs for non-communicable diseases such diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and anti-psychotic disease will also be manufactured within the first five years. Once operational, the plant will raise the number of pharmaceutical manufacturers in Kenya to 35.â€¨ Currently, the local pharmaceuticals supply only 28 per cent of Kenya's medicinal needs. The rest is covered by imports. There has been a regular import growth of 11.45 per cent over the last three years. “The construction of a local pharmaceutical manufacturing plant will bring significant industrial benefits, including technology transfer and demand for education and training, development of pharmaceutical production sector and create employment opportunities, as envisaged in Kenya’s Vision 2030,” Mohammed. said. Square Pharmaceuticals said they surveyed Ethiopia and Tanzania before settling on Kenya to host the plant. “The plant will ensure Kenya and the region can easily access quality and affordable medicine,” Square Pharmaceuticals Limited managing director Tapan Chowdhury said. According to WHO, local production of medicine in developing countries is a potential solution to the problem of public access to medicine  “We are grateful for the support we have received from the Government of Kenya, particularly, creating a policy and business environment where pharmaceutical companies can thrive. We believe that local pharmaceutical production has a potential to drastically reduce the cost of drugs by 40 per cent and bring greater access to essential medicine while at the same time, promoting universal health care,” Chowdhury said.
