RAK Half Marathon champion Bedan Karoki will be seeking to defend his title during the 2018 edition of the event set for February 9. Karoki faces up to 15 men with sub-60 minute bests—two more than last year—and his task is well cut out, whether he goes faster than his 59:10 mark from twelve months ago or not. No less than 29 men have now broken the hour on the sweeping loops of the RAK circuit, including the four under 60 minutes last year, each of whom set their personal best in the process, and three of them are back. Facing Karoki again, the astonishing Augustine Choge, able to boast the greatest range of world class times in history and who clocked 59:26 in third place in only his third half marathon, continues to seek experience before venturing to the full marathon, while Solomon Yego, fourth last year, dipped under the hour for the first time on a record-eligible course. Alongside them, twelve others have tasted ‘times in the 50’s’, their range varying from the hugely experienced Guye Adola of Ethiopia, with his 10,000m speed of 27:09 combining with his 2:03.46 marathon strength, to the raw talent of Kenya’s 20-year-old Jorum Lumbasi, who with his 58:48 in Copenhagen last September, was world No.2 in 2017. Others to watch include 2014 winner and two-time Boston Marathon Lelisa Desisa champion, who won his last four half marathons, and compatriot debutante Jemal Yimer, who at 21, can already claim a fifth place in last summer’s world championship 10,000m as well as fourth spot in the IAAF World Cross Country Championships in March. With such a display of talent due to line up on the day of the Winter Olympic Opening Ceremony, those with an eye for road racing of the very highest quality can divert their attention to the live broadcast of arguably the world’s consistently fastest half marathon of the last decade and more. The women’s field will be released later in the month where world record holder Peres Jepchirchir is expected to headline the list.
