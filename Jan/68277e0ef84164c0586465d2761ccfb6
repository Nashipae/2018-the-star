Tonnes of goods from Tanzania are possibly entering Kenya tax free following the lack of scanners at the Namanga border post. This was revealed during an inspection tour conducted by acting Kajiado county commissioner David Kipkemoi on Wednesday. The official told journalists that it was unacceptable for KRA to allow goods to enter the country without the same being scanned. He said this provides room for the proliferation of counterfeits and other illicit goods, a situation worsened by the numerous porous points at the border. "The government is losing billions of shillings to tax evaders who appear to be assisted by public servants entrusted with revenue collection." Kipkemoi further warned KRA officials against forging export documents. He asked the rural border patrol units to deal with culprits. The official said illegal ethanol is mostly moved across the Namanga border owing to collusion between KRA officers and the police. "I have received information that police officers are creating roadblocks at night in a bid to take bribes from motorists transporting goods to Nairobi." He spoke after meeting with clearing agents who complained about the questionable activities by police officers at the post. Kipkemoi said the government has only approved one roadblock between Kitengela and Namanga. The administrator's tour followed a petition by Futa Magendo Action Network (FMAN) who told President Uhuru Kenyatta to order a crackdown on tax evasion rackets in the area. FMAN alleged that a chain of cartels has been importing untaxed raw spirit from Tanzania, denying KRA billions of shillings from the scale of counterfeit drinks.
