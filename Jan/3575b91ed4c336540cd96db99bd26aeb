Suspected betrayal and mistrust in NASA over the planned controversial swearing-in of Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka as People’s President and deputy have forced the coalition members to affirm their commitment by taking an oath. More than 15 NASA lawmakers yesterday warned members who refuse to sign an affidavit to commit to the coalition’s swearing-in ceremony at the end of this month will be considered to be double-dealing with Jubilee.

We have decided to do this because some among us are with NASA during daytime, but at night dine with Jubilee at State House,” Malala said. There is a standoff in the National Super Alliance, with Wiper leaders threatening not to participate in the swearing-in unless there is fair sharing of parliamentary slots. Wiper leaders are demanding Raila’s ODM donate a Parliamentary Service Commission slot to its member – Borabu MP Ben Momanyi. They claim he was shortchanged in favour of Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga. ODM, however, has maintained it will not donate any of its slots and instead cast the ball on Wiper to agree with Musalia Mudavadi’s ANC to be given a slot. ODM argues it has donated more slots to its three affiliate parties than it should as the second majority party after Jubilee Party in Parliament. Click here for the latest political news
