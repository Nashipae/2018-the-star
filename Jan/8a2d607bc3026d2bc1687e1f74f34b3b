NASA principals accompanied their politicians to court on Monday, a curious move hours before their planned swearing-in of a president and VP. Police are preparing to keep the peace while members of the public are worried about fatalities with the inauguration of Raila Odinga (president) and Kalonzo Musyoka (deputy president). This is the first time the NASA principals have been spotted in the courts to follow proceedings of the cases arising from the August 8 election.

Babu's election on August 8 last year was challenged by Jubilee Party politician Francis Mureithi who claimed chaos led to massive irregularities. Mureithi asked for the scrutiny and recount of votes at 44 polling stations, most of them in Embakasi Primary School. Raila was in court for about 30 minutes. He declined to speak about his oath-taking saying a committee was in charge. But he told his supporters that he will be at Nairobi's Uhuru Park on Tuesday. Babu's lawyers opposed the application by his opponent saying he gave insufficient evidence.
