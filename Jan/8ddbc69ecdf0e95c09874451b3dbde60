Traders and business people in Kunati market in Thangatha ward, Tigania East, are counting losses after a fire razed property woth millions of shillings. The cause of the fire that broke out at around 3am is yet to be established. Traders who spoke to the Star said they could not save anything. They said crowded stalls made the fire spread easily and impossible to access the market. They also attributed the destruction to bad roads that made it difficult for fire engines to put out the fire. Trader Elijah Kimathi said a sales store with property worth more than Sh3 million, a garage, a posho mill, kiosks and other property were burnt to ashes. “These people need help to start a new business life. The fire has burnt everything in 10 front business houses. The fire fighters from Maua arrived at 6am, saying they got lost on the way,” Kimathi said. Tigania Central deputy county commissioner Caroline Nzili told the Star six buildings were burnt down. She said police have launched investigations to establish the cause. Nzili added that they are yet to evaluate the value of property gutted down.
