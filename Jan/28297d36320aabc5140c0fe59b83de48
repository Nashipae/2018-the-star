Daddy Owen has been quiet for some time musically. The artiste had a tough time after the death of the patriarch of his family. He gave us an exclusive and deeply personal interview about last year, what he has been doing, his father, his career plans and his son. "I wish I could do more. My dad was still very hard on me. Right now I am seeing some things that he was telling me when he was still alive. I still need your wisdom." We asked about him doing music with secular artists and he let on about the example he would be setting for his son. "I will end up confusing my son. I don't know if you are getting my point," he said. "I have a son. I have a son. He is a big boy, don't worry [about the name]. He is mature, akaboy, utamwona tu, usijali."
