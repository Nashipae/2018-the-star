Kenyan-born Australian Senator Lucy Gichuhi has defended Nyeri women against claims that they beat their husbands. Gichuhi dismissed the stereotype saying the stereotype was an "irrelevant joke and a sideshow". She said this during a press briefing on Monday, while introducing her husband William Gichuhi, who confirmed that he had never been beaten. Gichuhi, who hails from Hiriga area in Mathira, Nyeri county, spoke when she paid Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga a courtesy call at his office. The Senator said Kenyans should look at the Nyeri woman as one who takes responsibility for her life and supports family. "The Nyeri woman is a woman who is hardworking and overcomes her circumstances." Kahiga termed the Senator a role model to women in Nyeri and the country at large who have conquered the world in the global front. He cited the late Nobel Prize Winner Wangari Maathai and marathon champion Catherine Ndereba. Gichuhi, who went to Australia as an immigrant, was the first African woman to be elected to the Australian Senate last year. The visiting Senator will address the Nyeri assembly later this week.
