Everyone across the world is celebrating the New Year that we have
all been blessed with. It has been a crazy year for many but we have all
pulled through and are fortunate to see another year. Grace
Msalame's baby daddy and his wife are starting the New Year with amazing
news. A few months ago, Evaline Momanyi shared photos of her vacation
abroad and we noticed that she had a bun in the oven. Well, we weren't
wrong, as she has finally shared a photo of her growing baby bump. She
took to social media to share a cute photo of her and her husband,
accompanied with a very moving message and a verse from the Bible. She wrote, "The Prayer of Jabez "Oh, that you would bless me indeed and enlarge my territory, that your
hand would be with me and that you would keep me from evil, that I may
not cause pain!" 1 Chronicles 4:10 See you all in 2018....he has already begun his work for the next year!
Thanks to everyone and everything that has been a blessing, a lesson
and a part of my life in this past year. Peace, Love and BlessingsÂ  @mwaurasworld."
