The High Court in Meru has ordered scrutiny and recount of senator votes in seven polling stations in Meru county. Mugambi Imanyara, through lawyers James Odour and Martin Gitonga, is challenging the victory of Senator Mithika Linturi and had filed an application for scrutiny and recount of votes. Judge Ann Ong’injo ordered the recount and scrutiny. She also ordered the examination and recount of votes garnered for each candidate. Justice Ong’injo also ordered the scrutiny of all Forms 38A in all the polling stations in Imenti Central constituency, where the county returning officer claimed he corrected an error in Form 38B. She also directed for a recount and scrutiny in Maua Primary School, Nkubu Social Hall, Mabuurwa and Tigania East polling stations. They are all in Imenti Central constituency. The recount will be carried out between January 12-20 in Meru and Maua IEBC warehouses under supervision by the Deputy High Court Registrar. The Deputy Registrar will then file a report on January 22, when the matter will be mentioned.  "Forms 38A should be examined and results tallied to Form 38Bs to confirm Form 38C," the judge said.  At Nkubu Social Hall, the court ordered the scrutiny and recount of all ballot papers in polling station One. Lawyer Ruth Kiriara, who represented the IEBC and Meru county returning officer, had said the scrutiny should be limited to disputed polling stations. She told the court there was no supportive ground or evidence that could grant for scrutiny. Lawyer Ann Awour, representing Linturi, also opposed the application on grounds that scrutiny could only be done in specific polling stations. “The petitioner did not give alternative results apart from the ones declared in Forms 38A. The petitioner is attacking the entire process, so he can’t concurrently ask for scrutiny in sample polling stations,’’ she said.
