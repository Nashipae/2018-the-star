Uhuru
Park in Nairobi is both a recreation space and a symbolic national shrine. It
is for some the embodiment of the struggle for freedom and the unending quest for
democracy. It is here that many battles have been fought and won, lives lost in
the process, culminating in the inauguration of President Mwai Kibaki in 2003
that ended Kanu's decades-long tyranny. Symbolically, it was the choice venue
for the promulgation of the 2010 Constitution of Kenya. And so on. It
behooves every Kenyan to preserve the sanctity of the grounds not just for
these noble reasons; the park is the most popular place in the CBD where
members of the public retreat to enjoy the freshness of the 'city in the sun'
and meditate upon the challenges of their daily struggles. Granted,
the government may have have its issues with the NASA coalition's plans to use
the venue for its swearing-in ceremony. But the frequent closures of the park
for political reasons and for such long periods are both inconsiderate, selfish
and retrogressive. We
believe the public interest has been sacrificed at the altar of political
expediency in the decision to close the park, ostensibly for renovation.
