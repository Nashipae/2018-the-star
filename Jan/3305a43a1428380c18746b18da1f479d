Two legislators on Wednesday rallied hundreds of residents to an Embu court.  An ex-MCA was charged with destroying government property worth Sh5 million.  Mbeere North and Mbeere South MPs Muriuki Njagagua and Geoffrey Kin’gan’gi led the residents to attend the hearing at the Siakago court.  They wanted to support the former Kiambere MCA Martin Mwangi and his alleged accomplice Joseph Muriuki.  They were accused of arson and incitement, which they denied before resident magistrate Jackson Omwange.  Njagagua, who is also a lawyer, together with lawyer Eric Mutuma represented the two.  Mwangi and Muriuki are charged with destroying property belonging to Tana River Development Authority on December 31 in Mutuavare, Mbeere South .  The two were also charged with inciting the public against Tarda officer in charge Donald MacKenzie. They are out on Sh200,000 bond each.
