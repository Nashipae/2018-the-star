Only 70,073 students who sat last year’s KCSE examinations will join universities for degree courses under government sponsorship. Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service yesterday announced it had finished the first selection. The cut off mark for those seeking university places is C+ of 46 points and above. After completion of the first selection, the second selection will begin on January 24. At least 60,000 students will be placed in public universities while the remaining 10,000 will be distributed across private universities. Speaking in Nairobi yesterday, KUCCPS chief executive officer John Muraguri, said those who had not been selected will be considered in the second round. “The placement services will open its online application system for applicants to revise their choices on January 24 and close on February 14,” Muraguri said. Candidates who scored a minimum of C- will also be put on government sponsorship to pursue diploma courses offered in tertiary institutions while those who scored a mean grade of D will be encouraged to pursue craft certificate courses in tertiary institutions. The placement comes as the country experiences a decline in the number of qualified students against the available slots. Last year, about 80,000 students were admitted in both private and public universities under the government-sponsorship programme. A document seen by the Star revealed Business and Administration courses had enrolled the highest number of students followed by humanities. Click here for the latest political news
