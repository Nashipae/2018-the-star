A man was killed in Ol Kalou after the walls of a quarry where they were excavating stones collapsed burying them in soil and stones on Friday. David Akilamani, 35, was pronounced dead upon arrival at J.M. Memorial hospital where he was rushed following the incident. His colleague Haron Mwangi, 42, who survived the ordeal, said they were working in the 70-foot pit when its walls crumbled. "I was 70-foot up the cliff while my departed colleague was 20 foot below me," he said.  "While I was working at this level, I felt some soil fall on me from the top of the cliff. I looked up only for the debris to hit me at an instance and took me down." He said his colleague was buried in soil and stones adding that the deceased's brother ran to his rescue not knowing his brother had also been hit. Mwangi said an X-ray at J.M.Memorial hospital revealed his left leg had cracked at the ankle. He was then taken to Ol kalou Catholic dispensary where he was administered first aid. "It was while at J.M.Hospital that I discovered my colleague had died," Mwangi added. Other quarry workers who spoke to the Star said accidents normally occur but none of them has been fatal. James Kariuki said: "Sometimes big rocks go down with people once they are broken but we have never had a case of anyone dying." Doris Adisa said Akilamani could have been saved had the county government been supportive of the stone miners. Click
