Traders yesterday protested against demolition of their illegal structures along Ring road in Kilimani. They blocked the road and lit bonfires. They barricaded the road’s junction at Yaya Centre. Some said they were caught unawares and needed more time to relocate. GSU officers managed to stop the protests though tension was high among the traders. In the morning, city council officers tore down illegal structures along Argwings Kodhek road near Yaya Centre. Speaking to the Star, senior City Hall inspectorate officer Peter Mbaya said the structures were put up illegally. The owners had been told to relocate, he said. “Last year November, we served them with a notice to relocate from the road,” Mbaya said. ACCIDENTS CAN HAPPEN He said some of the stalls had been erected on pedestrian pavements while some were too close to the road, making it difficult for pedestrians to move about. Mbaya said it is risky for the traders to do business close to the road. Accidents can occur very easily and they will have nobody to blame but themselves, he said. “When we were demolishing the structures, they were watching and they did not resist. Why did they have to wait for us to leave then start protesting?” he asked. He said the traders know very well that they are on the wrong side of the law, that is why they remained mum. Earlier this week, city council officers began a crack down by arresting business owners and people found illegally dumping garbage. “We will not stop until the city is clean and we will not tolerate any illegal operations,” Mbaya said. Mbaya said the county government will continue to reduce the increarising number of illegal operations.
