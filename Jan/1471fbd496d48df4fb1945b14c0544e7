Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua has urged the Kikuyu Council of Elders seeking audience with President Uhuru Kenyatta over Cabinet posts to do so privately instead of using the media.  He was speaking during a service for retiring Revered Waithure of IChuga PCEA in Mathira on Sunday.  “The President is readily available anytime to listen unto them,” he said.  Elders met at Mukurwe wa Nyagathanga in Murang’a county on the eve of New Year and planned to see the President.  On the issue of succession in the Mt Kenya region, Rigathi urged political leaders to first focus on serving wananchi since time for politics is over.   “Time for politics is long gone. We have the President and Deputy President in office. We should focus on development instead of politicking. Debate of who should be the DP in 2022 is ill-timed. The election is far away ,” he added.
