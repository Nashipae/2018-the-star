The Kikuyu Council of Elders has hit out at Kiambu speaker Stephen Ndicho for criticising their method of prayer. Chairman Wachira wa Kiago yesterday said it is wrong for Ndicho to say praying in Mukurwe wa Nyagathanga shrine is outdated. Speaking at their headquarters in Kasarani, the elders told Ndichu he was born a Kikuyu and Christianity came later. He should not criticise their customs. “The speaker is a leader, and he should know some utterances can be destructive,” Kiago said. He said the prayers held at the shrine on December 31 were for peace and unity in the country and were attended by church leaders. Ndicho had said the Kikuyu Council of Elders, and all traditionalists in Kenya, should spare Kikuyus and other Kenyans from old ritualistic sojourns as they serve no spiritual fulfillment.
