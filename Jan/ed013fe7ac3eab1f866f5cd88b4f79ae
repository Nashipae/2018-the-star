A lone traffic police imposter was arrested on Isinya-Kiserian road on Thursday evening after flagging down an unmarked police car. The man had mounted a road block at which he frisked drivers and allegedly asked them for bribes claiming their vehicles were faulty. Isinya OCPD Stephen Weda said officers in the unmarked car were stopped near Birika area. “While they were still in the car, the imposter went around it and shouted that their vehicle had a worn out tyre. He asked the driver to explain why it was on the road." Weda said the officers noticed the man was alone and that the manner in which he wore a jungle green police jacket indicated he was not in the service. “My officers arrested him and asked why he was operating alone. He said his colleague had gone to a nearby hotel to relieve himself," he told journalists on Friday. "When he was frisked, they found some cash and a police ID belonging to a female police officer from Kajiado Central." Weda said his team later found the man had been cohabiting with the female officer. “We will take him to court to answer to charges as prescribed by his actions,” he said. He did not state if they would take any action against the woman. Click here for the latest political news
