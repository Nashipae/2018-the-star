A woman locked her husband and three-year-old baby in their house before setting it on fire on Monday. Police said Dorris Miriam, 19, and Daniel Mwangi, 30, had a serious disagreement
before they retired to bed the previous night. They lived at Methi village in Maragua, Murang'a county. Beth Nyambura, Mwangi’s grandmother, said neighbours took long to break into the house as the woman hid the keys. "I heard the screams of my grandchild and called neighbours who responded immediately," she told journalists at the scene. Maragua OCPD John Onditi
said preliminary investigations indicated Miriam set the house on fire in an
attempt to kill her family. The woman and her husband died at Kenyatta National Hospital where they were rushed by neighbours while the child was admitted with serious burns. "We received reports that the child is in a stable state," the police boss said and advised couples to find amicable ways of resolving their differences. "It is unfortunate that people can resort to such
devastating actions over disagreements in their homes." Over 20 murders involving couples have been reported in Murang'a county since 2017, a trend
that is steadily rising. Click here for the latest political news
