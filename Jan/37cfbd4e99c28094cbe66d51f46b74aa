The High court will this morning deliver a ruling on whether the Kenya Hockey Union elections scheduled for Saturday will go on or not . During the hearing of the case yesterday, Justice Joseph Kiplagat Sergon questioned the legitimacy of KHU since they are not a registered entity and therefore should not be the representative body for the sport in the country. Jalang’o noted Hockey Federation of Kenya was registered as the official hockey governing body thus, rendering KHU and their scheduled elections null and void. Should Justice Sergon rule in favour of HFK, the current KHU office, led by chairman Nashon Randiek, will continue to stay in office. A ruling against HFK, however, will see the elections proceed with the current office expected to find it rough especially against Nairobi Hockey Association candidates.
