Fifteen Investors yesterday told the High Court they stand to suffer huge loses running into billions of shillings if the ban on shisha is not revoked. Through their lawyers Victor Sabula and Shella Shiekh, they told vacation judge Roselyn Aburili there was no public participation before the blanket ban. The government said it is part of measures to achieve uniiversal health coverage by 2021. The said the ban will directly and indirectly affect 30,000 jobs.  “Our clients stand to suffer irreparable monetary damages, loss of income and employment,” shisha dealers said court. The lawyers said the investors are surprised, saying the situation is dire unless the court steps in to waive the Ministry of Health notice. Tobacco manufacturer BAT last year lost two cases against the state relating to enforcement of the same laws. “It is our humble prayer that you grant stay of orders as we canvass the substantive issues involved in this matter,” said lawyers. The judge had earlier agreed the investors had a case worth hearing, and they had a right to ventilate their grievance in court. The dealers argue that, despite being stakeholders in the shisha trade, they were never consulted before the implementation of the ban. They further argue that the decision contravenes the provisions of statutory instruments Act, which places an obligation on public agencies to involve stakeholders likely to be affected by the implementation of rules. One of the petitioners, Kennedy Lang’at, says in his affidavit he runs a shisha and liquor business in Westlands, “Shisha Place Bar and Restaurant,”. Lang’at said he is licenced to run the business.
