A crisis looms between the county government and
private water suppliers as water department water intends to take
charge of water services. The move to take control of all boreholes, earth pans and other water resources is aimed at enhancing revenue collection. This has led to a series of public protests. The sources have previously been run by water users' management committees that have been in charge of daily supply in the area. “We are aware of protests against the new development but we need to collect revenue and this is one of the major sources of revenue in the county,” director of water Mohamed Omar said. Omar said committees have not been remitting money collected into the county's revenue basket yet all repairs are done by the county government. Wargadud Water Users’ Committee chairman Bishar Somo on Monday led residents to protest against the directive. He said the boreholes were drilled by the national government and NGOs hence the county government had no right to take over. He said taking over water sources forcefully would cause conflict and suffering to the community. “Water is a devolved function and as a county
government we have seen the need of managing this natural resource properly to
boost our local revenue,” said Omar. MCAs led by Alinoor Derrow who
is also the county assembly
chairman for the Water, Energy and Environmental Committee, last week urged the county
government to find a solution to the crisis. “We understand the situation and a better way should
be found before the worst happens,” Derrow said. County assembly Majority leader Abdi Hassan
said taking over the running of boreholes might lead to a crisis. He said residents have been running the boreholes for
many years and doing repairs in case of break down. The county has been hardest hit by frequent water
shortages due to lack of permanent water sources.
