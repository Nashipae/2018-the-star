Jubilee leaders might broker a truce between Nairobi governor Mike Sonko and and Polycap Igathe who resigned from his deputy post. The county boss said this on Monday, noting he would embrace dialogue and expressing confidence that their strained relationship will be mended. "There is nowhere [where] people can't talk," he said in Mombasa. Sonko also said the county assembly and Nairobi residents will have a say on the path he should take. "We shall consult MPs, MCAs, residents and Jubilee leadership," he said, adding a deal will be reached in Nairobi, not Mombasa. The governor then asked journalists to stop bombarding him with questions. "Stop politicising this issue. Let's focus on building the Nation. Nairobians wants service delivery, not politics. We promised a lot during our campaign period." He earlier promised supply of enough water to all residents and that the city will be cleaned.

If things fall apart, the flamboyant leader said, "work will go on" - to mean he won't consider the former Vivo Energy managing director. "I have professors and engineers and I was elected by wananchi," he said. Igathe's last day at work is January 31 at 1 pm. He resigned last Friday saying he had failed to earn Sonko's trust. He has been criticised severely and told a political relationship concerns common interests, not trust. Senator Johnson Sakaja has assured residents that there is no vacuum in Nairobi's leadership. MCAs are planning a meeting to resolve the fallout. More on this: Courageous or cowardly?
