Politicians have been urged to keep politics away from the construction of the multibillion-shilling Bonyunyu Dam in Nyamira county. Kitutu Masaba MP Shadrack Mose accused politicians of inciting residents to oppose the project with claims that they will be displaced. Speaking in Bonyunyu on Saturday, Mose defended the project, saying it will benefit residents. “Let politicians speak the truth and keep politics away from development projects,” Mose said. Mose was with MPs Joash Nyamoko (North Mugirango) and Ben Momanyi (Borabu). The lawmakers had gone to console the family of Patrick Onsombi, who was shot dead last week following residents’ protests against the construction of the dam.  Mose asked the government to educate residents whenever it plans to initiate a project in their area. “Let us not allow politicians to incite our people against projects that will help us. Opposition to the project will make us enemies of our own,” Nyamoko said.  Momanyi said the residents could not have protested had the government conducted civic education. “Residents need to be informed. That is the only way to avoid chaos . The government must take the responsibility of educating residents who are opposed to its projects,” he said.
