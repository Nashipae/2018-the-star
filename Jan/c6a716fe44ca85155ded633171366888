The Kikuyu Council of Elders has asked the government to control gambling, saying it is making the youth lazy. They are concerned that many young people from Mt kenya have abandoned their economic activities and instead consider gambling as a source of livelihood. The elders said the easily accessible gambling, has raised young people’s hopes of getting quick riches. They have become irresponsible. Speaking at Mukurwe wa Nyagathanga Shrine, considered the cradle of the Agikuyu community, the elders who held New Year prayers on Monday said many youth no longer want to work and prefer to spend their time gambling. Chairman Wachira Kiago said gambling is encouraging the youth to engage in vices such as alcoholism. Most gamblers, he said, take beer as they place their bets, which could easily sinks them into addiction. “Young people are no longer interested in engaging in economic activities like farming because they consider it too much work,” he said.
