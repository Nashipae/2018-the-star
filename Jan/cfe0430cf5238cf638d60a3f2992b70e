Meru MCAs have urged Governor Kiraitu Murungi to rethink his decision to sack 1030 casual employees. Led by deputy speaker Elias Murega and Minority leader Ayub Bundi, the MCAs said they were not consulted before the workers were dismissed. “We are ready to take the matter to the assembly if that is what it will take,” Bundi said. The MCAs accused Kiraitu of trying to create employment opportunities for “their people” by sacking those already employed. On Friday, Kiraitu announced the dismissal of the casual workers, citing a high wage bill. Kiraitu said the move was aimed at rationalising the casual employment category.Meru youth leader Antony Manyara said he will move to court to reverse the sacking. Nominated MCA Karimi Njeru supported the dismissal, saying many casual labourers were irregularly hired.
