Mau Mau war veterans in Machakos have threatened to curse Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and former Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama. The elders said the two have misled the Kamba community adding the curse will be effected if Raila Odinga and Musyoka are sworn in next Tuesday. NASA has maintained that the two leaders will take an oath of office as 'the people's president and deputy president".

During a press conference on Wednesday, the lot said swearing in the duo may lead to bloodshed in the country. The elders said they fought for the countryâ€™s independence and would not encourage any leader to resort to war in the name of liberating the country. Johnston Kiiti, Mwala sub-county chapter chairperson, said the politicians are not right in their show of disrespect to President Uhuru Kenyatta. "For those who claim they will swear in NASA leader Raila Odinga, you are committing suicide since we already have a government in place." For the case of Muthama and Kalonzo, the elders said the two made a mistake in aligning the community to the opposition. "Do not provoke our anger since you are too young. Compromise with the current government or else we will deal with you." "This government came through our struggles," Kiiti said adding that whoever will swear in the two using the Bible contrary to the law will be punished. The elders further asked the National Assembly to strike off constitutional clauses which allow for picketing and demonstrations. It takes a referendum by universal suffrage to change a clause in the Constitution.
