Clerics and youth leaders in Kwale county yesterday dismissed the planned swearing-in of NASA leader Raila Odinga as the People’s President on January 30, saying there can only be one President. The group asked Raila to look for an alternative way to participate in the government. They spoke in Diani during a peace meeting to discourage the youth from being lured to violence. “This plan will fuel violence in the country and it will not make Raila relevant in politics. His advisers are misleading him,” Andrew Mwafusi of Okoa Pwani youth group said. Mwafusi said they are tired of seeing youths lose their lives over politics. “Violence will undermine tourism, which we mostly depend on for a living. If you continue with this plan, then be assured more youths will be jobless,” he said. Mwafusi asked Jubilee leaders to dialogue with their NASA counterparts to end the political pressure so Kenyacan move on. Resident Ali Mondo said, “Now that the presidency has gone with Jubilee, let us support the government and ask our interests to be taken care of.” Sheikh Kassim Zani of Muslim Interfaith said NASA leaders are selfish and do not care about the lives of other citizens. He urged Kwale residents to support the government and put aside their political ego until 2022. “The election is over. In every contest there must be a winner and a loser. If you allow yourself to be misguided then it is you who will suffer violence,” Zani said.
