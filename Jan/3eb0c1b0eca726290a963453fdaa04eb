Kisumu Woman Representative Rosa Buyu yesterday got relief when the High Court dismissed a petition challenging her election. Justice Thripsisa Cherere struck out the petition by Grace Akumu on grounds it lacked merit. She was ordered to pay Sh3 million. Akumu vied on the Citizens’ Convention Party ticket. Cherere said the claims of irregularities raised by the petitioner could not be ascertained. She said Akumu could not prove her agents were barred from accessing the polling station. “The petitioner has not proved beyond reasonable doubt which agents and the polling stations they were blocked from accessing,” Cherere said. She said only presidential results were to be transmitted electronically from the polling stations. On the vote stuffing claims, Cherere said the petitioner did not give sufficient evidence to back the allegations. “Some of the irregularities cited before the court were also committed by the petitioner,” she said. Cherere said the alleged collusion between the second (Buyu) and third (the IEBC) respondents were not proved. Akumu, the CCP party leader, wanted the court to declare her the winner of the August 8 election. Through her lawyer Ken Omollo, Akumu said there were errors in the Forms 39A used to declare the winner. She said in one case an agent signed forms from more than 70 polling stations. Akumu also cited irregularities in the lists of party agents filed by the IEBC. She said some agents’ names in the Forms 39A were not in the list provided by the electoral agency. Akumu told the court some forms were not signed by presiding officers or deputy presiding officers as required. She said some of her agents were denied access to polling stations for several hours after voting had started.
