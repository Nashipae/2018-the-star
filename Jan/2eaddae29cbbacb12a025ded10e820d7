Nairobi's former chief finance officer and three others have been acquitted of Sh17.9 million fraud for lack of enough evidence. Magistrate Kennedy Bidali said on Thursday that the prosecution failed to prove the case against Jimmy Kiamba and the other suspects. He said they failed to charge the people who gave instructions for transactions to the accused persons. Kiamba, county secretary Lilian Wanjiru Ndegwa, Regina Chepkemoi and Stephen Ogaga faced seven counts of abuse of office and making and uttering false documents. Bidali had said last year that the four had a case to answer in matters corruption. At that time, he said the prosecution, led by senior state counsel Edwin Okello, had proven they had a case to answer.
