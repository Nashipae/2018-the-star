Tigania East MP Josphat Gichunge Kabeabea has pledged to pay school fees to a bright but needy student who scored 370 marks. Christopher Munene is brought up by a single mother in a family of three. His sister is at Kangeta Girls while his younger brother is in class three.  Risper Nkatha Mukura her former teacher at Mikinduri Primary School went to social media and local radio stations seeking help for the boy. Little did she know her pleas could be taken care of. She created a Whatsapp group titled, 'I WILL TAKE MUNENE TO SCHOOL' where at the time of going to Press, the group had contributed at least Sh. 53, 000. "From his own pocket, (MP Gichunge) he has already paid 75, 000 to the school since bursary funds are not out yet. "Munene has been dreaming and working very hard to join Meru School. So after the mother told the poor boy that he couldn't afford to take him to his dream school or Garbatula where he was admitted, he had an option of going to a day school or repeat. They live in a rented house." Nkatha told the Star on Saturday. This is not her first such initiative, she spearheaded the sponsorship of Christine Kananu who scored 342 and missed Equity's wings to fly scholarship by 8 marks. "Munene's case is not like last year's case where a child by the name Christine Kananu who has no parents scored 342 and missed Equity's wings to fly scholarship by 8 marks. The poor girl also came and repeated. After a week in school and praying hard, I talked to many people and explained Christine's problems. God sent us one kind-hearted Susan Thiauru and promised not only to pay her school fees but also provide for all other needs when in and outside the school. Today, she is in form two and doing extremely well. As a teacher, I give hope to my pupils and make sure they realise their dreams." she said. Â
