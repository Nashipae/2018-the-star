CAROLE MAINA/The SRC yesterday received a boost in its legal bid to ensure  MPs and MCAs’ salaries and allowances are reduced. This is after two parties accused the PSC of nondisclosure of material facts. Justice George Odunga directed the PSC to respond to two applications - one filed by former Makadara MP Benson Mutura and another by Okiya Omtatah. Mutura and Omtatah applied to be made interested parties in the matter, saying they are apprehensive that unless they are made parties, the court will proceed and make orders based on wrong information given by the PSC, therefore defeating the interest of justice. MPs and MCAs have rejected the new salary structure. They have obtained orders stopping the SRC from effecting the new salaries, but the commission is fighting to reverse the decision. Mutura argues as a sitting member in the 11th Parliament which deliberated on the salaries issue, he is well  versed with the matter and will help the court. In August 2014, the former MP said he lodged a complaint with the Speaker of the National Assembly against the commissioners of the PSC who were then ‘duplicating allowances and skewed mileage for members’. The mater, he says through lawyer Kibe Mungai, was discussed at the Speaker’s Kamukunji.  “It is against this backdrop and wide deliberations in Parliament that Gazette Notice No. 6517 was published,” he said.
