Pupils of an Embu school spent Sunday night at a bishop's home after a fire gutted several of their dormitories. Property worth millions of shillings was destroyed at St Peter and Paul Boarding Primary School at Karurina village in Embu West. Bishop Paul Kariuki said the fire broke out at around 7 pm at one of the dormitories as the pupils had supper. "It quickly spread to several other dormitories," he said, adding efforts to contain it were futile. He said county firefighters responded on time but that the fire was too fierce so the learners were evacuated. Most of their property was destroyed.
