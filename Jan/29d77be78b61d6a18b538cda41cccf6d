Nobody
saw it coming, if reactions from social media on President Kenyatta’s creation
of a Cabinet Secretary without portfolio and the nomination of Raphael Tuju to
the position are anything to go by. Some of the nominations have also raised
mixed feelings. Vincent
Onyango (@ItsOnyango) said on Twitter, “When the President says he’s appointed
Raphael Tuju by co-opting him into the Cabinet he simply implies he’ll be mtu
wa mkono (porter) with no specific ministry to head. But then, I’ll be paying
his perks from my taxes…mmmmh!” Read: Uhuru unveils new Cabinet, nominates Munya, Shebesh, Ababu, and Marwa Allan
M Polycap (@AllanPolycap) joked on Twitter, “Mr CS @RaphaelTuju can I be your
PS or CAS?” @JamesOleKiyiapi
asked on Twitter, “The newly created position of CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE SECRETARY
is not recognized by the Constitution, and is NOT clear at this point what
value it adds to current hierarchy of administration in Ministries.
CA-CAS-PS…more bureaucracy?” Read: Uhuru sacks Mailu, Kaimenyi, Wario from Cabinet Radio
personality Carol Radul tweeted, “Rashid Achesa Mohammed is the new Cabinet
Secretary for Sport. Karibu. We have a lot of work waiting for you Sir.

analyst Mohamed Wehliye (@WehliyeMohamed) said, “I hear my
Starehe brother Raphael Tuju has been given free licence by the coach to roam.
No defensive or attacking duties.” “President
Kenyatta should be commended for coming up with an expanded Cabinet which also
meets the 2/3 Gender rule. Related: List of Uhuru's Cabinet nominees Raphael Tuju becomes the Minister without portfolio!
The President should also be commended for retaining Ministers who have been
removed from their Ministries to become key ambassadors! A few Ministers from
Opposition background is a good gesture of reconciliation. Let's now get down
to serious national engagement in moving this country forward! Ambassador Amina
will require all the support she will need in moving forward the Matiang'i
initiatives in the huge Ministry of Education! Congrats to the new appointees!!

Shake and then one of you was called home or was tired and there was a

Tuju: Co-opted to the Cabinet on a need basis, meaning? A consultant to the
Cabinet? #UhuruCabinet”, asked @Peter_Aming’a. @JoshuaOkumu
asked, “Chief Administrative Secretary. Mr President kindly describe this
position to Kenyans. Will this not bring chaos in Cabinet? #UhuruCabinet”. “Another
