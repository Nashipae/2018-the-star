West Pokot leaders have accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of excluding Pokots in Cabinet appointments. They noted dissatisfaction with the process so far saying their community has been sidelined yet it supported him in last year's polls. Led by former Lomut ward representative Musa Tekelezi, the leaders said their people must benefit because they voted for Uhuru. “We supported the president [in large numbers] during the first election and the repeat so he should reward us," he told journalists in Kapenguria on Tuesday. “We don’t want principal secretaries only. We also want full Cabinet positions. We need to have someone to represent us in government because we have been marginalised for a long time." The former MCA further noted that they ensured no politician who vied under the National Super Alliance was elected. “We have not elected any NASA leader in West Pokot. During Jubilee's first term, we did not have a ministerial position yet 98 per cent of our votes were for Jubilee," he said. "We feel cheated, used and dumped. Other communities have been given fare shares of the Cabinet slots. The President should not ignore us. We are stakeholders in Jubilee. We need a lion’s share ... we should be given priority." Tekelezi said he hopes that the president and deputy William Ruto will consider the community. “The president promised to include all communities  and ensure equal representation in government. We are reminding the head of state not to forget us." More on this: How Uhuru named CSs minus Ruto Click here for the latest political news
