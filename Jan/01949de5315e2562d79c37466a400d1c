Hundreds of women took to the streets to protest against President Uhuru Kenyatta’s “men only” Cabinet appointments. They said women are missing in the list of nine Cabinet Secretaries named by Uhuru on January 5. The protest from Uhuru Park to Harambee Avenue through several streets  was organised by the Centre for Rights Education and Awareness. CREAW executive director Wangechi Wachira said it would be better if Uhuru appointed women to fill the remaining 13 Cabinet slots. “We are asking the President, in the 13  slots that are remaining to make a Cabinet of 22, nine of them should be women. The women of Kenya are ready. If he has no list, we have a list of qualified women who are ready to hold Cabinet slots,” Wachira said.
