New Bishop of Mombasa ACK Diocese Alphonce Baya has said his 25-year tenure at the church will focus on five pillars. They are mission, sustainability at all levels, human resources, governance and institute for church life. Baya was consecrated on Sunday at Mbaraki Sports Ground by Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit. In his speech, Baya said, “In order to secure the future of our Diocese, there is an urgent need to refocus our mission strategy on the youth, teens and children.” He proposed to integrate the church’s mission and invest through shareholding of parishes, micro-enterprise development and capacity-building to generate adequate resources.
