A chief in Eldama-Ravine, Baringo county, has been interdicted for allegedly colluding with local brewers to sell illicit liquor that has killed 11 people in two weeks. Baringo county commissioner Peter Okwanyo interdicted Torongo chief Silah Mulalit on Friday. He said this will serve an example to other chiefs who aide the sale of illicit brews. “It is unfortunate and sad to have lost 11 energetic people in two weeks. I have interdicted him and ensured he doesn’t come back to serve the people again,” Okwanyo said. Okwanyo said the 11 people died after consuming chang'aa and busaa. He said the chief was also accused of ferrying illicit brew using his official motorcycle. The commissioner also said officers or chiefs found to have violated the alcohol laws in their areas of jurisdiction not only risk losing their jobs, but also being arrested and charged. Okwanyo was accompanied by Koibatek deputy county commissioner Mary Mushene, Baringo police commandant Smollets Muyianzi and Koibatek DCI Festus Malinge. Torongo assistant chief Edwin Rono was elevated on an acting capacity until March 7 as investigations are being carried against the chief. Malinge said his office will work closely with residents to end illicit brew in the area. Muyianzi said many bars in the area are operated illegally since they do not have valid licences.
