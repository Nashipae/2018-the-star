The fourth edition of Rachuonyo 10km road race will be held on Sunday in Homa Bay County. Athletics Kenya (AK) Nyanza North chairman Joseph Ochieng said the event has been moved from Ongalo Primary School due to its inaccessibility. Ochieng said the race will start at the Kendu Bay town and take the athletes to the scenic Lake Simbi Nyaima before finishing at Nyakongo Polytechnic. “It will be a spectacle seeing these athletes run around the lake,” he added. Ochieng said they will also hold 8km junior men, 6km junior women, 2km race for people aged over 50 years and a 1km race for children at the polytechnic. He said the children will be given learning materials as prizes. The race is sponsored area MP Adipo Okuome while the organiser is Benjamin Njoga a member of AK’s national executive. Ochieng said they expect more than 250 athletes to participate in the event. “We shall reward the top ten athletes in the road race and top six in the circuit races,” added Ochieng. He thanked area MP for sponsoring the race. “We want more sponsors to come on board and sponsors races. We have abundant talent which is untapped,” he said.
