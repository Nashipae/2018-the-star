L ike him or hate him, Timmy T-dat exhibits classic traits of workmanship at its best. That way, he has managed to maintain relevance for a proper span. Through his energetic display, he has amassed a significant following that has been a critical aspect when being considered for collaborative efforts by other top names. It was his track, “Welle Welle” featuring Naiboi (then known as Rapdamu) that turned him into an overnight success. Well, not really, but it actually set the pace for him as a Kenyan artiste. One year on, it had people paying attention. The effect was so far-reaching it had to be redone, this time with various stars injecting diverse flavour to the hit. The media has been more keen on off-the-field shenanigans rather than what makes Timmy the star he his. Maybe it has helped his career and, as long as it works, he is likely to notoriously continue offering oblique intimations just to get the media talking. But right now, he is collaborating across East Africa to transcend genres and reach new markets. He has managed to work with Wyre on “Haitosi,” tapped Dela’s vocals on “We’ll Be Okay” and recently experimented with rapper Khaligraph Jones on “Kasayole”. The artiste from Kasabun understands that collaborations can be a fast-track route to becoming a household name, especially if you appear with more established artistes. His list of joint projects is endless; it’s diverse in genre. Timmy, perhaps now, appeals to the fans of Zikki, The Kansoul, Femi One, Sudi Boy and Otile Brown, among many others. Timmy might not be the best thing that happened in the music scene, but he certainly isn’t the worst. He knows how to keep his fans entertained. For him, it is not about intricacy but steady release of hit after hit. He has carved out his niche with his sound and embraced his identity. Keep an eye out for Timmy this year. He’s probably got a few creative and musical tricks up his sleeves.
