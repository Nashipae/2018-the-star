Tarbaj MP Ahmed Bashane on Friday accused his opponent of causing chaos during the August 8 general election. The MP from Wajir county told court, in a petition against his win, that his opponent's supporters started chaos after the voting process. Bashane said this during his testimony in the petition filed by Idris Abdi Abdullahi. The latter wants the win nullified. On claims some statutory forms were not signed by all agents, he said his agents equally did not sign the forms hence his opponent's take does not hold. Idris argued that his agents were sent away from most of the constituency's 50 polling stations hence did not sign the results forms. "I did not receive any complaints that any agents were chased away from the polling station or denied access as alleged by Abdi," Bashane said. He also confirmed to court that most voters were assisted by either the agents or the IEBC officials to vote, hence asked the judge to dismiss the case. The MP also confirmed that some forms used to declare results had different data as captured in some forms37A. In December, the trial judge Margaret Muigai ordered for scrutiny and recount of votes in two polling stations. These were Kajaja II Primary School and Berjini Dam polling stations where it was alleged that results announced at the polling station were not those in form35. The court ordered a recount on grounds the actual number of valid votes of each candidate could not be confirmed as the process was halted midway. Click here for the latestÂ political news
