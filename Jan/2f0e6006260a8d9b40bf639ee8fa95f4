The National Police Service Commission has advertised vacancies in the positions of deputy inspector generals and director, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. This follows the dropping of DIGs Joel Kitili of the regular police and Samuel Arachi, Commandant of the Administration Police, and DCI Ndegwa Muhoro by President Uhuru Kenyatta a week ago. Uhuru nominated three officers to serve in an acting capacity, pending vetting. The NPSC now faces the question whether its advertisement of the jobs will only result in a perfunctory and cosmetic interviewing process and the confirmation of the acting senior officers, who presumably will also apply. The acting officers have been promoted over more senior officers. Kenyans will be looking at the NPSC to see whether it is an equal opportunity employer and a genuinely independent commission. One thing is clear from the outset: The cart was put before the horse in replacing Kitili, Arachi and Muhoro. Substantively replacing the DIGs and the DCI will also be an object lesson for the government on how to – or not, as the case might be – make appointments in the security sector or indeed any other.
