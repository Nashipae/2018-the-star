A Machakos High Court on Friday upheld the victory of Yatta MP Charles Kilonzo in the August 8 General Election. Justice Aggrey Muchelule dismissed a petition filed by Francis Mwangangi as incompetent and lacked merit. But while addressing journalists outside the court, Mwangangi’s lead lawyer Andrew Makundi said they were going to appeal the decision. Muchelule held that the petitioner failed to prove his allegations that the election was marred with irregularities and malpractices and that the second responded committed election offences. The judge said there was no evidence given on voter bribery claims raised by the petitioner and on whether the third respondent campaigned past the set hours. He further held  the petitioner could not justify allegations that his agents were locked out of the polling stations as no name of such agents was presented in court. The judge also dismissed as vague a claim by the petitioner that KEIMs kitfailed to work in some polling satiations, saying no name of such polling stations was given.
