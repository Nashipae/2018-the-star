The Trans Nzoia government has received 10 acres from Kenya Railways in Kitale to expand the town, Governor Patrick Khaemba said on Friday. This follows a request by Khaemba due to congestion in Kitale town. The governor said his government will soon start the construction of a Sh100 million modern second market on the land. It will also accommodate 5,000 kiosks which will be issued to traders in Kitale town.  “Half of the kiosks will be issued to youths and women,” Khaemba said. His focus is improving the economy.
