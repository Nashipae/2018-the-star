A 'little'
quarrel between two people at Isinya town, Kajiado on Saturday blew up into a
fully-fledged battle leaving several people injured and property destroyed. Trouble started after a local disagreed with
the owner of an agrovet shop over the price of an item. Peter Leken, who was nearby, said the shop owner, whom he only named
as Hillary, slashed the customer on the head with a machete. When
the customer called for help from passersby, Hillary is said to have dashed off
and ran towards Insinya police station. He was rescued by police officers on patrol who took him to the police station. After
some thirty minutes, more than 100 Maasai morans descended into the town and
demanded to be handed over the suspect so they could discipline him. The police blocked them from accessing the station. The morans later went to the suspect's shop and set his truck which was full of hay on fire. They also burned down the
shop into ashes as others burned hay stocks placed on the roadside along the Isinya/Kiserian
route. The irate morans engaged police in a fight in their quest to have the suspect released to them for lynching. Others
went to the town’s slaughter house to smoke out  the trader's community members  accusing them of disrespecting the natives. Police officers led by Isinya OCPD Stephen Weda contained the situation. Kajiado
acting county commissioner David Kipkemei urged the residents to desist from violence and handle their differences using the right channels. Area
MCA Joshua Olowuasa said: "That
was a difference between two individuals who should carry their own cross." "The person who was injured should have reported the matter to the police so the suspect can be
charged in a court of law." Click here for the latest political stories
