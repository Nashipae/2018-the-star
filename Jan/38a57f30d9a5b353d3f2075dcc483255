  Motorists were stranded along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway for more than two hours after residents of Kinangop blocked the road to
protest plans to set up a private cemetery in the area. Residents of Soko Mjinga, on Saturday, barricaded the the road, causing a traffic jam that stretched for more than 10 kilometres on both sides. They lit bonfires. It took the intervention of GSU officers to disperse the protesters and open the blocked sections of the road. "We have hundreds of squatters
who have lived in this area for many years. The government should resettle us first before it allows the cemetery to be put up here,” Kimani said. Magumu MCA Hussein
Ndung’u said they will oppose the construction of the cemetery.  “We are totally opposed to the plan
because it does not make sense at all. We'll resist it," Ndung'u said. He asked residents not to block the road whenever they are protesting. Nyandarua Land executive
Lawrence Mukundi, who spoke on behalf of Governor Francis Kimemia (pictured) said the plot had been leased to a private developer in 1960. The lease was to run  for 99 years. Mukundi said the land was to be
used for saw mill and manufacture of hand boards, with a
provision prohibiting its subdivision. “Despite the provisions, sub
division was done and change of user proposed. The county is against this venture,” Mukundi said. He said the county had written to the National Land Commission about the matter. “Changing the use to a cemetery is a special matter that requires wide consultations. That has not been the case,” Mukundi said. Sports executive Dominic Murani, also a resident of the area, said they will reject the project dubbed "cemetery for rich Kenyans."  "It is unfortunate that the government
has decided to bury rich people here, instead of considering the plight of poor squatters of Kinangop," Murani said.
