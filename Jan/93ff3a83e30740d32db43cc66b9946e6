A farewell event for two victims of the Lake Nakuru helicopter crash whose bodies have not been retrieved has been put off until February 10. A mass was to be conducted tomorrow morning on the lakeshore. No reason was immediately given for the cancellation. The bodies of Sam Gitau and John Mapozi have not been recovered since the crash on October 21 last year. Five people died in the crash. The bodies of pilot Apolo Malowa, Anthony Kipyegon and Veronica Muthoni were retrieved and interred. Last week, Gitauâ€™s family planted a banana at the shore to bid farewell to their firstborn son. The recovery operation involved families of the victims, the county and national governments, the National Disaster Management Committee, Kenya Navy, police, KWS and many divers.
