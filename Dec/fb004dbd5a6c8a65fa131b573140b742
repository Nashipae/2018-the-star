Laikipia has launched a Sh1.3 billion family planning initiative to cover five years until 2022. It provides a roadmap that guides the county’s engagement with NGOs, faith-based organisations, and other lobbies involved in family planning. “We want to rally behind the issues of family planning and look into issues of mitigating the unmet needs where mothers become pregnant because the services and commodities for planning were not available. It is a global issue and Laikipia is currently at 20 per cent. We need to reduce this,” Health executive Lenai Kamario said. Laikipia fertility rate is at 3.4 per cent compared to the national average of 2.98 per cent. Its maternal mortality rate is 124 of 100,000 live births and teenage pregnancy rate is at 28 per cent. Kamario said the plan will focus on communities and ensure access to services. “We have a target where anyone coming and concerned with reproductive health can pick the scope they would like to look into from the comprehensive document,” she said. Marie Stopes and Deutsche Stiftung Weltbevoelkerung are among the groups concerned with reproductive health. Kamario said organisations will be guided by the county plan. “It’ll be a challenge to achieve our target, especially in the communities where matters concerning family planning are a taboo. We’ll, however, use strategies they will understand to control the unmet need,” she said. Country Director for DWS Evelyn Samba blamed the failure in managing family planning to low or lack of financing in the counties.
