Police in Mombasa have narrowed down on three most-wanted criminals who have been terrorising residents. County Commissioner Evans Achoki said the three suspects will be arrested soon before Sunday. The suspects have been linked to the death of a security guard in Likoni on Tuesday. The guard was manning National Housing area when he got shot in a botched robbery attempt. Another guard was critically injured during the 4 am attack. Achoki said the trio also rob with violence in Kisauni and Mvita areas. “We are in the 39th day. We’ll get hold of them today or tomorrow,” Achoki said. He spoke at Kisauni High on Saturday during a security meeting organized by Search for Common Ground. Achoki said the two-week amnesty window announced on Wednesday for criminals to surrender is still open. “Should we come for you, consequences will be severe,” he warned. Muslims for Human Rights who attended the meeting said Kisauni political leadership has failed and should be blamed for the attacks. Project Assistant Fredrick Okado said MP Ali Mbogo rarely attends security meetings or mitigate crime. “We have not seen the commitment from his office to end the violence. What he does is to point fingers at groups working to end the crime,” he said. Okado said collaboration between police and community is key in restoring peace in Mombasa. Search program director Judy Kimamo said they are developing collaborating ideas. “People involved in a violent crime can reform. We have testimonies of gang leaders who have a turnaround,” she said.
