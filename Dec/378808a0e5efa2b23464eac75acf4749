The Mandera county government has constructed a Sh24 million resource center for people living with disability. Gender and Social Services chief officer Ahmed Abdi said the center will train People Living with Disabilities (PLD) to give them vocational skills. Ahmed said the county government is committed to equity among residents, hence, the investment in such projects. The center will train them in metal-working and shoe making. It is hoped they will make shoes for the disabled. Speaking during the World Day of PLD, Ahmed  said the county has set aside funds in the orm of grants and cash for businesses. He said the county assembly has passed a legislation to enable PLD to access free health care by registering them with the National Hospital Insurance Fund. Mandera chairperson of PLD Ibrahim Happy praised the county for its commitment in serving all residents equally, irrespective of physical status. He said Governor Ali Roba’s dministration has fairly distributed jobs to all qualified people. Kassim Haji, the  PLD spokesman, criticised the county, owever, saying it did not fairly award contracts. He said it did not adhere to the constitutional rule on awarding 30 per cent of county ontracts to PLD, women and youth. Kasim asked the county government to allocate more resources to PLD. “In the last five years we have been neglected, especially when dealing with the special needs of bed-ridden persons living with disability,” Kasim said.
