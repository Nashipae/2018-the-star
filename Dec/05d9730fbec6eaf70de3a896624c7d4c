Nyanza and parts of Western still have the highest malaria prevalence rate despite government efforts, according to the health working group reviewing the disease prevalence. This means that the likelihood of one contracting malaria is higher when they visit the two regions than any other. The report signed by Health PS Peter Tum and released by the National Treasury last week indicates that lake counties have an overall prevalence rate of 27 per cent compared to three in the highland areas of Mt Elgon, Rift Valley and Central. Coast has a chronicity rate of eight per cent.

The review reported that overall disease endemicity stands at eight per cent. The findings are critical, especially in view of the upcoming festive season when most Kenyans traditionally travel upcountry. Regarding the institutional readiness to combat the deadly disease, the report indicates that 84 per cent of hospitals have the capacity to diagnose malaria. Children under the age of five and pregnant women are the most vulnerable. The government has been proactive in mobilising resources from development partners and foreign nations to help in fighting the disease, with a chunk of the funds dedicated to the high endemic regions of Western and Nyanza. The American government, through the US President’s Malaria Initiative, gave the country Sh3 billion to help fight the disease. Some of the state’s anti-malaria initiatives include distribution 44.6 million doses of Artemether Combination Therapy (ACT), which were distributed over the last two years, the report says.
