AU envoy Raila Odinga yesterday cautioned ODM leaders against engaging in succession politics. He told them to focus on fixing wananchi’s problems. Raila told a delegation of Coast MPs led by Msambweni’s Suleiman Dori to pay attention to the Building Bridges Initiative. Dori and Owen Baya (Kilifi North) and Wiper’s Ali Mbogo (Kisauni), assured Raila of their commitment to working with him. They relayed similar assurances from Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa who is attending parliamentary games in Burundi.

We’ve slowed down on 2022 campaigns as you had advised and we remain committed to actions that strengthen rather than weaken the party,” Dori said. The ODM disciplinary committee had recommended the expulsion Jumwa and Dori over gross misconduct. They were summoned in October after they openly declared their support for DP William Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid. They ignored the summonses. Raila (pictured) said the lawmakers mentioned in the report will be given a fair hearing by the National Executive Committee. He condemned the conduct of Homa Bay MCAs who have consistently defied the party’s code of conduct and tainted its image. Seven Homa Bay MCAs were charged with assaulting speaker Elizabeth Ayoo and were detained for 14 days. They pleaded not guilty.
