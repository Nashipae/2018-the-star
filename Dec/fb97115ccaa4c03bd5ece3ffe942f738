Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet's driver has allegedly committed suicide while in Narok. Anthony Lemayan reportedly shot himself under the chin while on sick leave. In a police statement seen by the Star, Leteipa was on sick leave when the incident occurred. His brother Evans Leteipa reported the case to the police. "Suicide incident report: OB 16/9/12/2018 at 11.10 pm. It was reported by Evans Leteipa Maasai that his brother had committed suicide in Mwamba estate on the outskirts of Narok town," the police statement read. "Officers went to the scene and found a GSU officer attached to the IG's office in Nairobi had shot himself. The body had two gunshot wounds one under the chin and and exit wound on the upper head." The deceased was found on the ground about 50m from his house. Police recovered a pistol, a spent cartridge and a magazine containing 14 bullets. No suicide note was found and the intention for the alleged suicide is unknown. The body was taken to Narok County Referral Hospital morgue for an autopsy. A study has identified mental illness caused by the nature of the job as the main cause of the rising number of police suicides. In October, the National Police Service introduced a new department tasked with assessing the psychological wellness of officers.
