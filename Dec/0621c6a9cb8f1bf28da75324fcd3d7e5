A suspected robber on Friday morning was wounded by National Police Reservists in Mandera town after he attempted to break into a house. The man, whom police identified as Zakariah Salim Wambua, was intercepted by the reservists near a police camp at the Kenya-Somalia border. The reservists were on patrol. Mandera police commander Bernard Nyakwaka told the Star the suspect was shot by the officers after he tried to break into a house belonging to Yaya Kasim. He said the suspect was shot in the stomach. He is admitted at the county hospital. Preliminary investigations indicate he knew the occupants of the house were away. Nyakwaka said neighbours raised the alarm after they saw Wambua trying to break into the house. A week ago, robbers broke into a safe at Takbir petrol station and stole Sh700,000. They killed a night guard. Witnesses said they struck at 1am and were wearing police uniforms. Nyakwaka said a police parade and inspection will be conducted to ascertain if officers were involved.
