The Kenya National Highways Authority has cautioned the public over conmen calling job seekers and claiming they could help them get employment at the agency. In a statement on Tuesday, KeNHA director general Charles Njogu said the con artists call and contact unsuspecting people through social media and charge a fee. Among the telephone lines being used by the culprits are 020-7851978 and 07720508864 registered for Boniface Mwashi Mineso. "We wish to clarify that KeNHA has a clear recruitment and procedure policy which includes publishing of vacancies in the mainstream media and on the authority's website," Njogu said. "Further, the authority does not solicit any money during recruitment as indicated in the fake calls to applicants." Njogu advised the public to ignore the calls and any information on social media platforms regarding recruitment. Earlier, the Director of Public Prosecutions warned the public over people being swindled cash with the promise of pupillage and internships at the agency following a recent advertisement. Senior assistant director of public communication Beatrice Omari on Thursday said those found culpable will be prosecuted.
