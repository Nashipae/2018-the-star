ODM Party leader Raila Odinga may endorse former immediate MP Chris Karan as the preferred candidate for the party in the impending Ugenya by election. Raila, according to impeccable sources, said Raila supported the candidature of Karan. In a private meeting attended by party leaders held at the home of Siaya Senator James Orengo in Ugenya on Wednesday, Karan’s name was reached after a long deliberation. “There were varied options whether to drop Karan’s name and vouch for another candidate given that his popularity in the region has waned,” added the source. This comes barely a week after the Supreme Court nullified Karan’s election as the area MP.
