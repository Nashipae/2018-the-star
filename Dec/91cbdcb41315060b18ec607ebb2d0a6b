Harambee Stars maintained their global 105 spot in the recent ranking despite being out of action during last month’s Fifa international week. Stars stagnated on the log after the Confederation of African Football barred Sierra Leone from participating in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier match owing to government interference leaving Kenya without an opponent in the Fifa week. Kenya were set to accost Sierra Leone in their penultimate qualifier match in November 18 but the canceling of the match earned Stars a place in the finals slated for next year between June 15 to July 13. The venue for the Africa festival is yet to be determined after Caf stripped off Cameroon the hosting rights. Kenya, who will make a return to the finals after 15 years in the cold, tops Pool ‘F’ with seven points and are followed by Ghana who also maintained their 51st place in the standings despite hammering Ethiopia 3-0 in the qualifying match played during the Fifa week. Ethiopia are 151 while Sierra Leone are 115. Regionally, Uganda who have already qualified to the Afcon top the charts in position 75th while Kenya come second. Rwanda are third at 137 with Tanzania and Burundi following closely in position 138 and 139 respectively. Reigning African champions Cameroon rank 55th globally while seven-time champions Egypt are placed 56th. Despite qualifying to the Afcon for their first time, the duo of Mauritania and Madagascar are ranked low as they are perched 101 and 106 respectively. World Cup semifinalists Belgium top the global standings while reigning champions France are second. Five-time champions Brazil are third followed closely by beaten World Cup finalist Croatia. England close the top five bracket.
