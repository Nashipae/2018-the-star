A forest guard who threatened to shoot Elgeyo Marakwet governor Alex Tolgos has been interdicted. The ranger was suspended pending investigations into his conduct. The guard cocked his gun and threatened to shoot Tolgos during the governor’s tour of projects in Chebororwa ward on Tuesday. County commissioner Ahmed Omar condemned the officer’s “unwarranted conduct that caused the governor unnecessary embarrassment.” He said the suspect, who is popularly known as Omwami, has been locked up at a police station. Kenya Forest Service regional conservator in charge of Elgeyo Marakwet Anthony Musyoka said the agency regretted the embarrassment. “All public officers are bound by the code of conduct that they must adhere to while on duty. Weather the suspect was drunk or under influence of any substance will be established after investigations,” Musyoka said. The guard was wrestled down and disarmed by Tolgos’s bodyguards. The ranger, who was in civilian clothes, had blocked Tolgos from entering Takwei Primary School, saying it was in a restricted forest area. “If you go into the school, I will get my gun and shoot you,” the guard said as he hurled abuses at the governor and his entourage. The school is near the forest station where the ranger is attached. Tolgos later ordered the rangers to be moved out of the school compound immediately. “We can’t allow this to happen. How can we have security officers living in a school compound and getting drunk in such a way?” Tolgos asked. He promised to officially handle the matter with the KFS and police. Residents have accused the rangers of burning charcoal and engaging in illegal logging.
