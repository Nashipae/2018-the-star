Six schools in Migori county have missed their KCSE 2018 results sparking anxiety among parents and candidates. They are Nyabisawa Girls' school (Suna East), Sigiria secondary school (Rongo), and Komotobo secondary (Kuria East). Others are Sori Secondary, Obolo Mixed and Ageng’a Mixed in Nyatike constituency. The results were flagged over irregularities. By Sunday morning, the six schools were still seeking answers from the Kenya National Examination Council. Education CS Amina Mohamed on Friday said the government had withheld results of a number of exam centres. She cited suspected irregularities, which are being investigated by the examination council. "These centres will be notified of the decision as soon as the results are released. In the meantime, Knec will finalise investigations into suspected malpractices and release a report on or before January 31, 2019," the CS said during the release of the 2018 test. She did not, however, indicate how many schools are affected and from which regions. At least 100 students had their results cancelled. "I wish to assure the nation, affected candidates and parents that due diligence will be undertaken to ensure that no student is penalised unfairly," the CS added.
