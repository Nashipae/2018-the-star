The NTSA and the Health ministry have partnered to get the accurate number of people who die on Kenyan roads. NTSA manager in charge of road safety and strategies Samuel Musumba yesterday said 2,801 people have died in road accidents this year. “We realise our data is lacking some of the information as it comes from police,” Musumba said. He spoke at Radisson Blue Hotel, Nairobi, during a meeting on wellness of long distance drivers.
