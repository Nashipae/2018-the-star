Coast-based artiste Nyota Ndogo is happy to be compensated by the government after her almost completed house was demolished when the route of the Standard Gauge Railway was being planned. Her house was brought down but luckily, President Uhuru Kenyatta came through for her and many other affected victims and compensated them. “Baada ya serikali kuleta barabara mpya ya gari la moshi nilikua moja kati ya waliobomoa nyumba zao ili barabara lipite,” she wrote on Instagram. "But kitu kinanifanya nimpende Uhuru Kenyatta ni kusema kila mwenye haki yake alipwe nililipwa nikajenga hii." Nyota used the money to build another big house. "Ngoje niwapostie nyumba ya kuanza ambayo kila nikiangalia kwa google nalia couse nimepitia mengi kuijenga nikiwa na mimba ya baraka," she wrote.
