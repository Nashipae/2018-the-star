Global companies are seeking to invest in renewable energy businesses operating in Africa, an investor forum in Nairobi was told. The Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund and the Energy and Environment Partnership Trust Fund forum brought together financiers and companies from across the world. The Nairobi meeting provided a platform for small and medium-sized enterprises to interact with global financiers and firms keen on investment opportunities in renewable energy in Africa. The forum was an investor to business match-making platform that assists small and medium-sized enterprises  broker deals that will expand and grow their businesses and contribute to the transformational agenda in Africa. Christian Fellner, Austria Ambassador said the world’s economy is driven by SMEs, entrepreneurs and start-ups. “Most financiers and donors recognise importance of the early-stage investment market in creation of new jobs especially for women and youth and the development of the private sector in the clean energy sector in sub-saharan Africa,” he said. He said private sector is the key engine for job creation accounting for 90 per cent of all jobs in the developing world with SMEs accounting for majority of these jobs. Swedish Embassy, senior programmes manager Paula Kermfors said Financing energy programmes is limited by constraints and  challenges that hinder an enabling private sector investment. “Currently, energy access financing is beginning to penetrate the hard to reach markets - in rural, transitioning and fragile markets,” he said. Daniel Ohonde, AECF chief executive said they have funded 268 businesses in the renewable energy, climate change and agribusiness sectors.
