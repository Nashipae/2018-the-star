Senate speaker Kenneth Lusaka has dismissed political leaders from Western who have declared a run for the presidency in 2022. He said Bungoma senator Moses Wetang’ula, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa and Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi were “jokers” who could not go anywhere. Speaking at Kabula village in Bumula constituency, Lusaka said the three had no capacity to win the election and were only out to lead the Luhya community in opposition. He asked them to team up with DP William Ruto to form the next government if they care for the community. ‘’At the moment Ruto is the front runner, so they should team up with him unless they are out to make the community stay in opposition for ever,’’ the speaker said. Lusaka said the leaders should unite themselves and the community before running for higher office. “How will they win the presidency when all of you are divided?” he asked. “Let us first of all look for elusive Luhya unity and thereafter we can front one person, but for now forget it,’’ Luska said. He asked Luhas to rally behind Ruto, saying he has leadership qualities.
