Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) Vincent Onyala has been called up to the Kenya squad for this weekend’s Cape Town Sevens in South Africa Onyala replaces Homeboyz’s forward Jeff Oluoch, who got a groin injury in Dubai and jetted back home yesterday. Onyala had a superb season for the bankers in the national Sevens circuit and was part of the training squad named by head coach Paul Murunga. Oluoch loss is a big blow to the side as he was one of the players who emerged with credit in Dubai following shambolic display. Shujaa lost all six matches over the two days to pick a paltry point and are currently bottom of the standings. Speaking from Cape Town, Murunga said they will have to address the issues of the defence and tackling if they are to match England, Fiji and France in Pool ‘C’ on Saturday. “Obviously, our defence let us down. We were not able to make tackles and its something the boys are going to focus on this week and at the same time get our defensive alignment working,” added Murunga. Commenting on the pooling , Murunga said they will take one game at a time. “ s for this weekend, we are not setting any targets. We must get back to the basics and correct our mistakes. This is a very much a young squad with several debutants and we must get it right in all facets of play if we are to be competitive.” The team arrived in Cape Town on Sunday evening and had a rest and recovery session on Monday before getting down to business yesterday. Skipper Eden Agero said they were relishing the challenge of playing this weekend. “It presents an opportunity to correct the mistakes of last weekend and play much better and get our defence right,” he added. Agero said the mood of the team is still upbeat despite the poor show over the weekend.
