The government has beefed up security in the Western region ahead of the Christmas and New Year festive season. All security personnel have been asked to stay on duty while those who were on leave have been recalled to ensure that the region is safe. Western Regional Commissioner Anne Ngâ€™etich (left) told the press on Thursday in his Kakamega office that many insecurity cases are reported during the festive season hence the decision to heighten security. She said the regional security and intelligent committee is committed to restore sanity and bring order on the roads and crackdown on organised crimes in the region as well.
