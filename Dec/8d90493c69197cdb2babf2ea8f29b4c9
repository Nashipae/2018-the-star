Bomet leaders were on Wednesday urged to pass the Tea Bill proposed by Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot. The leaders said the Bill would benefit small scale tea farmers who have continually been fleeced of their hard-earned money by tea brokers. “It is unfortunate that for many years now farmers have never had good returns but we are happy with the Bill and we call upon our leaders to pass it,” Boito MCA Charles Langat said. Former speaker Geoffrey Kipng’etich insisted on the need for public participation to enlighten farmers on the importance of the Bill to them. The Tea Bill 2018 proposes the establishment of a tea regulatory body to develop the industry. “The Tea Regulatory Authority of Kenya shall in consultation with the cabinet secretary, initiate the formulation of policies to regulate the tea industry, register and regulate the operations of tea growers and processors, licence tea dealers, manage factories and their agents and tea brokers,” the bill states. Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter and former Konoin MP Sammy Koech claimed tea farmers in Rift Valley were getting lower bonus pay compared to other regions because tea brokers were from one particular region. Lugari MP Ayub Savula echoed the sentiments saying he will marshal MPs to pass the Bill once it is brought to the House. Also supporting the Bill are Former Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto and Embomos MCA Robert Serbai.
