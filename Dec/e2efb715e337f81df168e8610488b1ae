AN ALLEGED victim of extrajudicial killing was buried on Friday in an event that was mostly attended by elderly men and women. Young men and some family members skipped the event for fear of being targeted or harassed by police. John Githinji , 41, was buried at his father’s farm in Mugunda area in Kieni constituency, Nyeri County. Though police officers never showed up at the home, there were fears that their presence would be felt at the home looking for more suspects. Police officers had earlier made an appearance at the mortuary at the Nyeri County Referral Hospital in a car with private registration numbers immediately Githinji’s body was released before driving off. Githinji’s father Michael Murefu said his family members and himself are still traumatized by the killing and confirmed that some of his children skipped the burial for fear of being targeted or harassed by the police.
