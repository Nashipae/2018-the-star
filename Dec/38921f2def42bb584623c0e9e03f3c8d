Menengai Oilers are set to sign two players during the January transfer window, according to head coach Gibson Weru. The Oilers, who were promoted this season, currently lie tenth in the 12-team league table with six points after one win and three losses from their four fixtures. Weru said they will strengthen the fly-half and fullback positions during the window to give the side a chance of staying in the top flight. “From the four games this season, we have realised we have problem at fly-half and fullback. Our current first choice Amos Onyikwa has not done well and therefore we are looking at bringing in competition for him as well as fullback, where we have deployed Derrick Keyoga. We need to move him to the wing where he can play better and read the game well as a play-maker In their last match against Homeboyz last weekend, Weru said Thomas Lusangalu started at fly-half and will play there temporarily until they get a replacement. “Lusangalu did a commendable job and probably will start against Mwamba this weekend,” he added. Weru said the focus this week has been on their defence following the 31-28 loss to Homeboyz last weekend. “Against Homeboyz, the defence let us down. Our back-line did not click very well and we have no choice but to improve the department ahead of tomorrow’s match . We have to improve on our set-pieces because we are not consistent. At times, we blew hot and cold when it came to our scrums and lost line-outs at crucial moments.” Weru said he was relishing the challenge of facing Mwamba this weekend. “ It will be a competitive game. Mwamba beat Nondies last week for their first win and we want to finish the year on a high and pick our second win of the season,” he added. Following the trip to Mwamba, Oilers will take a much-needed Christmas break with their first fixture of 2019 set to be an away match to Kabras Sugar on January.
