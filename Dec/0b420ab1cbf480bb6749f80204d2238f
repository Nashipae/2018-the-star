Picture this, you're in the clothing business and you deal with mitumba. Not only do you do retail in Gikomba but you distribute on wholesale orship in Eldoret and Kisumu. December's here and there's a large bale that's arrived early this morning at 4.00AM from Tanzania which you ordered to cater for the sales that you anticipate for this festive season. It's 6.00AM and you're ready to redistribute. You need to send to Anyango in Kisumu and Wafula in Eldoret. Your workers are done sorting out the bale of clothes and have divided it into three. Now all you now need to do is dispatch and then take the remainder to your shop. Meanwhile, Anyango and Wafula are both ready to make a downpayment of sh. 170,000/= each. They actually woke up early for this! They know that the clothes will reach them by 1.00PM so that they too can open for business. However, the thing that they cannot do is send you the money via mobile because there is a limit to the daily transactions which they also do not want to exhaust. It's annoying! Banks are not open until 8.30AM and none of you has the time to wait. What's the smartest thing to do? If you haven't been keeping up with technology, you probably haven't figured out the answer yet.
