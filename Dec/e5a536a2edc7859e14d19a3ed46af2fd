Pwani Oil Products has announced the acquisition of the Rainbow detergent soap brand from Match Masters Limited. This will grow the Mombasa-based manufacturer’s market share in the fast-growing home care segment. Pwani Oils Commercial Director Rajul Malde said the firm is looking to grow its home care category by expanding its consumer base with products packaged and priced for different consumer segments including low income households. “This acquisition will enable us grow our soaps and the home care category as well as give our customers a wide variety to choose from. This is part of our expansion strategy to offer products that meet customer aspirations across diverse consumer segments,” he said. The acquisition will also enable Pwani Oils to further diversify its consumer portfolio where it is currently strong in the edible oils segment with its flagship products Fresh Fri and Salit. Personal care products include Diva and Sawa soap brands. In 2017, Pwani Oils launched White Wash a laundry bar soap that contains both washing powder and fabric softener. Rainbow soap will be available in 25g, 40g and 100g sachets as well as 200g and 500g pouches and jars and the larger 1kg and 3.5kg bags and jars. The 25g sachet will retail at Sh5 while the 3.5 kg bag and jar will go for Sh700. “Our value proposition is to offer consumers products that are affordable and meet their expectations,” Malde said.
