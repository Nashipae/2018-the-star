A fisherman died while another is still missing after a boat accident in the Indian Ocean on Monday. Four fishermen were going on with their activities when their boat capsized at Kabana Kabana beach, Mtwapa Creek. Two were rescued by local divers. One was retrieved dead while the whereabouts of the fourth is still unknown. While briefing journalists at the scene, Mtwapa OCPD Joseph Muriuki said theÂ county disaster team, fisheries department, and the police will lead the search. "It is not clear how the accident occurred," he said. Fishermen plying their trade in the area are prone to venturing into the waters without safety gear. They also use traditional boats which have no security apparatus, hence, exposing them to dangers of drowning. Preliminary investigations revealed that the boat must have overturned due to winds causing high and rough tides. The body of the deceased was taken to Kilifi District Hospital mortuary.
