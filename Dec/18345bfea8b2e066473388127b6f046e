Uganda retained the FIM Central Africa Challenge title following scintillating bike displays at the Jamhuri Park racetrack over the weekend. Having already taken impressive scalps against Kenya in the opening round at Kampala’s Busiika racetrack, the visitors savoured victory with mixed results in the eight categories. Uganda beat Kenya on a 2602-1378 aggregate score to take back home the coveted trophy. Ugandan Orland siblings Alon (MX65), Stav (MX85) and Aviv (MX125) were among the star attractions dominating their classes and beating Kenyans to a breathtaking podium tussle. But the Kenyan trio of Ngugi Waweru in MX1, Rolf Kihara (MX2) and Gisa Benzinge (pee wee class) were peerless beating Shivam Vinayak, Uganda’s Fatuh Kiggundu and Mbambazi Ashraf respectively to the podium dash. Kihara rode a Hucsvana. The 50cc class was equally entertaining and it was Ugandan diminutive speedster Gift Sebaguzi who took the chequered flag first. Sagazi won all the three heats at stake beating Kenya’s Mutai Wahome to second spot. Fans who braved the scorching sun were treated to some exhilarating displays of racing artistry. The visitors fielded a competitive 40-man team and were all smiles after winning both legs if the series. “We have come a long way as Team Uganda. A couple of years ago Kenya used to thrash us but now we’ve turned the tables on them. We have e dominated pretty much in most of the races and we are happy with the result and retaining this coveted trophy,” Arthur Block Jnr said. Despite losing the third heat to compatriot Obote Abaki, Alon Orland collected 57 points to emerge victorious in MX65 class.
