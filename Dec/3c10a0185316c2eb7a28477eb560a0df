One of the six men killed during the Kolongolo clashes in Trans Nzoia only sought to know why police officers were beating his friend, his elder brother said yesterday. Duncan Walela said they will leave everything to God as they have nowhere to seek justice. “Covering a friend’s nakedness caused my brother’s death. We don’t know where to run to for Justice, and who to cry to, but we’ll leave everything in God’s hands. Maybe someday justice will prevail,” he said at Mt Elgon Hospital mortuary where he went to view the body. His brother Maurice Simiyu, 26, was killed on Sunday evening when the police clashed with residents. “My brother had gone to the market to purchase some clothes for our nephew who had been circumcised,” Walela said. Simiyu saw officers beat his friend and he sought know why because the friend had not resisted arrest, Walela said, adding the offi cers responded by shooting him in the chest.
