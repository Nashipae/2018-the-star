A school in Kakamega has threatened to sue the Kenya National Examinations Council, saying its KCPE results are not genuine. Kakamega Green Mount School director Wesley Kipkemoi said he was contemplating suing to obtain orders to compel the council to remark the school’s Kiswahili scripts. He said the paper was not properly marked. He said the matter was of concern given Form 1 selection takes place today. He said they wrote to Knec on November 20 over the matter. “We are giving Knec a seven-day ultimatum to address our grievances failure to which we shall have no option but to move to court,” Kipkemoi said. The school was among top performers from Western region.
