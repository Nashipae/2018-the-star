The Supreme Court has upheld Alfred Keter's win in the Nandi Hills MP race. The court dismissed Bernard Kitur's petition challenging the outcome. The case was grounded on claims the MP campaigned outside IEBC stipulated time. A happy Keter told the press after the ruling that his case was fronted by cartels out to shield themselves from accountability. "Kenyans know cartels that are fighting me. I thank God because I have come out victorious and I want to thank everyone who voted for me and supported my leadership," the MP said. Keter said his detractors must know that his back in parliament with a full swing and won't relent in the fight against graft. "I want to thank President Uhuru Kenyatta for supporting the fight of corruption. Cartels, Keter is back in parliament...I will not relent and continue to ensure a country free from corruption," he said. He thanked DPP Noordin Haji, DCI boss George Kinoti, and the EACC for the 'good fight' against graft. Keter was declared the winner with 28,923 votes against 13,872 garnered by Kitur - the petitioner.
