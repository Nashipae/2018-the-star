An elephant that strayed into Mwakingali village was lucky yesterday after police prevented residents from slaughtering it. The lonely jumbo from Tsavo East National Park ran to Voi police station where it hid in a thicket as police and KWS officials chased away villagers who were in pursuit with machetes. The residents wanted to slaughter the jumbo for a feast. “Police should not deny us an early Christmas meal because there is a reason the elephant strayed into out village,” boda boda rider Alex Ngau said. The riders had pursued the animal through Moi Stadium into Voi town. The elephant menacingly ripped through the fence of Voi police station with officers dashing inside for safety. The jumbo then hid in a nearby thicket. Hundred of villagers joined the riders in pursuit of the feast only for police to block them. Voi police boss Joseph Chesire said the elephant got lost and was trying to find its way back to the park when the riders attacked. “It was fleeing from the noises and crowds following it. There was no harm caused,” Chesire said. The villagers who were armed with axes and machetes said police and KWS officials had no business in protecting the animal. “This was a Christmas gift brought to us through our prayers. It is wrong to take it away,” a resident said. KWS senior warden Zainabu Salim said the villagers had caused the jumbo to become jittery. Police reinforcemnt was called in to repulse the crowd. They later shepherded the elephant back to the pack. Chesire asked the public to keep away from wild animals that stray from parks. He said tragedies might occur. “We chase you away to keep you safe. It’s not malice or hate but for your own good,” Chesire said. Click here for the latest political news
