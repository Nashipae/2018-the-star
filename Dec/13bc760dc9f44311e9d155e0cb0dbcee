Kenyans are losing a lot of money through the medical equipment leasing program, Bungoma senator Moses Wetangula has said. “The government in Nairobi is purporting to supply medical equipment for lease to county hospitals yet these equipment include gloves, wooden chairs, trays and hand towels which are all disposable,” Wetangula said on Sunday in Kakamega. The Ford Kenya leader said the leased items should be returned after being used for the agreed time but some of the products cannot be returned because they are disposable. About Sh200 million is deducted from the funds allocated to every county to cater for the leased equipment. The contracts for the supply of the equipment were signed in February 2015 between the Health ministry and equipment manufacturers for leasing of medical facilities at Sh38 billion. Wetang’ula reiterated that lifestyle audit for the leaders should be done in order to expose those who steal from the public coffers. The senator says lifestyle audits is the only path to equity. “If you are working and your salary is known to everyone and you have money that is more than what you earn from your job or business, you need to tell us where all this money is coming from,” he said. Wetang’ula also criticised the Jubilee administration for not being fair to Kenyans by accumulating a high public debt which has crossed the Sh5 trillion mark. The senator who was speaking during a funds drive at the Lutonyi Catholic called on the Director of Public Prosecution and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to charge those responsible . He said that if the trend continues the gap between the rich and the poor will widen and poor people will suffer.
