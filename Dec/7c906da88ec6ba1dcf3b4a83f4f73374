Former Bomet governor Isaac Rutto has dismissed claims that his Chama Cha Mashinani party has been “sold”. He said CCM is intact and independent, contrary to reports being “peddled around” by some politicians and reasidents. “There have been too much propaganda being spread around and especially by radio callers to the effect we have sold our party. That is wrong and the party is firm,” Rutto said. He spoke when he met a group of social media users from the region called ‘mashinani online brigade’. The former governor said there has never been discussions over the sale of the party. He said CCM was formed to strengthen devolution and agitate for the rights of the common man. “Why are people talking about CCM having been sold just about when DP William Ruto was in Chepalungu, which happens to be my home?” Rutto asked on Friday. The former governor said the DP has been to Kisumu, Mombasa and Nyeri on developmental tours and he has never heard people talking about parties in these areas being sold. Rutto said the claims will not prevent him from engaging in talks with other parties ahead of 2022. He said CCM will not field a presidential candidate in 2022, but is open for talks with other parties on a possible coalition. “We will look around for presidential candidates but we’ll want them to approach us and request for our support,” Rutto said.
