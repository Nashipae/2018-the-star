West Pokot governor John Lonyangapuo’s security was withdrawn on Friday after he removed a police roadblock andwith freed a boda boda rider in Chepararia on Wednesday. County commandant Mathews Kuto said the governor’s security was withdrawn from both his residence and office. He said police are investigating the roadblock incident. On Thursday, Lonyangapuo said there are more than 20 roadblocks within a 15km radius and which the police use to extort Sh1,000 from every boda boda rider using the Lomut-Kapenguria road. Tension built in Makutano town after residents learned of the security withdrawal. Led by nominated member of county assembly Elijah Kasheuseu, the residents expressed fear that the governor might be arrested. Kasheuseu said the governor did not violate any law but he was protecting the rights of innocent Kenyans who were being exploited by police officers. He called on Interior CS Fred Matiang’i and Inspector General of police Joseph Boinnet to respect elected leaders. “The governor was elected by the people and he has a right to protect the interests of his electorate,” the ward rep said. Lonyangapuo on Wednesday evening removed metal spikes mounted outside Safari Park Hotel and Chepareria town on the Kitale-Lodwar highway. He said the roadblocks were illegal and accused police of using them to harass motorists. At the Safari Park Hotel roadblock, the governor found a rider transporting onions from Ortum to Makutano,handcuffed to his motorcycle, and ordered his release.
