A lobby group has opposed President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four housing agenda. The Urban Landlords and Tenants Association of Kenya said the government’s move to invest in the housing sector will provide an unfair competitive edge to private players. “The property sector is a dynamic industry that calls for all stakeholders to work together so that we can have a lasting solution. We will continue to engage our members who are landlords and tenants, manufacturers, service providers and authorities to enhance the sector,” Ultak chairperson Rachel Arunga said. The officials were addressing the media yesterday on market developments in the property industry at a Nairobi hotel. The group warned the police to honour lease agreements when they vacate police lines to live with other Kenyans.
