The Manu Chandaria Foundation has bought various copies of the Give Me My Mountain book for distribution in universities and public libraries. As part of their community service, every year the foundation gives out 12 to 14 books to various institutions that may not otherwise have the resources to stock up in an effort to educate, mentor and educate the next generation of entrepreneurs. The books were received by Manu Chandaria and a team of officials at their offices on Limuru Road. Speaking during the handover, the renowned industrialist praised the book and urged all interested in creating wealth in Kenya and in Africa to read it. “When I saw the book and realised it was written by someone who came from nothing, I knew this is what Kenya needs. Esther Muchemi gives us a clear example that yes we can make it if we want to, she didn’t inherit a fortune but through hard work and integrity she has scaled the heights,” Manu said. A practical guide to wealth creation, the autobiography chronicles the journey of self-made entrepreneur Esther Muchemi. From a single shop, Samchi Group of Companies has grown to be a business empire with interests in telecommunications, micro-finance, real estate and hospitality sectors. The book gives a blow by blow account of how Muchemi and her team built such an impressive portfolio. It lays out the principles and success factors that have made her the global icon that she is today. “I am so excited about this initiative and the impact it will have on our youth. Manu Chandaria has always been one of role models and he is a reflection of what we are talking about in the book, where you start small and grow big. His humility and hardwork has always inspired me and it’s . I don’t’ want to be found condemning the youth, but to be a role model for them and this initiative will put my book in the hands of the youth who need it the most,” Muchemi said.
