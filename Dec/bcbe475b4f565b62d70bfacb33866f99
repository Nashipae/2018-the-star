The three Chinese charged with attempting to bribe officers in the SGR investigation will stay in police custody until December 10 when the pre-trial starts. China Roads and Bridge Corporation employees Li Gen (transport manager), Li Xiaowu (security manager) and Sun Xin (translator) were denied bail on Friday. They work at the standard gauge railway terminus in Mombasa. They allegedly tried to give DCI officers Sh500,000 on November 22 to influence the probe in their favour. They have denied wrongdoing. The DCI officers were investigatingan alleged scandal involving SGR ticket booking clerks Florence Gitau and Esther Mushong. The pair were charged with forgery and theft. Chief magistrate Julius Nang’ea said the three are a flight risk and have no fixed residence. If released, they may interfere with witnesses given they were arrested for trying to bribe officials investigating them, he said. Nang’ea said if convicted, the three face up to 10 years in prison. Defence lawyers Nelson Sitonik and Queenton Ochieng had applied for bond for their clients, saying that as SGR employees, they reside in staff quarters at the Mombasa terminus and would not skip hearings. The lawyers pleaded with the court to confiscate travel documents of the three to allay fears of them being flight risks. Prosecutor Renson Ingonga dismissed the argument. He said the trio might be interdicted by the employer and in such a situation could leave the staff quarters. Once they fly out, it would be difficult to get them back because Kenya and China have no extradition treaty, Ingonga said. In the alleged attempted bribery, Sh200,000 first instalment was to be given on November 23. The detectives, led by Andrew Warui, rejected the offer. The Chinese were nabbed th next day — November 24. Click here for the latest political news
