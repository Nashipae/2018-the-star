Airlines flying to Lamu are overwhelmed by the high bookings as the festive season approaches. The airlines that fly to Lamu include Fly540, Fly Sax, Silverstone Air, Skyward Express, Safarilink and Airkenya. Most of them are fully booked for December, with some having a few spaces left in the last week of the month. Senior agent with Lamu Express Travels Fatma Ali said airlines are doing booming business. She said many holidaymakers and tourists are heading to Lamu. "Most flights are already fully booked. That's not something we experience every day. Its also a good sign that business will be good in December and January," Fatma said. The fare to not increased despite the high demand from customers. An agent with Air Travel Mohamed Said said the fare remains the same. "Flights from Lamu to Malindi cost Sh2,500-3,500, from Lamu to Mombasa Sh3,500-Sh4,500, while from Lamu to Nairobi Sh5,000-Sh6,000 depending on the airline. All these are the normal fares we charge," he said. There have been calls for airlines to increase the number of scheduled flights to Lamu. Many travellers have opted to used road transport since flights from Mombasa and Malindi to Lamu are fully booked. Kimani Waigwa, who went to Lamu a fortnight ago, said his family travelled by road because they were unable to get space on a plane. "I donâ€™t like travelling by road, so you can imagine my disappointment. All flights from Malindi to Lamu were fully booked yet we had already made reservations for our hotel," he said. "Next time, I will book early. However, airlines should increase flights to Lamu during the festive season. There are many people travelling but the flights are not enough." The introduction of cheap flights on the Lamu route has seen a steady increase in the number of travellers. Stakeholders want the Kenya Airports Authority to expand Manda Airport so as to attract more airlines and bigger planes. Click here for the latest political news
