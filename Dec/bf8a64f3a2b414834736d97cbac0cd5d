Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula has criticized Education CS Amina Mohamed over this year’s form one selection saying it was not done fairly. Wetang'ula said the process disadvantaged those who worked harder in the KCPE exam. He said most candidates who performed well have been denied their secondary schools of choice. “I want to tell CS Amina that she is demoralizing our children and this must change, otherwise what was the need for telling our children to chose the schools?” Wetangula asked. He spoke at Sitatunga in Cherang’any during a homecoming ceremony for nominated MCA Caro Makokha. The Bungoma Senator also took issue with men impregnating school girls. “I am aware that there was an incident where a teacher in Bungoma impregnated 11 girls, it is also known that in another area, a 12-year-old girl delivered twins, but worrying more is that this girl was impregnated by a 13-year-old boy, it is really disturbing,“ he said.
