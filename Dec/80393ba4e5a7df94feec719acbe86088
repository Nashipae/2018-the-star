Attorney General Paul Kihara has allowed Queen's Counsel Khawar Qureshi to practice as an advocate in Kenya but should only focus on Deputy Chief Justice  Philomena Mwilu graft case. In a notice on Thursday, Kihara said Qureshi's authority to practice is only limited to the above matter and connected proceedings arising. Qureshi is also required to maintain a valid practising certificate for the duration of the retainer. Kihara said the UK-based counsel is required to pay an admission fee as may be prescribed by the chief registrar of the judiciary. Qureshi is also subject to the disciplinary process as applies to a foreign advocate under the LSK Act during the course of the limited practice in Kenya. The clarification followed lawyer James Orengo's objections to the foreign prosecutor's involvement in the case. The DCJ's lawyers and the prosecution team on Thursday engaged in a three-hour standoff with each side refusing to give in.
