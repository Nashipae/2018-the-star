Residents of Abakaile ward in Garissa are poised for a by-election after the Appeal Court said it has no jurisdiction to hear a petition filed by last year’s winner. Mohamed Ali was declared winner by the IEBC, but Abdiwahab Sheikh challenged the victory in court. The first court upheld the win, but Sheikh challenged the ruling in the High Court, which annulled it in August. Judge George Dullu said the lower court had erred by failing to order vote scrutiny. Ali proceeded to the Court of Appeal, which, on Wednesday, said it only handles appeals for elections involving governors, senators and members of the National Assembly. Ali however promised to fight on. “I have instructed my lawyers to move and file the case in the Supreme Court to end this unnecessary stalemate,” he said. “No hearing took place pertaining to the main appeal. It was only a preliminary objection filed by the respondents, contrary to what some have reported.” He said he is committed to serving the people of Abakaile and will “climb any mountain to protect their hard-earned victory.” Ali (ODM) garnered 1,826 votes against 1,799 for Sheikh of ANC. Sheikh yesterday said the court had finally sided with the truth. He urged his supporters to be ready to vote. “I appeal to my supporters to remain steadfast and maintain brotherhood as they prepare to once again exercise their constitutional right in defending their subverted will,” Sheikh said. He said the 2017 poll was marred by massive irregularities and the results cannot be allowed to stand.
