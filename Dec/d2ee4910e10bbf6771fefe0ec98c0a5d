Zari Hassan has responded to fans who have been asking her to move out of Diamond's house after their marriage hit the rocks. Diamond Platnumz bought a house in South Africa, a mansion that his ex Zari Hassan has been living in even after their break-up. Zari said she used her brains to buy other houses, which are investments for her kids. "Wenye comment za ‘toka kwa nyumba yetu.’ Tabia zakua na wanaume bila kutumia akili sio tatizo langu. Nilitumia akili zangu kama mimi kununuliwa nyumba na watoto wangu. (I used my brains well and my children and I were bought a house. It's a future investment for the kids," she wrote on Instagram. Adding: "Kumbuka nyumba ninazo 4 apa Sauzi. Mwenye uwezo wake aje anitoe. #LifeIsGucci." Zari has two kids with the Salome hitmaker: Princess Tiffah and Prince Nillan. She also has three boys with late ex-hubby Ivan Ssemwanga. Ivan left his children property worth millions of shillings, and a mansion in South Africa. His firstborn Pinto Ssemwanga is set to take over some of the property when he turns 18. Zari broke up with Diamond Platnumz in February this year during Valentine's Day, over what she termed consistent disrespect from the singer.
