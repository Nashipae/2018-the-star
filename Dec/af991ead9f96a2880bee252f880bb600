The Inspector General of Police has urged Ipoa to speed up investigations into the killing of a Leeds University, UK, student in Kibera. Carilton Maina, 23, was shot dead last week in Laini Saba, Kibera. “We wish to inform the public that the IG has asked Ipoa to expedite investigations into the shooting that occurred in Kibera,” a tweet by the National Police Service indicated on Wednesday. Amnesty International has also urged the officer who shot Maina to surrender his gun for ballistic analysis. Executive director Houghton Irungu on Wednesday said Maina had no criminal record. The engineering student and his friends had gone to watch a football match when they were confronted by police officers. Click here for the latest political news
