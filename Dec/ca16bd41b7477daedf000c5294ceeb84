The Government has confirmed elaborate plans to adopt modern vehicular traffic management systems as a key component in the affordable homes program. The 500,000 affordable homes program (AHP) which is one of the Big 4 Agenda will feature access and movement systems to ensure smooth movement of people from their residence to their workplaces. Speaking on behalf of Housing and Urban Development PS Charles Hinga Mwaura, Nairobi Area Transport Authority Director Ronald Ndegwa said the development framework for AHP will incorporate improved transit access systems to curb perennial traffic jams associated with large projects. As plans for Nairobi’s upcoming Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) project, ITDP Africa is advocating the extension of the corridor through Nairobi’s central business district. Where previous models considered diverting the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) path around the city’s busiest central blocks, ITDP analysis shows that bringing the system into the city’s downtown would benefit users and improve traffic conditions. “To achieve Affordable Housing Program objectives we must facilitate ease of movement in an effective and reliable manner,” Hinga said adding that, “Our project design principles feature clear policies on access and movement including cycling paths and pedestrian-friendly walkways to boost non-motorized forms of transport uptake.” The affordable housing program incorporates supply, demand, and enabling environment interventions. The AHP project pipeline will be developed in five lots and lists Lot 1 developments as follows: Park road (1,640), Makongeni (20,000), Shauri Moyo (5,300), Starehe (3,500), Mavoko (5,500), Social housing (15,000), Nairobi and Mombasa Counties (78,700), other Counties (48,000) and the completion of legacy projects which will be announced soon.
