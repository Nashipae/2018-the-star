The Independent Police Oversight Authority on Wednesday launched an investigation into the shooting of Carilton David Maina, a university student, in Kibera, Nairobi. Police allegedly shot Maina, 23, claiming he was among a group of thugs that was terrorising Line Saba residents on Sunday morning. But residents took to social media saying the victim was a Leeds University student and not a criminal. “He came home for the December holidays and would have gone back (to England) in January if not for his life being ended by the split second speed of the bullets and the ravenous interests of the police. He had just come from watching a football match at the nearest movie shop, being a football fan and as a matter of fact a potential goalkeeper,” posted one Collins Onyango on his Facebook page. In a statement, IPOA says it will recommend criminal or disciplinary proceedings against any officers proven to have shot the university student. "The authority on its own motion immediately launched independent investigations to unravel the circumstances that led to the fatal shooting," the statement signed by Dennis Oketch, the authority's communication official, reads.
