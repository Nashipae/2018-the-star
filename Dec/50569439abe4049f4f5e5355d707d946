The President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Joseph Kabila - who's due to step down after 17 years in power - says his top priority is to ensure that elections go smoothly later this month. Speaking to the BBC, Kabila again refused to rule out running for office in future. He was originally due to step down two years ago. The Congolese Nobel Peace Prize winner, Denis Mukwege, says he's very worried that the presidential poll will not be free, fair or peaceful. Kambale Musavuli, a campaigner with Friends of the Congo, an advocacy organisation based in Washington DC, spoke to the BBC's Newsday programme about Kabila's plans to remain active in politics and possibly run for President in the future.
