The High Court in Kitale on Monday issued a temporary injunction restraining police from arresting West Pokot governor John Lonyangapuo for aiding a suspect's escape from lawful custody. Presiding judge Hillary Chemitei allowed a request by Lonyangapuo to restrain the IG, Interior CS and Director of Public Prosecutions from arresting, detaining or charging him. The judge issued orders compelling the respondents to reinstate police officers seconded to guard the governor and his residence. The judge certified as urgent the application by the petitioner. "I hereby grant the applicant the orders sought pending the hearing of the case. The respondents are restrained from taking action against him,’’ he ruled.

Through lawyer Peter Wanyama, Lonyangapuo had sought orders to bar police from arresting him in connection with an incident that took place at a road block on the Kitale-Lodwar Highway. Several leaders from West Pokot, led by county speaker Catherine Mukenyang and Majority Leader Thomas Ngolesia accompanied Lonyangapuo’s lawyer to secure the orders. The governor moved to court after police were dispatched to arrest him for allegedly helping a suspect escape and abstraction. On November 28, the governor is accused of confronting police officers at a road block near Safari Hotel on Kapenguria-Lodwar road and removing the metal spikers erected by police. He is also accused of ordering officers to unconditionally release a boda boda rider they had detained. The governor was angered by the officers' move to detain and handcuff the rider to his motorcycle.
