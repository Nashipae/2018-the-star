The Yemeni mother of a toddler dying in the US has arrived in California to visit him after the Trump administration relaxed its travel ban. Shaima Swileh, who currently lives in Egypt, was initially prevented from entering America. Her son, two-year-old Abdullah Hassan, was born with a brain disease that doctors say he will not survive. Abdullah's father, Ali Hassan, 22, has said the visit will allow the couple to "mourn with dignity". Mrs Swileh landed at San Francisco International Airport late on Wednesday and was greeted by crowds of well-wishers. She is now expected to travel to the children's hospital in the city where her son is currently on life support. The Department of State granted Mrs Swileh permission to enter the US on Tuesday morning, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a non-profit advocacy group representing the family.

"We are so relieved that this mother will get to hold and kiss her son one last time," CAIR-Sacramento attorney Saad Sweilem said earlier. "The public outpouring of support for this family was incredible." The organisation also rebuked the government for enforcing the travel ban to begin with, saying the toddler "could have been receiving comfort from his mother" for weeks. Soon after he took office, US President Donald Trump imposed travel restrictions on mainly majority-Muslim countries. The executive order went through several versions before being upheld by the US Supreme Court this summer. It bans nationals of Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen from entering the US. Click here for the latest political news
