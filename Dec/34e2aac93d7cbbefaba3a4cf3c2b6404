The effects of the ban on matatus from the CBD stretched into the night on Monday as private vehicle owners found themselves in a gridlock. As the 'walkathon' by commuters who depend on PSVs continued, private car owners didn't have it any easier. Traffic jams stretching several hundreds of metres were evident on major highways in the city as late as 9.30pm. A spot check on University Way, Kenyatta Avenue and Waiyaki Way painted a picture of a frustrated lot, with some motorists switching off their engines to save fuel. One motorist told reporters it took him two hours to get to Kenyatta Avenue from Moi Avenue. It usually takes less than five minutes to cover the stretch on a day with light traffic. Some motorists questioned whether matatus were really responsible for the perennial traffic jams in the city centre as claimed by Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko in his decongestion plan.
