Rogue government officials aiding the illegal entry of aliens and contraband goods into the country risk being dismissed, Northeastern regional commissioner Mohamed Birk has said. Birik on Sunday said the government was aware of "few elements" frustrating efforts to end illegal entry of goods and people into the country. “I'm issuing a stern warning to them that stern disciplinary action will be taken against them including dismissal and prosecution, Birik said in Garissa town. He said the government was serious about the matters and that "heads will roll.” “These are the people who are dragging us behind and giving the civil service a bad name. It is time we all become responsible and patriotic,” Birik said. There have been an increase in the number of aliens from neighbouring Somalia. Birik said the matter was a top concern his office was committed to eradicating. Police have arrested 40 aliens at various security check-points over the last two weeks. Most of the suspects were destined for Nairobi. They were arraigned with the courts directing that they be repatriated. The arrests and repatriations have however not stopped aliens from illegally entering Kenya. Mandera governor Ali Roba and Dadaab MP Mohamed Dahiye have been calling on the government to re-open border entry points with Somalia to allow for free trade. "The only way to curb entry of contraband goods is by re-opening designated border points and posting officers to inspect the goods," Roba said.
