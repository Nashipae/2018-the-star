Nairobi Assembly members have applauded Governor Mike Sonko for implementing a Collective Bargaining Agreement signed three years ago. The CBA means county staff will receive a 15 per cent salary increment from next month. The MCAs commended the governor last week in a special sitting to adopt the supplementary estimates for 2018-19. Majority Leader Abdi Hassan Guyo said the CBA is a critical component in the Supplementary Budget. “I thank the governor for implementing this CBA. It is very important for welfare of the staff of Nairobi county to be taken care of. When the staff go for this festive season, they will bless the governor and this assembly for adopting this Supplementary Budget,” Guyo said. Minority Chief Whip Peter Imwatok said, “We support the Supplementary Bill. That the staff of the Nairobi county for the first time can get the CBA as signed by the governor and then they will get paid from January 2019,” he said. More than 15,000 county staff will get the salary increment after City Hall promised a raise in a deal between the county government and the Kenya County Government Workers Union (KCGWU) in May 2017. Last week, the deputy county secretary and Public Service Management chief officer Leboo Morintat said the CBA issue had been a long outstanding problem, going beyond the current administration under Governor Sonko. “We as a county government need to appreciate the personal effort and highest consideration taken by the governor to increase the remuneration of county employees. Consequently therefore, the CBA shall be implemented in the payroll from the month of January, 2019,” Morintat added in a circular dated December 13, 2018 and addressed to all the county staff. In September, KCGWU Secretary General Roba Duba said the CBA will also improve the welfare and working conditions of staff.
