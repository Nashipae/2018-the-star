Senators want Energy and Petroleum CS John Munyes to explain financial misappropriation at the Kenya Pipeline Company. This came a day after KPC Managing Director Joe Sang resigned. He did not renew his contract, which expires in April next year. The Senate Energy committee chaired by Ephraim Maina (Nyeri) yesterday said it is concerned about the goings-on at the company and will be seeking explanation from the CS before taking action. “We’ll ensure all matters are investigated and appropriate action taken,” Maina said at a press conference. The CS was supposed to appear before the committee yesterday but at the last minute attended another meeting. He will appear today to explain, among other issues, the company’s status in the wake of push and pull over 11 million litres spillage that has rocked the institution in the recent months, corruption allegation and the performance of the Mombasa-Nairobi pipeline. “After consultation with the CS, he has requested the meeting be held tomorrow [today]. We have agreed, noting the current happenings, which they had not anticipated,” Maina said. KPC lost 11.646 million litres in spillage and 5.69 million to pilferage between March last year and May this year in nine separate incidents. Oil marketers demand cash for the loss. They have petitioned Parliament, but KPC has maintained the 11,646,000 litres do not meet the threshold for compensation. Narok senator Ledama ole Kina urged investigating agencies, the EACC and the DCI, to inform Kenyans of their findings. “There is a lot of theft at KPC. We also know the challenges of CIC Insurance, which has failed to pay claims as a result of spillage,” Kina said. He said they will issue summons today should Munyes be a no-show again.
