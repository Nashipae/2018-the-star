A 51-year-old Malindi man who raped an underage girl on several occasions and made her pregnant has been slapped with a 30-year jail sentence. Ngoloma Mulinge raped then 12-year-old Grace (not her real name) in 2016, when she worked for him as a dish cleaner on Sh20 pay. The girl, now 15, is housed at a rescue centre and has a one-year-old son. Shanzu aw court senior principal magistrate Diana Muchache said Mulinge deserves no mercy. “You should have been satisfied with your wife or look for a person or a girl who is older,” she said on Thursday before handing him the sentence. Muchache said the victim was younger than Mulinge’s first born aged 23. Muslims for Human Rights filed a case in 2016 after rescuing the girl. Muchache said the case was proved beyond reasonable doubt. “The doctor's report shows the child was fathered by you. The degree of confidence is 99.99 per cent,” she said. Muchache said Mulinge did not produce a report to contradict the doctor's. She said the girl's life has been ruined and she now lives in a rescue centre for fear the accused will abduct or harm her. “Defilement is punishable by a sentence of not less than 15 years. I hereby double that sentence and hand you 30 years in prison,” Muchache said. Mulinge has two weeks to appeal. The girl’s uncle said the accused is a “beast” and should “rot in jail”. Muhuri field officer Topister Juma said the child used to wash utensils at the accused's home and got paid Sh20. “Because of her poor background, she had to comply. She was raped thrice then got pregnant. Muhuri took her to hospital because she could not cope with her situation,” she said. Juma said the pregnancy was discovered at four months. The victim, a Standard Four pupil, has undergone counselling. Click here for the latest political news
