A Bondo court has ordered area OCS Abdikadir Yusuf to present himself for allegedly confiscating equipment belonging to two journalists. They were covering the arrest of a shylock in the town on Monday for allegedly operating illegally. Principal Magistrate M O Obiero issued the orders after the two told the court how they were assaulted, arrested and spent the night in police cells. Brian Odeng (KNA) and Geoffrey Oguma (Radio Nam Lolwe) were taken to court and charged with obstructing police from discharging their duties. The journalists pleaded not guilty to the charge and were released on a cash bail of Sh10,000. The case will be heard on January 22, 2019. The OCS is alleged to have confiscated their mobile phones, wallets, recorders, notebooks, Media Council Accreditation cards and personal belongings. The confiscated items were not recorded in the occurrence book at Bondo police station. "I was explaining to the officer to allow us to do our work. We even produced our job cards, but I was punchedÂ on the right cheek and we were arrested," Odeng told the court. On Monday, police had gone to arrest a shylock accused of auctioning residents' property without following due process. Click here for the latest political news
