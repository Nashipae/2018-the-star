The Kenya Revenue Authority has until tomorrow to issue Tom Ojienda with his tax compliance certificate for the year 2018-2019. In a ruling delivered yesterday, High Court Judge Wilfrida Okwany said Ojienda has established that he has an arguable case and also proved that he will suffer prejudice if the order isn’t granted. The judge ruled that KRA failed to state what loss it will suffer if the order is issued. Ojienda had sued KRA seeking to have it compelled to issue him with a tax compliance certificate. He said the actions of KRA are deliberately calculated malicious moves to ensure that he is locked out of the nomination of the LSK male representative to the JSC race that is set to be concluded on December 10. The certificate is a requirement for those seeking to represent the Law Society of Kenya in the Judicial Service Commission. Ojienda is seeking another term. “I issue a mandatory order compelling KRA to immediately issue Ojienda with the tax compliance his certificate not later than Thursday pending determination of this case,” judge Okwany said.
