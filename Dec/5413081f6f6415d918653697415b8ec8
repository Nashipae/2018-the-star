The Association of Matatu Operators has said it is not ready to move out of the CBD. Chairman Jimal Ibrahim said they will resist the Nairobi County Government's directive that bars them from accessing the CBD from Monday next week. Speaking to the Star on Saturday, he said the termini suggested by the county government are not up to standard. "Having no streetlights means that they are unsafe and the security of our members is at stake. There are no toilets and the termini are not in good conditions," he said. Ibrahim said matatus will move out of the CBD after the bus-stops are built to accommodate all matatus, security is enhanced and lavatories are constructed.

Ibrahim said they should have been consulted before a decision was made to move them from the CBD. Matatu Welfare Association chairman Dickson Mbugua also rejected the vacate notice, saying it is inappropriate. The county government has listed 11 termini that are to be used by the PSVs for only dropping and picking up passengers. On Thursday, the county government via a public notice banned PSVs from the CBD from Monday," the notice said. "The operators are required to take note that the above changes take effect as from December 3, 2018. "All previous gazette notices allocating any other place as picking and dropping areas within CBD are hereby revoked and become null and void as from Monday." The notice continues to draw mixed reactions from both the matatu operators and city dwellers. Click here for the latest political news
