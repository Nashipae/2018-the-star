Deputy President William Ruto's close business associate Samuel Mburu has been arrested for alleged tax evasion. Mburu was on Saturday accused by DPP Noordin Haji for tax evasion which cost the country over Sh64.9 million in lost revenue. The clearing and forwarding agent is known to handle Rutoâ€™s interests at Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) and Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA). The flambayount Mburu is also closely associated with Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika. He is facing charges of abuse of office and neglect of duty alongside 14 others and three companies. Other charges include; connivance to commit an offence, concealment of import goods, breach of trust and willful disobedience. Former Kebs managing director Charles Ongwae is among those the DPP has linked to the case. Haji in a statement said Gendipe Enterprises and Rupai Trading Limited with help of clearing agent, Landmark Freight Services Limited, custom and KEBS officials concealed imported goods with the aim of evading taxes. The two companies reportedly imported goods from Dubai which they declared to be machinery but were later found to be cooking oil.
