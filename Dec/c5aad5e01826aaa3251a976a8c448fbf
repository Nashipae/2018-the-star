The National Land Commission has for the second time failed to release the Kibarani land report even after making promises. The 32 acres in Mombasa was grabbed in 1994, subdivided into four parcels and allocated to three companies, NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri said. In August a public inquiry in Mombasa was told that 55 more subdivisions were made. Grabbers reclaimed the sea, obtained title deeds and put up multi-million-shilling business structures, the NLC said. President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered the title deeds be revoked and land handed over to county government. Yesterday, NLC director of communication Khalid Salim said the team won’t deliver as promised. “By next week we will tell you when the report will be out.” Salim said NLC secretariat has retreated to finalise the report.
