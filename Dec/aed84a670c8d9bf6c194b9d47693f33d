Police said the suspects were found with a vehicle stolen and electronics stolen from the deceased. The body of the businessman George Gachibi was found lying in a pool of blood on Tuesday at 9am by his employees who had gone to check on him at his house after he failed to answer to their calls and had not reported at his business.
