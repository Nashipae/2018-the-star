Self-proclaimed NRMKe General Miguna Miguna has welcomed the Sh7 million award by High Court for state violation of his rights. On Friday, Justice Chacha Mwita said the deportation of the embattled lawyer to Canada remains a fundamental violation of his birthright. He said the actions by Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i and the other state officials amounted to an abuse of office. The judge said that "taxpayers should not shoulder costs of violations by overzealous state officers." In order to deter future violations, the court ruled that Matiangi and Immigration Principal Secretary Gordon Kihalangwa should personally pay the damages and costs. Miguna said on his Twitter handle he is still Kenyan and has never lost his citizenship. "Justice Chacha Mwita has restated what I've maintained throughout. That the despots violated my fundamental rights, freedom and dignity and that I'm a Kenyan and never lost my citizenship," he said. The court also ordered the state to return Miguna's passport since it was unlawfully confiscated. Miguna was awarded a further Sh207,000 for his damaged house. Mwita said the damages issued to Miguna will act as a deterrent to similar violations of the law.
