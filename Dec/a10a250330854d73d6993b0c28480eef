Early one morning as we approached the quarry dam between No 7 & No 8, suddenly a black-backed jackal appeared on the road. The jackal was quite calm and trotted down the road in front of our vehicle. Every now and then the jackal would stop and listen and then search the bushes around the road. After a while, the jackal turned sharply to the right and trotted down the track towards the rear of the dry quarry dam. Then the jackal froze in the middle of the track, and after a few seconds, leapt high as it jumped headfirst into a clump of small bushes. After a short scuffle, the jackal leapt backwards, as if something bit it. The jackal stood for a brief moment, as it was seemingly thinking about the next move. Suddenly the jackal lunged forward and emerged from the shrubs with something small wriggling in its mouth. The tiny creature at first looked like a rodent, but it was actually a shrew. Shrews are not timid creatures, especially when threatened. So effectively, the jackal needed to be shrewd about what to do with this shrew. The jackal decided to bite less and rather use its body weight to jump onto the tiny shrew in an attempt to stun it. This tactic worked, and as soon as the shrew was stunned, the jackal went in for the kill with its fangs, and ended the shrewâ€™s life. Black-backed jackals are not often seen in the park. They are opportunistic in nature and eat carrion or even hunt small insects, birds and mammals. There is always something interesting or fascinating to see when looking at the wonderful creations of God, so why not spend some restful time in the park?
