Singer Jerry Ogallo is back with a new track called Dereva, which is one of his favourite songs "because we recorded it on my birthday (April 12)". "'Dereva' is a bedroom, honeymoon-inspired song, so wapendanao wanaelewa what I mean," he told Word Is. Jerry's career began with live performances in 2012, and he has spent the past four years developing his sound and infusing a distinct new-age rhumba delivery. "I knew I could sing back in secondary school (Kamukunji) in 2010, during my final year at the school's talent showcase. Then got into it professionally in 2012, when I was signed to Flag42," he said. Jerry featured Gudi Gudi super producer Jegede, and he "can't wait to work on another project with him". He said pushing his music is his greatest challenge in the industry.
