The government will engage teachers on the 1.5 per cent tax for the Big Four Housing fund and reach an amicable solution, Deputy President William Ruto has said. He spoke during the Kuppet annual delegates conference in Nairobi on Saturday. The DP was responding to the Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) secretary general Akello Misori’s call for a relook into the new housing tax. Misori said teachers were apprehensive about the new development, saying the 1.5 per cent tax would hurt them. “We feel that we would do with mortgage for professionals like us,” he said. Ruto said the push for affordable housing aims to improve the living standards of every Kenyan. He said the government will continue pushing for the implementation of the Big Four agenda. The Deputy President said the government will engage honestly and diligently and hoped the same will be reciprocated with good faith and a willingness to compromise. “That way, we will be able to find solutions to issues facing us,” Ruto said.
