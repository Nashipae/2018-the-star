There was drama at the Mpeketoni hospital mortuary yesterday after a family discovered that the body of their kin was missing from the facility. The family of the Deasi Wanjira, 92, had arrived at the morgue with a coffin ready to take their loved one home for burial when they were told that the body had been mistakenly collected by another family and ferried to Kinangop to be buried. The family turned violent as they cried and vented their anger at the morgue attendants demanding to be given Wanjira’s body. It took several hours for the hospital’s management to restrain the family memberÃŸs. They only agreed to return home after they were convinced that the other family was contacted and plans had been made to return the body to the hospital. The other family eventually returned Wanjira’s body to the rightful owners and collected their own kin. One of the attendant said such a situation had never happened.
