A modern mortuary will be built at Msambweni Referral Hospital, Kwale governor Salim Mvurya said yesterday. At the same time the governor ordered called that the hospital to be investigated following complaints of poor services at the health facility. The hospital is in a deplorable state with bodies rotting due an outdated and inefficient refrigerator. Mvurya blamed lazy and corrupt workers for the poor state of affairs at the hospital. “A new mortuary will be built to replace the old one which has been faulty most of the time,” he said, noting that the hospital ought to offer better services since the county and national government had allocated more resources after its elevation to referral status in 2016. “We have spent so much money in a bid to improve services at this institution but services still leave a lot to be desired. The probe will help us put things right,” he said. Mvurya, who visited the hospital, said efforts to improve healthcare were hampered by sloppy work by staff. He accused the workers of hoarding drugs, charging for blood transfusion and arrogance. He said the county will stop funding more health infrastructural projects and instead focus on human resource management and development. Residents often complain of poor mortuary services at the only mortuary in the sub-county. The other is at Kwale Hospital, which has been idle for four years since its completion after residents opposed its construction. Most residents are Muslims who do not take bodies to the mortuary as they bury their relatives hours after they die. In 2014, residents protested against the opening of the mortuary and a crematorium a Ukunda by a private developer. They said said it was unhealthy to have a mortuary in a residential area.
