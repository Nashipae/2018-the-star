Wazito lead the log in the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) National Super League after the third round of matches. Wazito, who were relegated from the SportPesa Premier League last season, leads the 20-team log with nine points same as Shabana. However, the Kisii-based Glamour Boys have an inferior goal difference. The two former top tier sides are the only teams with a 100 per cent record in the league and will meet on January 5 at Gusii Stadium. Shabana, parading an array of former top tier league players, had identical 1-0 win against Nairobi City Stars and St. Joseph’s Youth before edging Kangemi All Stars 2-1 at Camp Toyoyo on Friday to maintain their dream start to the season. Ushuru are third with seven points— one ahead of newly promoted Eldoret Youth, who are fourth on six points. Pace setters Talanta dropped to fifth place after suffering their first defeat of the season, going down 2-0 against Francis Oduor’s Kisumu All Stars. Former top tier league side Nairobi City Stars remain rooted at the bottom without a point. Modern Coast Rangers, Kibera Black Stars, Migori Youth, Bidco and St. Joseph’s Youth are yet to test a win in the league so far.
