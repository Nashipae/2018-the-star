He said the move will ensure that operations continue without interference for purpose of ensuring security of supply of petroleum products. The KPC managers' arrests started last night after the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji approved various charges against them. The Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti then ordered his officers to round up all those to be charged. Sang submitted a letter to the KPC board on Wednesday indicating that he would not be seeking a new term as managing director next year.
