One of the top girls in Northeastern from this year’s KCSE exams says she wants to pursue medicine. Speaking to the Star on Friday, an elated Katra Ali said her career choice was inspired by the high number of women in Northeastern and other rural areas who lack proper medical attention. She said wants to help reverse that situation. Ali scored an A- with a mean grade of 75 points. Ali, who sat her KCSE exam at Umu Salama Girls Secondary School, was accompanied by both her parents and former school principal Adow Aden at the school where they celebrated her performance. Ali said the notion that girls from the region can’t perform well in the national examinations is ridiculous, adding they only lack the opportunity to realise their dreams. “I expected to perform well since I worked hard and prayed to God. I thank my parents and teachers who have greatly encouraged me to excel in my studies,” she said. The shy but fluent girl advised other girls to work hard and remain focused on their goals in life, adding that her aspirations are to help others. Her former school principal said Ali had never been punished forof indiscipline or any other grounds during her four years at secondary school. Aden said they expected the girl to perform well since she has been leading in her class all through the years. He said this was also because of her being closely monitored.
