Businessman Jimi Wanjigi has told Kenyans to give birth to many children to make the nation great. In a video doing rounds on social media, he said the country has enough resources to take care of children. "Over the years Wazungus have told us about family planning, don't make many children, everybody two-two, you don't have the money, land or food. It is fake," Wanjigi said. Wanjigi cited countries like China, India, Ethiopia and Nigeria that have large populations yet they are developed." "China is great because of numbers. Don't let anyone lie to you," he said. "Let us make babies in the family unit, if, unfortunately, we do not succeed, we do it elsewhere. These children are our power today. We want many children in this republic," he said. The United Nations Development Programme puts China's population at over 1.3 billion and India's 1.2 billion. Ethiopia stands at 92.2 million and Nigeria 170 million. The tycoon said Kenya's population is not enough and there was an urgency to produce as many kids as possible. The 2009 census indicated that Kenya has a population of 40 million, but the latest statics by the UN states that it stands at 48 million. Click here for the latest political news
