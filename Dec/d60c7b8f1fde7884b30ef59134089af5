The Kenya Tea Development Agency is considering replacing wood with furnace oil to fire its steam boilers. KTDA chairman Peter Kanyago said the agency is looking for alternatives like furnace oil although it will be more expensive. This is because the government extended the ban on logging in public forests by one year with effect from November 24, worried bythe declining forest cover. The ban has been in force since February this year. Kanyago admitted that KTDA is suffering following the extension of the ban. “We are supporting the ban because we are aware of the environmental effects and we must support that,” he said. He said KTDA is however happy that the government has allowed those with their own fuel wood to use it. The factories are getting the supply from the local catchment and individual farms, he said. Most tea factories in Kenya rely on wood-fired steam boilers during tea processing. Environment Cabinet Secretary Keriako Tobiko said the pace of implementation of the ban has been hampered by inadequate institutional capacity and budgetary resource allocation. He said they had proposed a Sh18 billion budget to tackle the challenges of deforestation in the next five years. The CS attributed water shortage experienced in the country to deforestation, encroachment, and degradation of water catchment areas and riparian land. He said the extension of the logging ban will aid in the restoration and rehabilitation of the critical water catchments. “The extension will allow for the replanting of 76,603 acres with indigenous trees,” he said.
