10-man Gor Mahia returned to winning ways as the champions swept aside Zoo Kericho 4-0 in their second match of the new Kenyan Premier League (KPL) season at Moi Satdium, Kasarani yesterday . In a bid to get past their opening day defeat to Bandari, newly appointed coach Hassan Oktay fielded a strong side despite having a CAF Champions League first round clash against visiting Nigerian side Lodi Stars, who are already in town. Oktay handed former Kariobangi Sharks defender Pascal Ogweno his debut as he looked to seal the loopholes that saw them start their title defence on the wrong footing. Any chance zoo had of keeping Kâ€™Ogalo at bay evaporated inside the first minute of the match as Ephraim Guikan put the defending champions ahead. The Ivorian was on hand to score his second goal in the 16th minute when he calmly converted from the spot after Samuel Onyango was brought down in the penalty area. Gor Mahia were comfortable throughout the half and continued to bombard the visitors goal and their efforts paid off just before the half time break as Onyango made it 3-0. The second half resumed in similar fashion as new signing Erisa Ssekisambu found the Zoo FC backline napping and slotted in the fourth and final goal of the match in the 71st minute. There was drama towards the end of the game as Gor Mahia star midfielder Francis Kahata was sent off following an altercation with an opponent. The victory sent the champions to second on the table standings top spot virtue of goal difference at least until the weekend fixtures are played while Zoo continue to languish at the bottom of the pile with no point after two games.
