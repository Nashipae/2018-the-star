With only a year and a half before full rebrand of top tier lender Barclays Africa to Absa Group, several efforts are already underway in the Kenyan lender to complete the move. “We are introducing the brand through a series of campaigns, starting with credentials, then going on to thematic campaigns,” said Moses Muthui, head of strategy at the bank. The relationship between the Africa lender Absa and Barclays London will remain at minimal, with London holding 14.9 per cent. Barclays sold a significant stake in Barclays Africa Group to South African Absa, setting the stage for a rebrand after change of name to Absa Group was completed in July this year. The British bank first announced in March 2016 that it would sell most of its then 62 per cent stake in Barclays Africa over two to three years, as the bank refocused its strategy on the United States and Britain. The bank did not disclose the amounts being spent on systems upgrade but there will be better speed and agility on their internet platforms, card services and the overall user experience. The autonomy expected with the rebrand includes ability to take up more risk including introducing new products and services to the Kenyan market. In March, the Timiza app was introduced to the local market, posting impressive positive growth. Timiza has recorded 2.7 million customers downloading and interacting on the platform in nine months since launch. Muthui said the app processes up to 6,000 loan applications daily compared to a similar number per month before the app. “It is actually a stand-alone bank unlike what other mobile lenders are offering the market,” he said. The app is the only one that offers life insurance of up to Sh50,000 where the customer will only pay Sh42 per month in premiums. Barclays is the first lender globally to incorporate Whatsapp messaging and Facebook chat to reach all its customers.
