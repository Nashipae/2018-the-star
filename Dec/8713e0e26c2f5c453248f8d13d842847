Two people have died and three others injured in a road accident at Kapiti area along the Nairobi-Mombasa road. The two died on the spot in the collision that involved two vehicles, a trailer and lorry few metres from Mwambi Hills at 10.30pm on Monday night. Athi River police boss Sharma Wario said the trailer was headed to Mombasa when it engaged into a head-on collision with a lorry that was moving the opposite direction. “The Mombasa bound trailer was trying to overtake a fleet of vehicles when he collided with an oncoming lorry,” said Wario. Wario spoke to the Star in his office on Tuesday. He said three others sustained serious injuries and were rushed to Machakos Level 5 Hospital while the bodies were moved to the mortuary. Wreckage towed to Kyumbi police station pending inspection. “Any time an accident occurs, we tell our people to be cautious on the road but our appeal falls on deaf ears since the accidents keep recurring. Obey traffic rules, police do not drive your vehicles but you do,” Wario said. He said the incident happened a few metres from the scene of an accident where five people died on the spot last week. “Last week we lost a rider in Athi River because he was overtaking. The same week, we lost five people near the same scene of the Monday night’s accident,” added Wario.
