Songa By Safaricom launched the exciting Songa Na Mili competition a month ago and today, they awarded their second winner. CJay Martin was the lucky winner after participating in the Songa Na Mili competition a couple of times, and he finally walked away with Sh65,000. The song that made CJay Martin a few thousands richer was Kipepeo by Jaguar. He is a frequent Songa user and so when he heard the challenge on Classic 105, he jumped on the opportunity. “I heard about the competition on radio when listening to Maina and Kingangi in the morning on Classic 105," he said. Winning the money has come at the best time because CJay just finished school, and the money will help him start a business. "Nataka kufungua shop ya PS mtaani, at least hiyo iniskume skume since nimetoka shule juzi," he said. One thing CJay stated is that he loves the Songa By Safaricom app because he feels like he has his own mixtape on his phone. Diamond, who is big on the Songa app, is his favorite artiste on the app, but CJay also sums up as a Dancehall and hip hop lover. Brian Chege, Songa By Safaricom head of content and A&R, promised the Songa fans that they should expect a lot from the app during this festive season. Brian confirmed that there will be more competitions coming up on the different platforms, so Songa fans should expect a lot.
