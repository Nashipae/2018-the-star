Kanu nominated senator Abshiro Halake and party officials have been angered by a court ruling over the former ruling party involvement in a land grabbing case in Isiolo town. Halake said the party would in the next seven days appeal against a court ruling that dismissed representation of the party in the case by new advocates adding that she suspected foul play. She said that party members were dismayed when the court, in its Friday’s ruling, claimed it was not notified of the change of advocates and dismissed them on grounds that they were not properly on record. The senator disclosed that Kanu filed an application seeking to be granted leave to change advocates on May 15. The application was filed in court with notice of change of advocates where documents were assessed and requisite court fees paid on May 16 at the Isiolo High Court. Halake said the matter had come up in court in the said application six times, being four hearings and two mentions where the issue of representation never came up. "In fact in his ruling, the magistrate has not dealt with the merits of the applications and the main issues canvassed by the parties,” the senator said. Former Kanu Isiolo branch chairman Abdulahi Halkano and the current party secretary Jarso Huka called for justice in the land grabbing case which started in 2012.
