Former Nominated Senator Joy Gwendo has been released by the High Court on a Sh400,000 cash bail. Lady justice Grace Ngenye granted Gwendo bail after she sought a revision of her sentence. The ex-senator was sentenced to two years in jail by Anti-corruption court chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti last Friday. She was not given an option of a fine or a right to appeal for failing to pay Sh2.2 million belonging to a sacco. It takes a judicial review for the ruling of the magistrates' court to be overturned. The judge made the ruling after Gwendo failed to honour a plea bargain pact she entered with the State to pay the money to the complainant. This was after she admitted that on October 23, 2016, at Chiga parish in Kisumu, she used her position as a State officer to confer herself Sh2,226,880, money which belonged to the Sacco. Gwendo had pleaded guilty to charges of forgery, issuing a bad cheque and abuse of office and agreed to repay during the pre-plea pact that helped her evade being charged.
