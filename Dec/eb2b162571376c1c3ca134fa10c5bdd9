David Alliwah and his Vioja Mahakamani counterparts are still in shock after the show was robbed of their Judge Jamal Nassul. Jamal died after his nine-month girlfriend Grace Namu stabbed him in Mlolongo, Machakos, last week. Alliwah, who plays the role of a prosecutor in the show, told Word Is yesterday Jamal saw his death coming. "After the last segment, Jamal said a very long prayer for us, which was unlike him. I asked the audience to stand up and requested Jamal because he was Muslim. He prayed so passionately and even blessed the dead. He then told me to make sure we keep in contact." Adding: "I have worked with him since 2016 and our friendship was very close, more like a brother to me. We created a team together because my role and his role were similar. Although we had to appear as judge and prosecutor, we had good unity." Alliwah also recounted a day Jamal came to looking agitated. "Last week during our last shoot, Jamal was very disturbed. I remember his phone was cracked and he told me it was a quarrel with his 'wife' because someone had called Jamal at night, so she smashed the phone. I was so close to him and everything that happened in his life," he said. Namu, the suspect in the murder, was arrested on Wednesday last week. "She was not a side chick. Jamal had introduced her to many of us and we knew she was his wife. It was not someone who was intruding in his life," Alliwah said. Fellow actor Julius Masaai, alias Ole Tipis, said: "We have something called blend in the show, and I have blended well with Jamal; he was like a brother. We could fight and laugh. I could feel bad and hit him but then we would laugh. The show has lost the driver." King Kaka, who also features in the programme, said Jamal was a happy person and he will be missed. "We shared a lot with him and Jamal was always happy for the one year we worked together," Kaka said. Jamal was the nephew of veteran radio presenter Leonard Mambo Mbotela, who broke the news of his death.
