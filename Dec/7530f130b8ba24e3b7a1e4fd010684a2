At least 8,000 Luhya boys who underwent the cut in Western will take part in ceremonies on Wednesday to tell them how to think and act like real men. The ceremony, known as khukhwalukha, will involve boys. now technically men, from Bukusu, Tachoni, Kabras and Banyala, who underwent cultural and hospital circumcision. The boys have already prepared tree branches and maize stalks to light outside their houses on Tuesday night. During the lighting of the fire, which will keep them warm till around 5am on Wednesday, they will also burn the bedding they have been using since the cut. Bukusu cultural chairman Peter Masinde said the bedding is destroyed as a sign of that a new chapter of life is beginning. They receive new bedding. “Not only is the bedding destroyed but we also have taught the boys to donate their clothes to their young ones because they will wear new clothes after this last ceremony,” Masinde said. After 5am, the boys will be escorted by relatives and friends to a river to take a bath and receive new clothes. They will then be taken home and fed. Before eating the boys will be given hot cooked bananas, with which they will beat each other. This marks one last childhood game. “This takes three minutes and should not be repeated in their lifetime. After that the food is served, followed by the elders’ advice,” the chairman said. They are told, “The door that is closed is someone else’s, while the one that is open is yours.” This means one is not allowed to have sex with another person’s wife — but other women are fair game. This advise is known as khubita, and afterwards they will have graduated to adulthood. They are referred to as batembete and are not allowed to meet those who are undergoing circumcision until they graduate too. Circumcision commenced on August 1, starting with the sons of the circumcisers.
