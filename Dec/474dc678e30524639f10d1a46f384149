Police in Tana River kicked and punched a pregnant woman and left her bleeding during a search operation to find abducted Italian aid worker Silvia Romano. Romano was taken by four men on November 20 and is yet to be traced. The expectant mother, Halima Mohamed, is unable to walk and experiences stomach pains. She is six months pregnant. Mohamed was stepped on and squeezed inside the police Land Cruiser upon arrest. A one-year-old boy, Mahmoud Hassan, was pushed and hit his head on the tarmac when his mother, Fatuma Mariam, was being arrested. He sustained nose bruises. A young man is nursing a fractured limb. The ordeal occurred on the night of December 15. Ninety-seven persons - 53 men and 44 women - were arrested in connection with Romano abduction. The operation targeted Chira, Assa and Bilisa in Garsen constituency. The suspects were kept in the cold and rained on. They were released a day later and ordered to report to DCIO offices when called. Their IDs were confiscated. Five people from the group are still at Malindi police station. They are Dahir Bile, Hassan Robe, Hassan Shongolo, Mohamed Hassan and Dakane Osman. The victims of police brutality spoke to the Star on Tuesday and yesterday when rights group Muslims for Human Rights (Muhuri) conducted a fact-finding mission. Adam Gure, 76, said: “Police wanted us to bring out the Italian. We told them we don’t know where she is.” Muhuri Tana River field officer Ogle Abdi said one of the three communities in the area has been profiled as criminal. “This is a recipe for massacre as witnessed in 1984 in Wagalla,” he said. Muhuri rapid response officer Francis Auma and project assistant Fredrick Okado condemned the attack. “We have not seen such high-level rescue mission involving even an helicopter when a Kenyan is abducted. Kenyans are treated as lesser citizens and this is wrong,” he said.
