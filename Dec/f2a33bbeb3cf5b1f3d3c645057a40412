Uhuru said currently, green energy which included geothermal, solar, wind and hydro, contributes to 90 per cent of electricity pumped to the national grid. The Coast region has already received 100MW of geothermal power in a move aimed at stopping the use of thermal power which is expensive and harmful to the environment.
