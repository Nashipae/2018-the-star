Meru governor Kiraitu Murungi has proposed that elected leaders should sit down, dialogue and elect the President and the Deputy President. Kiraitu said if leaders elect the President and the DP, Kenyan voters will never turn against each other in tribal and ethnic clashes every general election. The governor spoke on Thursday at Meru Teachers’ College during the close of Kenya Music and Cultural festival. “The problem has been that presidential elections are always predetermined by the ethnic pattern of voting in the country. If you put Raila Odinga and Uhuru Kenyatta on the ballot, Atieno will vote for Raila while Wanjiku has to vote for Uhuru. This is the main cause of division among our people,” Kiraitu said. On Wednesday when he presented his submissions to the Building Bridges Initiative task force, Kiraitu told the team to address the political question fully. He said the country needs to find a lasting solution by tackling the contention around the structure of the executive to ensure it wholly reflects the ethnic and tribal characteristics of the country. Kiraitu said if this formula is adopted in Kenya, the resources would reach the mwananchi.
