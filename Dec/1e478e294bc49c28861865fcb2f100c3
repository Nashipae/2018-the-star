The government saved more than 91,428 acres of forest land in the Mau water tower from grabbers and encroachers in two years, Water PS Joseph Irungu said yesterday. He said the government’s effort to reclaim the water catchment giant was achieved in the broader conservation drive when settlers were driven out of the forest. Irungu said the government also protected more than 494,210 acres of the Mau Forest Complex. “The efforts to conserve the water towers have not only targeted at the Mau complex, but other forests across the country,” he said. The PS spoke during the medium term expenditure framework budget public hearing forum at the KICC. Irungu said the state also managed to rehabilitate 370 acres of water towers. They are Taita, Ngong and Enoosupukia catchment areas, he said. “We also managed to map three water towers – Mount Elgon, Arabuko Sokoke and Cherengany Hills,” the PS said. There has been efforts by the government to evict forest dwellers from Mau since 2005, but controversy has always marred the success of such endeavours. This year the government set up a multi-agency team, including more than 200 security personnel, to reclaim the forest land. Narok county commissioner George Natembeya who became the face of the latest evictions in July, said the state decided to remove the more than 300 families from the forest and have the catchment permanently sealed from human settlement. The government aims to achieve a 10 per cent forest coverage by 2022. The UN classifies Kenya as a chronically water scarce country on the basis of having one of the lowest natural water replenishment rates, at 647 metres cubed per capita per annum. This is far below the expected 1,000 metres cubed per capita per annum.
