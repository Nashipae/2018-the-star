The whereabouts of an Administration Police officer linked to the killing of David ‘crocodile man’ Owino in Baringo on October 6, remains unclear following conflicting reports over his transfer. AP officer Bosco Omboko is alleged to be among those involved in the killing of Owino, a Lake Baringo tour guide. “On Monday, a police vehicle arrived at the AP camp and we watched Omboko pack his belongings and leave,” Dennis Kiptoo, a resident told the Star yesterday. The residents said the AP officer was taken to the nearby Kiserian camp in Baringo South subcounty. However, county AP commander Robinson Ndiwa denied any knowledge of the officer’s transfer, saying maybe it was ordered by his counterpart in Baringo North. “If he did that then it is all right because he is also mandated to do so. But from my side, I deny the claims that my officers aided the killing of Owino. None of my officers laid a hand on him,” he said. Ndiwa said Owino was drunk when he was brought to the camp by Akoroyan assistant chief Moses Chebii but later died. Click here for the latest political news
