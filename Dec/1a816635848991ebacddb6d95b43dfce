Ijara Technical Training Institute on Tuesday received air conditioning and refrigeration equipment worth Sh130 million ahead of its expected opening next month. Technical Education deputy director Samwel Kemboi said the equipment was bought under the Kenya-China Technical Vocational Education and Training Institutions (TVET) programme. Kemboi said under the programme 134 technical institutions in the country will receive the equipment. He said already 90 of them have received the equipment. Kemboi appealed to communities where the institutions are based to enroll their children and make good use of the huge investments by the government. He said under the TVET reform programme is a motivation that will drive the Big Four agenda of the Jubilee government. “We are going to equip each of them with modern state of the art equipment that is required for training,” Kemboi said. TVET education is funded just like the public universities where students will apply for funding through the Higher Education Loans Board (HELB). While thanking the Kenyan and Chinese governments for the donation area MP Sophia Abdinoor said the community will put the equipment donated into proper use. Sophia said the equipment will help the youth to acquire necessary skills and make them competitive in the job market. The legislator appealed to the youth to enroll at the institutions adding that the government will guarantee their safety.
