TV presenter Jacque Maribe is back to work but is yet to be assigned roles, Royal Media Services innovations director Linus Kaikai has said. "She just came in and she first needs to settle in. We will decide internally on what she will be doing but she remains an employee of Citizen TV," Linus told Word Is. A close source had earlier on whispered to Word Is that she will be a news editor, who will compile and arrange stories that will run on air. “I am told she was back to work on Monday and will essentially hold her old responsibilities minus going on air. "So, in essence, she is a news editor who will compile and arrange stories that will run on air,” our source said. Jacque's bail terms barred her from presenting or conducting interviews on matters related to her murder case.
