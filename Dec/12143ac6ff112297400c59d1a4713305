The Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission is probing alleged irregular funding of foreign trips by Nyamira MCAs. The anti-graft body is also investigating Sh379 million tender for the construction of a modern assembly block. The court last week ordered the assembly clerk to issue certified copies of documents, records and registers including procurement plan and budget of the building, tender advertisement, quotation documents for all binders, names of the tender opening committee, tender opening register and tender evaluation register. The county is on the spot over the controversial block which is currently under construction. Other key documents that are required to be availed include; priced bill of quantity, engineer’s assessment, tender award and regret to the binders. Others are requisition for meetings outside the county as from January 1st to date, payment vouchers in respect to all meetings held outside the county, copy of payroll for the period from January 2018 to date in respect of members of the county assembly, copies of SRC circular dated October 2017, list of house committees designation and membership and payroll of all county assembly staff from January 2018 to date.
