Companies seeking Nandi county tenders will have to be vetted to prevent fraud, Governor Stephen Sang has said. He said on Monday that unscrupulous able-bodied individuals have registered companies indicating they belong to persons living with disability, women and youths so they can get reserved tenders. Some have won supplies and construction contracts yet they do not belong to the three categories, Sang said. He said he will blacklist such firms for depriving special groups of their share of tenders and have them prosecuted. “I’ve ordered that all companies seeking to do business with my government be vetted first and the right groups identified. Very soon, you’ll be hearing them running up and down,” Sang said in Kapsabet during a ceremony to mark the International Day of People with Disability. The county boss said the disabled have suffered for many years because they are denied opportunities that would enable them to exploit their potentials. Racketeers make a killing at their expense, he said. “We’ll ensure they are made to repay what they have taken away from the special groups,” Sang said. He distributed wheelchairs and other PWD-support equipment worth Sh5 million. The county will consider the disabled for jobs and training so they become self-reliant. “In the next financial year, we’ll push for more funds to support the completion of a commercial building that stalled over 40 years for PWD in Mosoriot,” Sang said.
