President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the Universal Health Care pilot programme for Kisumu, Isiolo, Machakos and Nyeri on Thursday This is a welcome move which should be supported by all, considering that many Kenyans are too poor to afford quality medicare. During the launch, President Kenyatta said all services will be free in all county health facilities. The President also outlined a package of eight essential health benefits. But are these the only services that will be free? There is confusion that needs to be cleared. The Ministry of Health has previously insisted UHC is not equal to free health services because someone must pay for it — the end user or the government. However, the government appears to have settled for a tax-based system, where it pays for services, rather than an insurance model, where end users pool money through institutions such as the NHIF. Is the tax-based model sustainable? We hope this model can be studied carefully during the pilot period and if it’s not viable, be replaced with an insurance model, which was already working well. With UHC, demand for health services will increase. Some estimates show the number of people flocking to hospitals for free services will rise by 50 per cent. That is why the government must speedily clarify what is free and what is not. Residents of the four counties must also be encouraged to continue paying their NHIF premiums.
