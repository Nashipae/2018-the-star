Baringo senator Gideon Moi has said the March 9 handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga was the topmost achievement for the nation in 2018. In his New Year wishes to Kenyans, Gideon said it is worthwhile as we come to the close of 2018 to reflect on the things that shaped us as a country. "The handshake changed the landscape of the country, as the two leaders taught us that as citizens of this great nation, selflessness triumphs over selfishness and personal ambitions," he said. The two leaders decided to throw behind their political antagonism and shook hands to symbolise unity and readiness to work together in moving the nation forward. Gideon, the son of retired President Daniel arap Moi, said it was a defining year for the country in two fronts - the unity of the country and the fight against corruption. He said the handshake was a momentous opportunity for the country "as it set the nation on the trajectory of national healing, reconciliation".

He said leaders should seize the goodwill and support by Kenyans and ensure the country feels the impact of the full realisation of fruits of the handshake. This includes the continued fight against corruption by ensuring those tasked with public resources maintain fiscal discipline, stop wastage and pilferage of public funds. "We should also not forget the challenges the Kenyan farmer faced this year by putting in place policies that will make his sweat in the blistering sun count," the Senator said. He asked Kenyans and leaders to work together this coming year so as to restore the sense of nationhood in our motherhood. Gideon wished all Kenyans a happy New Year.
