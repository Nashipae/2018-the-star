ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi on Sunday toured North Rift region and asked the Kalenjin community to back him in 2022 Presidential race. He attended two church events where and said he is in the race to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta. "I and my Luhya community stood behind retired President Daniel Moi. The Kalenjin community should thus back my bid as a way of returning the favour," Musalia said. Mudavadi was speaking at Nyaru trading centre where he presided over a funds drive in aid of Full Gospel Church of Kenya in Elgeyo Marakwet. The ANC leader and his entourage surprised worshippers at AIC Sitotwo in the same county where they arrived unannounced and participated in another fundraising for the church choir. "As we were flying past this area we saw tents and knew some good Kenyans should be praising God here. We decided to come and join you people," said Mudavadi.
