Tharaka Nithi governor Muthomi Njuki has applauded the Commission for Revenue Allocation for the new formula of allocating money to counties. Speaking while launching projects in the county, he said the CRA made the right decision to allocate cash based on counties' population. "We welcome the allocation of money to the counties according to the number of people and not the size," Njuki said. The Governor said the old formula was a headache because it was based on the last census done in 2009. CRA chairperson Jane Kiringai said the parameters that are taken into account include devolved functions such as health, agriculture, early education and technical training. Previously, a countyâ€™s population and poverty levels determined how much it was allocated every financial year. Njuki commissioned roads and new modern market stalls at Chogoria town that replaced structures that had been built haphazardly alongside the road. Residents are happy with the new look of the town.
