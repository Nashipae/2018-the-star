The Nairobi government has said it will continue to demolish buildings on public and riparian land. Julius Wanjau, who heads the county’s multi-agency team carrying out the demolitions, said marked buildings in Kileleshwa will be brought down. Speaking on Thursday, he said owners of the buildings have received notices from the National Environment Management Authority. “We are coming for all those who have built on public and riparian land. Be prepared,” Wanjau said During Jamhuri Day celebrations on Wednesday, Governor Mike Sonko asked developers who have put up buildings on riparian land to approach City Hall before the county demolishes their property. He asked them to produce a plan of how they will demolish the structures at their own cost.
