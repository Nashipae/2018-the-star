Shock has engulfed Githima village near Kiserian town in Kajiado County after a boy,17, allegedly abducted, defiled and killed a minor before dismembering her body. Police are investigating the killing of Angela Wambui, 6, of Green Garden Academy. Ngong police said Wambui’s body parts were recovered in Githima village stuffed in a gunny bag, some two kilometres away from her home. The police said the boy is suspected to have committed the offence on Friday. The suspect was arrested by members of public when he turned up at his home on Saturday afternoon before being handed over to Kiserian police station. A senior superintendent of police in Ngong who sought anonymity, confirmed the boy was booked in at Kiserian Police station before being taken to hospital. Members of the public allegedly beat the boy senseless when he showed up at his home. “I can confirm the suspect is in our custody and we have taken him to hospital for treatment and later he will be examined following the defilement allegations” said the senior police official. Resident Esther Mumbi said the suspect could have been under the influence of drugs. Mumbi, who spoke to The Star on the phone, said the village is shocked by what happened since the suspect has history of being violent. “What he has allegedly done has never been heard before and the entire village is wondering what bedeviled the boy. This is not normal for a boy his age to do," Mumbi said.
