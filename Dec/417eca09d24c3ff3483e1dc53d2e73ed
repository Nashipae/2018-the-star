Coast youths should learn proper English to benefit from the blue economy, two principal secretaries and maritime experts have said. Maritime and Shipping Affairs PS Nancy Karigithu and her Vocational and Technical Training counterpart Kevit Desai on Friday said many youths miss out on opportunities in the maritime sector because they cannot express themselves well in English. “The other day in Mombasa, we saw highly skilled youth who could not express themselves in English failing interviews. We need to learn proper English and not WhatsApp English,” she said. International Transport Federation inspector Betty Makena said lack of basic computer skills is also disadvantaging the youth. “It was embarrassing to see youths answer only two questions out of 50 because they couldn’t operate a computer. A whole maritime engineer could not open an email,” she said.
