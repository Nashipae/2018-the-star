After a barren draw with Mathare United in their last match, all of Ulinzi Stars’ energies will be directed at bagging three points when Sofapaka come calling in the fourth match of the season, the second at home, tomorrow and new boy, Ezekiel Okare hopes the team ends the year on a high. In the first home game, as Ulinzi Stars welcomed KCB, Okare got his first goal for the club and also grabbed an assist and he hopes he can play a crucial role again when his immediate former employers tour Afraha Stadium. He says training has been fine so far but noted that they need to carry the right focus to the clash and having played for the visitors in the last two years, he will know one or two buttons to press when presented with a chance. “We are confident ahead of the game; we have trained well so far and we still have a few paces to take but the most important thing is the focus we take to the game. In the last home game, I managed to get my first goal of the season and I hope the same rubs in when Sofapaka visits,” Okare said on the clubs official site. “I played for them and it will be special to face them. Having been there earlier is enough motivation for me.” A few things have changed at Sofapaka from the last time Okare was at the club but he still admits they are a tough side to face. Nonetheless, he is confident the Ulinzi Stars strategy for the game will work out. “They have a new coach but I think they are still the formidable side I left. We know how they play and we will devise our strategy well towards that. At the end of it, we hope to pick three points,” he added.
