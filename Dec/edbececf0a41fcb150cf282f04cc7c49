The government will not import police uniforms from any other country, Interior CS Fred Matiangi has said. This was after reports emerged that there was a general shortage for the specific fabric for the police uniform. "I have seen some comments that are very shameful! We have no problem providing our police with uniforms. Actually, we have paid for the new uniforms and they are being done," Matiangi said. Speaking in Nairobi on Tuesday, Matiang'i said he asked the PS Interior Karanja Kibicho who chairs the technical team on police reforms to look around for factories and textiles across the country. "What is happening here is that some people have put us under pressure that we should import police uniform... We will not import police uniform. We have to promote the local industry," he said. "This monkey business that has been happening in some corner should stop. It is outrageous for someone to say that we don't have materials in Kenya."

"Why would we revive Rivatex then we proceed like fools to import the uniforms? We have no problem providing our police officers with uniforms," he said. According to the Standard newspaper, the materials NYS are using to make the new uniforms were sourced from another country. In September, President Uhuru Kenyatta unveiled new uniforms for police officers which he said will enhance visibility of the officers.
