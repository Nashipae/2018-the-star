Embu teachers and residents are split on whether sex education should be introduced in schools. Kithinji Kiragu blamed parents for neglecting their children — a situation he said prompts their sons and daughters to start having sex at an early age. He wants sex and life education taught in schools. Kiragu owns a boys’ secondary school and a college. He said parents pretend to be too busy to teach their children life values, how to engage with the opposite gender and sex-related risks. He recalled that in the old days, adolescent girls would be taught morals by their grandmothers and boys by their grandfathers so they develop into virtuous members of society. Separately, Kenya National Union of Teachers Embu chairman Josphat Kathumi said having sex education in schools will burden teachers. He urged parents to take up their role and stop relegating it to teachers. Kathumi concurred that parents and guardians are to blame for the rise in teen pregnancies. Children are left on their own without guidance and they end up engaging in reckless sex, he said. He said children easily access and watch pornography on mobile phones and computers, then try it out and end up with problems. The unionist appealed to parents and guardians to impart good values to their children. He said teachers are already doing a lot of work. Parenthood requires men and women to spare time, despite their busy schedules, to be with their children and share with them values for proper, risk-free living, Kathumi advised. But Kiragu said only a mandatory school programme will help the country to fix the problem of unintended pregnancies and related risks of contracting disease. “The structure of training of children by their grandmothers and grandfathers is lacking today and thus adolescent girls and boys are left free to try new things,” he said.
