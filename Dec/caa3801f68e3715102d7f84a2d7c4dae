At least 101 people have died in road accidents since the 'Michuki rules' were reintroduced last month, the NTSA has said. The statistics are contained in the latest report by the National Transport and Safety Authority covering January to December 10. Pedestrians continue to top the list of deaths, with 1,117 having died since January, compared to 999 in the same period last year. There were 775 reported boda boda deaths, which is an increase from last year's 674. In the report, 682 passengers died, compared to last year's 650. NTSA said the number of drivers killed in accidents during the same period reduced to 285 compared to 290 last year. Nairobi leads in the number of road crashes nationwide and privately owned vehicles are linked to most of the accidents. Human error, recklessness, drunk-driving, speeding and non-compliance of traffic rules are to blame for road carnage. Another report released by the NTSA in August showed there are 273 blackspots countrywide. Out of this, 199 are in the Northern Corridor and 74 in Nairobi. Click here for the latest political news
