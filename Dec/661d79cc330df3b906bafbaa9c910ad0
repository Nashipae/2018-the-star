Nairobi Hospital chief executive Gordon Odundo has been sent on a three month leave to pave way for an audit over tendering processes at the facility. The hospital's board of management confirmed the decision in a statement on Saturday saying the leave, which became effective on Friday, includes his annual leave. "This will allow the completion of the ongoing forensic audit," the letter reads in part. "The board has taken the necessary measures to ensure that the functions of the hospital continue uninterrupted," the board said. A stand off reportedly ensured the hospital on Friday after Odundo allegedly locked himself inside his office way into the night to avoid being served with the leave letter. A lawyer sent to deliver the letter is said to have camped outside his office since midday but the CEO was yet to open his office by nightfall. Sources at the facility say the board's decision to send Odundo away is meant to pave way for an ongoing audit into multimillion insurance and construction tenders. A section of doctors are, however, said to be against the board's decision. The board assured patients that everything is under control. "We wish our patients, clients, consultants and other stakeholders that our management and staff are ensuring that our operations of the hospital are continuing in the usual expected standards," the board said.
