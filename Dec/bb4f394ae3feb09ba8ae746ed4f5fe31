Nyeri governor Mutahi Kahiga and his deputy Caroline Karugu (above)have dismissed claims that they were engaged in a physical fight. The two also denied reports that they have not been on good terms despite widespread eports of differences. Social media posts said Kahiga sustained injuries to his face after being attacked with a glass of water by Karugu. The posts’ author however did not give date of the alleged attack. “DG Wanjiru Karugu threw a glass of water at Hovernor Mutahi Kahiga which hit him and opened a cut under his eye,” the post said. But the governor who was from a Cabinet meeting said he was shocked by the information after the media went to his office to seek a comment from him and his deputy. There were also earlier reports that the deputy governor had resigned, which the two also dismissed. The governor said it was unfortunate that some people were wishing his government bad things. Kahiga said they are working together and that his deputy was in charge when he was out of the country. The governor came back from Italy two days ago. He said his relationship with the Karugu was intact and called on those not comfortable with it to stop creating problems about it.“I would like to authoritatively say that we are working well together and she is here and can always confirm that,” he said. During his tour to Italy, there were reports circulating that his deputy had resigned which the county government denied.
