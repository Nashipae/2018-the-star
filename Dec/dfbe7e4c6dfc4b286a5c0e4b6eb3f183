Marco Silva will take his Everton squad to Africa next summer to play a showpiece friendly against the next winners of SportPesa Cup. The date and venue for next year’s SportPesa Trophy tie is yet to be confirmed. The Blues will face the winners of the eight-team SportPesa Cup, featuring four teams from Kenya namely SPL champions Gor Mahia, second-placed Bandari FC, FKF SportPesa Shield winners Kariobangi Sharks, and AFC Leopards. They will also encounter four teams from Tanzania being the 2017/18 Tanzania Premier League winners Simba SC, Yanga SC, Singida United, and Mbao FC. The Blues became the first Premier League club in 2017 to play a friendly match in East Africa, beating Kenya’s SportPesa Premier League champions Gor Mahia FC 2-1 in front of a crowd of more than 40,000 in Tanzania. The Club plans to return to the region to contest the annual SportPesa Trophy against the winners of the 2019 SportPesa Cup. While in Tanzania in 2017 the Blues, alongside SportPesa, won hearts and minds in the region when they participated in a range of promotional and charitable activities across Dar es Salaam. The Club further strengthened its links with African football in welcoming Gor Mahia last month to Goodison Park to contest the 2018 SportPesa Trophy, winning 4-0. The match was also used as an avenue to raise funds for EiTC with proceeds from ticket sales going towards key EiTC initiatives. Click here for the latest political news
