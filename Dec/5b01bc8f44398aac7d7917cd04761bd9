A man from Mawingo slum in West Pokot county stabbed his wife to death on Wednesday over Christmas shoes. Neighbour Tom Makuto said, "The couple quarreled every now and then. The wife bought a pair of unisex shoes. When the husband arrived on Christmas morning he wore the shoes, went away and came back on Boxing Day. The wife questioned him and he turned on her." The man, Jimmy Njoroge, went into hiding. West Pokot police commandant Mathews Kuto said officers have launched a manhunt for the suspect. He said neighbours had tried to separate the two when they started fighting, but Njoroge took a kitchen knife and stabbed his wife three times. Kuto said the couple was in their early 20s and had no child. "The neighbours took the wife to the hospital, but unfortunately she died on the way," he said. Click here for the latest political news
