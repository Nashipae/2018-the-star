An MCA in Nairobi said he was assaulted by a colleague during a committee meeting in Mombasa on Saturday. David Mberia (Karen) said he was attacked by Public Accounts Committee chairman Wilfred Odalo. "I had just arrived for the meeting and when I greeted the chairman. He responded with blows on my nose and eyes," Mberia said. He said he broke his nose and bled profusely as other MCAs watched. Mberia said Odalo assaulted him following his Facebook post that ODM leader Raila Odinga had appointed him to replace Odalo as PAC chairman. Last week, Mberia posted on his Facebook page that Raila had instructed ODM Nairobi chairman George Aladwa and the county assembly leadership to have him (Mberia) chair the PAC. Speaking to the Star on phone on Saturday, Odalo said there was a "small confrontation" because Mberia was causing disharmony in the committee. "By posting on Facebook that he was the chairman of this committee is a gross conduct. That cannot be takenÂ lightly. You cannot wake up one day and say you are the chairman," he said.
