One player was killed and six others injured when lightning struck during a football match on Sunday at the Nangina Ward Soccer tournament in Funyula, Busia county. Red Sharks FC defender Allan Mbote, 20, was struck dead by lightning while celebrating a goal with his teammates against arch-rivals Raybentos at the Luchululo Primary School grounds. The match had been stopped for some time due to heavy rains that pounded the area. When the match resumed, the Sharks leveled the match, players celebrated their goal near the corner flagstaff when tragedy struck. Lightning struck seven Sharks players, killing Mbote, a Kenyatta University student, on the spot. Some people blamed witchcraft.
