Resolution Kisii RFC returned to winning ways after a hard fought 21-19 win over arch rivals Kisumu RFC in a KRU Championship at Gusii Stadium. It was a sigh of relief for Kisii, who went down 10-17 to Western Bulls last weekend. “This is a very important win for us having lost last weekend. Kisumu are very strong side and this win is a morale booster for us as we seek to return to Kenya Cup,” said coach Eric Bosire. Bosire added: “We started the game well, scoring two tries in the first 10 minutes but we conceded late penalties in the first half. In the latter stages of the second half, we were more resilient and that is what helped us.” Howard Okwemba of Kisumu said they were destabilised by two early tries. “It was a very competitive game but some decisions we made in the second half cost us. At one point, we were leading 19-12 and we threw it away,” added Okwemba. In the match, Kisii scored their tries through Rodgers Marube, Alvin Marube and Frank Momanyi. Isaac Wafula converted two tries and a penalty. William Ojiayo and Alvin Wanjala crossed the whitewash for Kisumu with Lenny Obiero scoring two penalties and a try for the former Kenya Cup side. Western Bulls, Catholic Monks and USIU made it three wins out of three. Bulls edged debutants Kitale RFC 24-10 at Kakamega Showground while hosts Monks edged Ngong Warriors 16-6 at the Catholic University of East Africa in Karen. USIU’s Martials defeated hosts Mombasa 21-17, Wasps narrowly defeated hosts South Coast Pirates 7-3 as MMUST beat University of Eldoret’s Trojans 17-10.
