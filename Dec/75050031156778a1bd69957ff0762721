Bungoma senator Moses Wetang’ula has asked ODM leader Raila Odinga support his 2022 presidential bid. Speaking on Friday in Funyula, Busia county, Wetang’ula said he has supported the ODM leader for the presidency thrice and won but he was rigged out. “As Ford Kenya party leader, I have supported former PM Raila for the presidency thrice. I now want to appeal to him to reciprocate and support me in my bid for the presidency in 2022,” said Wetangula. He said he will be a no-nonsense president and ensure corrupt leaders are jailed.
