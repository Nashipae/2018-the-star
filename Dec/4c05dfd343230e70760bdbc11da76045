A showdown is looming between two Cabinet secretaries over the reappointment of the EPZA chief executive officer. The conflict relates to a case filed at the Employment and Labour Court. Former Export Processing Zones Authority CEO Fanuel Odede Kidenda has sued Industrialisation CS Peter Munya for wrongful termination. He claims CS Adan Mohamed had renewed his contract for three years before he was transferred to the East African Community and Regional Development ministry. Munya and Mohamed swapped offices in the July Cabinet reshuffle. Munya says, however, that the reappointment letter was suspect and might have been forged. “I suspect the letter and draft gazette notice dated July 11, 2018, were either altered or forged to defeat the process of appointing a new CEO of the EPZA,” Munya says in an affidavit. He said the move to give Kidenda a new contract was fraudulent and done without due process and procedure.  Munya faulted Mohamed for reappointing the CEO, arguing the Cabinet collegaue had been transferred from the ministry and had no authority to appoint anyone. But Kidenda’s lawyer Danstan Omari said the former CS wrote the letter, dismissing forgery claims. He told Justice Hellen Wasilwa that Mohamed reappointed Kidenda before he left the ministry. Omari said Mohamed confirmed that on July 7-14, he travelled to the US on official duty and was accompanied by Kidenda. During the trip and pursuant to his powers, he wrote the letter, Omari said.  The case will be mentioned on Monday next week when the Attorney General is expected to shed light on Omari’s claims.
