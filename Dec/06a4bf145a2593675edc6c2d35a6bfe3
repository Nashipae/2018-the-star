Kenya Prisons are the new Kenya Volleyball Federation national champions after dethroning bitter rivals Kenya Pipeline following a 3-1 play-offs decider at the Moi Stadium, Indoor arena, Kasarani, yesterday. It was sweet revenge for the wardresses, who have played second fiddle to their local nemesis since 2014. It was a terrible outing for Pipeline since they had to settle for third place behind Kenya Commercial Bank, who had earlier on defeated Bungoma County 3-0 (25-18, 25-13, 25-7). Prisons and the bankers will now represent the country at next year’s Africa Club Championships in Egypt. Pipeline made one change to the squad that fell to Kenya Commercial Bank on Sunday, introducing Esther Wangeci as Violet Makuto was moved to the centre position in place of Yvonne Sinaida. Prisons squeezed an 8-7 point lead at the first technical time out of the equally balanced first set. The wardresses extended the lead to 11-8 and 13-11 as their opponents awarded them free points with poor net judgment but the oilers slowly but surely closed the gap with hard-hitting Leonida Kasaya delivering the goods to close gap at 15-14. However, it was not enough for a turn-over as Prisons led 16-14 at the second technical time out. Prisons bagged points with impressive Lorraine Chebet and left-handed Emmaculate Chemtai delivering well oiled spikes as they extended the lead to 22-17 and 23-19 before they took the set 25-19. In the second, Prisons once again took an early lead with Mercy Moim and Sharon Chepchumba in dominant form to lead 6-3 and 8-3 at the first TTO. Pipeline grew in the game as libero Aggripina Kundu shone with her reception as they trailed 7-9 and 7-13. Prison’s Edith Wisa and Joy Lusenaka’s water-tight blocks coupled with razor-sharp spikes from Moim, helped the wardresses to a 16-8 lead at the second TTO. Pipeline coach Japheth Munala rested Janet Wanja for Rose Magoi and the move seemed to bore fruits as the oilers closed the gap at 14-17 and 16-19. Prisons coach, Josp Barasa, also rested Lusenaka for Jane Wacu as Prisons extended the lead to 20-17. Sinaida was replaced with Christine Siwa and the youngster’s introduction was felt as Pipeline closed the gap at 20-19, 21-21 and 21-23 but Prisons proved unstoppable as they went ahead to bag the set 25-22 for 2-0 lead. The third set saw the teams tie at 5-5, 6-6 before Pipeline, for the first time, took an 8-7 lead at the first TTO. However, they stalled again, allowing Prisons to close gap and eventually overtook them at 14-13 and 16-15 at the second TTO. Chepchumba, Chemtai, Wisa and Moim were impressive for Prisons at they led 19-18 but failed to hold the lead as Pipeline overtook them at 23-22 to finally bag the set 25-22 to trail 1-2. Pipeline continued with their new found form in the fourth set leading 8-3 but they somehow allowed their opponents to grow in the set and tie the points at 13-13 before Prisons raced to a 16-14 lead at the second TTO and never looked back to take the set 25-21. Barasa was gracious in the win, saying: “I am very happy for the win. It has been longtime coming and I thank all the players and more so the youngsters who showed character.” His opposite number Munala said: “We just have to go back to the drawing board and hopefully we came back stronger next season.”
