Kenyan universities have been urged to shun politics and tribalism and hire qualified lecturers. Kenya National Examination Council chairman George Magoha says the university system in the country has been politicised. Magoha said the country has reached a stage where universities are created by politicians in their own localities. “We are creating universities in our own backyards because we think they are going to create jobs for our people. Shame on us!”Magoha said. He spoke during the third graduation ceremony at Machakos University on Friday. A total of 1,424 graduands were conferred certificates, diplomas, and bachelor’s degree certificates. Magoha said most Kenyan universities lack tangible physical infrastructure. “They are lacking academic faculty to the extent that it is only in this country where someone calls himself a professor but when you ask him professor in what, he starts sweating, you Google his name and you do not find it there,” Magoha said. He said a professor is supposed to do original research and you publish or perish ­ you don’t publish trash, he said.Magoha said some people call themselves professors though they have published nothing. He asked universities to look for ability, capability and competence as bottom lines in hiring. Magoha said universities should develop the culture of benchmarking in other universities with projects worth emulating. He said tribalism, nepotism and corruption are some of the vices ailing universities. Magoha said some people think productivity depends on tribe. “As universities, you should be bold enough to employ qualified competent personnel,” added he. He said there are capable people in every Kenyan tribe. Magoha said Kenya is not where South Korea is for not employing skillful and qualified people. Click here for the latest political news
