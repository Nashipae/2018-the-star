Eight people, among them three KDF soldiers, died on Sunday in two separate accidents along Mombasa-Nairobi highway. An officer, who was travelling with his colleagues to Mombasa in a lorry from Kahawa Barracks, died instantly. The driver lost control of the vehicle and veered off the road causing the truck to overturn near Salama market, Mukaa subcounty. Two other officers died while being treated at Machakos Level 5 hospital for injuries sustained in the accident. Mukaa police boss Charles Muthui said nine soldiers were injured in the 11am accident. "Only one officer escaped unhurt," he said. Bodies of those killed in the crash were taken to Machakos Level 5 hospital mortuary. In the second incident, five people died instantly after two cars collided head-on at Kanga area near Mtito Andei town. Makueni county commissioner Maalim Mohammed said one of the cars was overtaking a truck when the driver hit another oncoming vehicle. The administrator blamed the accident on the two drivers' carelessness. "We have drivers who are keen on the roads but people lose lives because there are a few who are careless," he said. "Why are some drivers always in hurry to a point of risking lives of passengers?" the commissioner asked. The latest incident brings to above 20, the total number of accident deaths reported for the past five days. At least 14 people were killed in Webuye after a matatu which stopped to pick passengers was crashed on by fuel truck at Kaburengu.
