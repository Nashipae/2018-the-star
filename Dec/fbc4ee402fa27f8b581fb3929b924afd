MP Nixon Korir now says Nairobi Dam has outlived its usefulness
and should be destroyed instead of demolishing Seefar apartments in
Nyayo Highrise. Korir told the Star in an interview last Thursday that raw sewage from Kibera slum ends up in the dam, which was built by colonialists in the 1940s as a
recreational facility. “The
county government needs to tell us if they still need Nairobi dam
because as far as we are concerned, it is no longer a dam,” he
said. National Environment Management Authority together with Water Resources Authority
and the
government have been demolishing high-end buildings standing on
riparian and road reserves, including Southend
Mall off Langata Road, Airgate Centre (formerly Taj Mall) and Ukay
Centers, since August. Nema and WRA had said the dam is leaking from underground into the
apartments thus putting at risk the lives of its occupants. Korir faulted them for condemning the building yet they are the
agencies that approved its construction. Parliament
has been investigating the circumstances under which the building was
approved. The
owner, who has since, sold 287 out of the 288 units to the
residents, claimed that he has all the approval documents from Nema
and WRA.
