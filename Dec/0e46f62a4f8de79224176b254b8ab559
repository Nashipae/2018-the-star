Tourism players have expressed concern over the deteriorating state of roads leading to tourist sites in the country. Kenya Association of Tourist Operators said the roads are key to exploring the tourism circuit. Helen Nduta of KOBO Safaris said they were incurring heavy losses repairing vehicles from damage while touring different parts of the country with tourists. Nduta said while the government had shown commitment in repairing key roads more needed to be done adding that the industry was fast growing a year after the chaotic elections of 2017. She said tourists numbers had increased significantly in the last one year. “It can only get better with government support,” she said. The operations manager at Kobo safaris said they had entered an agreement with Quipbank to purchase the off-road vehicles that were previously leased to the government. Quipbank’s commercial director John Mogire said the vehicles were suitable for tour companies due to the terrain they cover with visitors. “We have different products for different clients and we endeavor to create new products as need arises to meet their needs,” he said.
