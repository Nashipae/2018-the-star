Local TV drama series Vioja Mahakamani actor Jamal Gaddafi has allegedly been killed by a woman friend in Mlolongo, Machakos. A police report shows Grace Kanamu Namu is alleged to have stabbed the actor at Arks Hotel on Tuesday night after a quarrel between them. A Good Samaritan called Athi River police station and made a report at 6.15am. It was recordedÂ under OB No. 08/12/12/2018. "It was reported that Jamal Nassul Gaddafi (39), was having a party at Arks Hotel near 67 Airport Hotel on the night of December 11, 2018. There was a quarrel between him and his friend Grace Kanamu Namu (40). She picked a knife and stabbed him," the police report seen by the Star reads in part. Gaddafi, who also acted in the KTN Junior series, was rushed to Shalom Community Hospital in Athi River where he was pronounced dead. Athi River police boss Sharma Wario told the Star he was aware of the incident. "Nimesikia kitu kama hiyo. Niko kwa sherehe za Jamhuri Day. Tutaongea baadaye," Wario told the Star on the phone on Wednesday. (I've heard of something like that, but I'm currently involved in the Jamhuri Day celebrations. We will take later).
