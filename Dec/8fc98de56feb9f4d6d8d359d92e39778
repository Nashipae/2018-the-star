Athletics Kenya (AK) will from next year issue licences to athletes, coaches and managers in a bid to promote clean and fair competition and good sports governance as defined by the IAAF’s Athletics Integrity Unit. In a statement, the federation stated that they are eager to clean the sport after constant damning reports of drug abuse among the athletes. “We are committed to get rid of the drug menace by all means hence the reason why we have enhanced our processes of registering athletes, coaches and all training camps in the country. No clearance will be given to any athlete before being registered,” the statement read in part. There will also be a vetting exercise carried out for all the medical personnel involved in athletics development and the athletes representatives including managers. The registration exercise is expected to commence early January 2019 and the federation has urged all foreign coaches residing and coaching in Kenya to prepare and present their permits in person at Riadha House by January 9. These changes come a week after AK president Jackson Tuwei said he will not allow the country to be mocked or ridiculed at an international level because of doping. “We saw what happened at 2017 World Championships in London, where US sprinter Justin Gatlin was booed through out his races. I don’t want this to happen to any Kenyan athlete,” said Tuwei, who was speaking at the Athletes Conference held last week. The president reminded the athletes that Kenya is still on IAAF radar by virtue of being put in Category ‘A’— which features of countries where doping is prevalent hence the need for firm action. He further added that Kenyan athletes will only be allowed to compete at the World Championships and Olympics after going through three out-of-competition doping tests and a similar number of tests during competition.
