A legal officer who had been nominated to be among those to open a KPLC tender never participated in the process, a court heard yesterday. David Makenzi yesterday told Anti-Corruption Court magistrate Lawrence Mugambi (pictured) that he was not aware of the nomination. He was testifying in a case in which former Kenya Power and Lighting Company CEO Ken Tarus and eight other senior officials have been charged with failure to comply with procurement laws in awarding a tender in which Sh159 million was lost. Makenzi, who is now the Busia business manager, said he had been seconded to conduct revenue collection in Nairobi West at the time of opening the tender. The tender was opened between March and June last year. Makenzi said he received a letter from the audit department in April asking why he did not participate in the tender opening yet he had been nominated. He told the court that he received a show cause letter on April 30. On May 24, he got an invitation from the human resource department to appear at the regional office in Kisumu for a disciplinary hearing on the matter. A week later, he got a letter from the disciplinary committee saying they had given him a benefit of doubt on his explanation that he was not at the head office at the time the tender was opened. Hearing continues. Click here for
