Some 690 National Police Reservists will be deployed along the volatile Kenya-Somalia border. Garissa county commissioner Joshua Chepchieng’ told the press in his office yesterday that each of the locations along the border would get 30 police reservists to be stationed in villages. The reservists were recruited recently on the request of local leaders who insisted that the new security team should be sourced from retired residents with experience in the disciplined forces. Such recruits have a vast knowledge of the local terrain and will easily pursue Al Shabaab militants on foot in areas where other security officers cannot easily access. Chepchieng’ said the reservists will work closely with chiefs, elders, residents and other security agencies in eliminating the Al-Shabaab menace in the area. “With the 690 recruits, we believe that very soon the Al Shabaab threat will be a thing of the past,” he said. Areas where the terror group use as hideouts include Ijara, where Boni forest is located, Hulugho, Fafi and Dadaab. Boni forest is a ‘hotbed’ of the Al Shabaab militia. “The Al Shabaab threat has forced officers along the border to spend sleepless nights so that we can enjoy the peace we are witnessing today in Garissa and several other parts of the country,” the administrator said. Chepchieng’ urged the residents to continue volunteering relevant information to avert attacks on security agencies. The reservists will assist security agencies to effectively deal with the terror group, he added.
