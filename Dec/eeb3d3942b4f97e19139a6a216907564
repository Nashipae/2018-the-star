A man who reportedly killed his 82-year old neighbour on suspicion of witchcraft in Sibilo, Baringo North, surrendered to the police on Monday. Musa Chelimo fled after killing Kaino Cheptim. The latter was looking after his goats when Chelimo attacked him, reportedly for obstructing his path. "The suspect was from the river and was carrying a bucket of water. He had a brief argument with the old man, asking him why he was obstructing him," Victor Chebotibin, a witness, said. He said Chelimo did not take it lightly when the elderly man told him the space was wide enough for him to pass. Chebotibin said the assailant put down his bucket, picked a stick and hit the old man on the head. "He did not listen to Cheptim's plea to spare the man's life in exchange for a goat. Instead, he hit the old with a stone on his chest, killing him instantly." "The suspect kept on telling the old man: 'Today everything will end. You will tell us who has bewitched us in the community." Chebotibin said the suspect threatened to kill him if he intervened. Chelimo then fled. Sibilo acting county commissioner Mohamed Sheh said the suspect surrendered at Kipsaraman AP post on Tuesday. Some villagers said members of the suspect's family have struggled with health complications believed to have been as a result of a spell cast on the family. Cheptim had told them to go for cleansing saying the health complications might have been as a result of ancestral curses. Click here for the latest political news
