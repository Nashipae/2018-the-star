Talanta and Bidco United will tomorrow battle it out at Thika Stadium as the FKF National Super League enters the second week this weekend. The teams recorded mixed results last weekend with Talanta beating newbies Eldoret Youth 3-1 while Bidco lost 2-1 to Nairobi Stima. Kakamega High School’s Green Commandos hosts Kenya Police Bukhungu Stadium, Kibera Black Stars and Migori Youth will face off at Hope Center as relegated Thika United hosts Modern Coast Rangers at Thika Stadium. Thika failed to honour their opening day fixture against Coast Stima. The club’s team manager, Vincent Nyaberi, disputed reports that the club has been disbanded due to financial woes after their sponsor Brookside Dairies pulled out. On Sunday, returning Shabana hosts Nairobi City Stars at Gusii Stadium. Shabana have been boosted by the return of veteran coach Gilbert Selebwa who will be the team’s technical director. Coach Andrew Kanuli says their 1-0 away win against St Joseph’s Youth is a morale booster for the team. “The win was very important for us. We failed to convert several chances but we have worked on that the whole week,” he said. Eldoret Youth host St Joseph’s Youth at Sudi stadium, seeking their maiden win in the second tier league as Nairobi Stima and Kisumu All Stars battle it out at Karuturi grounds in Naivasha. Camp Toyoyo will host a double header with the first match pitting Administration Police and Coast Stima and Wazito taking on Kangemi All Stars. Debutants Fortune Sacco hope to win their first game when they welcome Ushuru at Thika Stadium.
