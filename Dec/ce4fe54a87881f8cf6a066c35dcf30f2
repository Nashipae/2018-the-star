Former Machakos senator Johnson Muthama has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to step up the war on graft to rid the country of the vice. He said on Tuesday the Opposition supports the crackdown and will only criticise the wrong things the government does. Muthama said the handshake between Uhuru and former PM Raila Odinga has united the country and provided an atmosphere conducive to development and the fight against corruption. The handshake was not meant to kill political parties but end corruption in government agencies, he said. Muthama said Uhuru will be to blame if Kenya fails to win the war. He said the President has the support of the public and political parties, and has the time and power to fix the ills. “Kenyans are at risk, yet a few individuals are syphoning billions from the public kitty. We want the corrupt charged,” Muthama said in Matungulu. He criticised churches for accepting graft proceeds. “Someone steals Sh10 billion, then donates Sh500,000 and you dance, sing and praise him. This is unacceptable,” he said.
