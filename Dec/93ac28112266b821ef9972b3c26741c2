Vehicle and Equipment Leasing Limited is planning to list its shares at the Nairobi Securities Exchange through an Initial Public Offering in February 2019. This will be the first time in nearly four years a local firm has listed its shares on the Nairobi Bourse via IPO since NSE’s self-listing in 2014. The firm plans to raise Sh$10 million (Sh1.03 billion) through the NSE to strengthen partnerships it has with its Asian and Southern Africa counterparts. “The amount of securities offered will be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of the offering. The leaser will communicate the percentage of shares they will offer by end of January 2019 after the board’s approval,” VAELL’s Chairman Joseph Kiiza said. Although the NSE planned to list four new firms this year, only Bank of Kigali Group has been cross-listed so far. The Rwandese lender was listed last Friday trading at a reserve price of Sh30. Firms such as Cytonn Investments and Tuskys Supermarket have also been working with the NSE in preparations to publicly trade their shares. VAELL which owns the Quipbank and TingA tractor sharing platform has subsidiaries in Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zambia.
