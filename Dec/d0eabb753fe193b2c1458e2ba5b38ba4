A group of students at the Technical University of Mombasa has vowed to stage a third demo to disrupt end of semester exams scheduled to begin today. On Monday, police lobbed teargas to disperse students who staged demos blocking the Buxton intersection to protest fee payment deadline. The demos forced the administration to review the fee payment policy but on Wednesday the students staged another demonstration decrying lack of enough desks and strict exam regulations. Some students were injured by riot police on Wednesday and others held at Makupa police station for hours. GSU officers followed the students to their residences during Wednesday’s demo, kilometers away from the campus and clobbered them, inflicting injuries on them. A splinter student organisation calling itself ‘TUM Activists Board’ has told members to turn up today with an intention of rioting. They intend to start fires to scare other students and security officers so as to disrupt exams. The group, which commands a huge student following, want fair exam cheating penalty procedures, better Wi-fi and clean toilets. Click here for
