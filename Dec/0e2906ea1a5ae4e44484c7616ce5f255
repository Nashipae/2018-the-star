The Council of Governors has condemned the withdrawal of West Pokot governor John Lonyagapuo's security. His bodyguards were recalled on Friday after he stormed a police roadblock and freed a boda boda rider who had been arrested for allegedly flouting traffic rules. In a statement, CoG said there has been no communication as to why the officers were removed. "The withdrawal of the Governor’s security demonstrates a clear conflict between the discharge of public duties and fulfilment of personal interests, whether directly or indirectly," read a statement. "The Inspector General of Police must take action, and seek to formally communicate to the Governor and immediately replace the officers. This must not be repeated ever again." The governors defended their colleague, saying 20 roadblocks had been mounted between Kesegon and Kainuk in West Pokot. CoG chairman Josphat Nanok said that is unnecessary in a situation where no major highway insecurity has been reported. The Turkana Governor said they have received reports of harassment of boda boda riders by the police. "This matter requires to be urgently addressed lest it creates disharmony with the citizenry. There are better ways of policing our roads," he said. Nanok said Lonyagapuo had talked to the police bosses days earlier, but no action was taken to ease the roadblocks. "We demand investigations over the roadblocks and harassment of people so that the truth is known," he said.
