Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i has ordered investigations against a chief and his assistant in Bomet county over an incident in which children were reportedly hospitalised after drinking chang'aa in Kaproret village, Bomet county. In a statement dispatched to newsrooms, Matiang'i faults the two administration officials for negligence, ordering the local regional commissioner to oversee the probe against them. "Upon confirming the incident, the Cabinet Secretary for Interior and Coordination of National Government has directed the regional commissioner to facilitate immediate investigations into the negligence of the area chief and assistant chief with a view to taking disciplinary action for dereliction of duty," reads the statement. Emphasizing the government's zero-tolerance, the CS noted that an immediate crackdown he ordered in the area upon being informed of the incident has led to four arrests. The four are detained at Konoin police station, awaiting to be arraigned in court tomorrow. Matiang'i also indicated that the government will not spare anyone handling the illicit brews in the country. â€œWe will spare no effort or resources in protecting Kenyans from these toxic substances, especially when they affect the lives of our innocent children," he said. Matiang'i said the state will be firm and decisive on the the issue of illicit brew trade. He also warned administrative and security officials against laxity, adding that "those sleeping on the job will be winnowed out and brought to account for security lapses in their respective areas of jurisdiction."
