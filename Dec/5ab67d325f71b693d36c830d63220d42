Nondies’ coach Willis Ojal thinks there is still room for improvement after his side beat Menengai Oilers 28-8 to clinch their third successive win in the Kenya Cup over the weekend. Ojal said the side failed to scale the heights of their win against champions against KCB last week but was satisfied with the win. “It was tough against the Oilers especially in the first half. We did not execute well but in the second half, the game opened up and we were able to score three tries and come away with the win,” added Ojal. Nondies face Mwamba and Quins next in matches Ojal has described as very competitive before the Christmas break. “It’s going to be challenging. Mwamba have lost three games and Quins and us are rivals and so we will have to be at our best to keep up the momentum,” added Ojal. Stephen Odhiambo, skipper Fidel Oloo and Steve Sumba scored a try a piece with Martin Juma adding two penalties and a conversion. Oilers lone try was scored by winger Derrick Mbarire with Derrick Keyoga adding a penalty for the Nakuru-based side. Kabras stay top of the standings with maximum 15 points after picking a bonus point in 50-8 win over Nakuru RFC at the Kakamega showground Impala remain in the hunt after a hard fought 16-9 win over Strathmore Leos, who are win-less after three games. Champions KCB hammered Mwamba 33-13 at the Lions Den while Quins bounced back from their defeat to Oilers to beat Homeboyz 35-15 at the RFUEA ground. Blak Blad recorded their first win of the season by winning the university derby 32-19 against Mean Machine.
