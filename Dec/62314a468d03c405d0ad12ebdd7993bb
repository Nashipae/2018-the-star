Two fishermen have been stranded in Lake Victoria after their boats became trapped by hyacinth in Suba North on Saturday. Ibrahim Yuaya and Patrick Otieno are separately marooned by the weed near Kisaka beach. Yesterday, efforts to rescue them were stopped. Homa Bay Beach Management Unit chairman Edward Oremo said their rescue boats could not navigate through the weed. “We’ve tried all we can but were unable to reach them because of the heavy presence of the weed,” he said. Oremo urged the county government to intervene. “It’s difficult to reach them. They continue moving with the weed as wind pushes them. We appeal for assistance from relevant authorities,” he said. Oremo also urged fishermen to stop operating alone, especially in deeper parts of the lake.
