Leaders from Mandera county have called on security agencies to carry out speedy investigations and bring to book those behind the killing of a night guard last week. Speaking to the press in Mandera town yesterday, the leaders led by Guticha MCA Mohmed Ibrahim, said it was worrying that no suspect has yet been arrested even though the killers were known. “Which other evidence do the investigative agencies want when they have been fed with all the information that would lead to the arrest of the killers,” Ibrahim said. Ibrahim, who was accompanied by MCAs Aden Abdullahi (Mandera Township), Abdi Aden (Neboi) and Jamale Hassan (Guba), said that preliminary investigations showed that the killers were dressed in police uniform. The MCAs said the slain guard's colleague saw the killers from an adjacent building. Aden said that whenever they went to inquire from the DCI officers over the matter, all they are told is that they are still recording statements from key suspects. “Our worst fear is that the family of the slain man may not get justice. This incident might be buried under the carpet,” he said. However, when contacted by the Star over the progress of investigations, Mandera East OCPD Ezekiel Singoei called on the leaders to be patient. He said the MCAs should give the investigative team time to do its work saying that 'tremendous progress' has been made in as far as arresting the killers is concerned.
