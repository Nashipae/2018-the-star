Kabras hooker Coleman Were is expected to be out for the next five months after undergoing surgery yesterday. Were sustained a knee injury while playing for the Kenya Simbas during the repechage World Cup qualifiers last month in Marseille against Hong Kong. Were is expected to miss the Kenya Cup season as he recovers from the injury. Kenya Simbas team manager, Wangila Simiyu, observed the surgery went well and he expects Were to make full recovery in good time. “He was one of the players who got introduced to the team this season and he has done a good job. We are confident he will recover in good time,” added Simiyu. Simiyu said skipper Davis Chenge, who missed the final repechage game against Germany should be bale to resume club duty in the next two weeks. According to Simiyu, his shoulder injury was not too serious and he should be able to resume club duty very soon. Joshua Chisanga, who got an ankle injury during the repechage, has been declared fit and will resume playing for his Polish club, Orkan Sochaczew. Elsewhere, Kenya Cup giants Quins have elected Michael Wanjala as their new chairman. The announcement comes after the Annual General Meeting held on Tuesday Wanjala takes over the club leadership from Mike Lucas who has served the club since 2015. Alan Onyango will be his vice chairman, replacing former Kenya 7s star Sydney Ashioya. Quins head of technical committee Victor Sudi said he is happy with the start of the season. Quins have won two out of three games, beating Mwamba 29-26, Homeboyz 35-15 and losing 14-8 to Oilers. They lie fourth on the standings. “It’s a good start to the season. I can say we are improving and we are headed in the right direction so far,” added Sudi. Quins face champions KCB in a tough encounter on Saturday at the RFUEA ground.
