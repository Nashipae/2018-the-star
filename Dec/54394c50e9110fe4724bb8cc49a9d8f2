There was a shooting scare aboard an SGR cargo train when a drunken police officer fired a shot out of the window. Emali OCS Gerrishon Murithi said the incident happened on Friday around 6pm on an SGR train that was heading to Mombasa. He said police officer Bernard Ng'ang'a and his colleague Cina Okul were aboard the train from Nairobi terminus on escort duties. “On reaching Athi River station, Ng'ang'a started drinking alcohol in a plastic bottle and became unruly,” Murithi said. In Sultan Hamud, Murithi said Ng'ang'a ordered his colleague Okul to tell the locomotive drivers to stop the train lest he shoots them. He then corked his G3 rifle and fired a bullet through the window. Okul alerted the drivers who eventually stopped at Emali SGR Station. “Sergeant Sammy Korir and Paul Njeru of Emali Railways police station intervened and disarmed Ng'ang'a,” the police statement said. Murithi said Ng'ang'a was released from the escort duties and replaced with Omar Kibwana at Emali Railways Police Station. Murithi said there was no damage on the train and no one was injured.
