Diamond Platnumz and Ryvanny, both from WCB Wasafi record label, have been banned from performing in Tanzania or anywhere else, until further notice. They were banned yesterday by Baraza la Sanaa Tanzania (Basata), a Tanzanian government body that regulates music, movies and other creative works. This is after the two singers defied the edict by Basata not to perform their latest song, 'Mwanza'. The song was banned last month for allegedly having vulgar lyrics and promoting immorality among the youth. The duo performed the controversial song in Mwanza last weekend, where they were on a tour. In a statement that has gone viral, Basata said the action was taken because of Diamond’s rebellious character. "Tamasha la Wasafi 2018 kimesitishwa kutokana na ukiukaji wa sheria, kanuni na taratibu katika uendeshaji wa tamasha hiyo hapa nchini," the statement read. "Basata limewafungia wasanii Diamond na Ryvanny kutofanya onyesho lolote ndani na nje kwa muda usiojulikana kwanzia 18 December." Diamond earlier responded: "Licha ya kuwa ni kweli #Nyegezi ni eneo na kituo cha Mabasi kilichopo Mwanza, lakini pia ni vyema Kama balaza letu pendwa la sanaa kutambua pia kuwa sio kila Nyimbo ni kwajili ya watoto wadogo. "Hivyo kusema isipigwe kwenye TV na Radio tumekubali, lakini iwe Kwenye Ule muda ambao serikali uliuweka wa kuwa watoto wako macho, ila pale wanapolala, basi uruhusiwe ili walengwa wautazame." Diamond Platnumz is expected to perform with international reggae band and Grammy Award winner Morgan Heritage during the Wasafi Festival at Uhuru Gardens. It is unclear if that will be affected.
