Shujaa’s shambolic start to the new season continued as they failed to qualify for the main cup quarterfinals for the second time in a row. Just like in the opening leg in Dubai the previous weekend the Kenyan side failed to sail through in Cape Town yesterday. Kenya are now bottom of the standings with a mere three points and huge threat of relegation hanging over their heads. Paul Murunga’s charges lost all three group matches on Saturday, losing 29-12 to England, 38-7 to Fiji and19-12 to France to drop to the Challenge Trophy. Here, the East Africans put up a gallant fight but still fell to Argentina 34-31 despite leading 24-5 at the interval. However, Kenya recorded their first win of the series when they beat African rivals Zimbabwe 31-19 in the Shield competition. Rookie Vincent Onyala bagged a brace with Johnstone Olindi, Daniel Taabu and Dennis Ombachi scoring a try each with Eden Agero scoring three conversion for their maiden win. Kenya then overcame a 19-7 deficit to beat Wales in the final with Olindi scoring twice with Cyprian Kuto, Leonard Mugaisi and Eric Ombasa crossing the white wash for the deliverables. Coach Murunga now expects to have his experience players back for the third and fourth legs in Australia and New Zealand in the year. Murunga is missing the likes of talisman Collins Injera, Andrew Amonde,Willy Ambaka, Sammy Oliech and Nelson Oyoo.
