High flying Wazito battle hosts Ushuru tomorrow hoping to win their fourth straight Football Kenya Federation (FKF) National Super League game. The top of the table clash to be played at Camp Toyoyo will be the first of a double header to be hosted at the venue. In the second game, Kibera Black Stars will welcome third placed Shabana. Wazito leads the table with 12 points followed by Ken Kenyatta’s Ushuru with 10 points same as returnees Shabana but the tax men have a better goal difference. According to Kenyatta, they are seeking to halt Wazito’s impressive start of the season. Shabana’s assistant coach Rix Kanuli said his team is ready to return to winning ways after battling to a barren draw against Migori Youth on Wednesday at Gusii Stadium. At Awendo Green Stadium in Migori County, Migori Youth host fourth-placed and debutants Eldoret Youth as Kenya Police welcome unbeaten Nairobi Stima. Hope Centre will host a double header. In the first encounter, Kangemi All Stars who failed to travel to Sudi Stadium for their mid-week game against Eldoret Youth play Bidco United while Nairobi City Stars will square it out with Francis Oduor’s Kisumu All Stars. Newbies Fortune Sacco and Administration Police will face off at Thika Sub County Stadium as Modern Coast Rangers seek their first win of the season against Talanta at Serani Sports ground. Coast Stima will square it out with win-less St Joseph’s Youth in the league’s last game of the year. The league takes a break until January 5, 2019.
