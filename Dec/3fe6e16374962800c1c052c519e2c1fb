More than 100 quarrymen in Tezo, Kilifi have protested the auctioning of a brick-cutting machine that led to the closure of Zowereni quarry. They blamed Italian investor Luca Benedicto for the sale saying the move has left them out of work. Benedicto is allegedly on the run, the protesters said. Angry workers on Sunday held a peaceful protest, saying no notice was given for the auction. They claimed to have used the Sh3 million machine for seven years. Some said there was a court order directing that the machine be taken away. Rhoda Karisa and Lavasco Mkutano who led the protest said breadwinners of over 60 families will be jobless. “We depended on the quarry for income,” Karisa said. Commission for Human Rights and Justice executive director Julius Ogogo called for vetting of foreign investors in Kilifi. “Some of them are part of those involved in fraudulent businesses,” Ogogo said. He said some investors were using locals to register dubious companies.
