Baringo senator Gideon Moi called on Nairobi governor Mike Sonko to embrace dialogue with transport stakeholders over the CBD ban. In a statement to newsrooms yesterday, Gideon asked Sonko to sit down with all transport stakeholders including experts to find an amicable solution to the crisis in the shortest time possible. He said this will ensure that planners put in place alternatives which are efficient and affordable to the over two million working population in the City who are key to the country’s economic growth. “This is a competitive modern city and introducing new measures without proper plans in place for shuttles to pick and drop passengers to the CBD is counterproductive,” he said. The senator said it is in the interest of people living and working in the City to have a smooth flow of traffic without facing unnecessary interference. “Commuters have suffered and forced to trek for long distances to their places of work,” he said.
