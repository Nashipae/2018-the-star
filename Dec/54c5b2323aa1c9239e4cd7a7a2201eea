Murang’a Level 5 Hospital now has a haemophilia centre that will benefit thousands of patients from Mt Kenya region. Haemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder that stops blood from clotting properly. It results when blood has insufficient protein that controls bleeding. It is controlled through clotting factors 8 and 9 that are injected into veins. The centre has been established by the Kenya Haemophilia Foundation and was launched on November 1. The foundation has proposed a law to protect patients. The centre is the fourth in the country after similar ones were set up at Kenyatta National Hospital, Eldoret and Mombasa. Officer in charge Jane Mugacha yesterday said residents with the disease have been struggling to access specialised care. Mugacha, also the head of the Paediatric department in the hospital, said the disease has been killing most patients at a tender age because of lack of treatment. “This causes patients to bleed uncontrollably when they get cuts and swell when they suffer physical trauma due to internal bleeding,” Mugacha said. The disease mainly attacks men. Women who are exposed to it become carriers. Physical trauma in the head may claim the life of a patient. “Carrier women experience heavy menses and have the clotting factor administered before childbirth to avoid over-bleeding,” she added. Mugacha received training in South Africa before the centre was opened.
