The government on Thursday suspended the demolition of buildings until further notice. The directive by head of public Service Joseph Kinyua came a day after more than 5,000 residents were left homeless at Nyama Villa estate in Kayole following the demolition of their homes. "Further guidance will be issued following consultations with all relevant State Agencies and Stakeholders," Kinyua said in a statement. A private developer claimed ownership of the more than 200 acres where Nyama Villa estate stands. It housed private residential houses and rental apartments. Chief Julius Wanjau, the officer in charge of the demolitions, said the land belongs to the proprietor of Marble Arch Hotel identified only as Maina.
