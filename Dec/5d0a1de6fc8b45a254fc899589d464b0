Both senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Cherangany MP Joshua Kuttuny are part of cartel behind the troubles in the maize sector, Endebess MP Robert Pukose has said. Speaking in Kitale on Sunday, Pukose (below) said Kuttuny is linking Deputy President William Ruto to the maize scam to conceal the truth. Kuttuny has called for Ruto to be probed over the matter. The National Cereals and Produce Board paid Sh1.9 billion to unscrupulous traders who supplied maize to depots at the expense of farmers. Kuttuny and Murkomen last week clashed over the matter during an interview on Citzen TV. “My friend Kutuny and Murkomen have been purchasing maize here in Matisi through some individuals. Let them not lie to us because they are part of the cartels,” Pukose said. Read: MPs: Ruto wants to bring Congo maize More: Rift MPs now want Ruto probed over maize crisis Click here for
