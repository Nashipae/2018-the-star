Tanzanian singer Ommy Dimpoz has been admitted to a German hospital. Speaking to Global TV, Dimpoz's father confirmed his son was doing well, until recently when his condition worsened. ''They have taken him to Germany for treatment and a possible surgery again. I have been talking to them on phone to know how he is going on,'' Dimpoz's dad said. Another close friend to the family also said the singer is in Germany for treatment. "Baada ya upasuaji awali wa koo hadi tumboni, alipata tatizo la kutoa uzaha na akakimbizwa hospitalini Ujerumani," the source told Global TV. Dimpoz has been struggling with throat-related complications and four months ago, he was flown to South Africa for a life-saving surgery over the same, where he spent about 15 days in the hospital.
