Harambee Stars may have achieved a historical feat on the African continent as they qualified for the 2019 Caf Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) for the very first time since 2004, but it has not been enough for them to make it among the top three teams shortlisted for the 2018 Men’s National Team of the Year Award. The national team qualified for next year’s tournament after Confederation of African Football (CAF) kicked out Sierra Leone from the 2019 Cup of Nations qualifiers. The suspension came after FIFA suspended the Sierra Leone Football Association (SLFA) two months ago due to government interference, specifically protesting the removal of SLFA president Isha Johansen and general secretary Christopher Kamara. The decision to remove Sierra Leone from the qualifiers meant Kenya and Ghana qualified for the biannual tournament from Group F. This achievement, however, didn’t convince CAF as Harambee Stars were beaten to the final list by neighbours Uganda who are showing signs of developing into a continental powerhouse, Mauritania and Madagascar, who shocked the whole continent by securing their first ever qualification for the continental showpiece. The shortlisted nominees were decided by votes from the members of the CAF Technical & Development Committee. The final phase will involve votes from CAF media experts, legends, coaches of the quarter-finalists of the CAF Champions League and CAF Confederation Cup, and coaches and captains of the 54 Member Associations. Meanwhile, 10 men players and 11 women players have been nominated for the men and women’s Player of the Year Award among them last year’s winner Egyptian Mohammed Salah, who plays for English Premier League side Liverpool and Nigeria’s female star player Asisat Oshoala who plies her trade for Chinese side Dalian Quanjian FC. The Awards Gala, to honour footballers and officials who distinguished themselves during the year, will be held on January 8, 2019 in Dakar, Senegal.
