Garissa will hold a cultural week from September next year when residents will exchange ideas to be imparted to future generations. Deputy Governor Abdi Dagane made the announcement yesterday when he opened a week-long cultural event at the Garissa Culture and Heritage Center. Dagane said the county has allocated Sh30 million for the centre’s infrastructure development. A modern multi-purpose hall and a museum are under construction. “We pledged to preserve our traditional artefacts and create a community hub for cultural knowledge and information,” Dagane said. He said the county will invite participants from all the wards to promote integration and provide an opportunity for youth and women to express their talents.
