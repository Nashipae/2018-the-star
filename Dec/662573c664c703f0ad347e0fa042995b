MPs are conspiring to get hefty new perks. If President Uhuru Kenyatta rejects the Parliamentary Service Bill 2018, they plan to muster a two-thirds majority in Parliament to get what they want. The 416 MPs already have a Sh7 million car grant and a Sh20 million mortgage facility. Now they want a second house allowance, plus a fully serviced and fuelled second vehicle, plus enhanced medical cover, plus a special constituency allowance. Our MPs are already among the highest paid in the world. They refused to allow the Salaries and Remuneration Commission to benchmark their pay. What they are demanding is unacceptable. They believe they are a special class to be rewarded above all others. Uhuru should reject this bill, if it is passed and comes before him. He should then warn Jubilee MPs that they will be expelled from the party if they vote to pass it with a two-thirds majority. Raila Odinga should do likewise with Nasa MPs. The MPs can then contest a by-election and see how many votes they get. Quote of the day: "If we don't believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don't believe in it at all."
