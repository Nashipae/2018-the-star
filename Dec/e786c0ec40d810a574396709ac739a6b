A father who allegedly killed his two daughters in Mshomoroni, Mombasa, has not come to terms with what took place. On Friday, James Maina told Shanzu senior principal magistrate Diana Mochache that he was shocked by what happened. He had been drunk when he allegedly hit the two girls with a weighing scale machine. They were aged four and six. An emotional Maina said he came back to his senses after the two had died. He was arrested on Thursday. The police sought for days to detain him as they continue with investigations. Investigative officer Billy Onyango said they will question and record statements from the suspectâ€™s wife and neighbours. They will also seek a postmortem report. Mochache allowed the application and directed that the suspect be detained at Nyali police station. She also directed that Maina undergo a psychiatric examination to determine if he is fit to stand trial. The case will be mentioned on December 17. Maina is said to have committed the offence after returning from a drinking spree. His neighbours said girls were playful. "He found them playing outside and called them to their house to give them a mango. He then stabbed them to death," a neighbour said.
