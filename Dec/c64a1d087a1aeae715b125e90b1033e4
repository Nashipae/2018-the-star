Two mothers have pleaded guilty at an Embu court (pictured) to having their underage daughters undergo FGM. Another woman was charged with keeping the girls in her house while they healed and concealing FGM. The girls are aged 10 and 13 years. The two mothers were on Tuesday charged with failing to protect their children from female genital mutilation. They are accused of allowing their girls to undergo the cut between November 25 and 30 in Mbuvori sublocation. The three appeared before resident magistrate Jean Ndegeri. The mothers pleaded guilty, but the third woman denied the charge. The woman accused of hiding the girls applied to be released on bond, be supplied with copies of the charge sheet, witness statements and any other document the prosecution plans to use against her. She was released on 20,000 with surety of similar amount. Her case will continue on December 13. The other two will later be sentenced by the magistrate.
