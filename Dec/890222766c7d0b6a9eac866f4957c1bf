Laikipia leaders and residents have expressed concern over the escalating cases of human-wildlife conflict in the region. They are Laikipia Women Representative Catherine Waruguru, Senator John Kinyua, and Laikipia West MP Patrick Mariru. The leaders accused the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) of sleeping on their job as marauding elephantâ€™s wreck-havoc in most parts of the region. They spoke at the burial of Richard Kinyua, 71, who was trampled by an elephant a week ago. The man was killed as he attempted to drive away a herd that had invaded his home at Marmanet. Waruguru and her colleagues want the government to ensure the animals are kept off, "otherwise residents will be forced to protect themselves by killing the wildlife". The leaders said the human-wildlife conflict was leaving behind a trail of destruction to crops with locals left to live in fear of attacks. "I want to plead with the people of Laikipia to give us one more chance so that we can talk with the KWS officers to tell as if it is people who will be living in Laikipia or it is the Jumbos," Waruguru said at Kinguka village in Marmanet ward, Laikipia county. They said an electric fence around Rumuruti and Marmanet forests, that has cost millions of shillings, has not deterred the elephants. "Animal attacks are rampant in Laikipia West. We are asking CS Najib Balala(Tourism) to come and solve the issue," Mariru said. Locals say a day hardly passes before an attack is reported. Click here for the latest political news
