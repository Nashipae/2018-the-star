Absenteeism, child labour and negative attitude by local communities are among the impedements of quality education in Nyandarua. Other drawbacks are early marriages, domestic household problems and negative peer influence, governor Francis Kimemia said on Wednesday. “These are the problems we must tackle for Nyandarua to reclaim its lost academic glory,” Kimemia said at Ol Joro Orok Stadium where he issued bursaries to students. In the 2017/18 financial year, Nyandarua allocated Sh100 million for bursary. The second disbursement of Sh60 million is being issued to 9,601 students. The bursaries will enable needy students to pursue education without financial worries. “The needy bright students will be supported to enhance access, retention and completion rates while reducing drop-outs,” the governor said. He at the same time emphasised discipline as bursary alone cannot guarantee better performance. “Our ultimate goal must be to ensure children excel in their studies so that we can help reduce poverty in Nyandarua,” the governor said.
