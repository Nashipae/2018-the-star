A Catholic priest yesterday was shot dead by thugs in Kinoo, Kiambu county. Father Muhia Njoroge was in charge of Kinoo Parish in Kikuyu Denary. The gang fled with a bag of unknown amount of offerings collected on Sunday. Police are investigating. The cleric was driving from St Peter’s Catholic Church, the headquarters of the parish, where the church hosts him. He was attacked 1.5km away. Kiambu county police commander Andiel Nyange said he was crossing a rough road to join the Nairobi-Nakuru highway at Regen, from where he would proceed to a Kikuyu town bank to deposit the cash. The four-man gang obstructed him at 9am and forced him to pull over to the roadside, Nyange said. As he sought to comply, one thug brandished pistols and another shot him in the chest through his Toyota Harrier windscreen. Witness James Waweru said the thugs quickly opened his car and removed the bag and a passenger’s mobile phone escaped on their two motorbikes. Waweru and others were building a house next to the scene. They took a keen look at what was going on before they heard gunshots. Waweru eulogised Njoroge as a dedicated priest who focussed on church activities and service to the faithful since he was posted there six months ago. Nyange urged churches, residents and businesspeople to ask for police escort when ferrying money. Members of the church plan to hold special prayers for the parish, the priest and his family members. Peter Wainaina said Njoroge had spent his Sunday at a seminar with the Catholic Men Association at St Steven’s Church, Kinoo.
