The government requires Sh1.13 trillion in the next three years to implement 33 programmes under the Public Administration and International Relations (PAIR) Sector. The programmes include facilitating national, youth and foreign policies, resource mobilisation, allocation and management, strengthening the devolved system of government, monitoring, evaluation and reporting on the use of public resources and improve service delivery. The Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) budget report by the Treasury shows the sector resources required for 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 financial years are Sh380.22 billion, Sh385.58 billion and Sh360.75 billion respectively. However, the sector has been allocated a total of Sh704.5 billion, comprising Sh238.55 billion, Sh241.39 billion and Sh224.56 billion for the same period, respectively. This represents a resource deficit of close to Sh425.5 billion for the three years. The sector was also allocated Sh138.528 billion and Sh100.02 billion in the 2019-20 financial year as recurrent and capital expenditure compared to Sh127.21 billion and Sh86.99 billion in 2018/19 year. This translates to a 8.9 per cent increase in resource allocation for the compensation of employees, use of goods and services and transfers in recurrent expenditure, and 15 per cent increase in capital expenditure.
