Kenya Prisons’ setter Joy Luseneka is ready to challenge regulars Jane Wacu and Janet Wanja for the national team position after being feted best in the just concluded Volleyball Federation (KVF) national play offs. Luseneka emerged the best setter during play-offs, drowning team-mate Wacu and last year’s winner Wanja. Luseneka, who has played in the shadows of two in the previous national team assignment, said it’s about time she stepped into the big shoes and the accolades at the play-offs have given her the inspiration. “It’s such an honour and humbling to finally win the best setter award. This award not only means a lot to me but also to the entire team and technical bench that entrusted me with the position in almost all the matches,” she noted. She continued: “I’m more encouraged now going forward that I can challenge other players in the position starting next year and hopefully, that the award will open bigger doors for me in future.” The former Lugulu High School player said she wants to carry the new found form to the next year’s Africa Club Championship with her team-mates. “When you look at the squad, we have few experienced players while majority are upcoming. We hope to be the team that will bring back the African Club title that has remained elusive since 2012,” noted Luseneka, who played as a centre player in her days in high school before she switched to setting. Team-mate Wacu acknowledged that Lusenaka is now ripe for the national team duties. The sensational setter said it’s a joy to watch upcoming players overshadow experienced players to win awards. “I saw it coming. Luseneka has been impressive throughout training and during the regular league matches and therefore I wasn’t surprised when she finally received the award,” said Wacu. She added: “Going forward, I hope she extends the same confidence to the national team and prove a thing or two. But generally I’m excited and happy for her.”
