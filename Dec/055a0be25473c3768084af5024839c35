Political leaders, elders and the security team from West Pokot county have agreed to collectively resolve conflicts along the border with Turkana. The efforts are aimed at ending the perennial challenges, which have led to lack of development in the area. The region has witnessed relative peace for the last three years. The leaders resolved to prevent youths from engaging in banditry, cattle theft and end conflict and wrangles along the border, and make sure all the stolen animals from both communities are returned to the owners. They asked residents to stop engaging in banditry and cattle rustling. Tension has remained high in the area after 52 goats were stolen from Kainuk in revenge for five cows stolen from Sarimach and taken to the neighboring Turkana county. The leaders who attended the weekend meeting include area governor Prof John Lonyangapuo, West Pokot county commissioner Apollo Okello and MPs Samuel Moroto (Kapenguria), Peter Lochakapong (Sigor) and Mark Lomunokol (Kacheliba). They held peace meetings at Nakwomoru, Kamunono, Kapelpok and Turkwel areas.
