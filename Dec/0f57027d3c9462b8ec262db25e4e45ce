Petroleum CS John Munyes has defended suspended Kenya Pipeline CEO Joe Sang saying the government did not lose money in the Kisumu Oil Jetty project. "No coin was lost in the Kisumu Oil Jetty project. I, however, leave the court and investigating team to do their job," Munyes told the Senate Energy Committee on Tuesday. He said tendering and execution of the project was above board. Five top KPC managers on Monday denied three counts relating to the loss of Sh1.9 billion in the construction of the Kisumu Oil Jetty. They are suspended CEO Joe Sang, Gloria Khafafa (company secretary), Vincent Cheruiyot (GM supply chain management), Billy Aseka (general manager infrastructure), and Nicholas Gitobu (procurement manager). Munyes said that they had estimated the project to consume Sh1.48 billion but issued a Sh1.7 billion tender to cover overheads. ''If you add taxes to Sh1.7 billion, it gives you a range of Sh1.9 billion. All this was approved by the board and the Treasury," Munyes said. The CS said the Oil Jetty was a presidential directive following an East Africa Community agreement to have one for effective transfer of oil products in the region.
