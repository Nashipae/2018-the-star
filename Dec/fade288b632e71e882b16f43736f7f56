Legendary rapper Nazizi Hirji says the most painful moment of her life was when she received news that her brother was dead. "It's now 12 years since he died. He was such a big support system in my music," Nazizi told Word Is on Friday. "I was on tour with Wyre and was in the car coming from Holland to Germany. That phone call was the most painful thing I had to go through in my life." Nazizi lost her brother, Feroz, in an accident that dealt a big blow to CMB (Cash Money Brothers), a group he had formed with Prezzo. Nazizi recently released a hit titled, Heart Of Stone. She will be featuring on Coke studio 2019. "The impact Coke Studio is bringing is making things possible by bringing artistes from different places and giving us a platform to perform, and that's a big deal for me. I've learnt that there is still gonna be room for improvement, even though I've been in the industry for 20 years," she said.
