Two suspects were yesterday charged with killing the father of Deputy President William Ruto’s spokesman Emmanuel Tallam. Silas Too and Hillary Korir denied killing Benjamin Koech in April. Eldoret High Court judge Olga Sewe ordered the two be detained at the Eldoret police station. The suspects’ plea taking had delayed for a month because they did not have a lawyer to represent them. They twice failed to take plea on consecutive appearances before justice Stephen Githinji. Too and Korir pleaded to be released on bond pending the hearing of the case but the judge adjourned the matter until May 6, 2019 when the application will be heard. Koech, 85, was killed on his way home in Cheptingting village, Lessos, Nandi county. “Your honour it’s not true at all,” Too said when the charge was read to him. The prosecution said the accused, jointly with others not before the court, waylaid and killed the old man. The deceased was from Simbi shopping centre where he operated a retail shop. He had been reported missing on the night of April 14. Villagers found his body in River Kipsigei after a search. A postmortem done at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital showed he was hit on the head with a blunt object. Inspector Maxwell Otieno from serious crime division conducted the investigation. His report indicated that Koech might have been killed elsewhere before the body was dumped in the river. “The suspects wanted to create the impression that the deceased had drowned which is not what actually happened,” the police report said.
