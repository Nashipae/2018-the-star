A needy but bright student from Masalani in Ijara subcounty, Garissa, is asking well wishers to help him join secondary school. Mohamed Abdilatiff, 15, from Hara Boarding Primary School, 20km from Masalani town, scored 390 marks topping Ijara subcounty. On Tuesday he officially got his letter where he had been selected to join Nairobi School, 500km away from home. His father, Abdifatah Ahmed, is a watchman at a local hardware while his mother is a housewife. When journalists visited their home in the outskirts of Masalani town, we found him seated outside their grass thatched house with his infant sister who was born during the second day of the KCPE exams. Mohamed, the first born in a family of seven and who looked visibly worried, appealed to well wishers to offer financial assistance by paying his school fees. “I worked so hard throughout my years in primary school to get good results. Unfortunately I may have nothing to smile about,” Mohamed said. His former head teacher Ahmed Ali says given a chance he can achieve his dreams and become an important person in the society. His father remained hopeful that his first born son will get assistance from well wishers. “I was first loosing hope. but your presence here has given me hope that come January next year my son will be in class,” Ahmed said His former head teacher Ahmed Ali showered Mohamed with praise saying that ‘given a chance he can achieve his dreams and become an important person in the society’. “He was one of the most disciplined and dedicated students I have ever taught in my teaching carrier,” Ali said
