Tanzanian songstress Nandy has revealed she convinced Willy Paul, alias Pozze, to change his style and adopt hers. The Aibu hitmaker said she declined Pozze’s first song and later gave him one of her own. “So we did Njiwa, he loved it and then we shot it,” she told Word Is last week. “I met Willy Paul when I came for a media tour in Kenya for my song Ninogeshe. He had a conversation with my manager before so when I came, it was the right time.” Nandy is set to collabo with Kenya’s Nadia Mukami in Coke Studio 2019. “This is my second time at Coke Studio. I feel so nice. The work I did last year has borne fruit, that why I’ve been called once again. This platform has helped me get known across the continent, so expect great things.”
