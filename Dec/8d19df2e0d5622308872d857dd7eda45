The FordKenya Kakamega branch has started a process that dewhip senator Boni Khalwale for supporting Deputy President William Ruto for President. The branch executive committee recommended disciplinary action against Khalwale, the party deputy leader, over what they termed “misconduct”. The branch last week said Khalwale’s association with the DP was personal and had nothing to do with party. The party early this week endorsed Moses Wetang’ula as its flagbearer in the next general election. Khalwale’s action is seen by the branch as attempt to sabotage his boss Wetang’ula. They want Khalwale disciplined including withdrawing his membership. Branch secretary Joseph Barasa accused Khalwale of running a secret team with which he “loiters around purporting to be party officials”. “Khalwale is on his own in what he is doing since that is not the party’s position. If it is business he is doing with the DP, it is his and not the party’s. We have recommended the party to summon Khalwale and discipline him,” Barasa said. Khalwale, Mumias East MP Ben Washiali, Kimilili’s Didmas Barasa and Sports CS Rashid Echesa led a delegation of Luhyas living in Kiambu, Kawangware, Kibera, Mathare, Kangemi and Kasarani to meet the DP at his Karen residence. Khalwale’s close association with the DP raised suspicion over the much touted merger between Ford Kenya and Musalia Mudavadi’s ANC, leading to the collapse of the union. The merger was to give birth to a new single political entity capable of uniting the Luhya Bloc vote ahead of the 2022 General Election. The branch officials asked Wetang’ula to re-engage Mudavadi and forge a working arrangement that will benefit the Luhya community and the nation. Barasa said candidates who hope to run on the party ticket have given a condition that Khalwale must leave the party first.
