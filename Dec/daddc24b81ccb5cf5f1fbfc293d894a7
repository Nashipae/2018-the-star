Three people were shot dead after thugs raided an M-Pesa shop in Shanzu, Mombasa county on Sunday evening. Four others were critically injured after the hooded two-man gang attacked a shop at Zimlati at about 7.30pm. Four others, who were part of a crowd that rushed to the shop on hearing gunshots, were critically injured. Two are at Coast General Hospital while two others at Mombasa Hospital ICU. Kisauni deputy county commissioner Kipchumba Rotich said the four sustained bullet injuries after one of the thugs shot indiscriminately at the crowd. He said one of the attackers posed as a customer before he opened fire. M-Pesa shops are busy at the moment due to the Christmas festivities. "That shooter must be very skillful," Rotich said of the gangsters adding that it is unclear whether the thugs succeeded in stealing any cash or not. Harry Gitau, a good Samaritan who rushed the injured to hospital, said sustained gunshot injuries to the eye, head, and stomach. Human Rights Group MUHURI rapid response officer Francis Auma condemned the killings. "When will this stop? Residents and police need to work out strategies to weed out criminals," Auma said. Rotich said that due to increased police presence in Kisauni, the gangs now are shifting operations to periphery areas, away from those deemed to be crime hot spots. "Businesses must undertake risk management. Police officers cannot be everywhere," he said. The county security committee chaired by regional coordinator Bernard Lemparamarai earlier told journalists of plans to ensure peace and security in Kisauni. Another high-level security meeting last week penned a 22-point resolution document to curb runaway insecurity in the county. The meeting chaired by governor Hassan Joho involved MPs, religious leaders, human rights groups and police bosses. Click here for the latest political news
