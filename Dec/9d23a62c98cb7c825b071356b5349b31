Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji has ordered the prosecution of formerÂ Kebs managing director Charles Ongwae, again. Embattled Ongwae is to be charged with abuse of office and neglect of duty that saw the state lose over Sh64.9 million in revenue in import improprieties. Ongwae and others are accused of being responsible for the misdeclaration and importation of contraband products. It is alleged that Gendipe enterprises and Rupai Trading Ltd together with their clearing agent Landmark Freight Services Ltd were helped by customs and Kebs officials to conceal goods they imported to evade tax and revenue due to the state. According to the DPP, a revaluation of the goods imported by the two enterprises from Dubai revealed that they had underpaid the customs authority, making the country lose a cumulative sum of Sh64, 944,112. Ongwae has been in and out of courts this year over for allowing subsidised fertiliser to be imported and over fake Kebs stamps. Others to be charged alongside Ongwae include Esther Wangui Watene, Ali Thuo Chuphi, Elizabeth Nyambura Kimani and 18 others.
