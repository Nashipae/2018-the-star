The government’s recovery circus for loss-making Uchumi Supermarkets must end. The
listed retailer, whose share value fell by 80 per cent in two years
from Sh5 in 2016 to Sh0.96 last week, owes suppliers Sh3.6 billion. And it still expects Treasury to pay Sh600 million. Uchumi
posted losses of Sh895.12 million in the half year ending December 31,
2017, a 63.55 per cent increase from a loss of Sh547.3 in the same
period in 2016. It recently urged the Capital Markets Authority
to delay announcing end-year results in anticipation of an unnamed
investor. Attempts to attract a US investor last year failed. The
troubles at Uchumi and the implosion of privately held former market
leader Nakumatt have opened the door to foreign chains with higher
standards — France’s Carrefour, The Game and South Africa's ShopRite
have slammed the door on its failed predecessors. Although it announced a new  team to help restructuring last week, not much is expected, considering past failures. That's why the government should admit Uchumi has outlived its usefulness and privatise or shut it down. You can't do the same thing over and over and expect different results.
