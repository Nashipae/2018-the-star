Nairobi, Kiambu, Kakamega and Mombasa are among the counties that will receive heavy rains during this festive season, the weatherman has said. The Kenya Meteorological Department on Tuesday said some parts of the country will experience near-average rainfall within the same period. In a statement signed by director Stella Aura, the department said Kericho, Nandi, Kakamega, Eldoret, Kitale, Nakuru, Narok and Kajiado are among the areas that will experience heavy rains. Other areas include Nyeri, Murang'a, Nyandarua, Kiambu, Embu, Meru, Nanyuki and Machakos. Makindu, Voi, Taita Taveta, Mombasa, Kwale, Mtwapa, Kilifi, Malindi and Lamu are also in the same category. Aura said Lowdar, Lokichoggio, Lokitaung, Kisii and Kisumu will receive depressed rainfall. She said though Narok county is likely to experience rainfall up to the end of December and into early January, most parts of Nyanza, Western, North Rift counties and Central highlands including Nairobi are expected to cease during the third to fourth week of December. As a result, Aura said farmers should expect poor crop performance in most agricultural areas. She said the situation is attributed to the poor rainfall performance experienced in October and November. Aura said foliage and pasture conditions in the pastoral areas of Northern, Northwestern and Northeastern Kenya are expected to slightly diminish due to expected sunny and dry conditions for most of December. She said water levels in the Seven Forks and Turkwel hydroelectric power generating dams are likely to be maintained. "This climate outlook is based on the prevailing and expected Sea Surface Temperature Anomalies over Pacific and Atlantic Oceans," reads the statement. Aura said the current El Nino-like conditions in the Pacific Ocean and the near-neutral Indian Ocean Dipole have also been considered. Click here for the latest political news
