Wajir governor Mohamed Abdi on Friday replaced three senior officials who were arrested last week over corruption allegations. He announced the changes on his social media accounts. Abdullahi Hassan Maalim replaced Ahmed Sahal as county secretary, while Abdihakim Billow replaced Daud Abdullahi as finance CEC. Adan Kamoy, who is currently deputy head of treasury, took over from Jeff Kithinji Mworia as head of treasury. “I have made the changes in the offices of the County Secretary and the Treasury to improve services and allow the court to determine the graft case before it. The changes take immediate effect,” Abdi posted. He called for a culture of “zero tolerance for corruption. Any employee involved with corruption shall be dealt with firmly, he said, adding he supports all agencies mandated to fight the vice to unravel the truth.” He appealed to the public to stop speculating and await the outcome of investigations The Ethics and Anti-Corruption commission alleges that the officials improperly used Sh26 million from the county government imprest account. The three appeared before Nairobi anti-corruption court Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti on Monday and were released on a Sh1.5 million cash bail or a Sh2 million bond each. They were ordered to deposit their passports. The case will be mentioned on December 10 to fix a pre-trial date. Their arrests triggered mixed reactions from residents and leaders. Some called the cases “stage-managed and meant to portray the county in bad light”. Resident Mohamed Siyat said the arrests “lack procedure and professional integrity. They are only meant to create headlines to paint Abdi in a bad light.” The fact that the allegations find their way to the media before actual investigation supports this assertion, he said.
