The Baringo County Choir won in the just-concluded Kenya Music and Cultural Festival in Meru after sleeping in their bus due to lack of funds. Music Director Harrison Okiri said the 32-member team could not afford rooms with the Sh3,000 allowance each person received. “We arrived late and tired but we managed to take the lead with the song “Kenya my Pride” of class 621”, Okiri said on Friday. The 92nd edition of the national festival, which ran from November 23 to 29, attracted over 30,000 participants from across the country. The choir said their ambition to attend national events and entertain President Uhuru Kenyatta has been obstructed endlessly by cartels. “We feel some cartels are sabotaging us because of late we are not being invited to the national functions,” Okiri said. However ,county Education, and Culture Executive Thomas Ole’ Nongonop said he has not heard of injustices against the Choir. He said such discrimination was unacceptable. The group, which was established in 2014 under the former Governor Benjamin Cheboi, incorporates 42 members, mostly jobless youths.
