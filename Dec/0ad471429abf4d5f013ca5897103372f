Nyanza Ford Kenya party members have complained over poor leadership at its national office which is led by party Moses Wetang’ula. They accused the current party leaders of being self-centred, saying they lack focus and have made Ford-K less vibrant. The members were led by the party founders in the region Felix Minda, John Auma, Gaston Owino (Kisumu), Thomas Nyabote (Kisii), Andrew Aduda (Siaya), and Elijah Odiwuor (Muhoroni). The leaders also want the National Executive Council declared illegal for being in office beyond their legal term limit of four years. Members of the council have been in office since 2010. The leaders said the council should be disbanded to pave way for fresh elections. Minda, who is also the Kisumu Ford-K vice chairman, yesterday said that the party has not conducted party elections for the last eight years. “The party does not have the requisite 24 active branch offices as per the law due to poor leadership at the national office,” he said. Minda challenged Bungoma Senator Wetang’ula to take charge of the party and steer it clear of the problems faced by the members. He decried the state of neglect of the party despite its rich history.
