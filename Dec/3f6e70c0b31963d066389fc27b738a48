Former US first lady Michelle Obama has ended Hillary Clinton's 17-year run as America's most admired woman.

The Queen finished in the top 10 for the 50th time, Gallup said. Former President Barack Obama was most admired man for the 11th year in a row. President Donald Trump finished second for the fourth consecutive year. The poll has been carried out every year since 1946, with the exception of 1976. The 1,025 adults surveyed were asked to name the man and woman living anywhere in the world whom they admire the most.
