A court has granted the Nairobi City County government orders to demolish Grand Manor Hotel in Gigiri. The move is a blow to businessman Praful Kumar who has been putting a spirited fight to save the property. The court held City Hall's argument that the hotel, being adjacent to United Nation offices, is a security threat. Kumar hit the headlines after Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission detectives arrested him for bribery. This was after the businessman attempted to bribe Governor Mike Sonko at his Kanamai residence in Kwale county. He is said to have gone to meet Sonko with a Sh5 million offer to allow the hotels' expansion before EACC officers were called in. Kumar was on August 24 charged with three counts of bribery before senior principal magistrate Henry Nyakweba. He denied the charges and is out on Sh1 million bond. The Nairobi government on August 16 stopped works at the premises near the United Nation offices in Gigiri.
