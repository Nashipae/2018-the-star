Nasa leader Raila Odinga has been asked to ensure that his handshake with the President benefits Western Kenya. Navakholo MP Emmanuel Wangwe (above) said the region supported the ODM leader in the past three presidential elections and it was time he reciprocated by getting development projects for residents. “It’ll amount to political conmanship if Raila comes to tell us about the Building Bridges Initiative. That’s already in the public domain. We want him to come with goodies accompanied by President Uhuru Kenyatta like they did in Nyanza last week,” Wangwe said. “We’ve already seen what Uhuru, who received five per cent of the Luhya votes, has done in Western. We expect to see more development now that Raila, who got the bulk support of 95 per cent, has joined him.” Uhuru and Raila visited Nyanza together and launched a number of projects, including the Sh2 billion Ahero interchange that connects Kisumu, Kericho and Kisii. Wangwe urged Raila to ensure the government prioritises revival of the troubled sugar industry.
