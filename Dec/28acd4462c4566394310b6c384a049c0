Murang’a MCAs have passed a Bill that will give the county government control of the water sector. The passage is a major blow to businessman Peter Munga who has been fighting for the control of the Murang’a Water and Sanitation Company (Muwasco). The MCAs passed the Bill on Thursday, a day after a section of the reps called for the deferral of its second reading. The Bill was eventually tabled after minutes of shouting matches between the MCAs who traded accusations of being compromised. Environment and Water committee chairperson Jane Wanjiru had on Wednesday called for the committee to be given more time saying in its current state, the Bill contained many contentious clauses that required to be amended before it goes for the second reading. She noted that the committee had received memos from the Water Service Regulatory Authority (Wasreb) and water companies which needed to be studied together with locals’ recommendations given through public participation. Her calls were supported by 20 MCAs while 22 others voted for the tabling of the bill. On Thursday, Wanjiru then tabled the bill for third reading and it was passed by 30 MCAs. Kimorori MCA Amos Murigi had opposed the Bill saying majority of the residents who gave their views during public participation had rejected it. Immediately after it was passed, water CEC Paul Macharia picked it for presentation to governor Mwangi wa Iria.
