Budalangâ€™i MP Raphael Wanjala has raised the flag that he will submit a social audit report to the DPP for action over the mysterious loss of Sh47 million project funds. According to the MP, a total of Sh5.5 million in Bunyala Central ward was paid to undisclosed individuals by the former CDF management. He was speaking at Mubwayo trading centre during the release of a social audit report for the period 2007/17 on Thursday as mandated by the CDF Act. Ababu Namwamba is the immediate former area MP. Wanjala said the former CDF committee had failed to exercise transparency and accountability in the utilisation of the project funds. He said the most of the projects identified by the ward residents during public participation forums had not taken off. A total of Sh723.6 million had been allocated for the same. Wanjala singled out a health centre among other projects that had been allocated Sh1.7 million for the construction of a mortuary. The morgue is non-existent.
