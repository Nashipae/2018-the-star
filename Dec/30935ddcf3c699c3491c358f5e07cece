Kisumu residents have appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta to commission works on the dilapidated Mamboleo-Chemelil-Miwani road when he visits the lakeside town on Thursday. The president will be in Kisumu for the launch of the Universal Health Coverage. He will preside over the event at Mamboleo Showground before touring other areas in the region. Kisumu matatu owners associations secretary George Alaro said the road was last repaired more than 20 years ago. "The bad situation of the major link road is hurting our businesses through transportation delays, damages on fleet and products, and high fuel costs." He said matatu operators and private vehicle owners incur high costs in repairing their vehicles. Alaro said that if upgraded, the road will reduce the amount spent by travellers heading to Nandi county and Nairobi via the Londiani-Koru road. Click here for the latest political news
