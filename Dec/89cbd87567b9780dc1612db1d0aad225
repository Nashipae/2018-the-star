Eight students of Ambira High School who were arrested for alleging they had stolen the KCSE examination have been released. They were freed on Monday by an Ukwala court for lack of evidence. The judge told the students with identity cards to leave them at Ugunja police station. Those who did not have IDs were asked to leave their parents' or guardian's phone numbers. The prosecutor said even though the students had been released, investigations on alleged exam cheating will continue. The students were arrested on Monday last week after appearing in a video boasting about how they stole the examination.

On Monday last week when they appeared before resident magistrate Gladys Adhiambo, they did not take plea. The prosecutor requested for seven days to investigate the matter. The application was granted and the students were detained at Ugunja police station. Earlier, Kenya National Examination Council chairman George Magoha said he regretted the moral decay among some students. Prof Magoha, who spoke last Monday to journalists at Rangala Girls, said if the Ambira students were found to have cheated, action will be taken against them. “We have already prescribed what we do to people who cheat and that is what we are going to do,” he added. He, however, said they will not profile any school, but will let the law takes its course. Click here for the latest political news
