The Association of Civilian Gun Owners has moved to court seeking orders to suspend Interior CS Fred Matiang’i's directive on fresh firearms vetting. In a letter on October 5, Matiang’i said that all civilian gun owners must undergo mandatory fresh vetting in the next three months. The gun owners have also sued the Cabinet Secretary for suspending their outdoor shooting range license. Among other issues they want quashed include the directive for fresh vetting and appointment of new members to the Firearm and Licensing Board. They have also said the decision by Matiang’i that declared the Sterling-Patchett MK5, CZ Scorpion EVo 3 and MP5 as prohibited firearms is unlawful. NGAO argues that the move by the State to suspend the license for their outdoor shooting range in Gitata farm at Kirigiti, Kiambu is illegal. As a result of the closure of the shooting range, NGAO members say they have missed out on several local and international shooting sports events. They cited the Licks Mashujaa Day shoot held annually in October which is the biggest events their calendar. "NGAO hots the IDPA Kenya fraternity and its members are entitled to participate and represent Kenya in global IDPA sport shooting completions and to access periodic shooting proficiency, self-defense and safety training," they argue. They also argue that Matiang’i disregarded mandatory provisions of section 3(2) of the Firearms Act by failing to appoint a representative from NGAO to the board. "No representative from a private members group of lawfully registered gun owners, being NGAO was appointed to the Board," the court documents reads.
