City Hall has cautioned Public Service Vehicles operators to be alert over fraudsters as they pay for seasonal parking tickets. According to a notice issued out on Wednesday by the Acting Nairobi county secretary Pauline Kahiga, all payments regarding seasonal parking are to pay through the bank in order to avoid impersonators. "This is a directive to all Saccos to make payments directly to the Nairobi City County's Cooperative Bank account, present the banking slip to the Chief Cashier and avail the resultant receipt to the Director of Parking Services Department for processing," the notice read. The notice further warns that "No other means of payment including through agencies will be accepted. You are further cautioned to be wary of fraudsters, cartels, impersonators, as the county shall take requisite action against any Sacco found culpable". All the slips must be issued from the bank and City Hall claims serious action shall be taken against any fake documents presented. PSVs normally pay for their seasonal parking tickets towards the end of every month. City Hall also said that it is in the process of updating its data for better and efficient management of payment for seasonal tickets by Saccos. According to PSVs owners, they pay Sh 7,250 seasonal parking ticket for a 51-seater matatu, 33-seater Sh 5,250 while a 14-seater they part with Sh 3,200 every month.
