Kangundo MP Fabian Kyule was on Saturday among 46 motorists arrested for drunk driving. Kyule crashed into a wall of a club as he attempted to drive off after the police flagged down his car. Inspector General Joseph Boinnet in a statement to the media, said the lawmaker wanted to beat up the guards who had rushed to assist him in his drunken state. Kyule has been detained at Parklands police station. "He should thank the police for arresting him as he was totally sloshed. We shudder to imagine what could have happened on his way," Boinett said. "Let him enjoy our free full board facilities," he added. Cops long the Mombasa - Nairobi highway, in collaboration with EACC officers also managed to net five cases of overspeeding. One driver, Fazal Ahmed, was nabbed for offering a bribe to the police. "The rule remains, do not drink and drive as you imperil your own life, as well as other innocent road users," Boinett said.
