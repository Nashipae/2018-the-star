Dennis Andere and Ron Ojala were crowned this year’s Mr and Miss Kibera at a colourful event that marked the end of a three-day Amani Festival held in the Kibra Day Grounds. The annual event uses sports and arts to change perceptions and develop leadership skills among the youth and children towards nationalism and peaceful co-existence through a celebration of diversity. Dennis, aka Baqteria or Ghost Rider, is from Sarang'ombe in Kibera. The renowned boda boda operator believes in being simple and unique. He hopes his title will inspire other young people, especially boda boda operators, to believe in themselves and that they also have something they can contribute to the community. Nineteen-year-old Ron said, “Positive thinking cultivates an environment that’s full of solutions and endless possibilities. Become the kind of leader that people would follow voluntarily even if you had no title or position. Mould yourself to become a brand ambassador of your own mindset." Annette Awuor, a contestant, “We were never in the contest to compete with each other, but we were all there to complete each other.”
