A man was killed in Nyaronge village, Nyamira county, on Tuesday night after his wife set their home on fire after finding out he had married a second woman. Johnson Mageto worked as a conductor in Keroka town. Keroka OCPD Eliud Njiru said the first wife, Jackline Kerubo, ran away from her matrimonial home three months earlier and only returned after getting information from neighbours that her husband had married another woman. Upon returning home on Christmas day, Kerubo found the other woman who said she did not know Mageto was married. The 'newly married' woman had to spend the night at Mageto's mother's house for fear of being attacked by the first wife. At around 1am on Wednesday, Mageto's family was woken up by smoke from a fire. Mageto's house was in flames and efforts to save him were futile. The new bride fled and Mageto's body was taken to the Gucha Hospital mortuary in Keroka as police launched investigations. OCPD Eliud Njiru urged residents to resolve family issues in a sober manner. "This is quite unfortunate. In case of a misunderstanding in our families, let us try to handle matters in a way that can promote peace in the society," he said.
