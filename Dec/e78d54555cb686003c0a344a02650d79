Kiambu governor Ferdinand Waititu has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to sack the National Transport Safety Authority director general Francis Meja for frustrating investors in the transport industry. Speaking at the county headquarters when he hosted matatu sacco chairmen drawn from 9 counties, he faulted Meja for ordering the phasing out of 14 seater matatus in the country. He termed the move as oppressive and retrogressive claiming that it was a calculated scheme to impoverish investors in the sector, most of whom are from the Mt Kenya region. ‘He is very arrogant and knows nothing to do with the transport industry and we can foresee him planning to kill our people’s livelihoods in collaboration with cartels who intend to buy buses and phase out 14 seaters,’ he said. He also took a swipe at his Nairobi counterpart Mike Sonko for barring PSVs from accessing the CBD. Click here for
