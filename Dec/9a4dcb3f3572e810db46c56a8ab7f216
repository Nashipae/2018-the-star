The Judiciary comes in last. I will tell you for a fact that if investigations are not done properly, if proper documentation is not presented in court, if prosecutors don't do their job properly, justice will not be served. The role of a judge or magistrate is simple: Look at the issues, look at the facts then deliver a judgment or ruling. The role of the judiciary is not to investigate. The role of the judiciary is to look at cases and make a determination based on the evidence. It is the police's role to investigate. The prosecution mandate lies with the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is the role of the DPP to prosecute cases. That is in no way the mandate of the courts. It is worth noting that in the whole justice system, each state agency must do their work properly. When we talk about bail terms, we must be cognisant of the fact that it is within the constitutional right of any suspect brought before court to get bail. You can't just hold people for the sake of it. At the end of the day, a judge or magistrate looks at the crime committed and the risk inherent. Regarding issues involving corruption, as much as the suspects are not flight risks, as far as they are in the country and not going anywhere, I don't see any reason for them not being accorded their right to bail. Justice must not only be done but also must be seen to be done in graft cases. That is the rule of law. We must protect the Constitution. We must look up to the Judiciary to deliver proper judgment. But as I said, all the state agencies must do their job. The President has the right to give his opinion because at the end of the day, this is his legacy as well. I am quite sure that everyone is keen to fighting this dragon called corruption but the courts come in last. The Law Society of Kenya Vice President spoke to the Star
