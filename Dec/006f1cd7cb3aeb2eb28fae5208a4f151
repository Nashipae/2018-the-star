Teachers will go on strike when schools re-open for the first term on January 3, their union has said. In a circular to its branch executive secretaries on Sunday, the Kenya National Union of Teachers' Secretary General Wilson Sossion said their members will not report to work because their demands have not been met. "We shall not resume duty until all our issues are resolved to the full satisfaction of the Kenyan teachers," he said. The union said the Teachers Service Commission must address the delocalisation policy, teachers' promotions, teachers' professional development modules and scrap performance contracting. On December 18, the TSC ignored protests from teachersâ€™ unions and announced the transfer of 3,094 head teachers countrywide. Head teachers of primary and secondary schools who were moved, had been at one workplace for more than nine years. They were to hand over by December 28.

The Cabinet Secretary formed a conciliation team to help mediate between the commission and the union. However, Knut said, "The notice is effective and the strike is legal and also a human right entitlement that we must all participate in." Sossion told all the teachers affiliated to the union to take part in the industrial action and should not show up when schools resume on January 3. Following the strike circular, it appears the conciliation efforts by the Charles Omanga-led team have all but collapsed. Sossion told teachers to participate in the strike as a duty "to stand up in solidarity to defend the interest of the teaching service in Kenya." Click here for the latest political news
