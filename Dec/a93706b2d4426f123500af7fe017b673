Homa Bay traders who lost goods worth thousands of shillings to floods in Soko Mjinga have threatened not to pay rates if the drainage at the market is not fixed. More than 300 traders were affected by the Sunday night downpour. Their chairperson, Joshua Ouma asked the county government to unblock the drainage system. “Some of the drains in the market are blocked by soil. They cannot hold large volumes of water from estates in Homa Bay town,” he said. Grocer Marylyn Akinyi on Monday told journalists that she lost all her fruits and vegetables. “The stall was swept away by floods. A sewer burst and the waste drained in the market,” she said. Homa Bay Township assistant chief Duncan Okech blamed the topography of the area for the disaster. “The structures often contribute to flooding and muddy conditions,” he said. The market is on the lower side of the town, next to Lake Victoria where most of the town’s sewer drain their contents. The traders said non-remittance of taxes would serve as a reminder to the county administration to provide services to rate payers.
