The nurses strike last year resulted in increased transmission of HIV from mothers to children in Murang’a county. Murang’a Health executive Joseph Mbai said the nurses union issued orders to its members to stop testing expectant mothers during the strike that lasted five months, causing a sharp increase in the number of infected infants. Speaking at Nyakianga Hospital during a medical camp organised by area MP Peter Kimari on Sunday, Mbai said testing expectant mothers is a vital process in ensuring their children do not contract the disease from them. “During the strike, many expectant mothers were not tested which caused many children to be born with the disease,” Mbai said. According to the National Aids and STIs Control Programme (Nascop), 1,232 children contracted the disease in the county during the strike. Mbai said the strike also increased home deliveries as many mothers could not afford medical care in private facilities, which further increased the transmissions. “When you refuse to do a test and allow a child to be born sick yet you have taken a vow to fight for the health of all, that is very wrong,” Mbai said. Kimari said that the county is set to launch a campaign that will mobilise expectant mothers to have at least six antenatal check-ups and ensure they deliver in hospitals. He expressed concerns that a large number of infected infants are yet to be diagnosed due to the failure by their mothers to take them to health centres.
