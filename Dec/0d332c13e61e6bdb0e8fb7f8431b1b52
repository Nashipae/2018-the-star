The Fifth Sanaa Theatre Awards took place on Tuesday at the Nairobi Cultural Centre, where different actors were awarded for their plays and narratives. The awards recognise the efforts of the actors and narrators, and the best plays, as voted for mostly by the audience. The director, Mr Orido, is the initiator of the awards. He started it five years ago and wanted to appreciate the acting industry. Among the winners this year were Annabel (Best Narrative) and Jesus Christ the Superstar (Best Musical).
