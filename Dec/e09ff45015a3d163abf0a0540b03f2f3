The government is yet to reinstate my security detail, West Pokot governor John Lonyangapuo has said. Lonyangapuo said on Thursday that the law dictates that a governor is supposed to be protected. "You can only withdraw security if a governor is a threat to the nation or is treasonous. So, I don't understand why removing roadblocks resulted in my security being withdrawn," he told KTN. The governor said some "draconian" laws need to be reviewed so that "someone in an office does not wake up and do want he wants." "Kenyans need to know that our Constitution grants us our rights," he said. Lonyangapuo's security was withdrawn after he removed a police roadblock and freed a boda boda rider in Chepararia on November 28. He accused the police of chaining the rider and forcing him to sleep on the tarmac road.

(I'm the county boss and I must make sure the law is followed)," the governor said. "If you find someone is disorderly you have to bring sense into them." "I did that and people were not happy in Nairobi, they withdrew my security they have not returned it up to now." Lonyangapuo questioned why there are so many officers manning roadblocks and blamed them for harassing motorists in the name of implementing the ‘Michuki rules’. "Which insecurity is on the highway. It looks like some people in Nairobi think this place is somewhere where someone can come and deposit bad manners, because these people are primitive," he said.
