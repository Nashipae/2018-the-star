The Ministry of Education has pushed school opening date by a day to January 3. The move is to allow learners and teachers who had traveled for holidays time to return to their institutions, the ministry said. In a circular signed by basic education director general Elyas Abdi, all Pre-primary, primary, Secondary, and Teachers' Training colleges will start their first term on January 3. Basic Education PS Belio Kipsang had earlier in the year issued a circular scheduling the first term to start on January 2 and run through to April 5. Half-term was announced to begin on February 18 to February 24.Â First and second term are expected to run for 14 weeks. Third term will run for nine weeks for primary schools and 10 weeks for secondary schools. The school holiday and term dates released by the Ministry of Education are followed by primary and secondary schools as well as colleges across the country. Click here for the latest political news
