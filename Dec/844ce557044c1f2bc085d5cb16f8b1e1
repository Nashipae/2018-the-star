City Hall will not grant any rates and interest waivers to defaulters. Through an advert in local dailies on Friday, the county said it is mandated by the Public Finance Management Act to levy rates, fees and charges to finance services to all city residents. “The Nairobi County Government wishes to inform all property owners within Nairobi and the general public that there is an ongoing clampdown by the county government on rate defaulters,” read the notice. The county called for timely payment in order to plan for provision of services. Last month the county launched a crackdown on defaulters who owed it up to Sh15 billion. In the first phase, eight properties with arrears amounting to Sh7.8 million were clamped down. The areas covered included the CBD, Kilimani, Thika Road, Ngara and Parklands.
