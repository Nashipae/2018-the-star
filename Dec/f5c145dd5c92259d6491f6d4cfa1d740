Former Kiambu governor William Kabogo has requested President Uhuru Kenyatta to allow use of biometric system in the 2019 Census. He told the Star that biometrics will ensure the government acquires reliable data. “There is no way a county like Kiambu can be compared to regions like Marsabit. I don’t see why they can get more money than us,” he said in an interview. The census will be conducted in August next year. The national Treasury has said it might cost Sh18.5 billion. The last census in 2009, recorded a population of 38,610,097 people.
