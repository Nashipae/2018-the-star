There was low turn-out for the Kenya Defense Forces recruitment excise in Mandera county as candidates kept off due to low KCSE grades. The minimum grade for recruitment to KDF is D (plain) but many candidates aspiring to join the military from the region had below the required academic qualifications. No women turned up for the exercise as they decided to skip apparently over low academic grades. Only 50 candidates turned up for the recruitment with just 17 of them meetingÂ the required academic qualifications. Lieutenant Colonel Paul Aruasa who spearheaded the recruitment exercise, said they would only deploy candidates who met all the requirements of a minimum D (plain) and aged between 18 and 26 years. The recruits are also required to be medically fit, over 55 kilograms, 1.6 metres tall and with no criminal records besides being a Kenyan citizen. Aruasa said some Mandera county wards lacked even a single candidate attending the recruitment but said slots would be shared among the available candidates. The colonel revealed KDF was recruiting ex-military personnel who met the required qualifications with only one candidate, Ismail Abdinoor Jimale attending the drive. Aruasa said Jimale met all the qualifications and would soon get back to the forces. "We are also recruiting ex-National Youth Service (NYS) candidates but unluckily the ones who attended the drive here do not meet the required age requirement of between 35-45 years as many of them were below 30 years of age. The age requirement for ex-KDF personnel is between 30 and 55 years but in this category we have only one candidate," he lamented. Click here for the latest political news
