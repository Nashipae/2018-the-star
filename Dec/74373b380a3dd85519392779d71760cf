The man and a woman were travelling from Meru to Wamba town. Relative Kennedy Lesowapir said, “We are not giving up until we find them, even if it's their bodies." Area MCA Lucas Lekwale said residents have complained that the river has claimed many lives since 2003. He asked the national government to build a better bridge along the river to prevent future disasters. Etes Amu, who has lost six relatives after they drowned in the river, said a bridge needs to be built urgently. Samburu Administration Police Commander John Karanja, who is leading the search team, said they are having a difficult time because of siltation in the river.
