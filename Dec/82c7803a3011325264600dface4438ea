Police are investigating an incident whereby an administration police officer committed suicide after killing his lover on Thursday. Isiolo county commissioner John Ondego said the officer came from duty and proceeded to have lunch at a canteen operated by his lover. Ondego said minutes later, the two who were in early 40s started quarreling following which the officer shot dead the woman and then turned the gun on himself. The canteen is located within the Administration police compound and the victims had reportedly cohabited for more than a year. Ondego urged officers to always explore more appropriate ways of resolving disputes other than murdering spouses or committing suicide. Cases of police officers killing their lovers and then committing suicide are on the increase in Kenya.
