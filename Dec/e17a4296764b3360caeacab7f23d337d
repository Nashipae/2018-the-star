The EACC has directed three top Kenya Ports Authority retirement benefit scheme officials to surrender themselves to the police over corruption allegations. Outgoing CEO Halakhe Waqo said retirement benefits scheme trustees Frederick Oyugi, Maurice Amahwa and Harry Arigi should be arraigned on Thursday on abuse of office charges in Mombasa. “EACC has been investigating allegations of fraudulent acquisition of public funds at the Kenya Ports Authority retirement benefits scheme by way of purchase of land in Kikambala near Vipingo, Kilifi measuring 100 acres at a sum of Sh 700 million at an inflated cost,” Waqo said. He said the three will be charged alongside Ephraim Maina, the Director of Seline Consultants Limited and Kikambala Development Company Limited. “The commission concluded investigations and forwarded the file to the Director of public prosecutions who upon review concurred with the recommendations of the commission and gave consent of arrest and prosecution of the suspects in court with various offences,” he said.
