Nacada board member Chipukeezy on Monday said alcohol is still the number one most abused drug in Kenya. Speaking at KICC during the first international conference on drugs demand reduction, he said: "There is an emergence of the use of hard drugs in our urban areas, especially Nairobi. Most young people lack mentors in life and end up indulging in drugs, and alcohol is still number one, although hard drugs like cocaine are also abused." He emphasised the need to stay away from drugs. "It is easy to start drinking and abusing other drugs, but very hard to stop. It is therefore important to take care because the hardest and expensive thing to do is to rehabilitate yourself, and that is why we are losing so many lives," Chipukeezy said. He said the agency wants to get more ideas and know what needs to be done to try to fight the menace, and how best to fight it, terming the approach a way of interacting with different people from different countries. "We cannot solve this problem in our offices. Therefore, we need to come out and talk to the people on the ground about drugs, and let's reduce the talks and increase the actions." Chipukeezy was appointed a member of the board of directors by President Uhuru Kenyatta in June.
