Allocation of money to the counties should be based entirely on population and not the size of land of the devolved units, Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tong’i said yesterday. “The allocation of shared revenue to counties as it was done by the CRA was skewed,” Tong’i said. The MP said Kenyans voted for devolution to have resources brought to them and not to be deprived of the same. He urged leaders to reject the formula used by the Commission for Revenue Allocation because it will disadvantage counties with high population. “I am foreseeing a situation where counties with the highest population are going to suffer if the formula will be applied. I call upon all leaders to reject this,” legislator said.
