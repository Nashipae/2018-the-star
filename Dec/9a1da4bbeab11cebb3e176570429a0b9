Candidates who had not performed exceptionally well in their primary education have stolen the show in the just released results, proving that a 100 per cent transition is possible. For instance, Kamau Josphat Mwangi had 278 marks in KCPE but scored A- in KCSE. This is the first time that the ministry analysed top 100 most improved candidates in relation to their KCPE performance. Kyulu Richard had 257 marks in KCPE but scored B+ in the just released results. Similarly, Osman Haret Gedi had 271 marks in KCPE but scored B+ in KCSE. Overall, the 2018 KCSE examination was free of leakages. However a few cases that were found will be dealt with with the full force of the law, Education CS Amina Mohamed said. Amina said the sterling performance showed that the government’s agenda of transitioning 100 per cent from primary to secondary was possible. “The results show that those who had performed poorly in KCPE can do well,” she said. During the 2018 Jamhuri Day celebrations on December 12, President Uhuru Kenyatta directed the ministry to work with relevant government agencies to ensure that all the candidates who sat the KCPE 2018 examination join secondary schools. This was under under the 100 per cent transition programme.

Mbugu Lydia Nyambura had scored 282 marks in primary. She however managed a score of B+ in the just released exams. Teresia Kalekye had 254 in her Standard Eight examination but scored B+ in her KCSE exam. During the 2018 KCSE examination, there were 660,204 candidates who sat the examination. Of all the candidates, 338,628 were male, while 321,576 were female, representing 51.29 percent and 48.71 per cent of the total candidature respectively. This shows that there has been consistence towards achieving gender parity in KCSE examination enrollment. Suuda Mohamed Salat had a paltry 133 marks in KCPE but managed a C+ in KCSE. Most of those who performed poorly before showing good marks in KCSE are from county and sub-county schools across the country. Brian Kipkemoi on the other hand had 285 marks in KCPE and managed a B+ in KCSE. The CS said the government has enhanced financing to over 150,000 TVET trainees at an estimated cost of Sh10.5 billion. She said HELB is currently funding students in 74 TVET institutions and is expected to progressively increase funding to TVET trainees in all the 203 TVET institutions across the country. “I encourage more KCSE graduates to apply for admission in approved Ministry of Education TVET Institutions,” she said.
