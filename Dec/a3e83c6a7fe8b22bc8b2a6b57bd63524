Wazito coach Mohammed Dmchulla has welcomed the acquisition of the National Super League side by Dubai-based tycoon Ricardo Badoer. The millionaire, who doubles up as the president of Spanish based CD Ursaria FC purchased Wazito on undisclosed terms in a move which Dmchulla says will boost the welfare of his players and aid them meet their target of being reinstated back to the top flight. Wazito were axed from the Kenya Premier League last season after finishing second from bottom. After landing a shirt sponsorship deal with Sumac Investments, the club shopped for experienced players and their impact is already being felt having won the opening two league matches. Among the players who crossed to the University of Nairobi affiliated club are U-23 midfielder Teddy Osok, last season’s NSL top scorer Stephen Owusu, Mt Kenya’s duo of Joe Waithira and Eugene Ambulwa. The club also reunited with Zachary Gathu and Dennis Gicheru who all returned from KCB. Dmchulla, who assumed the leadership mantle from his boss Frank Ouna, said: “It’s priceless to have the welfare of players catered for —meaning they will solely focus on delivering on the pitch. We have a target of gaining promotion and I believe if the players are settled, we will be able to achieve it.” The youthful coach expressed pleasure with the quality of his players and remained hopeful of returning to the top flight. “I am pleased with the quality of players at my disposal and I believe our target is realistic. I am looking to get the best out them and rise the standards of the club in terms of performance and most importantly guide them to be professionals. The NSL is tougher than KPL and it calls for good preparations and assembling a strong playing unit.”
