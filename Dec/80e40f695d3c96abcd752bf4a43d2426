Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company has said it improving water supply in Lang’ata constituency. Nawasco Managing Director Nahashon Muguna said the company started on Monday to constructwater chambers from which it will connect all pipes leading to Kibera and disconnect them from the main pipeline. “This will allow the water company to control water between Kibera and Lang’ata without any violence and also avoid water shortage which could lead to outbreak of water born diseases,” he said. Construction is expected to take at least 10 to 15 days. He also said that the pipeline serving Lang’ata passes through Kibera where cartels have diverted water from the pipes. Lang’ata MP Nixon Korir had earlier raised concerns of possible collusion between Nawasco and the county Government to sabotage water supply in Lang’ata. For a long-term solution, another pipeline is being constructed to improve water supply to Lang’ata and stop conflict between Kibera and Lang’ata.. Muguna said the pipeline is being done from Kabete to Uthiru then to Karen Shopping Centre. It will be tied to the existing pipeline along Lang’ata Road. The project is to be completed by end of this month (December). Currently, Nairobi is experiencing water rationing in which water is supplied on certain days in the estates. Muguna said that rationing does not meaning punishing users. He rubbished claims that tcompany’s staff are part of the cartels manipulating water supply.
