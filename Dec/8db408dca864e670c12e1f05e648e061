The KCB rugby team came off an empathic win over their rivals Homeboyz RFC on Saturday afternoon at the Lions Den, Ruaraka, beating them with a convincing margin of 34-15 at the end of the 80 minutes of play. The bankers were solid in defence as they were in attack with flyhalf Billy Isabwa opening the scoring after great build up play from the forwards and the back line. Darwin Mukidza added the extra two points. KCB dominated the first half but Homeboyz brought their 'A' game in the second half and got on the scoreboard through scrumhalf Mohammed Omolo and Henry Ayah with the conversation. Darwin Mukidza and Peter Waitere sealed the game off with two great tries to make it 34-15 in favour of KCB. Coach Curtis Olago said that he was more than impressed with the boys' performance adding that there is still room for improvement as they go into the Christmas break. "The technical bench have to realign and make sure that they come back even stronger when they take on the Mean Machine on the January 12th, 2019," Olago said.
