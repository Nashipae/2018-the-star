Moi University’s School of Medicine yesterday cancelled exams for fourth year students following claims the test papers had been leaked. The University Academic Board said it made the decision to safeguard the integrity of the exams. “No evidence of exam cheating has been found but investigations are going on until the truth is known,” a statement from the academic board said. The exams were rescheduled and students will sit the tests between yesterday and December 14. Dean of the school of medicine Dr Lukoye Atwoli confirmed the exams had been cancelled. “So far, we have established there was no actual cheating, but there were wide claims, especially through social media, which undermined the integrity of the exams,” he said. Atwoli said students were repeating seven papers that had been cancelled. “So there is no cause for alarm,” he said. Last week students at the Annex campus of the university protested over missing marks ahead of the university’s 37th graduation ceremony on December 20. Police also arrested four suspects found printing fake certificates for the university among other institutions. Police are still pursuing more than 10 other suspects linked to the printing of the exams and degree certificates for Moi University and the University of Eldoret. Vice Chancellor Isaac Kosgey said the matter was being handled with the necessary seriousness. Detectives also seized copies of fake diploma certificates for Eldoret National Polytechnic and Bachelor of Education degree certificates for Moi University and University of Eldoret.
