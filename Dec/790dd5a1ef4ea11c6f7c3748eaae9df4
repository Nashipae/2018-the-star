Deputy President William Ruto has ordered for immediate dismissal of a police officer who failed to deal with a case of defilement in Magarini last week until area MP Michael Kingi intervened. The DP warned that any government official who engages in corruption while handling cases of sexual offences will be dismissed. Ruto said such acts of laxity have contributed to increased cases of teenage pregnancies in the county. “It’s an abuse of office and totally unacceptable. I would like to know the officer who failed to take action in a defilement case, I will take action and sack him tomorrow,” he said. The region shocked the nation last month after statistics showed it was leading with cases of teenage pregnancies at more than 13,000. The DP spoke during fundraising and issuance of 800 title deeds at Mapimo grounds Gongoni in Magarini on Wednesday. “Any officer who will get information of defilement and fail to take action should get prepared to go home, whether it’s an assistant chief or police if you cannot protect the minors you have no business in the office,’’ he said. He also cautioned security personnel against harassing bodaboda operators. Ruto was accompanied by over 11 legislators from the Coast and one Governor from Kwale Salim Mvurya.
