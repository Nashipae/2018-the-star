ODM disciplinary committee has recommended the expulsion of Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa and Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori over gross misconduct. Jumwa and Dori were summoned in October to appear before the ODM disciplinary committee after they openly declared their support for Deputy President William Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid. They ignored the summons. In June this year, Jumwa was on record saying that she had made up her mind to support DP Ruto as he is ready for the country’s top job irking the party leadership. However, in October she changed tune and declared that she respects Raila as her party leader. Jumwa said she was in constant communication with him.

They are to be expelled following the recent acts of violence, unruly behaviour and disobeying party decisions, ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna said on Tuesday. A Kisumu court remanded seven Homa Bay MCAs on the charge of assaulting Speaker Elizabeth Ayoo. The seven were ordered detained at Kodiaga Prison in Kisumu after they appeared before Kisumu resident magistrate Rose Ndombi.
