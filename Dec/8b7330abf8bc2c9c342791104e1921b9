Kitui governor Charity Ngilu has been cautioned against dragging Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka into her disputes with MCAs. Kitui county assembly Majority leader Peter Kilonzo of the Wiper party  told the governor Kalonzo was neither directly nor indirectly involved in MCAs work. He said Ngilu should give him a break. Kilonzo in response to social media postings from Ngilu’s press service to the effect that she had  accused Kalonzo  of using the numerical  strength of his party to undermine her leadership. He said Ngilu was recently quoted in a speech on Jamhuri Day,  saying that MCAs quest to frustrate her administration was an indirect manifestation that Kalonzo   was involved  in county affairs. A day after Ngilu made the statement against the MCAs  and  Kalonzo, the assembly  rejected the supplementary budget presented by the administration. On the same day the Tseikuru MCA who chairs the Budget committee, Bonface Kasina, tabled a motion to  impeach Ngilu’s Treasury executive Mary Ngilu, one of the best-performing executives. It was  signed  by 37 MCAs who accused Nguli of abuse of office, dishonoring  assembly recommendations and failing to pay pending bills. On Monday, Ngilu was quoted in the press as saying she would not succumb to intimidation and that she was ready to take the political fight to the MCAs’ backyards and tell the residents what has been going on. But Kilonzo said that the MCAs  will  not allow the  “lining  of pockets” of a few people with  funds  stolen in the  name of  development. “We cannot abdicated our responsibility ... Our interest as Wiper MCAs will only centre on the people who elected us to represent them,” Kilonzo said. He said as long as Governor Ngilu’s efforts, actions and focus remain within lawful limits and constitutional framework, she can count on MCAs 100 per cent.
