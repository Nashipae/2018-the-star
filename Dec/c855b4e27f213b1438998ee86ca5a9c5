Champions Gor Mahia are set to unveil their new coach Hassan Oktay in the course of the week after the Turkish tactician jetted in yesterday. Gor sought the services of the Turkish coach, who initially plied his trade with England-based Braintree FC, to replace departed Dylan Kerr who left to join South African outfit Black Leopards. According to the club’s deputy secretary general, Ronald Ngala, the new coach arrived in the country yesterday and he is set to be unveiled in the course of the week. “The new coach is in town and we will unveil him this week. We will make it official this week and give more details on his contract.” The rank fell vacant last month after Kerr threw in the towel, citing a better offer in South Africa hence leaving his assistant Zedekiah “Zico” Otieno to man the technical bench. Kerr took charge of the club’s last match against Everton and mysteriously remained in England only to tender his resignation letter later leaving the club to scratch for his replacement. However Zico proved reliable as he led Gor to a 1-0 win in the first leg of the Caf Champions League against Nyasa Bullets of Malawi last week at Moi Stadium despite missing several key players. The exit of Kerr saw the club receive more than 50 applications for the job but it was Oktay, who boasts of Uefa ‘A’ coaching licence, who received the mantle to succeed Kerr. In his first assignment, Oktay is set to prepare K’Ogalo for the return leg against Malawi’s Nyasa on Wednesday in Blantyre before leading the club in retaining the SportPesa Premier League and Super Cup.
