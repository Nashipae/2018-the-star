Former Senator Joy Gwendo has been sentenced to two years in jail without an option of a fine. Anti-Corruption Court chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti handed her the sentence after the ex-lawmaker failed to honour a plea bargain she entered with the state to pay a Kisumu sacco Sh1.7 million. Gwendo had pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud following the plea bargain deal with the DPP. In the deal, the former legislator agreed to pay the sacco the said cash, being the genesis of the case. The politician pleaded guilty to a count of abuse of office and two others of issuing bad cheques. She admitted that she issued a cheque of Sh300,000 in favour of Kisumu East Cotton Growers Cooperative Society through CFC Stanbic Kivuli’s development initiative's account yet she knew there were insufficient funds. Gwendo also admitted issuing another cheque on the same day worth Sh950,000. She faced a third count of abuse of office. On the abuse of office allegation, the former senator admitted that on October 23, 2016, at Chiga parish in Kisumu, she used her position as a State officer to confer herself Sh2,226,880, money which belonged to the sacco.
