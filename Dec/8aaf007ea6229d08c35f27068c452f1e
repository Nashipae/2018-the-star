KCSE exam results for more than 200 candidates in Garissa subcounty have been cancelled over irregularities, mostly cheating . At Ikhlas Secondary School, all the 127 candidates had their results nullified. Out of 69 candidates who sat the national examination at Young Muslim Secondary School in the same area, 56 had their results cancelled while 10 out of 23 candidates at Excel Secondary School suffered the same cancellation. According to an education official who requested anonymity, the results of candidates who were arrested and arraigned in court during the exam period were nullified. They include three students of Boystown, and one from Yathrib and another at Sunshine secondary schools. The students were found with mobile phones and materials related to exams. Their cases are among the more than 100 pending in courts countrywide. Among the schools whose results are being withheld in Garissa sub-county are Mnara boys, Al Azar and Iqra secondary schools. According to Knec, results of the schools are under investigation. Garissa Knut Executive Secretary Abdirizak Hussein said all the six sub-counties in Garissa are equally affected by either the results being withheld or cancelled. Abdirizak said the withholding of results is causing anxiety among the candidates and their parents. “Why withhold the results because they are under investigation. Release the results together with reasons why they are being investigated,” Abdirizak said.
