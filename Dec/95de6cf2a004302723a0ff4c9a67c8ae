Narok has risen from the academic ashes after a dismal performance last year which saw no student from the county record an overall 'A' grade in their KCSE examinations. The poor performance prompted education stakeholders to hold a crisis meeting over the results which seems to have finally borne fruits. In the results released last week, the county recorded two A- and several B+ grades signaling an improved performance compared to the previous year. Edwin Kipngâ€™etich from little known Oldonyoorok Secondary and Jacob Onguti from Masikonde Day secondary school both managed a mean grade of A-. In the 2017 results, the top students from the county (12) candidates scored B+, with 304 others scoring C plain and 505 scoring C-. Another 860 scored D+, 1,734 (D) and 2,251 scoring D-. The number of those who scored below C+ was 5,012. Angered by the poor results where only seven percent made to the university, Narok governor Samuel Tunai called an urgent meeting with principals, education officials and parents demanding answers over the dismal performance.
