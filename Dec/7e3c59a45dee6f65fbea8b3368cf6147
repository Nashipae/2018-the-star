This, he said, includes reservation of thirty per cent of all government procurement opportunities for women, youth and persons with disabilities, devolution of some services and functions to counties, and increased resource allocation to the devolved units. The President said through these initiatives, the number of persons engaged in productive economic activities rose by 5.6 per cent from 16 million in 2016 to 16.9 million in 2017. “I note with satisfaction that since 2016 when this 2jiajiri Programme started over 23,000 youth have been trained and over 2,000 youth-led business enterprises have been created,” said the President. Kenya Commercial Bank CEO Joshua Oigara said the bank would advance Sh 10 billion each year for the next five years at a low interest of nine per cent to support youth enterprises in the country.
