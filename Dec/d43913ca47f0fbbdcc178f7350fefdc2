Supporters of ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi have launched a funds drive to support his 2022 presidential bid. Mudavadi (right) has been invited to launch the Vihiga chapter of the group calling itself the Mudavadi Support Team at Kegoye secondary school on Boxing Day at the annual Maragoli cultural festival. He is expected to unveil a pay bill number where funds can be sent. The group is mobilising business people, professionals, mama mboga and boda boda operators among others to support Mudavadi’s campaigns through donations or fundraising. The group has a core team of 20 volunteers with Maurice Itebete as chairman, Frank Kimiya as secretary and Oscar Wanjala, the treasurer. Mudavadi’s private secretary Kibisu Kabatesi welcomed the initiative as a step in the right direction. “You cannot say no to someone who wants to support you. My only advice is that the initiative must remain alive upto 2022. It will be a tragedy if it dies on its launch,” he said. The former vice-president has heightened activities to galvanise support for his second stab at the presidency in 2022. He has declared himself official leader of opposition after ODM leader Raila Odinga joined hands with President Uhuru Kenyatta. He has made frequent visits to Central Kenya in recent past raising speculations on whether the vote rich region was shifting allegiance from Deputy President William Ruto ahead of the next general elections. The former deputy Prime Minister has also made several visits to the Coast where his party won a parliamentary seat in the last elections. “The concept is that Mudavadi’s campaigns should be people-owned and driven by donation of as little as Sh50 and not moneyed cliques,” said group chairman Maurice Itebete. The initiative will be rolled out to other Western counties of Bungoma, Kakamega and Busia before spreading to all the 47 counties.
