Lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi has blasted Chief Justice David Maraga over what he terms "massive corruption" in the Judiciary. "I was admitted to the Bar in 1993 by CJ Hancox and practiced before CJs Cockar, Chesoni, Apaloo, Chunga, Gicheru, Willy and now Maraga. I have never practised before a more inept, corrupt, tribal and politically compromised Judiciary as is the Judiciary that is now under CJ Maraga," he tweeted on Sunday. This is not the first time Ahmednasir is making accusations against the Judiciary. On Wednesday, he accused the Supreme Court of being biased in the case against two Iranians convicted of terror charges whom he was representing. He said the court was exercising illegitimate political power over the two Iranians who were acquitted by the Court of Appeal. Last year, Ahmednasir also criticised the court for calling for a repeat election. He said the verdict was a political act by the Supreme Court.
