Governor Martin Wambora has given the top KCPE pupil in Embu a four-year scholarship to study at Alliance High School. Thirteen-year-old Telvin Gichuki, who scored 434 marks out of 500, said he was inspired by former Prime Minister Raila Odinga to become a civil engineer. Both his parents were retrenched and were saddened that their son may miss a place in his dream school.

Telvin, a former pupil at Tenri Primary School was admitted to Alliance High School, but the parents were devastated because they could not afford the fees.
