Environmental activists want the state to kill plans for the Sh200 billion Lamu coal plant following the Blue Economy conferencei. The activists on Thursday said the proposed coal project flies in the face of the agenda of sustainable economies for communities living close to water. Regional Team Leader for 350Africa.org, Landry Ninteretse said there was no point discussing growth when communities are caught in the “crossfire of‘development and survival”. He said the government must respect the Blue Economy Initiative. Thus it has a duty to invest in clean energy, not dirty coal, Ninteretse said.
