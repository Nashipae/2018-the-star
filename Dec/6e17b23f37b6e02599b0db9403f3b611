Police in Lamu have arrested and prosecuted 90 rapists, child defilers and notorious drug peddlers this year. Lamu County Commissioner Joseph Kanyiri, who released an end of year evaluation report on Thursday, said out of the group 60 are drug dealers. He said drug trafficking thrives in Langoni, Gadeni, Wiyoni and Kashmir in Lamu Town. Other areas are Faza, Kizingitini, Tchundwa and Mbwajumwali in Lamu East. Kanyiri, who spoke at Mkunguni Square, said 29 rapists have been charged in the last 11 months. The report shows rape is rampant, but the community is unwilling to speak about it. Kanyiri said they will not relent in the crackdown against drug traffickers. He said more suspects will be arrested before the end of the month. The report states that the most peddled and used drugs in Lamu are heroin and marijuana. Among the suspects charged, 51 were found in possession of marijuana and nine heroin. "The crackdown targets hotspots for drugs and users. The users reveal the sellers," he said. Kanyiri told law enforcement officers to tighten the noose on drug dealers if surrounding communities are to raise a productive generation. He said peddlers who surrender to the police will receive lenient sentences. Kanyiri cautioned parents not to settle defilement cases at home. He said justice is defeated and the affected children's rights are violated. "Parents should not make deals with rapists. The community must condemn any sort of harm on our children. Culprits must be handed to the justice system," he said. "You should be ashamed if you are the kind of parent who can dine with a person who defiled your child and destroyed his or her life."
