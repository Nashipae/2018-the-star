Pedestrians who use the Railways footbridge have been warned to be extra cautious as it is not strong enough to hold many people. On Monday, hundreds of city residents were seen struggling to climb up the footbridge, raising safety concerns. "Kenya Railways would like to urge members of the public using the footbridge connecting CBD and Landi Mawe to do so in an orderly manner for their own safety and that of other users," the state corporation wrote on its Facebook page. There was a gridlock at the footbridge after Nairobi governor Mike Sonko banned matatus from accessing the Central Business District. The wooden bridge can only support a maximum of five people per square metre. Kenya Railways was forced to deploy police to manage the heavy human traffic in order to avoid overloading of the bridge. Thousands of commuters walked for long distances to their workplaces after the county government effected the gazette notice on the matatus ban. On Tuesday morning, the ban was however been lifted unconditionally until further notice.
