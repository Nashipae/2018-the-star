The National Assembly is today likely to confirm Twalib Mbarak as the new chief executive of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. Mbarak is joining the EACC as the anti-corruption drive of DPP Noordin Haji and DCI George Kinoti gains momentum. The EACC has been widely criticised for being ineffective despite its huge annual budget of more than Sh3 billion. Only small fish were convicted. In its defence, the EACC argued that it forwarded files to the DPP for prosecution but no action was taken. In the past the DPP and DCI may have sat on files but that is not the case today. In fact they have taken over the EACC files on the KPC, NCPB and NHIF and move rapidly to court. Mbarak’s challenge now is to effectively partner with Kinoti and Haji. The EACC should not get sucked into turf warfare with the DPP and DCI. It does not matter who does it as long as it gets done. Let the EACC play its part and convince the doubters that it is an effective anti-corruption agency. Quote of the day: "Everyone imposes his own system as far as his army can reach."
