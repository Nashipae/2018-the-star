Deputy President William Ruto today returns to Western for the third time in two weeks to sell his 2022 bid. Politics on the proposed referendum to amend the Constitution and the handshake deal are expected to dominate speeches at the event. The DP will attend the annual Idakho cultural festival in Malinya Stadium, Ikolomani, Kakamega. He is expected to preside over a bullfighting contest and reward winners. Organisers say the winner in each contest will get a heifer and cash. Losers will pocket Sh20,000 each. In the past, Ruto had criticised former Kakamega senator Boni Khalwale for engaging in bullfighting, instead of promoting dairy farming. Times and circumstances have, however, changed, with the 2022 election beckoning. “The DP will have breakfast at my Lihrembe residence before proceeding to the venue,” Ikolomani MP Bernard Shinali said yesterday. Ruto was in Ikolomani two weeks ago when he commissioned the Iguhu Medical Training College before visiting Emuhaya constituency to launch the tarmacking of the Sh800 million Ekwanda-Lwanda-Mwichio-Esirulo road. He was back in the region five days later to preside over a fundraiser in aid of 50 churches in Likuyani ward at St John the Baptist Boys Secondary School. He then attended the homecoming party for Sirisia MP John Waluke. Analysts say the DP is keen on the vote-rich Western and Coast regions to bolster his bid due to uncertainty surrounding the Central Kenya support, which he earlier banked on. ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has been traversing the region and the country to consolidate his support and popularise his bid. He has declared his interest in the presidency and is banking on the support of his backyard. Read: Ruto returns to Western with eyes on 2022 bid Click here for the latest political news
