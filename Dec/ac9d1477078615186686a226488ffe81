Nyamira governor John Nyagarama has dismissed claims that Gusii politicians were ejected from President Uhuru Kenyatta’s meeting in Kisumu last Thursday. The head of state met ODM leader Raila Odinga and Luo elders and leaders. It had been reported that Kisii governor James Ongwae, Senator Sam Ongeri and Nyagarama were smoked out of the meeting. Nyagarama made the remarks after MPs Joash Nyamoko (North Mugirango), Ben Momanyi (North Mugirango), Shadrack Mose (Kitutu Masaba) and Jerusha Momanyi (Woman Rep) said Gusii leaders were treated badly in Kisumu. The governor said the three of them, who had attended the presidential event in Kisumu, left the meeting with blessings of the President and Raila. He said they left because they were to attend the funeral of Kisii woman representatives Janet Ong’era’s brother. “I’m an elder and I never tell lies. We walked out of the Kisumu meeting after the President had given us Sh500,000, Raila gave us Sh200,000 and Interior CS Fred Matiang’i Sh200,000 to take to the funeral. No one chased us away,” Nyagarama said. He spoke at Riatuya SDA Church on Saturday, when he joined area MPs in a funds drive to build the pastor’s residence.
