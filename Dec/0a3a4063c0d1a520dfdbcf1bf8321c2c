Actress Brenda Wairimu joined the premiere of the Kenyan-Danish movie, 'Subira', at Nyali Cinemax. The movie was nominated in 13 categories of Kalasha Film Awards 2018, and scooped five awards. It is about a young, free-spirited girl from Lamu, who struggles to live her dream of swimming against the local custom and an arranged upper-class marriage. Brenda described her attraction to the role of Subira in the movie written by Sippy Chadha. "I have always been attracted to strong female leads. I had to try it out. Female characters are always complex in such a beautiful way, their emotions are complex and well-thought-out," she said. Adding that the storyline of the movie is "a story that is not well known. I'm happy to tell a story of someone who is somewhat voiceless". The Mombasa screening was a full house, with the audience including veteran TV actor Kenneth Ambani and Mpower Limited managing director Janet Katisya.
