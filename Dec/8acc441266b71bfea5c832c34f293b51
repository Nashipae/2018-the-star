Human rights groups in Mombasa have agreed to work together with the police to curb rising insecurity in the county. The two agreed to put aside their differences to stamp out insecurity. The groups have often clashed with police over extrajudicial killings. Haki Africa executive director Hussein Khalid said Civil Society Organisations were ready to work with police to ensure Mombasa regains its status as the holiday city. “As CSOs, we are ready to support you 100 per cent in fighting crime,” Khalid told police on Thursday. He spoke on behalf of the more than eight CSOs that attended a security meeting at Kadongo ground in Mshomoroni. The meeting followed difficult two months during which 15 people were killed and many others injured. Some killings happened in Mshomoroni and Nyali. Coast regional coordinator Bernard Leparmarai said security has greatly improved. He attributed the improvement to increased cooperation between the police, members of the community and CSOs. “When we work together, it is easier to fight crime than when we continuously point fingers at each other,” Khalid said. Khalid denied accusations of complicity in crime with his organisation blamed for defending criminals felled by police. “Haki Africa does not and will not defend anyone who takes a machete and slashes another person,” Khalid said. The meeting was organised by Vijana Kwa Vijana Youth group. It was attended by top security bosses, politicians and the human rights groups. It was a follow-up to the other held at the Kenya School of Government on Monday. The Monday meetings was attended by Governor Hassan John, Senator Mohamed Faki and all seven MPs from the county.
