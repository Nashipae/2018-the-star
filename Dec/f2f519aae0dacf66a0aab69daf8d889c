Mombasa will host Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) Term One ball games in April next year. According to the KSSSA calendar, rugby 7s and 15’s have been switched from second term to Term One games. Other games expected to take place in Term One include basketball, hockey, swimming and athletics. Kisumu County will host the Term Two games, which will feature football, netball, volleyball and racquet games. The national games for the Term Two games will kick off from July 26 to August 4, 2019. The East and Central Games will this time be staged in Mwanza, Tanzania as from mid August to August 24. Laiser Hill are the defending champions in boys’ basketball category while Kaya Tiwi the reigning champions in girls’ category. In hockey, St. Anthony’s Kitale and Trans Nzoia Mixed will be seeking to defend the crowns while Upper Hill will be chasing their second successive crown in rugby 15s. Kimilili and Moi Kamusinga are the holders in boys and girls’ handball respectively. KSSSA secretary general, David Ngugi, said preparations for the event have started in earnest and they expect to finalise the plans for the games by the January. “We have had a couple of meetings to adequately prepare and plan for these games and ensure the participating teams are well catered for,” added Ngugi. Ngugi said the Ministry of Education has re-organised all co-curricular activities hence the reason the rugby Sevens and 15’s are being played at the same time. “We have been in touch with the ministry and they have told us to change a few things and even in second term, football will be held at the same time unlike the previous years,” added Ngugi. He said he expects a competitive contest in Term One. “We see new emerging teams coming from the counties so you will see new faces at the championships in Mombasa,” he said.
