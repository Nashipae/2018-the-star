The government has suffered a setback in the implementation of the gazette notice ordering the fresh vetting of licensed gun owners. This follows a court's decision on Monday suspending the notice pending the hearing and determination of a case filed by the by the National Gun Owners Association (NGAO). Interior CS Fred Matiang'i had ordered all civilian gun owners to undergo mandatory fresh vetting in the next three months. Justice John Mativo, however, stayed Matiang'i's order until the case by NGAO is heard and determined. Judge Mativo further temporarily suspended the appointment of new members of the Firearms and Licensing board. The court directed parties to serve the respondents and appear in court on January 16 for further directions.
