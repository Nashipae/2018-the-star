The Lands ministry is planning to issue 35,000 title deeds to Laikipia landowners in five months. Lands CS Farida Karoney yesterday said the titling drive has started. She said Likii, Majengo, Manguo, Luoniek and Kwa Maina villages are among slums set to be registered. The drive will be completed in May next year. The move culminated from a directive by President Uhuru Kenyatta to issue title deeds to plot owners during his visit to Nanyuki in June. Speaking during a meeting with plot owners of Likii and Majengo in Nanyuki, Karoney said the ministry would revoke title deeds for grabbed public and private lands. The CS was with CAS Gideon Mung’aro, PS Nicholas Muraguri, Governor Ndiritu Muriithi, Deputy Governor John Mwaniki, county commissioner Onesmus Musyoki, Laikipia MCAs and officials from the ministry and county governments. Karoney said they will partner with the Laikipia government and agree on how the areas would be planned before title deeds are issued. MCAs said a number of public lands have been grabbed. “We are allocating money for construction of schools, market and other facilities but when we go to the ground the land is grabbed and buildings erected,” Umande MCA Daniel Mugweru said.
