When they announced that Jim Parsons refused to sign a new contract to return to The Big Bang Theory as Sheldon Cooper, the producers of the show decided to call it quits. It’s only then that I realised I had given 12 years of my life faithfully following this show. 12 years! What will I do come next September? Am I ready to give up my guilty pleasure of nerdy humour? I was contemplating accepting the turn of events before I was hit with another blow... Modern Family was also calling it quits after 10 seasons. Another show I followed religiously for 10 years. Modern Family was a pioneer of its kind, leading the way in portraying actual family dramas in the contemporary world. Sometimes I’m surprised that I gave up over a decade of my time connecting with TV characters weekly, as though they are an important part of my life. Since I’m to mourn these two huge incoming losses in my life, I wondered who else was on the chopping block. For starters, this year we had to bid an early adieu to the beloved fixer Olivia Pope on Scandal. There’s only so many presidents a girl can save after seven seasons. Next, we had to say goodbye to the quirky and loveable Jess on New Girl. Surely, the girl is no longer new after a smashing seven seasons. In other news, the dark night superhero Luke Cage seems to bear the heavy loss following creative differences between show runners and writers. Marvel’s Luke Cage has been cancelled after a meagre two seasons. Another show to suffer because of external extenuating circumstances is House of Cards. Following the aftermath of Kevin Spacey’s sexual misconduct allegations, the show was cancelled after the fifth season. Other shows that are cancelled or set to conclude for the television year 2018-19 include: Shades of Blue, Mary Jane, Game of thrones, Girlfriend’s guide to Divorce, Quantico, Alone Together, American Woman and Jane the Virgin.
