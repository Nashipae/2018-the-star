Every border point in the country will soon have sniffer dogs to help in the war on ivory trafficking. They will have canine units to support the police in the crackdown. The sniffer dogs will be able to detect as little as 20 grammes of ivory. The border points include Malaba, Namanga and Moyale. According to the Kenya Wildlife Service, the population of wild animals has been declining at an alarming rate, mainly because of poaching. Elephants are the worst hit. Rhinos are also targeted. The KWS in partnership with the African Wildlife Foundation commissioned a canine facility in Mombasa on Monday. It is fully equipped with play and sleeping areas for the dogs. The facility has highly trained officers who work with the dogs. In the past three months, the KWS has used the strategy to seize ivory smuggled in three separate incidents at the Port of Mombasa, director general Charles Musyoki said. African Wildlife Foundation Vice president Philip Muruthi said judges and prosecutors will be trained on the importance of wildlife so they make proper judgments in cases involving offenders. “Someone who has been caught will meet judges and prosecutors who have been trained on the value of wildlife,” he said.
