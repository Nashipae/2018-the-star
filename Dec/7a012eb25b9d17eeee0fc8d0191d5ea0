Nineteen local manufacturers have adopted the ‘Made in Kenya’ logo for standardisation and marketing of Kenyan products globally, said Brand Kenya chief executive Floice Mukabana. Those already branding are among 100 companies dealing in leather, clothing and artefacts who registered for the mark through Brand Kenya. The mark was launched by Deputy President William Ruto during the annual Kenya National Trade Week in August and was followed by a deal between Kenya Association of Manufacturers and Brand Kenya to promote uptake and implementation of the unique identifier. Its objective is to grow the manufacturing through the Buy Kenya, Build Kenya Initiative. “The goods and processing have been checked by Kenya Bureau of Standards for authenticity and quality,” Mukabana said. According to KAM, the manufacturing sector currently contributes 8.37 per cent of the GDP and aims to grow by 3.4 per cent each year to hit at least 15 per cent by 2022. However, manufacturers have always complained of increased competition from lower priced imported goods as a major hindrance to expansion. Brand Kenya has announced a Made in Kenya festival from April 5 - 7, 2019. The festival will adopt the ‘Black Friday’ discounted sale to boost business. This strategy is mostly preferred by online shopping platforms giving up to 70 per cent off the price.
