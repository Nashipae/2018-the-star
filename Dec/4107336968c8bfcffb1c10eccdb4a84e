The government is considering providing literature setbooks to 1.4 million students in Forms 3 and 4 from January. This will significantly lower book costs for students who have been relying on their parents and guardians to buy these setbooks. Students are supposed to acquire three setbooks for fasihi (Kiswahili literature) and three for English literature. The distribution of these textbooks is part of the policy introduced last year that mandates the Ministry of Education through the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development to purchase and distribute textbooks. While the book distribution policy, which is a joint World Bank-Government of Kenya project, is noble, it must at all costs be shielded from graft. Already, the Ministry of Education is on the spot over missing textbooks meant for four classes in upper primary. Millions of Classes 3, 4, 5 and 6 did not received textbooks right from January when the policy was adopted. This lack has adversely affected teaching and learning in public schools. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission should expedite investigations into suspected textbook graft and charge those responsible. Corruption should not be allowed to compromise teaching and performance of students at any level of education.
