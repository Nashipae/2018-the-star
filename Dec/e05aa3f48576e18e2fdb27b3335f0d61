Sugarcane farmers from Kakamega, Nandi, and Uasin Gishu counties have asked the government to gazette and effect the Sugar Regulations 2016 to streamline operationsr. Speaking during the Butali Sugarcane Farmers Association annual general meeting yesterday, the farmers said that lack of order in the sector allows for millers to exploit them. “We hope the sugar task force headed by Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri and Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya will come up with permanent solutions to the myriad challenges facing sugarcane farmers, including zoning of the sugar belt,” said William Kopi, the association’s chairman. He said that lack of order in the sector has allowed unfair competition.
