Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula has told Luhya leaders to unite for the community to stand a chance in the 2022 presidential race. The Bungoma Senator said Luhyas have supported other presidential candidates, and it is time they backed their own. He spoke on Saturday during a funeral service at Bungoma Medical Training College. Wetang'ula said he and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi have resolved to work together to ensure the Mulembe community speaks in one language ahead of poll. The two leaders have hinted at a possibility of merging their parties to form aÂ strong vehicle that will unite Luhyas. However, the merger bid faces a myriad of challenges. To start with, Ford Kenya deputy leader Boni Khalwale has publicly supported Deputy President William Ruto's State House bid. ANC leaders have sharply criticised the move. They said the community cannot unite and throw away their vote by supporting "someone else'. Wetang'ula said he will either form the next government or look for like-minded leaders to form it. He said other communities should reciprocate by supporting a Luhya presidential candidate. Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati said it is too early for the Mulembe nation to align itself with any political outfit. "If you look at past trends, alliances are usually formed six months to an election. Let us wait and see how the political tide is moving," he said. Wetang'ula, Musalia, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa and Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya are among Luhya leaders eyeing the top seat. Click here for the latest political news
