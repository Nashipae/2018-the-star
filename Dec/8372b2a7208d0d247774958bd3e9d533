Grammy award-winning group Morgan Heritage is set to headline the biggest end-year party in the 254, Wasafi Festival 2018. The Jamaican stars will share the stage with celebrated Tanzanian powerhouse Diamond Platnumz and his WCB crew on December 31 at Uhuru Gardens, Nairobi. Speaking about the upcoming performance by Morgan Heritage, the organisers, The Great Republic, said: "We are thrilled to be the first event company in Kenya to do an event of such magnitude." Adding: "We are bringing the three biggest genres of music among the youth on one platform. Fans of reggae, bongo and Kenyan music will get everything at the Wasafi Festival." This will also be the first time Diamond and Morgan Heritage perform their hit song, Hallelujah, on Kenyan soil. Kenya’s Band Beca and Nadia Mukami will also perform.
