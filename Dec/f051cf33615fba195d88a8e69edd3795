Owners of vehicles bearing foreign registration plates have been put on notice as NTSA moves to crackdown on unregistered vehicles. Director General Francis Meja said a police crackdown will target vehicles bearing plates inscribed as X-GK, X-KA and X-Diplomat but whose owners do not have the necessary documents. "The authority has also noted an influx of vehicles bearing foreign number plates. We wish to clarify that vehicles bearing numbers like X-GK are not registered and are therefore operating illegally," Meja said. According to Section 6 (1A) of Traffic Act Cap 403, it is illegal to operate a vehicle which is not duly registered in Kenya. The law, however, makes provisions for owners of foreign registered vehicles to operate in the country provided they obtain the necessary clearance from the relevant authorities. These include clearance by the immigration department, KRA and foreign vehicle permit from NTSA and insurance coverage. "The police will be enforcing the law on all vehicles found to be operating without due registration or vehicles bearing foreign registration found to be in country without necessary documents," Meja said.
