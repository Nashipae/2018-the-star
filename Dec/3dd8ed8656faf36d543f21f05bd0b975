MPs are pushing to have greater say — in fact, the last word in the procurement and award of major projects by the national government. A resolution proposed by the Budget and Appropriations Committee and has been adopted by the House. It requires that any contract worth more than Sh1 billion should be pre-approved by Parliament. This requirement, as Treasury CS Henry Rotich told lawmakers yesterday, violates the principle of separation of powers among the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary. After approving the budget, Parliament should give the Executive space to implement the approved budget. Already, the MPs have a lot on their plates. They should stop pushing to control everything. Demanding that lawmakers have the final say on projects introduces another unnecessary layer of bureaucracy. This can easily delay project implementation. Further, there are increasing cases of MPs being compromised and allegations of bribe-taking. Thus, giving them more discretion in procurement and award of major projects will easily create a fresh avenue for graft. When legislators are involved even in procurement, how can they objectively provide oversight of the same project? That is why Parliament should leave implementation to the Executive, while the MPs play their oversight role. Quote of the Day: “Few men have virtue to withstand the highest bidder.
