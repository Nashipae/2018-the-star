Two people died yesterday at dawn in Lari, Kiambu, when a lorry transporting potatoes collided with another vehicle on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway.Lari police boss Isaiah Odhiambo said the car’s driver and a passenger died on the spot. Three others were taken to AIC Kijabe Hospital with serious injuries. Odhiambo said the lorry’s driver and his loader were not injured. The accident happened at 2am. Lorry driver Bernard Njuguna said the driver of the other vehicle lost control and swerved into his lane.Njuguna said he tried to avoid a head-on collision but it was too late. “The car was moving towards our vehicle. I hooted, flashed headlights, but they collided. The car pushed us and we landed in a ditch,” he said. “I urge drivers to be careful on the road to reduce fatal accidents.” The potatoes were offloaded and loaded in another lorry. The wreckage was towed to Lari police station. Odhiambo has urged drivers to follow traffic rules. “We are investigating. These vehicles will be inspected,” the police boss said. National Transport and Safety Authority last month said that the country lost 2,585 people to road accidents between January and November 1 this year. This was an increase from 2,331 in the same period last year. NTSA director general Francis Meja said speeding and drunk driving are the main causes of accidents. He said 92 per cent of accidents are caused by human error, mechanical problems accounting for five per cent while environmental issues are to blame for three per cent.
