A sports competition was organised on Saturday for youths from Turkana and Samburu communities to promote peace and discourage cattle rustling. Organiser Elly Letipila said the event, held at Baragoi stadium, Samburu North subcounty, aimed to promote peace. “For the past four days sincethis tournament begun, youths from Samburu and Turkana communities have been meeting here on a daily basis from 8am to 6pm to play games, interact and make friends,” he said. A total of 15 teams from the two communities, which have been hostile against each other following livestock conflicts, participated in the competition called Letipila Peace Tournament. The youths praised the initiative, saying it has brought them together after many years of tension. “As youths from Samburu and Turkana communities, we have isolated ourselves from each other on tribal lines, but we are now together in unity because of this tournament,” Laban Ngirau said. He said many youths engage in cattle rustling due to idleness. Some youths who were visiting the area for the first time to cheer their teams said they previously had a negative perception towards members of other communities. “We were afraid when we came here; we used to hear about battles, but we have realised people are friendly, they love each other and we are happy to be with them,” Immaculate Barsela from Loosuk, Samburu Central subcounty, said.
