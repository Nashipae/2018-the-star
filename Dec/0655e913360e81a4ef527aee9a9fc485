NHIF suspects arrested over Sh1.1 billion graft on Monday denied the charges before Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti. The 18 suspects are being held at the Milimani law courts cells awaiting a ruling on their bail application. Ogoti is expected to deliver the ruling at 2.30pm. While opposing their release on bail, Deputy DPP Emily Kamau termed the offences serious economic crimes. Kamau told the court that people died because of lack of NHIF cover because their money was stolen. However, their lawyer Cliff Ombetta said there is no charge of anyone having died. State counsel Victor Owiti asked the court to bar the suspects from accessing their offices so as not to interfere with investigations and witnesses. He asked the court to give terms that are commensurate to the amount lost. Click here for the latest political news
