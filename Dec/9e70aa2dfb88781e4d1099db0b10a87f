Rose Muhando went viral recently in a clip where she was seemingly being exorcised by controversial pastor James Ng'ang'a. However, a pastor from Tanzania, who claims to be her spokesperson, has told BongoTimes TV she is not possessed. "Other people, including pastors and bishops, are saying Rose Muhando is being punished by God for missing gigs which she has already been paid for," he said. "She may have missed performances but it is because some pastors who invite her for performances want to have sex with her. They are pastors and we know them, and she has shown me the messages they have been sending her." The pastor also said the singer is currently ill and admitted in Nairobi, although pastors are using that opportunity to tarnish her name and uplift themselves.
