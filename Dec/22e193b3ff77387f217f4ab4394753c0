The absence of Emmanuel Simiyu and Zack Aura has dealt Butali a blow ahead of their season ending men’s Kenya Hockey Union Premier League match against rivals Kenya Police tomorrow. Simiyu, who has been a reliable goal scorer this season, will miss the match for accumulation of cards while Aura, a former Kenyan international and an attacking midfielder, is out of the country on official engagements. Police, who are seeking to defend the title, have 60 points while Butali are second on 57 points, heading to the final game of the season. The law enforcers will be pursuing a draw of any kind or a win to keep the title while Butali will have to work harder for a win and level points with their opponents. The two sides met in June this year in the first leg, where Police humbled Butali 3-0 to end their unbeaten run. Butali’s assistant coach Godfrey Wakachunga termed the absence of the duo as a big blow to his side but remained confident of a win. “It’s a big blow to miss the two in such a match but I believe we will carry the day. I am glad we have regained our scoring form and our game has improved a lot and it is my hope we will silence Police. We have been preparing for the match and the boys are raring to give a good account of themselves and hoist the trophy.” While Wakachunga will be sweating on the unavailability of the inspirational duo, his Police counterpart Fred Masibo will have to do without the services of Kenyan international midfielder, Willis Okeyo, who will sit out of the match for accumulating cards.
