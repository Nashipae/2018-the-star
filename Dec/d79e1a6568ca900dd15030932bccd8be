The year 2018 saw Kenyans face multiple challenges and celebrate multiple wins. As it comes to a close, the Star wishes all our readers a Happy New Year as we usher in 2019. As we do this, let us use this moment to reflect on our achievements, challenges and goals for the new year, both as individuals and as a country. The government spent most of 2018 planning the Big Four agenda and it is time to leave the boardrooms, roll up our sleeves and start achieving results. In 2019, Kenyans expect progress in the Big Four in a manner that uplifts  their daily lives, such as bringing down the cost of living and creating job opportunities for young people. To elected leaders: You are almost halfway through your term. You must take a hard look at what you have achieved and where you have failed. Implement your campaign promises. May 2019 be the year that we achieve more cohesion and economic progress as a country.
