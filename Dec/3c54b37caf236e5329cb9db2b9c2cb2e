Poor households that depend on kerosene will buy it cheaply for the next one month, accordingÂ to the latest ERC review. The cost of kerosene has been reduced by Sh6.61 and will retail at Sh105.22. Motorists will also pay less for super petrol within the same period as the fuel cost has been reduced by Sh4.57 and diesel by Sh0.55. The regulator has attributed the reduction in fuel prices to a decline in the weighted average cost of imported refined petroleum products. The prices are inclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT) at 8 per cent in line with the provisions of the Finance Act 2018. Click here for the latest political news
