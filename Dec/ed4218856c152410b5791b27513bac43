The national roll out of the Competence-based curriculum (CBC) has been pushed to 2020, CS Amina Mohamed has announced. In a statement on Saturday, she said poor planning and a hasty roll out led to the failure of the national roll out, which had been planned for January 2019 . A Multi-sectoral National Steering Committee found several problems that hindered successful roll out. They include inadequate alignment in the formulation of the curriculum, teacher capacity development, selection and supply of learning materials and assessment. This led to improper coordination, Amina said. She said the majority of stakeholders are still optimistic about CBC's ability to improve learning. The CS said the process did not carefully consider resource constraints. Teachers were not supportive of the curriculum because their role was somewhat diminished in the new structure. Amina said problems also arose from the procedures for developing a learning programme being deemed as complex, decreasing the quality of lesson plans and teacher interventions. "The CBC national pilot will, therefore, be extended for one more year to allow alignment in implementation, particularly, intensive in-service teacher training," the statement said. The national roll out will take place in January 2020. The National Education Sector Strategic Plan for 2018-22 will be launched in February 2019. "A secretariat will be established within the ministry to coordinate the priorities, activities, communication and implementation infrastructure to support the CBC," the statement reads. Amina said the curriculum focus at the ministry will be reorganised to secure supervision and evaluation of the CBC in all public, private and special needs institutions across the country. Training of tutors for teacher training colleges will start in January 2019. Read:Â Kenya not ready for national roll out in 2019 Click here for more political news
