A list of individuals shortlisted for various positions at the county government of Bomet has been canceled in what could now lessen the frosty relations between the public service board and the county Assembly. Last week the county Assembly adopted a report stopping the board from further advertising, interviewing and recruiting persons for various positions. The MCAs cited unfairness in the recruitment process and failure by the body to obey the summonses by the committee on various occasions. In the report, the executive was also directed to forthwith stop further funds to the board until it honours the summonses by the assembly. The cancellation of the interviews which were set to begin next week was placed in a paid advertisement appearing in one of the local dailies on Saturday. It, however, remains unclear as to who paid for the advertisement with the board's chairman Joshua Terer distancing themselves from it. Terer who spoke to the Star said, "I am totally shocked with the development, we have just returned from Mombasa on some other official duties only to find that the process has been canceled."

He pointed out that the nullification would great unnecessary anxiety among candidates who had been shortlisted and who were preparing for the interviews. The board, Terer noted, will be issuing a communication regarding the nullification of the interviews next week. Positions advertised includes that of internal auditors, human resource managers, communication and ICT officers. Also Read: No mass layoffs, witch-hunting of Bomet county staff - Laboso
