The Sh74 billion Lake Turkana Wind Power project on Wednesday came under scrutiny from a group of senators who demanded an inquiry into how the funds were used. The senators want an independent investigative agency to determine if the country got value for money. They are Moses Wetang'ula (Bungoma), Mutula Kilonzo Jnr (Makueni), Godana Hargura (Marsabit), Mahamud Mohammed (Mandera) and Ledama ole Kina (Narok). Wetang'ula had sought a statement on the project which was contracted by Kenya Power and paid for by taxpayers. Lake Turkana Wind Power Company Limited was contracted to generate 300MW. The lawmakers called for recovery of funds paid for the project for which services were not rendered. “The delayed commissioning of the project has seen Lake Turkana Wind Power Company Limited lay a claim to the government for payment of deemed generated power at 100 per cent capacity. Already, a staggering sum of Sh5.7 billion has been paid,” Wetang'ula claimed. “The company is demanding a further Sh9.6 billion for the same. On what basis is the government making this astronomical payments to the firm without the supply of a single megawatt of electricity?” he further claimed. The senators also want the goverment to explain why it abandoned its feed-in-tariffs policy and syndicated a loan from the Spanish government of Sh17 billion, in addition to its contribution of Sh3 billion through Kenya Electricity Transmission Company (Ketraco) to construct the line. The Bungoma senator demanded that the Energy ministry explain to the taxpayers the total sum of money to be paid on the alleged deemed generated electricity. CS Charles Keter has been summoned to appear before the Energy committee.
