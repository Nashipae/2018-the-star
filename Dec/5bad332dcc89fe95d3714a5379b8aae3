Two orphans in Makueni county are appealing for help to pay secondary school fees. The two sisters, Angeline Museny'a and Catherine Ndunge scored 376 and 387 respectively. Museny'a was accepted to Precious Blood Kilungu, while Ndunge to Bura national school in Taita Taveta. The girls were raised by their mother, who was a single parent, until she passed away in 2014. The sisters were helped by well-wishers to complete studies at Mukameni Primary School. Their guardian speaking to the Star on phone said Museny'a and Ndunge are young bright girls with a promising future. "They are well disciplined girls and it is unfortunate what happened to them. They live with their grandmother but she is struggling to take care of five kids on her own," Benjamin Kisaulu said. Kisaulu is asking for well wishers to come to the aid of the young girls and donate whatever they can. The young girls will require among other financial requirements, money to cater for personal effects like blankets, bed sheets, suitcases and uniform. They can be reached on 0723469668.
