NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri (pictured) on Wednesday said the commission will only make compensation in kind.That means those displaced will be given alternative land. Addressing the land owners in Mokowe town, Swazuri said cash will only be paid for the various developments that were on the plots at the time of acquisition. The developments include trees, crops and houses. Beneficiaries will be compensated by end of next month. There were only 38 beneficiaries in the initial list but Swazuri said the current list has 54. “It should be clear that no money will be paid out for the acquired lands since we are only doing alternative compensation,” Swazuri said.
