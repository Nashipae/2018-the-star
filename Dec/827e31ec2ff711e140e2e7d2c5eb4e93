A businessman was yesterday charged with stealing Sh9.5 million from the Kenya Commercial Bank. Fredrick Kamakia was accused of stealing the cash on December 6 at the KCB Capitol Hill branch. A family discovered that their deceased father’s shares had been fraudulently sold at Sh9, 523,919 and proceeds credited to Kamakia’s account at the Capitol Hill Branch. They reported the matter to the bank’s forensics department. The bank flagged off Kamakia’s account who presented himself to the KCB headquarters on Monday demanding an explanation for his account’s closure. Kamakia claimed to be the only son to Daniel Makau whose shares he had allegedly disposed of.
