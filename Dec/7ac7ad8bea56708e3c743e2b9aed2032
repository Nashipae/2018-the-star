Kilifi governor Amason Kingi yesterday called for a federal system of government based on the eight post-independence provinces. He was addressing the Building Bridges to Unity Task Force. He wants the third tier of government, between the national government and the counties, to take 80 per cent of the budget because that would make it unattractive to become president. Kenya cannot afford another costly layer of government. We already have MPs who are among the most highly paid in the world, jet setting ministers, and over 60 MCAs in every county. It is naive to recommend that revenue for national government should be reduced as it is responsible for defence, infrastructure, and key expenditure. Regions do have shared interests. For instance, land is an emotive issue at the Coast and needs to be resolved. But the counties can work together to solve their common problems. Already they are setting up regional economic blocks for counties to cooperate. Counties should just collaborate through loose informal alliances. We cannot afford an additional costly layer of regional government. Quote of the day: "There is no need to substantiate the obvious". Jean-Marie Seroney The Kenyan politician died on 6 December, 1982
