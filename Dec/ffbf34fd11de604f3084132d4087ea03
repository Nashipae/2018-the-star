Comedian Obinna spent part of his life as a street child because he was angry with his father. "I used to have issues with my dad because he claimed I was so rude," he told Massawe on Radio Jambo yesterday. "I would even think he was not my real father. We did not agree and so I ran away from home and came to Nairobi, where I became a street boy in 2009 for one month," he said. He was forced to start acting to pay for his own school fees. "I am doing well, and that is why I am now fine with my dad. I joined Eastleigh High School and lied to the school that I was an orphan so they could admit me," Obinna said. "I was staying in Makongeni with some friends and would wash their clothes so I could be useful to them. I started acting in set book plays but I would not get paid because the money catered for my school fees." The comedian recently made headlines after he bought his baby mama a Toyota Passo during her birthday. He not only spent Sh750,000 on the gift but also spent some more to treat her. He is set to marry her soon. "She is the mother of my baby and that means she is special to me. She is a very kind and honest person," Obinna said. "I took her to a driving school before her birthday and gave her the gift during her birthday because she has been good to me and she deserved that from me. I am not for a big wedding. I prefer the Attorney General wedding to cut the cost and do something small for a party."
