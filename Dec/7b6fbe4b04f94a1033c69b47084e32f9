Businessman and owner of Enashipai Resort and Spa in Naivasha, John Mwangi, has died.
He was admitted to Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi. He died on Wednesday. Leaders eulogised Mwangi as a man who turned the face and fortunes of Naivasha. “His dedication and commitment to detail was unmatched, making Enashipai a favourable destination for high-profile meetings,” Nakuru governor Lee Kinyanjui said.
Naivasha Professional Association chairman Absolom Mukuusi said the death is a big loss.
 Kamau Njuguna, a director representing Kenya in the East Africa Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Mwangi transformed the hospitality industry in Nakuru. “We pass our condolences to the family as they mourn a great man,” he said.
A member of the family, who declined to be named, said, “It’s true mzee passed on yesterday. He had been undergoing treatment since last week,” the relative said.
