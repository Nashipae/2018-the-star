The Kenya University Students Association yesterday pledged to strike in all public universities in January if the policeman behind Carilton David Maina’s death is not arrested. Maina was shot dead on Christmas Eve in the company of his friends. Police stations near campuses will be attacked, Kusa president and chairman of the University of Nairobi Students Association Antony Manyara said. “Evans Njoroge, a Meru University student leader, was shot dead and nothing has been done so far. Today, as speak we have lost Carilton David Maina, a visionary student from Kibera slums who wanted to change lives of his home area,” he said. Carilton worked hard and got scholarship to Leeds University. Give us the officer who killed him or we shall meet on the streets, Manyara said. He said the issue of police brutality should be addressed.
