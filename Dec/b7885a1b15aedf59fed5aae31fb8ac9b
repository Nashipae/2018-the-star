A 40-year-old woman was yesterday charged at a Milimani court with causing grievous harm to a nurse at Kenyatta National Hospital after her child died while undergoing treatment. Pamela Akinyi  is accused of unlawfully attacking and seriously injuring Mildred Akinyi on October 13 in corridors of the referral hospital.  She allegedly attacked Akinyi, claiming nurses at KNH failed to transfuse blood to save her 17-year-old son’s life. Her son died of leukemia-related complications the previous night. The nurse had left a ward to fetch warm water for a patient when she met Akinyi with five other women and a man at the nurses’  reception. She directed her to the welfare office for assistance but was attacked as she left them.  The nurse was  rescued by colleagues and the hospital’s security and rushed to an emergency room, where she was admitted. Akinyi denied the charges before senior resident magistrate Caroline Nzimbe. She was released on a bond of Sh100, 000 and alternative cash bail of Sh50,000. The hearing starts on December 19.
