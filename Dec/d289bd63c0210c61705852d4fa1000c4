Sneha Kotecha’s bid to win her fourth International Tennis Federation (ITF) East Africa Junior circuit suffered a blow as she lost 0-6, 6-3,3-6 to Stepahanie Auer of Austria in the second leg’s semi final at Nairobi Club. Sneha, who won last week’s girls singles title found the going tough as her second set triumph was not enough to dump the resilient Austrian who overpowered her in the third set to proceed to the finals. Auer served off her quest to the finals strongly, winning all games in the first set against the unsettled Sneha who strained in her returns. The loss seemed to exasperate her as she staged a spirited fight in the second set to supplant the Austrian to level matters hence forcing the game into the determining set. The evenly contested third set saw Auer take a two game-lead but Sneha rallied from behind to restore parity before extending the lead by a game. She, however, could not maintain her tempo, allowing the Austrian to level matters and control the proceedings to the end of the set which earned her a place in the final. Sneha admitted that her opponent was stronger and consistent in her returns and this made things tough for her. “It was really a tough match for me as my opponent was strong and made fewer mistakes. She was good and consistent in her play and was on point in returning my serves. I hope I will have enough rest and prepare adequately for the third leg next week where I hope to reclaim my singles.” Auer will now meet Sofia Pizzoni of Italy in the final after the latter saw Vineetha Mummadi of India. In the boys’ category, second seeded and Nairobi-based Burundian Abdoul Shakur lost 4-6,3-6 to Peter Sallay of Hungary in the semi finals.
