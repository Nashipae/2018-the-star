Prior to this, Ngari served as global head for retail distribution. Lamin joined the bank in 1999. While the bank said the appointment of a cluster CEO for East Africa will be announced in due course, it also announced that Bola Adesola has been appointed as senior vice chairman, Africa. Adesola will be responsible for supporting the execution of the Bank’s strategic intent within the Africa region. "She will also lead as a senior banker on key relationships and transactions," read part of a statement.
