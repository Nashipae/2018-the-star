Athletics Kenya (AK) western branch factions are at loggerheads again with the bone of contention this time round being a15-km ‘Ikhongo Murwi’ race organised by Mama Sarah Obama Foundation. AK vice chairman Paul Mutwii has, however, warned the organisers of the event scheduled for December 15 of dire consequences if they go ahead and host it without following the due process. Mutwii said the organisers of the event had violated the rules governing the sport by side-stepping the bonafide officials and engaged the services of the suspended western branch officials led by Francis Afundi. He said Afundi has no authority to transact any business on behalf of the federation. “As far as AK is concerned, Afundi is under suspension and doesn’t sit in a committee that is charged with the responsibility of organising events in western. “We shall look for legal and government involvement to sort out the mess he is trying to perpetuate at branch level,” Mutwii reiterated. Mutwii also called on the western officials to ensure full force of the law is applied against the suspended officials led by the former branch chairman. Afundi and assistant secretary Henry Moi, who also served as deputy treasure, are alleged to be involved in fraudulently coordinating the event at the expense of bonafide branch officials. The two were suspension for allegedly mismanaging funds to a tune of Sh249,000 belonging to Kakamega Forest Marathon last month and have since been barred from carrying out any activity on behalf of AK. Western branch acting secretary, Homa Mugalitsi, reiterated said they will effect the order from the head office by ensuring the suspended officials face the full force of the law and that they pay for their actions.
