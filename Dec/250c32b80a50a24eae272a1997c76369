Maralal town in Samburu county has been hit by a fuel shortage after owners of petrol stations closed their businesses following a crackdown. Energy Regulatory Commission officials on Saturday ordered the close of stations selling fuel beyond the recommended prices. A litre of petrol was selling at Sh128 on Saturday instead of Sh117.89 as recommended by ERC and diesel was retailing at Sh122 rather than Sh116.83. Samburu Central subcounty commander Abagarro Guyo said the suspects will be charged on Monday. Hundreds of commuters were stranded with boda boda and taxi operators had to buy fuel from Nyahururu. “We are asking the government to help us make orders from Nyahururu town. Petrol stations in Maralal town have been closed, we don’t know what is happening,” boda boda operator Kennedy Lerosion said. Other businesses such as painting, which either require petrol or kerosene have also been affected. Click here for the latest political news
