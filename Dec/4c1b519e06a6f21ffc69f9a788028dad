Nzoia Water Company has bought 30 motorbikes to improve services to Bungoma and Trans Nzoia residents. Commercial and administrative manager Bernard Kikechi yesterday said in Webuye that their officers will use the bikes to collect revenue, read meters and supervise supplies. The two counties will share the motorbikes. Kikechi said they will buy more. He urged staff to avoid using them for personal errands. “I’d like to urge our customers to pay their water bills on time to avoid disconnection,” he said. “We’d like to assure them of constant clean water supply this festive season.” Nzowasco has more than 37,000 customers. It recently installed a new pump in Matisi, Webuye, to increase supply. It has advertised the position of managing director.
