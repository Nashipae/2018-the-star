Baringo governor Stanley Kiptis has hinted that Moi Teachers Training College Seretunin will soon become a county university. Kiptis gave in to the mounting pressure from professionals to “fast-track establishment of the long- awaited institution. “ We have already discussed with my colleague leaders and identified Moi TTC as the most viable place and plans are underway to have it converted into a university,” he said. The governor was reacting to remarks by Professor Paul Chepkuto who said the plans should be treated as a matter of urgency. “It is quite embarrassing as county Number One it has never hosted a president for a record 24 years. So far we don’t have asingle operational university,” Chepkuto said. Addressing the public at Keturwo on Saturday, Kiptis urged top graduates to submit ideas from their academic thesis to breathe life to the university. His sentiments were endorsed by Baringo North MP William Cheptumo, Water CS Simon Chelugui and Irrigation PS Fred Segor. Cheptumo backed Kiptis said they hoped the university will be ready by early next year. The idea by Senator Gideon Moi to move it to the 1,000-acre site owned by Egerton University at Chemeron in Baringo South was rejected by other leaders. They said it was it too far from Kabarnet town, the county headquarters.
