Four fishermen drowned on
Thursday after their boat capsized in Lake Victoria at Seme, Kisumu county. They are Dennis
Abala, Kennedy Oketch, Wilson Ndolo, and Chrispinus Bolo from West Kadinga
sub-location. County police commander Job Boronjo said the lot was on a fishing expedition at the time of the accident. "Six others were rescued when the accident occurred," Boronjo said. He said the boat carrying the ten fishermen was overpowered by strong winds and high tides before it overturned. The boat capsized at Kagwel beach, a few metres from Kianja beach
next to Ndere Island National Park at 5pm. The bodies were retrieved from the lake
and taken to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary. Accidents in Lake Victoria have become commonplace lately. Recently, about 33 revellers died after a boat they were partying in capsized in Uganda. Tanzania's MV Nyerere ferry capsized in Lake Victoria leaving at least 224 people dead last September. The lake has had a history of ferry disasters, the worst being 1996 when MV Bukoba killed over 800 people after it sank in Mwanza. Click here for the latest political news
