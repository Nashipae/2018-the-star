Pathologists removed two bullets from the body of Kilifi deputy governor Kennedy Kamto during an autopsy on Thursday. A source privy to the postmortem said one bullet went through Kamto's chest into his heart, killing him. The other bullet was retrieved from the left leg. The 1-hour autopsy was spearheaded by chief government pathologist Johansen Oduor. Kamto's body will be moved to Aga Khan Hospital mortuary awaiting burial on December 20. Following the incident, human rights group MUHURI has called for an overhaul of top police commanders in Mombasa. "Crime has moved from Likoni to Kisauni and now to Nyali. Police must be serious with their work," MUHURI' quick response officer Francis Auma said. Auma said Kamto's killers must be brought to book or else many people will continue to die in hands of gangs. Investigations surrounding the murder have begun with officials highly guarding the proceedings. The investigations, which have been taken over by top security personnel, are being conducted with a high level of secrecy. Mombasa county commissioner Evans Achoki refused to comment on the progress of investigations saying the matter was taken over by his seniors. "It is beyond us," he told the Star. Regional Coordinator Bernard Lemparamai said that among other things being investigated is the motive of the killers. "The investigations take long," he said without divulging more information. Kamto was killed by hooded gunmen at his Nyali home on Wednesday at dawn. His elder sister Chiku Kamto said this was the third time attackers were pursuing the former deputy governor.
