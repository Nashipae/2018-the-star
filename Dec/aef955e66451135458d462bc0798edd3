A driver of a lorry has died in a fiery crash after his truck collided head-on with another at Nyambare area along the Nairobi Nakuru highway. The Mitsubishi canter was heading towards Nakuru when the driver lost control and swerved off to the other lane where it collided with another one. Lari OCPD Isaiah Odhiambo said the canter driver died on the spot while his loader was rushed to Kijabe hospital in critical condition. Odhiambo said occupants of the other lorry escaped unhurt in the 6am accident. "We only lost the canter driver but his passenger has been rushed to the hospital where he is receiving treatment, another private car that was behind the ill-fated lorry hit it but its occupants were not injured," Odhiambo said. Eyewitnesses said the driver of the private car tried to break but his car skidded on the road since it was raining. "We were at the stage waiting for a matatu when the lorries collided. We started running away since we suspected that the vehicles might roll to where we were" said Simon Njuguna. A huge traffic jam ensued as the wreckage blocked part of the busy highway. The jam stretched for more than two kilometres as the wreckages of the canter and private car were on the middle of the road, while the Isuzu was at the ditch where it landed. "We urge drivers to be careful while driving along this road whether during the rainy and sunny season. Rainy season is worst since vehicles skids and visibility is poor," Odhiambo said. The body of the driver has been moved to Uplands funeral home, while wreckage of the three vehicles were towed to Lari police station. Click here for the latest political news
