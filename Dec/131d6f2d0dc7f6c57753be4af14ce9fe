Debutants Shabana will be out to extend their unbeaten run in the National Super League when they host a win-less Migori Youth today at Gusii Stadium in the fourth round of the season. The star studded Shabana have won all their opening three matches and sit second with nine points and will hope to maintain their perfect start in line with their dream of returning to the top flight after many years in the cold. The clash pitting leaders Wazito and Kibera Black Stars headline the triple header lined for Camp Toyoyo. The revamped Wazito lead the standings courtesy of their healthier goal difference and will accost Kibera who are yet to win a match and are placed 17th on the log.

Kenya Police are sixth with six points while the paramilitary team are seventh with five points. A revitalised Kisumu All Stars host St. Joseph Youth at Moi Stadium.
