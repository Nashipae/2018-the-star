Saudi Arabia's foreign minister has ruled out extraditing to Turkey suspects in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Adel al-Jubeir said: "We do not extradite our citizens." Just over a week ago, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan demanded the extradition and on Wednesday a Turkish court issued arrest warrants. Saudi Arabia has charged 11 people with the murder, which took place in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. Arrest warrants were issued in Turkey for former Saudi intelligence chief Ahmad al-Assiri and former royal adviser Saud al-Qahtani. al-Jubeir criticised the way Turkey has shared information with the kingdom. "The Turkish authorities have not been as forthcoming as we believe they should have been," he said, quoted by AFP news agency. "We have asked our friends in Turkey to provide us with evidence that we can use in a court of law. We have not received it in the manner that it should have been received." Erdogan says the order to kill Khashoggi came from the highest levels of the Saudi government but insists he does not want to damage the Saudi royal family. It denies that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was involved in the killing. The Gulf kingdom's public prosecutor has said Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate as a result of a "rogue operation" on the orders of an intelligence officer. Khashoggi was given a lethal injection after a struggle. His body was then dismembered inside the consulate in Istanbul and the body parts were handed over to a local "collaborator" outside the grounds, the prosecutor said.
