Preparations are in top gear ahead of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s visit on tomorrow to launch the pilot phase of universal health coverage in Kisumu. This is the first time Uhuru will visit the political home turf of ODM leader Raila Odinga after the March 9 handshake. National and county government officials, including county security team, yesterday met to fine tune the final planning. A multi-agency team was yesterday finishing on clearing the ground and painting of structures at Kisumu’s ASK Mamboleo showground, the venue. The roads to the showground were also under final repairs. Nyanza regional commissioner Moffat Kangi said they are prepared for the visit. He said the president will inspect road construction and launch the UHC. Massive preparations were also underway at the Kisumu State Lodge, an indication that Uhuru is likely to spend in Kisumu on Thursday. The President is also likely to address residents at the famous Kondele on his way to or from Mamboleo showground. “It is all system go as we have registered 245,000 households out of the targeted 240,000 by Monday.” Kisumu governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said. Heath CAS Rashid Amana met Nyong’o over the preparation for the launch. The UHC programme, one of the items in the Big Four agenda, will be piloted in four counties - Kisumu, Nyeri, Isiolo and Machakos.
