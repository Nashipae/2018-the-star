Police in Mombasa are pursuing three suspects linked to rising insecurity in Kisauni, Mvita, Changamwe and Likoni. County Commissioner Evans Achoki said on Tuesday the suspects are gang leaders. Achoki who spoke during a press conference in his office said they have their names, but declined to give them to the media. "I will not mention names, but we have their details. We know who we are looking for because in any crime scene in Mombasa, we’ve been seen these three people's names come up," said Achoki. He said police posts have been set up in Kisauni in areas with notorious criminal gangs. They include Kazandani, Kadongo and Frere Town. Mombasa Police Commander Johstone Ipara said they have arrested five suspects and recovered police uniforms. "Five suspects are in police custody, four others linked to murders in Kadzandani and Utange have been taken to court," said Ipara. The security chiefs said Mombasa will be safe during the festive season and there is no cause for alarm. On Saturday, two suspected criminals were killed along Mombasa’s Moi Avenue during a botched robbery bid. An AK47 rifle was recovered. Ipara said police on patrol found four men trying to break into a shop. Two suspects were shot dead and two others escaped. On Tuesday morning, another robbery was reported in Likoni near the Deputy County Commissioner’s office. A private security guard at the National Housing area was shot dead. "We have not arrested anyone over the killing but police are hunting for the thugs," said Achoki. Following the killing, the county commissioner held a meeting with all private security firms in Mombasa. Achoki said they agreed that police officers and private security firms will be working together. "The will jointly man social joints, malls, restaurants and clubs. Police will be riding in private security firm vehicles during patrols in hotspots," said Achoki. Click here for the latest political news
