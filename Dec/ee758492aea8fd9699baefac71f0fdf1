Deputy President William Ruto has asked universities to align their programmes with the needs of job market. He said course development should involve the rigorous analysis of the current market’s needs. Ruto spoke during the sixth graduation ceremony of Kisii University. “I would like to challenge the university to review the courses on offer and ask if what is being taught matches the way the world is changing,” the DP said. “We cannot achieve the goals we have set for ourselves as a country without world-class university education and first-rate programmes.” He said one reason that makes Kenya a regional powerhouse and a preferred investment destination is because it has the best human resources in the region. Ruto said the National Research Fund has been allocated Sh2 billion to meet its activities. “The role of a university is not just to teach but also to advance knowledge,” he said. Ruto said universities should come up with innovative ways of helping the government implement its Big Four agenda, citing affordable housing and universal healthcare. He said the government has allocated Sh350 million to Kisii University towards the expansion and infrastructural development. The DP told the graduates to utelise the skills, expertise and knowledge gained in the university to create jobs. “Do not limit yourself, do not be fixated on one path, do not think small. Ask yourself what you would do to make this county, or this country better and then start,” he added. Vice chancellor John Akama said 17,000 students have graduated from the institution. Most have started businesses.“We have prepared our students to compete effectively on the job market,” Akama said. Present included Kisii deputy governor Joash Maangi, MPs Richard Onyonka (Kitutu Chache South), Jerusha Momanyi (Nyamira woman rep), Jackson Limo (Kipkellion) and Oroo Oyioka (Bonchari).
