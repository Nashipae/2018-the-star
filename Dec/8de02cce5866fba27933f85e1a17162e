All is set for trial of the two suspects in the attempted murder of the former Garissa Finance executive Aden Mukhtar. The suspects are former KDF officer Aden Mohamed and Juliet Njoki. Aden and Njoki are charged with attempting to kill Mukhtar on August 19 on Kandara Road in Kileleshwa, Nairobi, and conspiring to kill lawyer Charles Kanjama between July 1 and September 27. They have denied the charges. Mukhtar was shot just before he filed a suit in court to challenge the credibility of governor Ali Korane’s academic qualifications, through his lawyer Kanjama. State counsel Nicholas Mutuku yesterday said the state has supplied the defence with 25 witness statements and 16 documents to be relied on during the trial. Defence lawyers Danstan Omari and Sam Nyaberi confirmed that they have received the items. The hearing will begin on February 6. Omari said they still have issues with detention of Aden’s car and money but will raise the same in presence of Assistant DPP Catherine Mwaniki who is prosecuting the case. Aden had Sh400, 000 in his car when he was arrested and the same was detained by the DCI.
