The impasse between leaders and the Teachers Service Commission over the admission of students from Northeastern to Teachers Training Colleges will speedily resolved, Deputy President William Ruto has said. Northeastern leaders want TSC to admit those with lower grades to colleges as part of ending marginalisation of the region. Those eligible for admission to TTCs must have a minimum grade of C- (minus) in KCSE. The leaders said many teachers have fled the region due to insecurity. They want the grade lowered so many locals can be trained to plug the teacher shortage in the region. TSC has rejected the request. “About the problem you have with TSC, I want to assure you that it will be resolved,” Ruto said yesterday. The Deputy President spoke in Garissa town after launching a water project. The project include drilling, equipping and pipeline distribution of borehole water in Garissa town. Ruto was accompanied by Garissa governor Ali Korane, MPs Adan Duale (Garissa Township), Rashid Kassim (Wajir East), Bashir Abdullahi (Mandera North), Hassan Omar (Wajir South), Abdi Shurie (Balambala), Mohamed Hire (Lagdera), Sophia Noor (Ijara), Mohamed Dahiye (Daadab), Abdikarim Osman (Fafi), Abdi Mude (Lafey), Annah Subbow (Garissa), Rehema Hassan (Tana River), Rehema Dida (Isiolo) and Mandera senator Mohamed Mohamud. Ruto urged the leaders to encourage students to take up teaching jobs so that the region can have adequate teachers from within. He said the government will ensure every child enjoys their right to education. “I want to give you our assurance as government that the education of our children, especially those from the pastoral communities, is a priority commitment,” Ruto said.
