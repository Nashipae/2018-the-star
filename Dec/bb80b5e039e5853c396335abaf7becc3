ODM has started a crackdown on its supporters who masquerade as branch officials in Nyanza and other stronghold areas. National chairman John Mbadi on Saturday expressed concern over what he described as cartels who disguise themselves as party officials and extort money from politicians in Nyanza. Speaking during fundraisers at Sare and Omboga Seventh Day Adventists churches in Karachuonyo Constituency, Mbadi said the trend is tainting the image of the party. “The habit is rampant in Nyanza and other areas where the party draws strong support. Most aspiring politicians have been conned by fake officials but we don’t know them,” Mbadi said. The Suba South MP who was accompanied by a number of Homa Bay MCAs including Julius Gaya (Central Karachuonyo), Jeff Ongoro (Kanyaluo) and Judy Kamaria(nominated) said ODM will start conducting its elections at all levels to weed out the masqueraders and get genuine officials who would be elected. He instructed ODM branch chairpersons to compile reports on genuine party officials. “We must have an order in the party. Instruction is given that should anyone be found masquerading as the party official legal action would be taken against them,” he added. The chairman told the imposter officials that they recognize them as the party supporters but they should not transact any business on behalf of the party. “I am not saying the party is rejecting its supporters. Anybody who masquerades as the party official should not blame us if they find will find themselves in a hot soup,” he said. Mbadi said he is committed to ensuring that ODM continues to gain more support in regions it did not perform well in the last general election. “We have already known our strengths and weaknesses. We are rolling out campaigns next year to make the party stronger than it is today,” Mbadi said. Click here for the latest political news
