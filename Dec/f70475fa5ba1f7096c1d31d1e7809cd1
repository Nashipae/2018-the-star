The holidays are a great time to celebrate food and to appreciate it. But, according to UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, in some parts of the world, holidays have become synonymous with over-eating and food waste. “In general, one third of all the food produced in the world is either lost or wasted. That amounts to 1.3 billion tons per year,” says FAO in a statement. The statement further stated that besides food waste there are also other resources like seeds, water, feed, money and labour that go into making the food are also lost. “While we celebrate the people and ideas that we value, let us make saving food one of them,” FAO said.The UN agency said to avoid and reduce holiday food waste, people should be realistic and plan in advance. “Don’t prepare food for 50 people if only five will turn up for dinner. If you do cook too much food, encourage guests to take some home with them. Whatever is left, put it promptly in the freezer for another day. In general, food should not be left at room temperature for longer than two hours,” the statement read. There are many creative recipes on the internet for using leftovers, and people should store any leftovers in the refrigerator and use it as soon as possible, the UN said. “The instinct to make something different for every meal is quite common, but before cooking a new dish, see if you have anything already prepared and still safe to eat to finish first. Alternatively, turn your old leftovers into a new dish. Just remember to avoid re-heating food and then putting it back into the refrigerator later,” says FAO. Another way to avoid food waste is to allow guests to serve themselves so they can what to eat. The UN advises that as nice as it is to serve people, a host might not accurately gage how much or how little someone wants to eat. “when a meal is self-serve, don’t take more than you can eat,” the statement read.
