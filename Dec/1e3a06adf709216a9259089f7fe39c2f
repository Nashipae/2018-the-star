Light Academy Mombasa has conceded defeat to their Nairobi counterparts after two candidates from the latter emerged in the list of top 20 best performers. They are Edwin Otieno Ouko, who was ranked third nationally after scoring an A of 87.289 points. Also in the list was Mark Gitau who scored an A of 86.886 points to hold position 20 nationally. "They done well but we will recover next year," Maika Mohamed of Light Academy told the Star on Saturday. The institution's Mombasa branch had nine candidates scoring A-s and 13 others with B+. Nabil Khalid Mbarak and Kadi Tereka Sadaraka topped in the school having posted an A- of 79 points. However, Maika said the school's mean grade reduced compared to last year. "This time we posted a mean grade of 8.42 compared
to last year’s 9.0," Maika said, attributing the same to increased number of candidates. In 2017, there were 28 candidates while this year
the number increased to 67. "We are however glad that out of the 67, 55 of
them surpassed the university entry grade," said the teacher. Nabil attributed the success to cooperation between
the teachers, parent and students. "Our principal pushed as hard but we are now
seeing the results," said Nabil. Gilbert Rumba, who also scored an A- with 76
points, said the journey has been long and tedious. Read: List of top 100 KCSE 2018 exam candidates Click here for the latest political news
