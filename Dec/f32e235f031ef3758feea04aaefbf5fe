Deputy President William Ruto has said the delay in rolling out the competence-based curriculum does not mean it will not happen. He said education is a critical sector and the ministry wants to ensure gaps are filled during the pilot before the national roll out. "We shall first begin by training teachers on the competence-based curriculum then put in place good policies that will then be taken to Parliament by February before we embark on rolling out the programme," Ruto said. He spoke on Saturday at Mabanga Primary School in Kabuchai constituency, Bungoma county, during the celebrations for Fr Pius Lukhale of Kimatuni Parish. Lukhale was celebrating 25 years of service. Education CS Amina Mohamed on Saturday announced that the national roll out of the CBC had been deferred by a year and that the pilot will continue until then. In a statement, she said poor planning and a hasty roll out led to the failure of the national roll out, which had been planned for January 2019. Ruto said education is about acquisition of knowledge, not just passing exams. "We want education to be about teaching an all-round individual," he said. "The Jubilee government is focused on ensuring the Big Four agenda is achieved before 2022." Click here for the latest political news
