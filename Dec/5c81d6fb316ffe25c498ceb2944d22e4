Has Kirinyaga governor Anne Waiguru succumbed to pressure from ward reps to complete stalled projects from the last regime? In September, while launching The Wang'uru Open Air Market, Waiguru said she will not be pressured to complete projects that are not "viable" started during the Ndathi regime.During Jamhuri day celebrations which were snubbed by all MCAs and MPs from the county, Waiguru backtracked and said her government will complete the projects and pay the pending bills after the on going special audit. "We have heard some noises about projects from the last regime,we will complete those projects so that they benefit Wanjiku since if we do not then the monies will have gone to waste,'' Waiguru said on during the Jamhuri day celebrations. The county boss had further said her government would not pay Sh 290 million pending bills from her predecessors regime since most lacked supporting documents. "If we embark on completing these projects then we will be putting funds to waste since they are not viable and you will see the EACC and the DPP come for us,no we won't complete the projects until a special audit is done," Waiguru said then. "We realised that most pending bills had no supporting documents,some were sneaked in during the transition period and hence we can't pay without a special audit that we have requested from the office of the auditor general only those that will get a clean bill of health will be paid.'' Waiguru said then. The MCAs led by budget committee chairman and Baragwi ward MCA David Mathenge had accused the executive of not implementing development projects at the ward level. Mathene had further asked the county to move with speed and complete stalled projects from the Ndathi regime.
