Kiambu woman representative Gathoni Wamuchomba has expressed concern over rising cases of molestation. She said on Saturday that she received numerous complaints. She called for swift measures to curb the problem. Wamuchomba said the sexual predators are known. On Friday, two men were charged in a Thika court with separately defiling two children aged six and four. They denied the charges. Wamuchomba said, “Some teachers molest our children. Drivers entrusted with ferrying kids home prey on the innocent souls too. Uncles have also turned into beasts and are mauling their nieces. These cases are skyrocketing. A solution must be sought.” She spoke at St Andrews ACK Church in Thika. The church provides a Bible study programme for 900 children from the town. The lawmaker urged parents to educate their children on how to protect themselves and tell them to speak out whenever anyone makes sexual advances to them. “In most cases, victims are threatened with dire consequences, including death, if they disclose the ordeals. This can be changed by emboldening them to speak up when anyone touches them indecently,” she said.
