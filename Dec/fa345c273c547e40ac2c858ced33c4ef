A nephew of Kisumu governor Anyang’ Nyong’o has filed a fresh application seeking a six months jail term for the governor and his sister Risper Nyagoy for contempt of court. Kenneth Odhiambo says the governor and his sister failed to comply with a court order issued by the High Court judge Tripsisa Cherere in October. He also wants Susan Mudhune, Esther Nyong’o and Mary Owiti be committed to civil jail for a period not excluding six months. Odhiambo moved to court just hours after Nyong’o and Risper withdrew an appeal challenging the High Court decision that required them to include their nephews and nieces as beneficiaries to their farther's Sh 200million estate. Justice Tripsisa Cherere in the ruling ordered Nyong’o to include all children belonging to their sisters as beneficiaries to the multi-million property. She also revoked the administrative letters and certificate of confirmation of grant that placed him and the sister as the sole controllers of the state and appointed one of the nephews as the co-administrator of the estate.
