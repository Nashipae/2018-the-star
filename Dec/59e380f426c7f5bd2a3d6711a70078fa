Four more police officers accused of torturing and robbing the owner of a clinic in Embakasi of cash have been arrested and will be charged on Friday. The four are among ten police officers and a civilian who are accused of robbing the clinical officer of Sh291,000 in Tassia, Nairobi, on December 12. They claimed they were investigating unlawful possession of government drugs at the clinic. According to police records, the suspects tortured the medic and were handed Sh261,000 in cash and the rest via M-Pesa. Four other officers and a civilian were arrested on Wednesday and arraigned on Thursday. They are Enock Rop and Alfonce Ochieng, both attached to Kayole Division, and Oscar Ojiro and Paul Gwandaru, both attached at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters. They were charged alongside Reuben Mutugi, a taxi driver who officers from the Special Crimes Prevention Unit claimed drove the officers around Nairobi on the night of the incident. Those arrested on Thursday are Godhard Mburu, Geoffrey Letome, Vincent Malonga and Kennedy Atemi. “The first five have already been charged in Court; the rest in safe custody awaiting arraignment tomorrow and two being sought by detectives,” the DCI said. Meanwhile, detectives are looking for one Muigai Ngugi, alias Moses Muigai Ngugi who was charged with impersonation but failed, for the second time, to appear in court on December 10. The suspect first skipped court appearance on September 20. Ngugi is accused of impersonating NIS officer at Nyayo House and obtaining Sh300,000 in false pretence. He was out on bail but a warrant of arrest was issued after he skipped court. The detectives are appealing to the public to report to the DCI headquarters or the nearest police station should they spot him. They said a reward will be issued for information that may lead to his arrest. Click here for the latest political news
