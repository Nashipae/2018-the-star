Farmers want to meet President Uhuru Kenyatta over the maize crisis, opening of the NCPB depots, price for new harvests and the Sh2.1 billion they have not been paid. They have petitioned the State House to plan the meeting. The farmers made the request through Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri. The Cabinet approved Sh2,300 per bag, but farmers rejected the price. They said they would lose money and have proposed least Sh3,200. Last year, the NCPB paid Sh3,200 per bag. Kenya Farmers Association director Kipkorir Menjo yesterday said they will raise their grievances with the President. “We believe he is well placed to understand the plight of farmers than other leaders. That’s why we want to discuss with him so we find the best way forward,” he said. “We would like to know when the NCPB stores will be opened to start buying maize from farmers.” Last week, outspoken Jubilee MPs Alfred Keter, Silas Tiren and Joshua Kuttuny said they would lead the farmers to meet Uhuru. The government plans to buy two million bags, which was approved by the Cabinet.
