Mandera governor Ali Roba has hit out at the National Treasury over its failure to release the equalization fund to the county. Speaking yesterday at Moi stadium in Mandera town during the Jamhuri Day celebrations, Roba said the national government is holding on Sh14 billion which should have been released to marginalised counties. He said the funds belonged to the counties as required by law which is to be used to bring them at par in terms of development with the rest of Kenya. “We resist any attempt to block the Equalization Fund from being disbursed to the 14 counties as identified by the Constitution. I am calling upon the national government to move with speed and release the funds,” Roba said. Roba said the county was on the path to recovery from years of marginalisation by successive regimes. “I am happy to note that with tremendous efforts we continue to make strides that restore our pride under devolution. Our destiny is in our hands,” he said. He urged stakeholders to ensure they actively engage in public participation by the county to ensure legitimacy and protection of the people's will in all projects. Roba also called for the lifting of the ban on quarry activities in the county. The governor commended the joint efforts by the National government, Kenya Defence Forces, the National Police Service, the National Intelligence Service, the National Counter Terrorism Centre and non-state actors who put their lives on the line to make Mandera and Kenya County safe from extremists. “Six years ago, Mandera residents could not gather in public even to mark such an important national day like this because Al Shabaab militants had made it difficult for us to gather and celebrate. I am happy with our recent conference that brought all leaders together to agree and campaign against violent extremism,” Roba said.
