Nyanza residents are preparing to welcome President Uhuru Kenyatta during his first visit to Kisumu since his March 9 handshake with Raila Odinga. Nyanza is Raila’s backyard and considered an opposition stronghold. The President will visit on December 13 to launch the piloting of Universal Healthcare Coverage, part of his Big Four Agenda. The government will spend Sh3.9 billion to pilot the programme in Kisumu, Nyeri, Isiolo and Machakos counties. The projects will establish the capacity of NHIF and improve infrastructure before the programme is rolled out countrywide. Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong’o said the county is well prepared to host the President. Muhoroni MP Onyango Koyoo called on President Kenyatta to revive collapsed sugar industries, saying the livelihood of millions of Kenyans depends on the sector. He said Uhuru should also launch the construction of Muhoroni-Mamboleo C674 road, formerly the C34, which is a key road to Kisumu, Nandi and neighbouring counties. Other leaders welcoming Uhuru include Nyando MP Jared Okello, Kisumu Central MP Fred Outa and Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga They said the region will benefit from projects through Uhuru’s visit. “We expect most stalled projects such as Kicomi, sugar and fishing industry, and maritime transport to be given priority by Uhuru,” Okello said.

He said the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital should be upgraded to the level of Kenyatta National Hospital and Moi Referral Hospital.
