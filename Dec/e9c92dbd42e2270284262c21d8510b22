Jubilee vice chair David Murathe has offered Kirinyaga governor Anne Waiguru his position after she called for fresh party elections. In a response to Waiguru's remark, Murathe said she needs to familiarise herself with the party Constitution. "Please acquaint yourself with the party Constitution Article 33 (5) on the transition clause. Tuju retires in 2020. The operative word is "shall"," he tweeted. "Unless you want to amend the party Constitution. Mine, you can have on a silver platter even tomorrow. Join the rabid attack dogs," he added. Waiguru called for fresh elections in the midst of a political storm kicked off by Murathe's remark that the party does not have any binding agreement to support Deputy President Ruto in 2022. She said statements made on behalf of the party should be done by elected party officials who "in fact represent the views of the Jubilee party as a whole."
