Knut and the TSC have been urged to give dialogue a chance. Labour CS Ukur Yatani on Friday announced the conciliation team assembled on December 20 has began work. The team led by Charles Maranga will file its report in three weeks. Other members include Benson Okwaro, Moses Ombokh, Linus Kariuki, Issack Kubai, Robert Muthanga and Albert Njeru. Knut issued a strike notice on December 19, saying teachers will not report to work when schools open in January. Teachers' grievances lack of promotions, delocalisation and transfers, the performance contracting system and their professional development modules. Knut and TSC have been directed to file their submissions by close of business Friday. The team is scheduled to have a sitting with the teachers' union on Saturday at the Mfangano lane offices. "The conciliation committee will [visit] Knut headquarters and meet with their executive committee to get further clarification on the details of the issues in contention and or content of their memorandum," the statement reads. The arbitration team will in turn visit TSC headquarters on Monday morning before starting a joint sitting with the disputing parties in the afternoon. Noting that the matter is of immense public interest, Yatani has called for patience and commitment to the dialogue. Click here for the latest political news
