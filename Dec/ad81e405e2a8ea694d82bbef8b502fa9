Golf Park’s Tony Omuli shot an excellent round on the first day of the fourth leg of the Safari Tour Golf series at the Thika Greens Golf Resort to emerge clubhouse leader with a 3-under par 69 score. He shot a bogey-free first nine, holding par on the first seven holes followed by consecutive birdies on the Par-4 eighth and Par-4 ninth holes for a total of 34. On the back nine, he started off with consecutive birdies on the Par-4 10th and Par-4 11th before dropping shots at the Par-4 12th and the Par-3 14th. Having held par on the reminder of the holes, a birdie at the Par-5 18th took his back nine total to 35. Speaking after the Round, Omuli said that he was happy with his performance after Round One adding that there was still more work to be done in the remaining rounds. “It was a good opening round today and I am pleased with the performance. The course is long and challenging and there is still a lot of golf to be played in the remaining rounds so a lot can change in the process. I intend to maintain a similar game focus throughout the tournament in the hope of winning my first Safari Tour title,” he said. Meanwhile, Railway Golf Club’s Alfred Nandwa, Mumias Sugar’s Dismas Indiza and Nyali’s Njuguna Ngugi finished the round tied second after returning a decent 2-under Par 70 score. On the first nine, Nandwa picked birdies on the Par-5 second and the Par-3 sixth before bogeying the Par-4 seventh to return a first nine total of 35. On the back nine, birdies on the Par-4 11th, Par-5 13th, Par-3 16th and the Par-3 17th cancelled off dropped shots on the Par-4 11th and the Par-5 18th for a back nine total of 35. On his part, Indiza only dropped one shot on the first nine at the Par-4 seventh, but a birdie on the par-5 second took his total to 36. On the back nine, birdies on the Par-4 11th, Par-5 13th, Par-4 15th and the Par-4 16th were enough to cancel out bogeys at the Par-3 14th and Par 5 18th for a total of 34. Elsewhere, Greg Snow, top pro at both the Vet Lab and Limuru legs of the Safari Tour Golf Series, ended the round tied in sixth with a level par score.
