The Ministry of Education plans to replicate the scholarship model in Muhoroni in all constituencies countrywide, CS Amina Mohamed has said. Amina said the model being used in the constituency under the stewardship of MP Onyango Koyoo targets bright and needy students. She said the ministry is considering working with all constituencies to provide bursaries where they lack structure. Amina said the Muhoroni Constituency Development Fund set up one of the best grassroots scholarship program in 2014, one of its kind in the country. In a speech read on her behalf by Nyanza regional director of education Richard Chepkawai, she said the state was impressed by the work done in Muhoroni. The CS said Koyoo has supervised the building of classrooms, dormitories and dining rooms at Achego Girls, Koru Girls, St Rita Ramala Girls. among others. He has also set up one of the most innovative grassroots scholarship programmes in the country. The first lot had 43 candidates who sat for the KCSE exam n 2014. “With this clear vision, Koyoo is building the transformation of the Muhoroni generation. One that will raise the status of this country to become a leading light in Kenya,” Amina said. Most of the students have qualified to study engineering, medicine, architecture and law, and have been absorbed into the full sponsorship programme. The remaining 30 have all been placed in universities. In 2018, the subcounty had a total of 209 students under the National School Policy and Sh11,190,696 was paid for their full years’ fees by Muhoroni National Government Constituency Development Fund. Amina said the ministry has been considering deepening its partnership with MPs in providing scholarships and bursaries. Koyoo said when he took over in 2013, he realized most students who performed very well in KCPE examinations and got admissions into national schools could not afford school fees and their chances were filled by students from well off families outside the county.
