Tanzania and South Africa played to a barren draw in Copa Coca-Cola Africa Championship Group D match at Nakuru High School yesterday. Hlongwane Njabulo, Nxumalo Lulama and Captain Buthelezi Thando were particularly impressive for South Africa while Omary Said and Hemed Benjamin created interesting opportunities for the East African nation early on. The match gradually transformed into an end to end affair with both teams seeking to break the deadlock during the lively opening half,. Unfortunately the match ended without a goal. The second half was equally balanced with most of the action taking part in the middle of the park. The game witnessed several stoppages due to injuries before the sides shared the spoils. “I am happy we didn’t concede but I am a little disappointed that we didn’t score because we had good chances. I think the injuries to my two key players played a part in the result but overall I am happy with the performance. We now have to perform better in our next match against Angola,” said Tanzania coach Abel Mtweve said. “It was a tough match because we played yesterday under the rains and my players struggled to pass the ball around today. I think it was a good show overall. Tanzania too played very well. They were strong and quick,” South Africa coach Isaac Shai added. The standings are taking shape with South Africa leading the group with four points from two games in the wake of their opening 10-0 win over Angola. Tanzania are second with a solitary point and Angola are bottom of the pile. Meanwhile, Two second half goals helped Mozambique defeat Malawi 2-0 in the Pool ‘C’ match. Mozambique scored the first goal immediately after the restart, through super-sub Luis Filipe’s ferocious shot. Joao Faizal doubled the advantage from the penalty spot after a Malawian defender was adjudged to have handled the ball in the box. Malawi’s defeat means they have no chance of winning the tourney having lost 2-1 to Uganda in the opener.
