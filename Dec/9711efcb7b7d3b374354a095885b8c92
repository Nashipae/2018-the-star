Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi yesterday criticised the ongoing Kenya Defence forces for lack of openness. “There is unevenness of recruits and I don’t know the reason. Why can’t they tell us that in this subcounty we have picked this number and so on? Is it hard to say? We don’t need those secrets since they are not helping at all,” Mulyungi said. Speaking at Mwingi Sports Ground yesterday, Mulyungi said the number of officers being recruited per constituency should be made public to avoid marginalising some areas. Mulyungi said the Constitution requires all opportunities to be spread equally and every region should reap equally from the benefits. He said even after the National Assembly summoned Defense CS Raychelle Omamo to give clear information on the matter, she excused herself, saying the information was classified according to the Kenya Defense Forces Act. The MP assured the people living with disability in his constituency that their welfare is well cared for. Yesterday he gave out more than 100 wheelchairs to persons living with disability in Mwingi. Elsewhere, Makueni representative of People With Disabilities Ben Nguluu expressed concern over low participation of the disabled in sports. At a ceremony to mark World Day of Disability on Monday, he urged the national and county governments to invest in special fields for people with disabilities.
