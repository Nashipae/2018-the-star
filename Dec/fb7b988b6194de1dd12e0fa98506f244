Residents of Kibagare slum in Westlands have sued the county government and the National Land Commission to stop their eviction from disputed land. An association of slum dwellers says their children, persons living with HIV/Aids and the disabled are at risk of being thrown out into the streets with nowhere to go. The Kibagare Slums Association wants the court to stop the state and countyt from evicting them, fencing off the land or erecting any building. They say they do not have an alternative place to live. “There is no likely compensation that can restore the slum dwellers and members of the petitioner (association) into normal dignified life if evicted and exposed to the elements of nature with no alternative shelter, health, educational and religious facilities such as they are enjoying, albeit in poor and squalid conditions,” lawyer Harun Ndubi says in suit papers. The court heard that the slum dwellers have lived on the land since 1950s and know no other home. The slum near Loresho South Estate has schools, churches, mosques and dispensaries and houses. The land belongs to the government and was previously allocated to Kenya Railways. But the parcel became free and was occupied by landless persons. Recently, strangers have been surveying the land accompanied by police officers, causing anxiety among slum dwellers.
