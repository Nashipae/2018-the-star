Five people on Monday died at Kapiti plains, Machakos county whenÂ the matatu they were traveling in collided with a lorry. Athi River police boss Sharma Wario said the 14-seater private matatu was ferrying faithful from St Marys Miracles Church, Mombasa back to the Coast. "They were headed to the Coast from a crusade in Siaya county," he said. The group left Siaya for Mombasa at 4.30 am. The accident happened at 8.30 am. There were 14 adults and three children. The injured were taken to Machakos Level 5 Hospital, while the deceased were moved to the mortuary at the same facility. Wario urged motorists to drive carefully, especially during this festive season. "People should be careful on the road. This section of the highway is straight and clear so I don't understand how the two drivers could not see the approaching vehicles," he said. Click here for the latest political news
