ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru wants technology-based firms to list at the Nairobi Securities Exchange in order to create more wealth. “We want to be a wealth creating society, tech firms need to list in order to get more involved and benefit from the advantages of listing,” Mucheru told the Star on the sidelines of CIO 100 symposium and Awards in Naivasha. He urgedthe firms to further use skills to drive transformation in both the public and private sectors and grow the economy. To drive a listing confidence in the tech firms, Mucheru expressed government’s confidence in supporting and sustaining momentum of investing in ICT. “Having witnessed the evolution of technology from the days internet services were declared illegal until the government accepted internet as an integral tool for development...it is evident the sector is growing,” he said. Currently, Safaricom is the only telecommunication and technology- based firm listed at the NSE. At least 350 CIOs present at the symposium called on the government to first work on its policies before asking ICT firms to list. According to Tech-world, global tech publisher and analysis platform, some of the requirements associated with IPOs are discouraging to tech companies. “What can also prove off-putting to tech companies are some of the requirements such as disclosing confidential details about the business to the public, therefore increasing the likelihood that ideas are poached by the competition,” the firm said. While the bourse has had no IPO listing for the last six years, Capital Markets Authority is optimistic some of the budget announcements made this year will lead to new listings.
