Security personnel have arrested one of the three main suspects in connection with the abduction of Italian aid worker Silvia Romano. Ibrahim Adan Omar, who had a Sh1 million bounty on his head, was nabbed at Bangali town in Tana River at 7pm on Monday. An operation has been ongoing since November 20, when Romano, the manager of African Milele Onlus, was abducted at her rental home in Chakama in Kilifi.

He said Omar is cooperating as police hunt for the remaining suspects and Romano. However, he declined to give further details about the arrest. “It’s true we have arrested one suspect, but I may not disclose other details since it could jeopardise the investigations," Akoru said. Security personnel have been conducting a major air and ground operation in Kilifi and Tana River counties. Sources said security forces recovered an AK47 riffle, two magazines and bullets. Last week, three people, among them the wife of one of the three key suspects and a Tana River nominated MCA, appeared in court but were not charged. Police sought more time to complete investigations. The other suspects who are wanted over the abduction include Yusuf Kuno Adan and Said Adan Abdi. A security operation comprising the Kenya Police, AP, GSU, Kenya Defence Forces, KWS, and special forces are in Tana River and Lamu searching for the suspects. The suspects are believed to be planning to cross over into Somalia with Romano. Click here for the latest political news
