A KCSE candidate committed suicide in Nyamache, Kisii county after failing to meet his expectations in the just released results. Geoffrey Ayako, 20, hanged himself after he failed to score beyond a C- that made him repeat form four. The student opted to retake the KCSE examinations with the hope of doing better this year. He scored C- in 2017. Chief Meshack Nyang’ara told the Star they believe the student was disappointed by the outcome, hence the decision to take his own life. "The boy first sat his KCSE examination last year at Nyabinge and managed a C-. He opted to repeat at Borangi where he scored the same grade. We suspect he might have been stressed by the score," the chief said. Kisii county police commander Edward Muli said it was unfortunate for the family to lose such a young boy. The police boss advised parents to properly guide their children to avoid such incidents in future. Read: List of top 100 KCSE 2018 exam candidates Click here for the latest political news
