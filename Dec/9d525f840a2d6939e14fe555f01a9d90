The Supreme Court is expected to give a ruling on the acquittal of two Iranians convicted of three terrorism-related charges in 2013. The five-judge bench which was chaired by Chief Justice David Maraga heard arguments from both the ODPP and defence on Tuesday. The Iranians were found guilty by the Milimani chief magistrate's court three years ago, but the Court of Appeal ruled that there was insufficient evidence early this year. The ODPP later in February lodged an appeal against the Court of Appeal's decision to acquit Ahamad Mohammed and Sayed Mousavi. It wants the two to serve their life sentence after being convicted of possessing 15kg of explosives and planning to carry out bombings.

But the two have maintained innocence saying they were just tourists. The ODPP told the court that information obtained from the convicts during investigations helped them recover the deadly explosives and that it does not amount to a confession. "Evidence on record proves that two respondents had knowledge where RDX (explosives) were recovered. Witnesses placed respondents at the scene of recovery," the prosecution said. "Information obtained from suspect during investigations which led to recovery of exhibits does not amount to a confession under section 25A Evidence Act but section 111(1) and 119 Evidence Act," it said.
