Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on Wednesday  was displeased with Miss Uganda Abenakyo for wearing Indian hair. "I congratulate our muzukulu on these accolades and also salute her for recently completing her university degree course,‚Äù tweeted Museveni. "She is a true definition of beauty coupled with brains. My only concern is that she was wearing Indian hair. I have encouraged her to keep her natural African hair. We must show African beauty in its natural form." Miss Abenakyo visited the Ugandan President after she had just returned home from Sanya, China, where she came close to winning the Miss World title in China, finishing third in the popular vote. Abenakyo, who was crowned Miss Uganda 2018-19 in August, rose to global fame when she won the continental crown in the Miss World 2018 contest. She also became the first Miss Uganda to make it to the top five finalists in the Miss World contest. Vanessa Ponce of Mexico was crowned Miss World 2018.
