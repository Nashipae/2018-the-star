The government has paid maize farmers for grain delivered to the NCPB last year, except for 49 who are still under investigation by the EACC. Another 44 farmers are being vetted, Agriculture Chief Administrative Secretary Andrew Tuimur said yesterday. The government has paid out Sh950 million. “We owed farmers Sh2.1 billion but Treasury released Sh950 million, which is for paying the remaining farmers” except for 93. Kipkorir Menjo, the director of Kenya Farmers Association, confirmed that most farmers have been paid. He urged the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to hasten investigations. He said genuine farmers should be cleared in time to repay loans owed to the Agricultural Finance Corporation.
