The Auditor General report of 2017 has revealed unverified expenditure by a Siaya county executive. According to the report there is spending that the executive is not able to substantiate. The report in its second page shows that Sh29 million in the purchase of two fire engines that cost Sh113 million was not accounted for. “The management has not explained how the balance of Sh29 million which had been disbursed out of the Sh113 million was utilized,” the report reads. The report went ahead to highlight how the executive was not able to justify the Sh4.9 million for landscaping at the governor’s office compound. The report established that the Sh4.9 million has been paid in completion to the contractor but the work is not even halfway. “Physical verification of the landscaping on 9 January 2018 revealed that the landscaping had been partially done yet the contractor had been fully paid the total contract sum of Sh4.9,” the report said. The report also raised concern why the executive paid extra Sh2.8 million to the same contractor to put up ordinary and executive car park that was later demolished. The county government of Siaya was also put to task on the procurement of maize from three suppliers through direct procurement totaling to Sh95 million for distribution to the county residents to mitigate the effects of famine. Auditor General Edward Ouko noted that the executive had correspondences from National Cereals and Produce Board on the availability of maize yet the direct procurement of maize worth Sh86.6 million was carried out in mid-June 2017 while the county had information on famine in March 2017. The report shows that the County Government procured the maize as famine relief yet they did not have an emergency fund in operation. It also revealed that even though the County Government of Siaya initiated the construction of county headquarter as its flagship project in 2013/2014 financial year, the proposed project has not fully been implemented. The management were however not able to provide inspection and acceptance committee report for audit examination to justify payment of Sh21 million to a consultant. Also in the report, the legality of the expenditure of Sh8.7 million on payment for insurance providers for the year ended 30 June 2017 cannot be confirmed. In the report that was released yesterday, Ouko says no support documents were availed for their audit examination to confirm on who took 150 VIP meals worth Sh165, 000, ordinary meals for 60 people worth Sh419,250, a security worth Sh120, 000, publicity and mobilization worth Sh120, 000 and transport worth Sh96, 000. According to the Auditor General, no invoice from the supplier was availed for audit examination. The propriety of the expenditure of Sh20 million paid to an Advocate as legal fees could also not be confirmed. Governor Cornel Rasanga’s government could not also explain how imprest issued and surrendered amounting to Sh11.5 million was not adequately supported with relevant supporting documents. Also, it was noted that 27 officers were holding imprest above Sh500, 000 each, all totaling to Sh62.6 million which has not been accounted for as at 30 June 2017. The executive could not provide proper supporting documents on how Sh22.9 million was reimbursed for a night out and transport allowances for staff members for various training in Kisumu. The County management is said to have breached the law and regulations governing emergency expenditure by spending Sh256.7 million on emergency relief and refugee assistance.
