As the Form 1 selection and placement begin today, KCPE exam
candidates are anxious about where they will be posted and whether the
100 per cent transition promised by the government will be realised. National, extra-county, county and subcounty schools are involved. The 1,052,364 candidates who sat the exam will be joining 800,000 students who transited to secondary schools last
year. With elimination of tuition costs and a higher number of students clearing Class 8, enrollment in secondary schools will rise. This requires excellent planning by the Education ministry and school administrators to maintain quality. A
good number of students will be admitted to county and subcounty
schools that have been operating in many area with limited resources and few teachers. Over three years, the pupil-to-teacher ratio has worsened, mostly as a result of increased admissions. This has hurt education
and reduced teacher-student contact hours. The current ratio is
1:60. Four years ago, it was 1:45. The recommendation is 1:40. Delayed
disbursement of state funds, shortage of classrooms, libraries, labs and other facilities also hurt learning and teaching. These challenges must be urgently addressed to safeguard standards as more students clear Class 8 and Form 4. Quote of the Day: “Facing it, always facing it, that’s the way to get through.
