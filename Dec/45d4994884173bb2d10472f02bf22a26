The Education ministry could release KCSE exam results next week. Examiners are winding up marking. The announcement will come earlier than usual as promised by CS Amina Mohamed to give way for university admissions, which are set to start early next year. Some 663,811 students sat the exam. Last year, KCSE exam results were released on December 20. The Kenya National Examination Council had earlier indicated the results would be released before Christmas. The Star has, however, established that the exercise is at an advanced stage and results compilation will soon start. Knec estimated it would take longer than marking of KCPE exam. The latter relies on machines while marking of secondary school exam is done manually. Knec chairperson George Magoha yesterday said the bulk of the papers have been dispensed with. About 20 national schools in Nairobi and environs are acting as marking centres. They have at least 4,000 examiners. The exam was conducted under strict guidelines to curb cheating and malpractice. Some 110 individuals, including students, were arrested for attempting to cheat while four were deregistered over impersonation. Click here for the latest political news
