A suspected member of the Wakali kwanza gang in Likoni succumbed to injuries on Friday following an attack by boda boda operators. Michael Otieno, 18, was among a group of six suspected criminals attacked by the operators in Senti Kumi on Thursday night. Mombasa Level 5 Hospital deputy chief administrator Mary Ochola said Otieno sustained deep cuts. The other youths suffered injuries in the head, back and hands. “They were brought here at 5am by cops. All were young men,” Ochola said. The boda boda operators were armed with crude weapons. Residents said the gang has been terrorising residents. Muslims for Human Rights rapid response officer Francis Auma said, "Mob justice should be discouraged and parents need to be vigilant." Likoni police boss Benjamin Rotich said the gang members were hard-core criminals from Kisauni. “They had sought refuge in Likoni after police mounted an operation in Kisauni,” he said. He said they had planned to rob a resident, who raised the alarm, prompting the attack by the operators. Read: Police gun down Wakali kwanza gang leader Click here for the latest political news
