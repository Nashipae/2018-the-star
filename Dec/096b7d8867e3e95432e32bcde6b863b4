Some 240 young men from Gatundu, Kiambu county, recently graduated into adulthood after undergoing circumcision under the Kikuyu traditions. The colourful ceremony was held at Gatundu Primary School and was organised by the Kiama Couma Elders Council. Kiambu principal chief called on the church to let the council conduct traditional rites such as circumcision and to deter from describing them as demonic. He congratulated the elders for taking their rightful role and told the church to concentrate on spiritual matters.
