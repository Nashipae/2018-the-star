Music recording powerhouse Decimal Records is set to release its first compilation album, 'Decimator Vol 1'. The label is owned by producer Eric Musyoka and P-Unit's Bon-Eye. The 15-track album will be launched at the Kiza Ballroom on Tuesday. It will feature new and veteran artistes, including Nannoma, Bon'Eye, Brian Nadra, Konkodi, Jack Rooster, Avril, Yvonne Darq, Shaquay, Khuhani, P Unit and producer Ricco Beatz. Perhaps the biggest surprise is the inclusion of Nannoma, one of the pioneer rap groups in Kenya in the late 90s. It comprises Eric Musyoka (Masta Aajab), Big MiC (Zanthara) and Mbwa Kali (Toshi). They are featured in the album with a remix of their first hit, Kila Saa, which will feature new artistes Shaquay and Khuhani.
