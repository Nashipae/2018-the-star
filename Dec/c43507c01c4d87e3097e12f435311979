Barely three months after being promoted to the national Division Two Super League western region, Kabras United risk being locked out of event due to lack of funds as registration deadline looms. Team’s head coach Phillip Shiundu said they are yet to get a sponsor hence he is worried they might not be part of the league. “We received our promotion letter immediately after we finished the branch league top and we immediately started looking for sponsors. Unfortunately we are yet to get any,” he noted. He said they have been relying on a well wisher, Patrick Lumumba for support only that it’s not sufficient enough to enable them take part in the league. “Lumumba has always stood with the team right from lower leagues up to now,” said Shiundu. He said the team has embarked on serious pre-season preparations and with sponsors on board, they hope to be competitive this season. He said they have also acquired three experienced players to bolster the squad as they seek to prove a point. Those who were signed recently are defender Geoffrey Khalumi, striker Ben Makokha and Richard Kasiti. Football Kenya Federation( FKF) western region executive officer, Tony Kweya, has warned teams that they risk being locked out if they do not pay part of their registration by the end of this week.
