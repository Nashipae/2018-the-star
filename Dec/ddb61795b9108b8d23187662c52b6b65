Four senators have said the Building Bridges Initiative will create a strong political alliance and bring all Kenyans together for a common goal in 2022. The senators, led by Siaya’s James Orengo, said the alliance will bring all the major political figures in the county together. Addressing residents on Sunday during a funds drive at Yenga in Siaya, Orengo said the alliance will not include those who want to drag Kenyans backward. He said the time for retrogressive politics is over. Orengo added that the Building Bridges task force is collecting views of Kenyans on how they would want to be governed after the 2022 elections. “When the bridge that Raila Odinga commissioned is complete, President Uhuru Kenyatta will have to assess the bridge before it’s again used by Raila to take Kenyans to the promised land,” he said. He added that after the President assesses the bridge, he will make the major announcement of his successor, which he promised would shock many people. Kisumu senator Fred Outa, Moses Kajwang (Homa Bay), and Olekina Oledama (Narok) said the President will not exit the stage without giving Kenyans direction on who will replace him. Kajwang dismissed those who want ODM leader Raila Odinga to retire from active politics, saying Raila is still in the big league. Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo told off those positioning themselves for the presidency, saying nobody can match Raila’s stature. He said Deputy President William Ruto should wait his turn for the presidency. Oledama also said his community is fully behind Raila’s leadership. He said the Maasai leaders who are not behind Raila are brokers trying to hoodwink residents.
