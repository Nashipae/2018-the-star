Kenya’s most successful female pugilist Fatuma ‘Iron Fist’ Zarika will hang her gloves next year, but not until she defends her World Boxing Council (WBC) title in a rematch against Catherine Phiri of Zambia in March. “Time comes when you say enough is enough. The essence though will be to end my career on a high,” said Zarika. Zarika who was inspired by Conjestina Achieng’ aka ‘Hands of Stone’ is to date the only Kenyan boxer to lay hands on the WBC title, which is the most prestigious among the global boxing titles. The Nairobi-based boxer said she aspires to inspire the next generation of female boxers. Zarika defeated Yamileth Mercado of Mexico at KICC to successfully defend her WBC title. The SportPesa-sponsored boxer stretched her record to 31 wins, 12 losses and two draws. Zarika out-boxed Zambian Phiri through a unanimous points decision to retain the World Boxing Council (WBC) bantamweight belt in her first title defence at Carnivore grounds in December 2017. The ‘Iron First’ withstood deep cuts above the right and below left eyes to chalk up a unanimous decision. Judges John Shipanuka (Zambia), Michael Neequaye (Ghana) and Steve ‘Vedo’ Okumu scored 97-92, 98-95 and 99-92 in favour Zarika, who successfully staged her first defence since winning the title October 2016, after defeating Jamaican Alicia Ashley in the USA. Zarika thrilled fans with some good combinations especially in the first four rounds during Phiri’s fight.
