A Kilifi MP has asked the Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo to stop the construction of a Sh1 billion office block for MCAs, saying it is too expensive. Kilifi North lawmaker Owen Baya (pictured) wrote to Odhiambo on Monday asking her to also investigate if the project was properly approved. Kilifi residents on Saturday took to social media to protest the construction of the office, saying there were better ways to spend public funds. The luxurious office block will have a gym, jacuzzi, sauna and steam bath facilities. Baya’s letter was copied to the Auditor General Edward Ouko who was asked to launch probe on the matter. “Kilifi cannot use its little resources to provide luxurious lifestyle to our MCAs while people suffer because of poverty and food insecurity,” Baya said. Baya wants Odhiambo to establish if the project went through public participation and whether the county government was involved in the design, approval, procurement and supervision as required.
