Several people have been hospitalised in Bungoma after chaos broke out between two warring factions in Sirisia constituency. Trouble started when police blocked politician Moses Nandalwe from assessing the venue of a funds drive for boda boda riders at Mayuba stadium. Incensed youth in his entourage tried to force their way into the stadium and they clashed with a rival group. Police used live bullets and teargas to disperse the youths who fought back for the better part of the afternoon. Sirisia police Antony Njeru told the Star on the phone that while the Consitution allowed for free assembly, Nandalwe had not notified them of the meeting. "He ought to have told us earlier of the planned meeting," he said. Nandalwe, however, rubbished the claims. He said he had informed the police. He accused the police of working under the instructions of a local politician. "The politician didn't want the funds drive to happen. He is afraid of my growing popularity," Nandalwe said. The politician accused by Nandalwe could not be reached for comment. His phone went unanswered. Click here for the latest political news
