Lugari leaders will meet President Uhuru Kenyatta next year over development in the region, MP Ayub Savula has said. Speaking during graduation at Mautuma KMTC yesterday, Savula said that the community will not depend opposition leader Raila Odinga to negotiate development for them. Savula accused Raila of abandoning Luhyas in the opposition as he joined the government to negotiate for his Nyanza region. “We are envious of Nyanza. Look at the kind of development that is being taken there yet we were all together in NASA. We must go and also seek our share of development,” he said. The MP said that Luhya governors, MPs, senators, women representatives and MCAs will start holding meetings in January before booking an appointment with the President. Uhuru began a two-day tour of Nyanza yesterday. He is hosted by Raila. The President is expected to launch several development projects in the region. It was the first time the Head of State is touring the region that vehemently opposed his re-election to the extent of boycotting the repeat presidential election on October 26, last year. The two leaders made peace through the now famous March 9 handshake that has redefined Kenya’s political landscape. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has since been given a job by Uhuru while other NASA principals, Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Moses Wetang’ula (Ford Kenya) have declined to join government. He added that the community received a raw deal during the grand coalition government formed after disputed presidential elections. Savula said that the community will also negotiate directly with Uhuru for the 2022 presidency. “We do not need to go through intermediaries because Uhuru is the one in power,” he said. Savula supported the government’s decision to suspend the new education curriculum adding its implementation was hurried and the government needs more time to engage with all key players to ensure its success.
