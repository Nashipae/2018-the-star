The government says it has sealed loopholes for illegal trade in drugs and counterfeits at Eldoret International Airport. A consignment of Mandrax drugs was seized at the airport early this year. The manager of the facility Walter Agong (top right) said they have enforced a new clearing system to ensure the airport is not a conduit for illegal trade. “All relevant government agencies are working as a team and we can not entertain counterfeits or drugs to go through this airport,” he said. The performance of the airport has also improved as it currently receives four cargo flights per week, bringing in one million tonnes of cargo, especially from the Middle East. “Our records indicate we have achieved about 15 per cent improvement in cargo handling compared to the previous years,” Agong said. He spoke at the airport during an anti-counterfeit border sensitisation forum under the North Rift Consumer Outreach Programme organised by the Anti-Counterfeit Agency. The Eldoret Airport is the second largest in the country after the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in terms of cargo. “We are now targeting even better performance in the next one year and aiming to be an efficient facility offering world class services,” Agong said. Six months ago police arrested three KRA officers for trying to sneak in Mandrax drugs.
