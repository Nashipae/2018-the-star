Bahati's wife Diana Marua and his baby mama Yvette Obura have never met. Speaking to Massawe on Friday, Diana said they don't talk. "We don't know each other because she was in a relationship with Bahati and when I came in, she was not in his life," she said. "Her daughter comes home at least once a week. She is innocent and she doesn't have to be involved in all what people are saying." Bahati accepts that he also had a past, despite being a gospel artiste. "I like to be open because I want to inspire other people. Being a gospel artiste does not mean I don't have a past. Everyone has a past and it was puppy love," Bahati said during the interview. How does the couple handle trolls? "At the beginning, it was so hard but it reached a time I had to accept the life because it is about me, not what people are saying," Diana said. "The worst troll was when bloggers said Bahati did a DNA test for our daughter Heaven without my knowledge. I had just had a baby and had healed from postpartum, and it was so hard on me when I read such information." Bahati explained that he had done a DNA test on his first daughter and bloggers picked that story. Bahati and Diana's daughter is called Heaven Wendo, but they will give her another name when she is big.
