Secular singer Vivian, alias Vivian Kenya, and her fiance are planning to have a white wedding soon. The wedding arrangements are in progress," Vivian told Massawe yesterday. The two celebrated their ruracio ceremony early this year after Sam, who doubles up as Vivianâ€™s manager, proposed to her last year during an interview on live TV. "It is easier to date him because he was and is still my manager and music is all about lifestyle. Your exposure is big and therefore you need someone close to you every time," she said. The singer, however, said she is not sure when she will be getting a baby with Sam West. "I don't know if I want to get babies but if they come, it is okay with me. Although it is not right to put pressure on getting a baby," she said. "You have to have embraced the decision of getting kids. When babies come, they come with a lot of responsibility, which every woman has to be ready to adapt to." During Mother's Day, Vivian took many people by surprise when she unveiled a grown girl, whom she introduced as her own biological daughter. She said in the interview that she got the baby at a young age. "I got my baby in my early 20s and my baby daddy is not a deadbeat," she said. Her worst embarrassment on stage was when her zipper came out as she was performing. "I once had my zipper torn while performing and had to stop my performance and go make it. Sam came on stage and made it for me, a great challenge of managing female artiste. It was the most embarrassing thing on stage," she said.
