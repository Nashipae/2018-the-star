County hospitals have been urged to move from manual to digital records. Health CS Cecily Kariuki said the digitisation of public health facilities in the counties would improve efficiency of services to patients. She was addressing the press at Kathiani Level 4 Hospital in Machakos county on Thursday. Cecily said digitisation would cut the time spent by patients in hospitals as they wait to be attended. She visited the facility after touring Mavoko Level 3 Hospital accompanied by Machakos deputy governor Francis Maliti, Athi River deputy county commissioner David Juma and his Machakos counterpart Kasim Boso. The CS’s visit to the two hospitals was a follow-up on the universal health coverage programme launched by President Kenyatta in Kisumu last week. “President Uhuru announced that health services are free in all public health facilities in the four pilot counties where universal health coverage programme has been launched. I am here to follow up and monitor how the project has taken off in Machakos county after the launch,” she said. She confirmed the availability of drugs. “Before coming to Kathiani, I passed through Mavoko Level 3 Hospital and confirmed that the drugs had arrived. No more charges for health services,” she said.
