The Mandera department of Labour and Social Protection has digitally registered over 20,000 people to benefit from the government’s social protection fund. Mandera East children’s officer Haji Somo on Friday said the fund dubbed ‘Inua Jamii’ was marred by inefficiencies due to the analogue platform the beneficiaries used to access the fund. Somo said the biometric features used to identify the beneficiaries were inneficient as some could not be identified using a biometric machine. He said the government is registering the beneficiaries through the modern banking system by opening an account for every beneficiary where they will in the future access their Sh2,000 monthly grant without going through the Ministry of Labour and social Protection officials. “The beneficiaries can now access their money through the ATM and from the banking hall without coming to our offices, “ Somo said. In the program there are three types of socially vulnerable groups who are currently benefiting from the government grant; orphans and vulnerable children, persons living with severe disabilities and the elderly persons cash transfer.
