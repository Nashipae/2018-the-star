The rising public debt will chock the country to death if left unchecked, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi said on Monday. He said Kenya must make a 360-degree turn to salvage the situation because the government is borrowing unnecessarily. "We have borrowed to feed our greed," Mudavadi said at a press conference in Mombasa. "We are now loan fighting. We are borrowing loans to repay other loans," he said. On Friday, President Uhuru Kenyatta told journalists at State House, Mombasa, Kenya is in a good position to repay its debts. He dismissed fears that the country could lose the Port of Mombasa to Chinese Exim Bank, should it fail to repay the loans it took to fund the standard gauge railway.

The President promised to give journalists evidence to publish for Kenyans. "We demand full disclosure of all the status of the loans we have taken. All the details....." Mudavadi said. He said Kenyans cannot live with uncertainty since the public debt has risen to 60 per cent of the GDP. The government says the debt is at 56 per cent of the GDP, which it said is no cause for alarm as it is lower than superpowers like Japan, who has a public debt of about 100 per cent of the GDP. Mudavadi, however, said 2019 will be even tougher if nothing is done to reduce the public debt. He said Kenyans are overburdened with taxes on essential commodities.
