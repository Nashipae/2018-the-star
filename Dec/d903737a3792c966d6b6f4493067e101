Nandi governor Stephen Sang wants all multi-national tea estates surrendered to the county after the expiry of their 99-year leases. During a meeting with the British Deputy High Commissioner Susie Kitchens on Wednesday, Sang said the county has no intention of extending the leases. He said some of the Nandi tea estates were operating on temporary extension and hoped that there would be a smooth transfer of the properties to the county. The governor explained that the relationship between the county and the tea firms have been cordial in the past two years. Kitchens was accompanied officials from the British High Commission who are seeking ways of working closely with regional economic blocs. She said the British government was keen on supporting the blocs as they dealt directly with improving communities. The county has been pushing for compensation over historical land injustices.
