Former Harambee Stars captain Robert Mambo and Bandari FC coach Bernard Mwalala have called for the establishment of another strong team from the coastal region to partner Bandari in the Kenyan Premier League. By doing this, the two opined, more youths from the region will get more opportunities to nurture their talent and manage to put food on the table. “Bandari can only accommodate 25 players. There are many talented players here at the Coast. If we had another strong team, it will be a step forward for the region,” said Mwalala. “We must support people like Saido in order to have more teams from the Coats in the Premier League” Mwalala spoke after the final of the inaugural Said Abdalla Foundation Super Cup at the Uwanja wa Mbuzi in Kongowea on Wednesday. Kadzandani FC won the tournament after beating Talanta FC 1-0. Mambo, however, said talent alone cannot make players successful. “Hard work and discipline are key ingredients in any footballer’s career. With discipline and hard work, more players from the Coast can play in Europe,” said Mambo. He said a good example of hard work and discipline is epitomised in Mohamed Katana Nyanje alias Agege Messi who plays for Greek giants Panathinaikos. Agege was born and brought up in Mwandoni, Mombasa and was spotted by Qatari’s Aspire Academy. He has also played for Portuguese giants, Sporting Lisbon, prior to moving to Panathanaikos. On Wednesday, Agege, 19, said his dream of playing in Europe came true because of discipline and hard work without having featured for any major football club locally.
