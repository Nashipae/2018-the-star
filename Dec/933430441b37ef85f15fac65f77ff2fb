The 2012 Olympic marathon bronze medallist has set sights on ether Tokyo or London as his next assignment after placing third in Berlin in September. Wilson Kipsang said depending on how they agree with his manager, London or Tokyo will be his preferred destination when the season opens next year. “I have recovered well after Berlin and I want to compete in either London or Tokyo. Berlin Marathon is behind me and I have to focus ahead with a view of posting good results,” he said said during the launch of Young Athletes Training Camp at Kitany Boys High School in Elgeyo Marakwet. Kipsang won London marathon in 2012 in a time of 2:04.44 and 2014 in 2:04.29. He went on to claim the Tokyo Marathon in 2017, where he posted an impressive 2:03.58. “My target is to improve on my time in either of the two races. I am preparing well for my next assignment and I believe I have what it take to win another race even after my average show in Berlin,” Kipsang, who is also a former New York City Marathon champion, said. Kipsang placed third in Berlin Marathon this year behind winner Eliud Kipchoge, who recorded a new world record of 2:01.39 to erase the previous mark of 2:02.57 posted by Dennis Kimetto at the same venue. Amos Kipruto displayed courageous show to place second. “My target is to win my first race in 2019 and I am working towards that. What happened this year will count for nothing because as an athlete, I am required to always stay focused with new goals,” he said.
