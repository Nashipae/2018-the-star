Homa Bay leaders have formed a team to carry out civic education ahead of the expected Supreme Court ruling on petition against governor Cyprian Awiti. The Homa Bay County Peace and Reconciliation team comprises of the county security team led by county commissioner Macharia Irungu, church leaders, Imams, youth leaders, civil society, political leaders and members of the public. The director of Justice and Mercy, a local NGO, Ken Okoth, says the initiative is meant to prepare the Homa Bay voters for any court verdict. “Homa Bay is always known as a violence prone county and that is why we have come up with the initiative to talk to our people and whichever the ruling goes,we must remain in peace as brothers and sisters,” Okoth said. Homa Bay governor Cyprian Awiti and former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga are battling at the Supreme Court over the August 8, general elections governor results outcome. Magwanga successfully petitioned the re-election of Awiti at Homa Bay High Court which nullified the results citing numerous illegalities and irregularities. Awiti then moved to the Court of Appeal in Kisumu which upheld the lower court ruling before proceeding to the Supreme Court.
