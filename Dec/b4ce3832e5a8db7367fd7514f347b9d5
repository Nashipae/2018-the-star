Knut Tharaka-Nithi branch has faulted the decision by the Teachers Service Commission to transfer primary school headteachers and secondary school principals. Chuka and Maara Knut branch executive secretary Njeru Mutani (above) said the transfer of teachers who were about to retire might break up families. He said 36 primary school headteachers and six secondary school principals in Tharaka-Nithi county had been transferred to Embu and Makueni counties. The TSC transfers target 3,000 teachers countrywide. Mutani said the transfers will adversely affect exam performance.
