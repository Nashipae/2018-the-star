The plot has thickened at National Lands Commission after it emerged that CCTV cameras were disabled when a computer allegedly containing fraudulent payments was stolen. All the CCTV cameras leading to the second floor where the servers are located were disconnected on Saturday before the computer disappeared on Sunday, a source told the Star on Tuesday. Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti has since summoned security personnel at the building and NLC staff to record statements. Kinoti has also asked commissioners and directors to record statements of the same incidence. The computer that was stolen contains all-important data on all mega land compensation deals that the commission has been undertaking on behalf of the government. The machine which was domiciled at the 2nd floor of the Ardhi House disappeared mysteriously on Sunday night in what could throw off balance a probe into irregular payouts to several companies and individuals in regards to SGR phase 1 and 2 compensation scheme. Also lost is crucial data on the NLC's compensation programme for other various projects including dams and road expansion sites. On Monday both NLC chair Muhamad Swazuri and Abigael Mbagaya confirmed the loss. More on this: Probe into NLC irregular payouts in limbo as computer goes missing
