Garissa government enforcement officials have denied they harassed and stripped naked a miraa and food vendor when they evicted traders from a bus park. Head of the enforcement unit Major (Rtd) Ibrahim Hassan on Wednesday said the woman was “unruly, abusive and she undressed herself” to evade arrest early this week. He said she later claimed she was stripped naked by the officers. “The woman has occupied the market dumpsite and when we gave her a vacate notice, she became unruly and uncooperative,” Hassan told the Star. He said they called in police officers to assist in apprehending her, but the woman tore up her clothes. “We were shocked but we tried our best to arrest her in the best way possible,” Hassan said. The vendor had on Tuesday claimed the county enforcement officers stripped her naked, manhandled her, before marching her to the police station. She said the officers ruined her dignity in public, when they ripped her clothes, including the headscarf and diraa — a flowing local dress. Garissa police boss Aron Moriasi said they are investigating. He said preliminary reports indicate the woman undressed herself. “We were told she incited other women against the officers. We will have comprehensive report on this matter on Tuesday,” he said. The county is clearing traders off the main streets. It issued a 30-day eviction order to clear Orahey market because it is too congested.
