Kenya’s Sneha Kotecha launched her bid for her fourth junior title strongly after thrashing India’s Sahithya Vederea in straight sets to qualify for the third round on a day where matches were delayed due to showers. In the boys category, Albert Njogu had his way to the third round made easy after his opponent Max Flaherty of Australia retired while trailing 6-2,2-0. The burly Aussie had his bid to recover from a set down thwarted by a leg injury which condemned him to an early exit. As Njogu made it to the third round his compatriot Ryan Randiek went down fighting 6-3,6-1 to Frank Jonker of Netherlands to exit the tournament in the second round. The diminutive home player hardly matched Jonker’s strong forehands in either sets and scattered returns to the advantage of the towering Dutch, who powered his way to the third round. Randiek faulted his errors and lack of match fitness following his six month injury as key contributors to the loss. The rookie, however, expressed optimism in recovering his form which dwindled while on the sidelines through playing test matches and tournaments. “I was a little bit erratic in my forehand and in the entire match. He was strong and aggressive but I still feel I am yet to hit my best form. I am working towards it by doing lots of practice and being in the three legs of this tournament has also helped me considerably. I haven’t performed to my expectations in the three legs but I really hope I will redeem myself once I am at my best. I now shift to doubles and prepare for forthcoming Karen Open Championship,” said Randiek In other matches played at the same venue, Kenyan-born Briton Jayson Mbogoro lost 6-4,6-0 to Rostilav Galfinger of Kazakhstan while Kenya’s Kendi Kamunde lost 6-4,6-0 to Joanna Ploccia of Poland in the girls tie. Second seeded boy Sina Moghimi of Ireland progressed to the next round after edging out Emin Keskin of Netherlands 6-3,6-1.
