The body of a man who drowned in a swimming pool at a hotel in Kabarnet, Baringo county was found by a watchman on Monday. Musa Chesang said he went to the pool area at 6am to switch off the light and noticed clothes near the pool. “I walked there to see if someone had sneaked in early to swim, only to see the body of a young man stuck at the bottom of the water,” he said. Chesang rang the hotel branch manager who went to the site then reported the incident at the nearby police station. “The previous evening (Sunday), I checked the pool twice around 8.30pm and 9pm just to make sure nobody was around. I had already sent away some youth who were swimming at the site during the day,” Chesang said. The manager said the pool area is closed at 5pm. The hotel had earlier hosted a meeting involving artists, musicians and dancers from Kabarnet town. “I cannot tell if the victim was one of the youths. They finished their meeting and left the hotel by 8pm,” Kandie said. The artists said the deceased was not part of their team. “We have not seen this man around Kabarnet town, maybe he is still new,” musician Oscar Kemboi said. Residents gathered around the pool to view the body, but no one could identify it. Police took the body to the county referral hospital mortuary in Kabarnet town and investigations were launched. County police commander Smallets Munyanzi said the body had no injuries to suggest murder. “But the criminal investigation officers are handling the matter,” he said. Munyanzi urged residents to be careful when swimming. Click here for the latest political news
