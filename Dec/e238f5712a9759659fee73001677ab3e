Turkana South MP James Lomenen has condemned the killing  of  two county officials by  suspected Pokot bandits. Turkana county commissioner Seif Matata confirmed that the Turkana South Constituency Development manager Mark Erukudi and environment officer Maxwell Lokol were shot dead while on a motorbike heading to Nakwamoru from Kapelibok. “The two were shot dead on the evening of Wednesday by suspected armed banditts from neighbouring West Pokot county on a motorbike while heading to Nakwamoru to join their families,” Matata said. He said the suspected bandits retaliated to  attacks after a seven-year-old boy was shot dead at Takaywa by armed cattle rustlers and left with an unknown number of cattle on Wednesday morning. Lomenen has condemned the killings saying that conflict is very expensive and urged both communities not to retaliate but instead shun cattle rustling.“We have planned for cease fire meetings for the course of the week along the Turkwel corridors. Pokot leaders and Turkana leaders will have dialogue to cease fire meetings to each community in specified region.” he said. He said they Will converge the two communities leaders on the next day to bring back the situation to normal as for now tension has heightened. He said they will deal with areas and people who caused the problem so that they can join hands to bring back the situation to normal. We will on Saturday hold several peace-building barazas that will be attended by border villagers from the two communities,” said Mr Lomenen. The region has suffered a string of attacks for a long time making hard to attract  investments into the  county. Lack of employment opportunities has left locals with livestock as the only sources of income which drive them to engage in cattle rustling and banditry attacks heightening insecurity.
