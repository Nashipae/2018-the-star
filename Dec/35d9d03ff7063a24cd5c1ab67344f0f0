The police service has transferred 167 officers in a reshuffle that takes effect immediately. The changes were announced Wednesday in a circular dispatched by Deputy Inspector General of police Larry Kieng. Police formations affected include the Tourist Police Unit, Kenya Railways, Traffic Department, Kenya Police Airwing, Anti-Stock Theft Unit (ASTU) and Kenya Airport Police Unit (KAPU). Among those redeployed are 41 Chief Inspectors and 126 Inspectors of police. Kieng did not disclose the reasons behind the redeployment. “Release the officers to report to their new stations by January 15, 2019. Confirm departure/arrival by casualty return,” Kieng directed regional commandants and the commandants of the affected police units. On August 1, some 503 police officers were affected in yet another reshuffle aimed at bolstering national security targeting officers who have overstayed in their current stations. Some 433 Chief Inspectors (CI) and 70 Inspectors of Police (IPs) were moved to new stations in the changes announced by Deputy Inspector General of Police Edward Njoroge Mbugua. Among those affected in the latest changes include the Lang’ata OCS Raphael Kioko who has been moved to Mwiki in the same capacity. He switched places with Anthony Waigwa Muchemi. EACC OCS Esther Muthoni has on her part been moved to Makadara as the staffing officer. Click here for the latest political news
