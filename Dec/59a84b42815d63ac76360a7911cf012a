Kitui county commissioner Samuel Kimiti has urged security agencies to deal firmly with those molesting or mistreating the disabled. He said on Monday that all people must be treated with dignity, regardless of their physical conditions. “I’m worried by information of molestation and mistreatment of the disabled people. All security committees must ensure safety of the people living with disability,” Kimiti said during the International Day of People with Disability at Kauwi Primary School. County police commander Antony Kamitu said his officers will ensure culprits are punished. “Any case of molestation or manhandling of any disabled person must be reported for swift action. We’ll hunt down such heartless people and ensure they face the law,” he said. Kamitu gave his mobile phone number so residents can report directly. The county government said it is committed to programmes that empower the disabled. Chief officer Agnes Mulewa represented the governor.
