Reason? They are no longer sure that Ruto is Uhuru's chosen successor. Some have quietly been avoiding being seen in public with the man from Sugoi and are reaching out to other possible candidates. ***** Has Gideon Moi decided to roll up his sleeves and get his hands dirty? The son of the former president has scaled up his political activities in the recent past with visits to opposition strongholds of Nyanza and western Kenya and President Uhuru's home region of central. We are told that the Baringo Senator is planning other visits to the rest of the country as he tries to position himself.

Reason? The member has allegedly been acting as an agent for some importers of bitumen products yet the same are produced locally. They are concerned why an official of such high position is busy promoting importation of certain products at the expense of local manufactures and also undermining President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s agenda four on boosting local manufacturing. ***** A former MP from Nyanza has lost hope in politics after he unsuccessfully failed to recapture the seat. His political career has dwindled to the point that he resorted to hiring hecklers to cheer him up in funerals. Residents vowed not to elect him over his poor track record for the two terms he served. Recently, the man who served as assistant minister, hired hecklers and ferried them to a former councilor's burial. But they were shut down by youths who got wind of their plans to heckle the representative of the current MP from speaking. Surprisingly, the MP showed up unexpectedly amid cheers from locals. He addressed mourners peacefully forcing the hired hecklers to leave. He has so far decided to join forces with other perennial poll losers to groom a candidate, who had vied for the seat and lost, for 2022 race. Click here for
