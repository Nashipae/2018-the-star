The Supreme Court on Friday upheld Alfred Mutua's win in the 2017 Machakos governor election. The apex court ruled that the Appeals Court erred in nullifying the county boss' win. Through lawyer Kioko Kilukumi, Mutua said the Appeal judges erred by nullifying the elections on grounds that it failed the test of constitutional verifiability. The court ruled that the governor was validly elected and asked his competitor Wavinya Ndeti to meet all costs of the case. The appellate court had ruled that Wiper candidate Wavinya Ndeti proved that irregularities and illegalities committed by the IEBC affected the results.

"...2022 here we come. I'm still in the race to be fifth president of the republic of Kenya. It is time for change," he said. The governor added: "Those who have led this country before like President Jomo Kenyatta, Daniel Moi, Mwai Kibaki and now Uhuru Kenyatta have done a wonderful job...same to Raila Odinga for entrenching democracy...but we want money in our pockets."
