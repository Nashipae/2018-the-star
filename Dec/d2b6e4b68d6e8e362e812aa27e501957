Bungoma senator Moses Wetang’ula and Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa have dismissed claims that Luhya leaders failed to pick a 2022 presidential candidate when they met last Wednesday in Vihiga. They instead said on Friday that the meeting, which took place during the annual Maragoli Cultural Festival, was not meant to endorse one of them for the top job. Media reports had indicated that the leaders were unable to pick a candidate, leaving the region’s unity in limbo and hurting the chances of one of its sons ascending to the top job. “I’m shocked by some of the scribes who come from this region and keep reporting funny and negative reports on our unity as Luhya leaders,” Wetang’ula said in Ndivisi, Webuye East. They attended the burial of Mzee Richard Namisi, a Tachoni elder. Wetang’ula said the Mbale municipal grounds meeting brought leaders together to celebrate the community’s culture. Eugene said they agreed to clean their house first by putting aside their differences and walking together. He said his rivalry with Wetang’ula has ended. The CS led a Ford Kenya splinter group that formed New Ford Kenya. “We’ve set our differences aside and embraced each other. It doesn’t augur well for those who have been laughing at our community because now they know we are a united house,” Eugene said.
