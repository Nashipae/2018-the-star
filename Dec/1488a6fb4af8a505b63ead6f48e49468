Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has vowed to enhance the war on drugs. He spoke on Monday, when he officially opened the International Conference on Drug Demand Reduction at KICC, Nairobi. Matiang'i decried rampant drug and substance abuse in both primary and secondary schools. He said the ministry has repatriated several foreigners who had failed to meet international requirements and will continue to do so. The five-day conference is a partnership between the Ministry of Interior, Nacada and the International Society of Substance Use Prevention and Treatment Professionals. "This is not just a Kenyan problem, but global. One thing that we must embrace is less talk. We need to act more,” Matiang'i said. "It’s a global tragedy associated with all social evils, including disease, corruption, violence, crime, breaking up families destroying young lives among others." The CS said Kenya has adopted a strategy that seeks to address both the supply and demand for drugs in conformity with the three international conventions on drug control. "As a country, we will also be calling for enhanced international cooperation and increased allocation of resources for the campaign for a world free from trafficking and use of illicit and controlled drugs," he said. Matiang'i said Kenya is increasingly cooperating police and customs authorities. He said the Kenya Coast Service will also help curb drug and human trafficking. The CS called for support from faith-based organisations and the community, adding they play a critical role in treatment and rehabilitation of addicts. Click here for the latest political news
