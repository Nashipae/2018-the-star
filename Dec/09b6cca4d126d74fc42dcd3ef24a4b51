Kabras Sugar have signed Mario Wilson from Tygerberg RFC in South Africa. Wilson is direct replacement for Enzo Foutie, who was ruled out for the rest of the season due to a knee injury. Wilson has turned out for Blue Bulls at the Under-19 and U21 levels. Foutie has been flown back to South Africa where he is scheduled to undergo surgery at the Stellenbosch Medical Clinic. He sustained a knee injury last month in a pre-season tie with Menengai Oilers then aggravated it a fortnight ago while playing in the Erick Shirley Shield (ESS) against Blak Blad. Head coach Henley Du plessis said they are delighted with the arrival of Wilson who links up with the two other South Africans in the squad including Johanes Claude and Logan Basson. “The South Africans have settled very well in Kakamega and they are really enjoying the place very well,” he added. The sugar millers lead the log with 20 points and are unbeaten so far from four outings. They face second-placed Impala in match pitting two of the remaining unbeaten sides this weekend at the Kakamega show ground. The South African tactician said it will be the toughest match they have played this season. “This will be arguably be our toughest match of the season so far. We know Impala are a good team and we have to be at our best if we are to register a fifth win of the season,” added Du Plessis. He said there is room for improvement in the side despite a 100 percent start to the season. “We are always looking to improve in every game and so far the players have responded well to the game plan and we hope to continue in the same vein on Saturday against Impala,” he added. The western-based side are chasing their second Kenya Cup crown, having won the league in 2016 by beating Impala 22-5 in the final. They have also played in the Kenya Cup final from 2015 to last season and made the Enterprise Cup final last year.
