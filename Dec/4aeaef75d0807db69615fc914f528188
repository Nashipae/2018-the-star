The battle for Kirinyaga governor’s seat is headed to the Supreme Court after former Gichugu MP Martha Karua lost an appeal against Governor Anne Waiguru’s win. Karua and Waiguru have been embroiled in a legal tussle since last year after the former disputed the governor’s victory in last year’s polls. Waiguru garnered 161,373 votes against Karua’s 122,091. Yesterday the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court’s verdict that dismissed Karua’s petition challenging the outcome of the polls. Karua was seeking nullification of Waiguru’s election on grounds that the August 8, 2017 poll was not free and fair. The former lawmaker said she was unfairly defeated, claiming that the election was marred by cases of voter bribery at polling stations and that her agents were barred from accessing the polling stations. Karua however later said that she will appeal the decision at the Supreme Court. Read: Karua heads to Supreme Court after Appeal judges dismiss petition against Waiguru Click here for
