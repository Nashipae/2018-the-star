Nairobi governor Mike Sonko has been named the Good Deeds Goodwill ambassador by Israel. The Israel delegation led by Good Deeds Global CEO Kaynan Rabino revealed this after paying  Sonko a courtesy call at City Hall. Rabino hailed the ongoing major beautification along Mombasa Road and also thanked the governor for his good support to various communities. He also added that Nairobi is a good city to invest in and do business. "We have been watching various videos on YouTube, you are a leader who should be emulated by many." "People should not take your generosity for granted because what you have done so far is very commendable," the governor said Sonko assured the delegation that they will work together in making April 7, 2019, Good Deeds Conference in Nairobi a success. The conference will be held at a hotel in Nairobi. "I' m very much pleased with your good support and I also thank God for all of these. Were it not for him, I could not be anywhere," he said. Sonko added that his administration is working round the clock to ensure that every Nairobian, especially those in slums, will not live in squalor. "My aim is to leave a legacy. Everyone must enjoy a good life," Sonko said. Among those who accompanied the team included SBI International Holdings chief sustainable officer Denis Repushinski.
