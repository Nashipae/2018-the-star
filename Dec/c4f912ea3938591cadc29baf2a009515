Secondary schools may not be able to carry out lab experiments after the ministry failed to factor in funds to buy equipment. The 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary school is also expected to deepen the population crisis in learning institutions, straining the available resources, among them science equipment. The Education ministry’s Medium Term Expenditure Framework 2019-20– 2021-22 shows Sh243 million meant for buying laboratory equipment was reallocated to clear pending bills of computers for public secondary schools for the 2016-17 financial year. The report shows the government agency tasked to procure and distribute science apparatus supplied 22,394 equipment to secondary school this year. Through the agency, school heads are required to buy equipment from tuition fee allocation of the Free Day Secondary Education funds. The government allocates about Sh4,000 for tuition fee. But due to constraints on the number of activities the tuition fee caters for, the funds are inadequate. Some schools say they do not have enough laboratories to carry out practical lessons for science subjects. Kenya Secondary Schools Heads Association chairman Indimuli Kahi said institutions with large numbers of students have an advantage of acquiring more equipment. This gives them an upper hand over other schools. Click here for the latest political news
