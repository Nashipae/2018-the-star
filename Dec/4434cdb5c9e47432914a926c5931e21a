At least 300 people have been displaced by flash floods in Nyando constituency, Kisumu. Heavy rain has pounded the area for the last three nights. The most affected areas are Kakola Ombaka in Ahero and Kabonyo /Kanyagwal. Kakola Ombaka chief Jacob Ongudi told the Star on Wednesday some flood victims have moved to relatives' houses. "Help us Mr President [Uhuru Kenyatta], please visit this area and see what we are going through," he said. Four villages Kaloo, Giko, Wangara and Kasumba /Kamahawa are the hardest hit, Ongudi said. Affected residents are moving to rescue centres. "We are helping them move to Nyamasa Primary School, Ombaka Catholic Church and River of Life Church," Ongudi said. Houses, schools and churches are submerged in water. Kakola Ombaka resident Jacob Ogola asked the county and national governments to come to their aid. "We have lost our belongings including animals. People are in urgent need of help," he said. Another resident Elizabeth Awour from Kabonyo/Kanyagwal made a similar appeal. She said people woke up in the night and found water surrounding their houses. Ahero MCA Ken Ooko told residents who have not been affected to move to higher ground. He also asked well-wishers to help the people in need. "Let people move to their relatives or to safer places until the floodwaters subside," he said. No one has been injured.
