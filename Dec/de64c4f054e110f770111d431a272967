Quack doctor Mugo wa Wairimu will remain behind bars until the conclusion of his case after a Nairobi court denied him bail. Mugo was charged with operating a clinic without a valid certificate among other counts. He denied the charges. He had asked the court to release him on bail pending the hearing of his application. In her ruling, Senior Principal Magistrate Martha Mutuku said there were strong competitive reasons for the accused not to be granted bail. "I find that stringent bind terms alone cannot guarantee or safeguard the integrity of the trial process neither cannot guarantee the process of the trial," Mutuku ruled. She further said that there are compelling reasons that warrant her to deny Mugo bail.
