SportPesa Premier League side Sony Sugar are eyeing a better campaign in the 2018/19 season. Coach Patrick Odhiambo is positive that his charges will not struggle like last season. Sony hosts Robert Matano’s Tusker FC at Awendo Green Stadium on Sunday in their opening game of the season. “We want to finish in a better position than last year. That is my target at the moment,” said the coach. Odhiambo hauled the cane millers from relegation zone to finish 9th in the league last season. Odhiambo said the former Kenya Premier League champions have signed six players and released seven. Among the new signings is former Gor Mahia winger Ronnie Omino, who is keen to resuscitate his career at Sony. Others are Robert Otema, Apollo Otieno, Patrick Ochieng, Kennedy Owino and goalkeeper John Njau from National Super League outfit, Nairobi Stima. “The new signings have adapted to my style and philosophy. They have also gelled well with the rest of the team and we are now looking forward to start our league campaign. We have had a very good pre season,” added Odhiambo. Those who were dropped are Sowedi Salim, John Omweri, Kevin Oliech, Fredrick Ochieng, Collins Neto, Bernard Otwoma and Castro Ombara.
