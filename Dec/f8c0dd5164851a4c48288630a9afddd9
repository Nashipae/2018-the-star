The long walks city residents endured on Monday when matatus were banned from entering the CBD was a “mock exercise” to find a solution to the traffic menace, Nairobi governor Mike Sonko said yesterday. Sonko suspended the ban on matatus from entering the CBD 20 hours after it took effect following transport chaos and gridlocks caused by the surge of PSVs at the designated dropping points outside the CBD. The governor said he is out to leave a legacy, not just politics. Sonko said the ban is inevitable even as a section of leaders oppose it. In what seems as hitting out to those opposed to the ban, Sonko urged politicians to stop bringing in politicising the matter. Speaking in Kasarani yesterday, he said plans to revamp the transport management and system in the city is underway. He said they are working to ensure the decision settled upon will not disadvantage the elderly, physically challenged and other disadvantaged persons. “The President and I are working together to ensure Nairobi’s lost glory is revived... I want to call on Sakaja to team up with the us and we work together,” Sonko said. The county finds BRT as the most reliable and quick way to decongest the city, he said.
