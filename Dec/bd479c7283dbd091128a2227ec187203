Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki today spent her Sunday at Kenyatta National Hospital with children from the cancer ward to mark the joy of Christmas. The CS said Christmas is a season to wish one another joy and love and peace, particularly with children suffering from cancer. "Spending time with children gives me joy," she said after sharing a Christmas cake with the children and having fun. Our focus is quality of care for cancer patients and reduction of cancer cases through early screening, she noted. The CS observed that health is a matter of life and death and everyone must do their best to give hope to the sick. She noted that the government is committed to investing more in cancer and non-communicable diseases. Sicily added that the State shall utilise resources optimally to support decentralisation of cancer treatment countrywide. "Every family is affected by cancer in one way or another and my passion is to equip health centers to support cancer screening," she said. The CS commended KNH for bearing the heaviest burden of cancer referrals from 47 counties and urged them to utilize resources better. "You have done well in terms of expansion and management of cancer services in Kenya and I am happy with your work," she argued. Currently, KNH is supporting oncology services in Nyeri and Eldoret counties and has also identified Kisii and Meru for further collaboration to handle cancer burden in the country. "Our goal is to ensure treatment is available to all Kenyans at an affordable rate," acting KNH chief executive officer Thomas Mutie said. Sicily wished the children a quick recovery and a Merry Christmas. Click here for the latest political news
