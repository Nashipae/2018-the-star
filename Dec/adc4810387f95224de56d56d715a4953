The Ministry of Labour yesterday urged the Kenya National Union of Teachers to call off the January 2 strike and pave way for negotiations. In a statement, Labour CS Ukur Yatani said the ministry has appointed a conciliation team to bridge the fallout between TSC and Knut after the latter asked its members to boycott work in January. The team will be led by Charles Maranga. Knut on Wednesday issued a 14-day ultimatum to the TSC after the announcement of the transfer of 3,000 head teachers. This will be the second time the Labour ministry is moving to resolve the dispute between the two after the collapse of talks in October last year.
