KRU Championship enters third round tomorrow with Silverstone Kisumu RFC hosting arch-rivals Western Bulls at Mamboleo ASK Showground. Bulls are unbeaten in the league so far after three matches and will be seeking to maintain their unbeaten run against their former coach Howard Okwemba who handles Kisumu. “The game will be a cracker. I expect a tough game against my former team. Bulls are a very good team but we need to recover from the loss against Kisii and win this one,” said coach Okwemba. Last weekend, Kisii whipped Kisumu 22-19 in an entertaining game at Gusii Stadium. Bulls are third on the log with 13 points with Kisumu fourth with three points adrift. United States International University-Africa and Catholic Monks will square it out in a top of the table clash at USIU grounds. Both teams remain unbeaten in the league. Monks lead the log with 13 points same as USIU but Monks have better points difference. Kisii, boosted by their win against Kisumu last weekend, travel to Eldoret to battle win-less University of Eldoret’s Trojans. Kisii coach Eric Bosire said: “We are heading to Eldoret for a win. We have worked on areas where we had weaknesses in the first three matches and I’m hoping the boys will come out with a win,” said Bosire. Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology welcome Kitale RFC at the ASK Kakamega Showground. Last weekend, MMUST coached Ochieng Ahaya, edged University of Eldoret 17-10 to record their first win of the season. Sixth placed Ngong Warriors RFC will entertain South Coast Pirates at the Kibiko Secondary in Kajiado County while Regional Logistics Mombasa RFC will take on Egerton Wasps at Egerton University in Njoro.
