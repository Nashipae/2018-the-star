The court in Makueni has found a former bodyguard to Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr guilty of unlawfully shooting Brian Mutua on September 23, 2014, during a scuffle at the Makueni county premises. Makueni Senior Principal Magistrate James Mwaniki said Shedrack Kioko Malekya could not justify the use of a firearm during the commotion. The evidence adduced before the court showed that Kioko shot Brian at a close rage injuring his stomach. He will be sentenced on February 7, 2019, based on a probation report. Three of his co-accused were lucky to walk scot free after the court found the use of their firearms on the material day justifiable. They are Ndunda Muthoka who at the time was bodyguard to the then Makueni County Assembly Speaker Stephen Ngelu, Francis Daido the then bodyguard to the former Assembly Majority Leader Francis Mutuku and Nicholas Musyoka the then bodyguard to the former Kati MP Richard Makenga. The court ruled that it could not link the three bodyguards to the gunshot wounds sustained by the various victims who included the current assembly Speaker Douglas Mbilu.
