Newly appointed Kenya Commercial Bank women’s volleyball team coach Japheth Munala conducted his first training session with the team at the Ruaraka Sports Club yesterday. The team has also moved training base from Railways Club to Ruaraka. Munala, who decamped to the bankers from the former Kenya Volleyball Federation league champions Kenya Pipeline recently, said the current short training stint was for the sake of gelling. The team, will however, break training this Friday before they resuming on January 2. Munala said it was only fair that the six players who switched from Pipeline to KCB have a feel of what is like to play for the bankers ahead of the next year’s KVF league and the Africa Club Championship to be held in Egypt. The seven are Noel Murambi, Leonida Kasaya, Violet Makuto, Veronica Kilabat, Christine Njambi, Truphosa Chepkemei and Jemima Siangu. “As you know, KCB had other players before the new ones arrived from Pipeline. These two teams have a different way of handling things and so we have decided to hold a five-day training for the players to gel and just to know what is expected of them,” said Munala, who is also the women’s national team coach. He added: “It’s Day One of the training and really there is little I can comment on the players performance but at least their body conditioning is good. I believe with that we will be able to start from somewhere on January 2.” He continued: “It’s not up to me to decide which players will be leaving the club next year. The buck stops with the management and therefore we will have to wait and see who will be dropped. For now all the players are attending the training.” In their earlier communication, KCB said they will at least release eight players next year. Asked about the feeling at the new club, Munala said: “They have welcomed me well and given me the support at this early stage. We can only get better going forward.”
