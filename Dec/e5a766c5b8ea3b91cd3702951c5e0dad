The High Court has ruled that the state violated lawyer Miguna Miguna's rights by deporting him to Canada. Justice Chacha Mwita on Friday ordered that Miguna is paid Sh7 million for his continued violation since he is still in Canada. Mwita further ruled that actions by Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and the other state officials amounted to an abuse of office. The judge said that "taxpayers should not shoulder costs of violations by overzealous state officers." In order to deter future violations, the court ruled, Matiangi and Immigration Principal Secretary Gordon Kihalangwa should personally pay the damages and costs. The court also ordered the state to return Miguna's passport since it was unlawfully confiscated. Miguna has also been awarded a further Sh207,000 in damages to his house. Mwita said the damages issued to Miguna will act as a deterrent to similar violations of the law. Click here for the latest political news
