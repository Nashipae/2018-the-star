Last season’s SportPesa Premier League runners up Bandari proved that their resurgence in the recent days has not been by fluke as they stunned former champions Sofapaka 2-1 to maintain their perfect start in the league. The dockers opened the new season with a 2-1 win over reigning champions Gor Mahia and served Sofapaka yesterday with a similar dose at Machakos Stadium to draw six points from clubs billed as potential candidates to claim this season’s silverware. Veteran forward Kepha Aswani fired Sofapaka to an early lead just seconds into the match as a long ball from Dennis Odhiambo landed at Cliff Kasuti’s path, who teed up Aswani to break the deadlock. The goal proved the difference between the two sides till halftime but after resumption, the dockers pulled one back through Congolese national, Yema Mwana, who tapped in Fred Nkata’s cross in the 60th minute. Second half substitute Wycliffe Ochomo sealed the three points for Bandari in the 75th minute, finishing off a counter-attack move past Sofapaka custodian Richard Aimo. Elsewhere, Posta Rangers avenged their first match loss to Western Stima as they beat Mt Kenya United 2-1 at Afraha Stadium. Ken Mutembei was on target for the mailmen in the 22nd minute before Francis Nambute doubled the lead eight minutes after the break. Former Mathare United and AFC Leopards winger Samuel Ndung’u pulled one for Mt Kenya, a goal which proved to be just a consolation at the final whistle. Mt Kenya opened the new season with a similar loss to Sofapaka. At Moi Stadium Kisumu, returnees Western Stima will have Henry Onyango to thank as his 80th minute goal was enough to down a visiting Tusker side. Stima under the tutelage of Paul Ogai had electrocuted Posta Rangers in their opening match while Tusker played Sony Sugar to a one-all draw.
