Nyamira Jubilee Youth leaders have said they will support interior CS Dr Fred Matiang’i to run for gubernatorial race in 2022 as he is the person who will save Nyamira. Led by Brian Mamboleo, the youths said the county needs to be liberated from the jaws of corruption surrounding it among other issues of development and the only person who can be able to do that is Matiang’i. “We have witnessed unequipped health facilities, unmaintained market centers, a 12 hour economy, poor policies put in place regarding response to emergencies, unexplainable early childhood programmes, water scarcity, fishy youth empowerment projects and poor revenue collection methods marred with high corruption,” said Mamboleo. He said the rot in Nyamira must be cleaned once and for all to enable the county government under Governor John Nyagarama to move forward and address serious issues affecting the devolved unit. “In order for Nyamira to move a step higher like other counties, and lay a better economic platform for investors it can be achieved by installing CS Matiang’i as the CEO since he has a capacity to make tough decisions and stands resolutely for what he stands for,” he noted. The youths said they believe Matiang’i will provide leadership that links the county government to the national government and also international bodies in seeking necessary opportunities to flourish the economy of the county. “As the youth we believe that we have a bigger share in the appointments to senior positions according to our inputs, unlike the selective recycling and shifting of the old involvement of the youths in governance will ignite change, bring up new ideas and drive real progress on a whole range of county building,” they said. They said the county needs someone like Matiang’i to emulate from his performance from digital migration, curbing of examination malpractices, intensified war against gambling across the country among other roles he has played to ensure our country is safe. “We pray that when the right time comes, the CS presents his name and we will support him and ensure we have a county to mention like other counties,” the youths noted.
