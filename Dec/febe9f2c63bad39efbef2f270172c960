The anti-graft agency has dismissed claims it has failed to timely investigate New KCC boss Nixon Sigey and two others over alleged financial mismanagement. In an affidavit, Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission officer Ferdinand Kiwanuka says the commission cannot be controlled or directed by any person or authority when implementing its mandate. “The investigations are at an advanced stage. It’s in the interest of justice and good order that they are allowed to proceed to their legal conclusion,” he says. Peter Ombati petitioned the court to have Sigey, Magdalene Muthoka and Samuel Ichura removed from office on allegations of financial mismanagement. He also wants the court to set time within which the commission should complete its probe on their conduct. But Kiwanuka says the assertion that they have failed to conduct timely investigations is baseless and lacking in facts. He says the complainant has not enquired on their progress. According to court documents, Sigey and Muthoka colluded and, without following due process, authorised the transfer of about 475 million employees’ contributions from Liberty Life Assurance Company to Britam Life. Ombati said the three are in office and could interfere with crucial implicating evidence. He said the transfer of the colossal amount and the manner in which it was carried out in closed doors without obtaining members’ consent was tainted with corrupt considerations. He said he received numerous complaints from whistle blowers and New KCC employees about allegations of abuse of office, employment malpractices, and other corrupt practices perpetuated by Sigey. “The complaints were made known to the anti-graft agency way back in 2015 and to date, there’s nothing concrete to show the progress of the investigations. It’s imperative this court provides a time frame for probe,” Ombati said. The case will now be heard on January 17. Click here for the latest political news
