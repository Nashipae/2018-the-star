The former chairman online betting firm BetVictor, is looking to set up a betting firm in the country, joining Kenya’s lucrative betting and gaming market. The 67-year-old British bookmaker, Victor Chandler who sold BetVictor in 2014, aims to take advantage of Kenya’s high growth of smartphone, internet use and mobile payment systems. Chandler has already collaborated with UK-based betting firm FSB Tech to launch an East African sports betting venture know as BetLion currently with a presence in Uganda. The new sportsbook is expected to launch in Kenya and Tanzania in a growing market where FSB Tech already has two brands operating which are BetYetu in Kenya and MkekaBet in Tanzania. Spencer Okach, a marketing expert who has helped several betting firms in Kenya launch their business is said to be putting final touches on BetLion operations in the country. “Yes, I played a big part in its successful launch in Uganda and the business is going from strength to strength. As for Kenya, this is a big market and obviously it is on BetLion’s radar,” Okach said. The firm will be battling it out for market share in Kenya’s already flooded market with more than 36 registered online betting firms currently operating locally.
