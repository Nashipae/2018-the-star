King Kaka is happy for the moves he is making in the industry after his hit song Dundaing was on Wednesday played in the US at the NBA game between Dallas Mavericks and Portland Trail Blazers. "It shows that everything is possible and artistes don't have to change their sound to fit in the world's playlist catalogue," Kaka told Word Is yesterday. "I kept it real when writing the song, and so it is a big win to me. This music is global and I did not have to change my style to fit in that American audience. The song 'Dundaing' is doing good and the fact that it was played in US at the NBA means a plus to Kenyan music industry." In a video shared on social media, his song, which features Kristoff and Magix Enga, is heard playing in the background during a timeout. Kaka posted it on social media, captioning the video: “Another Win!!! And We Are NBA. We Are Dundaing!!!!! MARVS VS POR. Big Up @poizonivythedj.” Kaka is also the first and only Kenyan artiste to be interviewed on Hot 97, one of the biggest radio stations in the US. The song was uploaded on YouTube a month ago and has over 900,000 views.
