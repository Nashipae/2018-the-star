One of the suspects linked to the loss of Sh110 million at the National Cereal and Produce Board silos in Kisumu and Eldoret will have to remain at Kodiaga Prison after failing to raise bond. Senior Resident Magistrate Winfred Onkunya said she does not have jurisdiction to vary the bond terms. Willy Kipkoech (agricultural officer, Kisumu) was charged along 10 others, who were were released on a bond of Sh5 million each. However, Sang who has been at the prison but his lawyer yesterday requested flenient bond erms. Lawyer John Were said his client, who is a civil servant, was unable to raise the bond and applied that it should be reduced so that his family can raise it to secure his release. However, the prosecution led by Makaya Nyakundi objected to this saying the bond given by the court was reasonable. The accused lawyer, however, stated that the bond is not reasonable to anyone because people have different means. “My client cannot afford this that’s why he is still in custody hence requesting that the bond terms be released,” he said. The Magistrate stated that her hands are tied and can only take mention date for the lawyers to argue the matter before Julius NgarNgar. “I have no jurisdiction to handle anti corruption matters. My hands are tied on that matter,” said, and picked January 10, 2019, as mention date for the matter. One of the suspects, Caroline Chepchumba, who did not take a plea after her lawyer said she was sick and was receiving treatment in a hospital in Nairobi, will also appear on the same date to take a plea. The two were charged along nine others. The case for all the 11 suspects will be mentioned in February 12, 2019, for further direction. Click here for the latest political news
