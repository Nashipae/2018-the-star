Former Recapp member Emmanuel Mwongela, alias Manolo, says they agreed to split in good terms. "Recapp is something we started in high school and when it became serious, I was like, let's give ourselves a timeline because music can look like a hole where you throw money, it needs many projects. We gave ourselves five years and because the industry is not an easy place, we kept pushing," he told Word Is last week. "After the period, we met again and gave ourselves the sixth year, which was 2017. So went all out and at the end of the year, it still didn't make financial sense. In 2018 we all decided to venture into solo careers and see how that goes." Adding: "We are still friends and supporting each other, and we are still walking in Christ."
