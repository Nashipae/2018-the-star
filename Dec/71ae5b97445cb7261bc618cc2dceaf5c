Telkom Kenya’s perfect run at the Africa Cup for Club Championships continued yesterday as they claimed a hard fought 1-0 victory against a well motivated Kada Queens. The result was enough for the Kenyan champions to secure a place in Saturday’s final. The Kenyan side headed into the match full of confidence following three consecutive wins at the tournament—a feat no other women’s team has managed so far. The Queens on the other hand were not expected to even earn a point from the match having picked up only two points from three games. In the first half, the defensively disciplined Kada Queens who were playing in front of their home crowd kept their momentum throughout the half to keep the attacking force of Telkom in check. The teams went into the break deadlocked at 0-0 but in the second half, the visitors showed why they are nine-time African champions as barely two minutes into the fourth quarter Audrey Omaido went past the Queen’s defenders to slot the ball past goalkeeper Emmanuel Nengi, a goal which resulted in a moment of silence from the entire stadium. Despite the win, coach Jos Openda insisted that he was not amused by their opponents defensive approach to the game. “I have never seen a team that plays defensively even when they have the ball. This restricted our players movement but we’re happy to collect maximum three points as we head off to the last match on Thursday (today), ” said Openda. The Kenyan champions will face their bitter rivals Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) in their final round-robin match as they seek to avenge their 1-0 loss inflicted by the tax collectors in the last championship. “The match is more important to them as at the moment, they are struggling in the tournament. However, we will head into the game with the same composure and seriousness witnessed so far in a bid to finish the round robin matches unbeaten,” insisted Openda.
