Limuru urbanites have urged the government to rein in criminals ruining the constituency. Led by MP Peter Mwathi, the residents have petitioned Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to ensure the police step up security. They raised concerns that they are being mugged and robbed at gunpoint in the evenings and at night. On December 24, security guard Beth Chebet was murdered near Limuru Milk Processor. On December 15, veterinarian Kimani Njeng’ere was shot dead by thugs and robbed of his cash as he arrived at his home gate at 8pm. On December 10, Kinoo Catholic parish priest Joseph Njoroge was shot dead. Njoroge was to deposit church offerings in a bank account in Kikuyu town where four thugs on motorcycles waylaid him. Businessman Macharia Waweru urged the government to investigate the murders. Mwathi said the situation must be contained. “We don’t need press conferences about how tight security is in this area while our people are calling each day claiming they have been mugged and robbed,” he said. “We want to see action.”
