A global pro-bono law firm is setting up a resource centre to help Mandera residents fight human rights abuse. Public International Law and Policy Group, which is based in Washington, US, will launch the resource center in January 2019 to help build capacity among area residents. Branch chairman Noor Abdow yesterday told a stakeholders forum in Mandera town that the centre will be run by three paralegals and assistants to enlighten the public on continued human rights abuse, mostly by security agents. There have been many cases of extrajudicial killings in the region involving innocent people. In their fight against terrorism, Kenyan security forces are accused of being behind disappearance of innocent people. PILPG resolved to have two students from Strathmore Law School engaged at the resource centre. They will enlighten the public on human rights abuse. It is expected that people from marginalised communities will be able to access the legal system. This will help them in holding the culprits of extrajudicial killings to account. Over the past 20 years PILPG has operated offices in 25 countries.
