Police in Mombasa have shot dead two suspected criminals who were on a robbery mission along Moi Avenue. Cops on patrol ambushed four men as they attempted to break into a shop at Express area on Saturday, Mombasa police boss Johnstone Ipara said. Two were gunned down and an AK47 gun recovered. The gun was found hidden in a bag that also had a blood-stained hammer, a rope and a cap. Other items recovered from suspects include three mobile phones and four sacks. Police believe the hammer was used to commit crime in Kisauni and Likoni. They have launched a manhunt for the other suspects who fled. "Individuals who engage in criminal activities must know that their days are numbered," Ipara warned. The bodies were taken to Coast General Hospital mortuary.
