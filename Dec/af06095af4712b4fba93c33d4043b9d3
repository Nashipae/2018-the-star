The Technical University of Mombasa has been asked to take advantage of the Coast General Hospital to establish a school of medicine. Mombasa governor Hassan Joho on Wednesday said the county is ready to support the university in offering quality education. TUM, which was awarded a charter in 2013, is expected to start enrolling medicine students from next year. Vice chancellor Laila Abubakar said the school of medicine at the institution’s main campus in Tudor was 90 per cent complete. “We are hopeful we shall enrol the first batch of medicine students by September next year,” she said. Abubakar urged parents to take advantage of the opportunity to enrol their children. The two leaders spoke during the institution’s sixth graduation ceremony. Joho was the guest of honour. “We are aware of the new medicine programme you want to introduce. I want to urge you to take over the Coast General Hospital and transform it into a university hospital,” Joho said. The governor said he was hopeful the university will produce doctors, nurses and clinical officers during its 12th graduation ceremony. “I think it takes about six years to graduate as a doctor. We’re going to celebrate doctors and clinical officers from the Technical University of Mombasa by 2024,” Joho said. Some 2,120 students graduated on Wednesday. TUM was started 67 years ago as the Mombasa Institute of Muslim Education. The university has a school of business, faculty of engineering, faculty of applied sciences, institute of computing and informatics and school of humanities and social sciences. TUM has partnered with universities in Belgium and Egypt and the Coast General Hospital to establish the school of medicine. Abubakar said they have expanded the Kwale campus and are putting up a Sh200 million hostel for 436 students who are on sponsored by the government. They are also putting up a police post to enhance security.
