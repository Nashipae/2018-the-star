The year 2019 is going to be really an eventful year. It will be eventful to the extent that it will be a carry-over of the political activities from 2018. As to whether it will be decisive on matters political, to the extent that it will affect the 2022 elections, especially the presidential contest â€” that would be a very early call to make at this time, and probably inaccurate.

He has expressly indicated several times personally and through his allies that he is going to run for president. It is also going to be the year where various actors and players will be keen to see whether Raila Odinga will be making moves as to whether he will be contesting the presidency yet again, or potentially contesting. Raila will not declare very early right now that he is contesting. An announcement may come very late, maybe in 2021, that he will compete. Another question would be whether the former Prime Minister decides to become kingmaker and groom another leader to take the baton from him.
