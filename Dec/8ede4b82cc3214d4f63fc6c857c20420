Residents of Mai Mahiu have demanded compensation for property destroyed by flash floods that swept through their homes and farms along the SGR line. They say officials of the China Communications Construction Company diverted water from one of the culverts to their homes. The company has launched investigations into the claims. The residents said they lost property worth thousands of shillings. The area has received heavy rains in the last week. CCCC spokesman Steve Zhao said they were taking the allegations as serious and the company would act expeditiously. "We immediately dispatched a team of engineers to the scene on learning that one of the culverts in Mai Mahiu had allegedly directed storm water to homes," Zhao said. He denied claims that a section of the railway line had been washed away, saying only loose soil had been eroded due to the rains. “We have also invited China Railway Development Company and other stakeholders to go to the ground, investigate and recommend action to be taken,” he said. Zakayo Mutua said his house was destroyed by the floods. He blamed the designers of the SGR for the disaster. “We have never experienced anything of this kind in the past. We want compensation from the contractor because we have lost many things including livestock,” Mutua said. Click here for the latest political news
