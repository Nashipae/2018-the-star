A pedestrian was fatally hit by a bus on Thursday night at Flyover trading centre on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. Some of the 70 passengers on the bus were injured as the driver veered off the road as he tried to avoid the pedestrian. They were taken to Kijabe Mission Hospital. The bus was heading to Nairobi from Kakamega. Witness John Kimani said the pedestrian crossed the road without looking out for vehicles. “The deceased, who is not known in this area, rushed from one side of the road to the other without checking and he was hit by the bus and died on the spot,” he said. Njabini OCPD Jane Munywoki said most of the injured passengers were treated and discharged. The accident caused heavy traffic, with many motorists seeking alternative routes before police cleared the scene. Click here for the latest political news
