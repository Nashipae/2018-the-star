A total of 260 Early Childhood Education teachers will be hired in Garissa county in April next year. The recruitment will start after teacher trainees graduate in April, Deputy Governor Abdi Dagane  said yesterday at Garissa County ECD Training Centre, which is under construction. Dagane urged Form 4 leavers to join the colleges in Garissa and Dadaab and promised that the county would pay their fees. The centre consists of classrooms and an administration block. It  is 75 per cent complete. “This is one of the various flagship projects and initiative we have undertaken to establish all the necessary institutions, infrastructure and policy frameworks of all the devolved units,” the deputy governor disclosed that  the county administration was reaching out to development partners and organisations on the improvement of the quality of diploma and certificate courses offered. He said the county administration built 10 ECD centres this year and  that more will be added next year to address a shortfall of 470 ECD teachers. Next year’s  hiring of 260 such teachers is intended to close the gap. Separately, Garissa Kenya National Union of Teachers executive Abdirizak Hussein praised the county administration for the hiring of more teachers as a move that was long overdue. Hussein, who was speaking on phone,  said many schools in rural areas were still faced with acute shortage of ECD teachers and basic infrastructure.
