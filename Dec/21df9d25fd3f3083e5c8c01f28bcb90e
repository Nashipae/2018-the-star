Telkom Kenya need to beat Nigeria’s Kada Queens today to securing a place in the Saturday’s final of the ongoing Africa Cup for Club Championship at the Abuja National Stadium, Nigeria. The nine-time continental champions have been impressive so far, winning their opening three matches to sit top of the women’s standings with nine points. Ever since Jos Openda’s side laboured to a 2-1 win against Ghana Police in their first match of the tournament, the team has been able to score 8 goals in total against their last two opponents including compatriots United States International University-Africa ‘A’ Spartans and home side Delta Queens. The Kenyan champions will be feeling confident heading into the match as their opponents, Kada Queens are yet to register a win let alone score a goal at the annual tournament. The Nigerian side has so far played out to two barren draws against defending champions Ghana Revenue Authority, compatriots Delta Queens and lost 2-0 to Ghana Police. If Telkom get to reach the final, they will be eager not falter again at the final hurdle as they did at the last tournament when GRA beat them 1-0 in Accra, Ghana. A 10th title win will officially cement the team as the Queens of Africa and will surely motivate them ahead of next year’s Africa Olympic Games qualifiers, as the country seeks to field strong teams in both men and women’s competition. Meanwhile, Kenya’s debutants USIU Spartans are still in search of their first victory at the championships. After three games, the students are rooted at the bottom of the standings with only a point, having gone 1-0 down against GRA, lost 4-0 against compatriots Telkom and drawing 1-1 against hosts Delta Queens. They face an even tougher test against Ghana Police today who have four points having won their last game 2-0 against Kada Queens, drawn 0-0 against GRA and lost to Telkom.
