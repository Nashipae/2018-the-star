Menengai Oilers forward Eric Ombasa is a doubt for the Hamilton and Sydney legs next month. Ombasa sustained a shoulder injury in Dubai and did not play in the Cape Town leg over the weekend. Team manager Eric Ogweno said they will have to assess Ombasa’s injury and with the short turn around time, he faces race to be fit for the trip down under. Ogweno said Ombasa impressed in Dubai and the injury will be a big blow for him. “He was one of the players who came off the bench and provided a spark to the team in Dubai. He was a solid ball carrier and was also good on attack and defence,” added Ogweno. The team arrived on Monday night from Cape Town and will have a 10 day rest period before resuming training next week, ahead of the Christmas and New year festivities. Skipper Eden Agero said they have learnt their lessons from the two opening legs, where the side performed poorly, garnering four points to sit in 14th place on the log. “Cape Town was a bit better. We are able to win two matches against Wales and Zimbabwe and it gives us confidence, going forward into the next two tournaments,” he noted. Agero said the side have to improve in all facets of play if they are to amass more points in the forthcoming tournaments. “Our defence must get better and our strength and conditioning must be sorted out if we are to match the teams we are facing,” noted Agero. Agero, however, praised Johnstone Olindi who was Shujaa’s best performing player over the two legs with seven tries and four conversions alongside KCB rookie Vincent Onyala and Mwamba’s Sammy Taabu. “I believe we have a great future in Sevens rugby. The young players really played well and with the right support and growth, they can go far,” noted Agero.
