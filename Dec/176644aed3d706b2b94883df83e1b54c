Police have stepped up security as President Uhuru Kenyatta prepares to lead Kenyans in ushering the New Year at State House in Mombasa. County commissioner Evans Achoki told the Star on Monday they have received numerous applications for fireworks. He said successful applicants will only be allowed five minutes and must adhere to strict specifications. "After 12.05am, no more firework displays. Thereafter, any fireworks will be considered illegal," warned Achoki. Revellers, political and religious leaders have made elaborate arrangements to usher in 2019 in style. President Uhuru will address the nation from State House, in a tradition observed by his successors. Founding President Jomo Kenyatta addressed the nation in Nairobi and Gatundu. Retired President Daniel arap Moi preferred Nakuru State Lodge while former President Mwai Kibaki chose Nairobi and Mombasa. Mombasa governor Hassan Joho has invited residents to Mama Ngina Drive. Achoki said special security teams have been formed to ensure all goes to plan. There will be sniffer dogs, uninformed and civilian-clothed police in entertainment joints and social gatherings to ensure safety. "All is set for the festivities. We will be everywhere to ensure security," Achoki told journalists in his office. "Anybody who tries any monkey business will be dealt with ruthlessly. We will be rough on you." Achoki banned boda bodas from operating after 8pm. Click here for the latest political news
