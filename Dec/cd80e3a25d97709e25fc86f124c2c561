A couple was on Saturday found dead in their home on the Shauri Yako estate in Homa Bay town. The bodies of Ben Mancha, 43, and Phoebe Kamire, 38, were found by a neighbour who went to visit them. The bodies were on separate beds in their bedroom. Mancha had foamed at the mouth. Landlord Joseph Onyigo, who lives within the compound, said he the deaths were mysterious. “They occasionally had inhouse differences, but we don’t think that has to do with their death,” he said. Mancha worked at a hardware shop within the town and Kamire was a housewife. Onyigo called for investigations. “Neighours last saw them at midday on Friday. A neighbour got shocked to find the two had died in their bedroom,” he said. The couple had a six-year-old daughter. The daughter had a sleepover at a neighbour's house. Arujo assistant chief Jackton Olielo said the matter was reported to the police. The bodies were taken to the Homa Bay County Referral Hospital mortuary. Click here for the latest political news
