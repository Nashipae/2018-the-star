A section of MPs from Western have lashed out at the Deputy President William Ruto over his stand on the proposed referendum. They are Senator Cleophas Malala, Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi, and Busia Woman Representative Florence Mutua. Speaking to the press in Kakamega town, the lot asked the deputy president to name the people seeking to create positions through the proposed referendum. "Why is the DP insisting Kenyans do not want a referendum yet there is even no question to debate?" Florence Mutua asked. "Let them not tell us about faceless people. Be man enough to mention names of those seeking new positions," she added. "Give the Building Bridges team time to make its recommendations. If they recommend a referendum we will be a strong "yes" team," she said. Ruto was quoted at the weekend as having dismissed the call for the plebiscite as a drive to "create positions for a few people in Nairobi." Speaking at the home coming ceremony of Sirisia MP John Welukhe, the deputy President dismissed the call as aimed at undermining the local leadership by merging the counties and county assembly wards. He also led MPs and other leaders allied to him in characterising the referendum push as a drive to create positions "for a person who should be proceeding to retirement in peace."

"He must make his mind whether to support or oppose the referendum. He can't continue changing his tune depending on where he visits," Malala added.
