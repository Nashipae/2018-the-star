Public officials have been asked to involve communities in decision making to reduce protests and conflicts. Erick Otieno, the executive coordinator of Kamkunji Paralegal Trust (Kaplet), a CBO, said public participation is lacking in most decisions about projects. This, he said, has on many occasions led to conflicts and protests from the communities that feel left behind in matters that affect them.He spoke in Masalani subcounty, Garissa during a community dialogue and public participation exercise organised by the department of Trade in conjunction with Kaplet. Otieno said that the citizens are more enlightened and know what they want. “We are appealing to county government leaders and other elected leaders to work closely with the community. Gone are the days when those who were holding leadership positions used to make decisions without consulting,” he said. Erick cited corruption as the biggest disease ailing counties adding that corrupt leaders don’t want to be engaged directly with the people who elected them for fear of being questioned on how they have used the resources on projects. County CEC for trade and tourism Adow Jubat said that Kenyans have a right to be told what the government is doing for them be it at national or at county level. He said his department would continue engaging the business community so as to understand the issues they want addressed and how best to address them. He further said that his department will strive to create an enabling environment for them to do business. He however asked the traders to cooperate with the county by paying taxes saying the county will only be able to give quality services if they pay their dues. Garissa is one of the county governments that have experienced protests from the public over a sewer project that they say is blocking waterways leading to floods. Other counties at crossroads with state projects include Kwale.
