Wheat and maize farmers in Narok have threatened to abandon their crops from next season for what they termed “mistreatment” from the government and low prices. Cereal Growers Association Narok branch secretary Lekina Kameto said if the state fails to increase the prices of the crops, they will shift to livestock farming which is more lucrative. He said the region harvested a lot of maize and wheat but the produce is rotting in stores due to lower prices. Kameto spoke to reporters at Ololulung’a trading centre in Narok South subcounty on Saturday. “The government should consider increasing the prices because the cost of production is high and growers are not making profit. We are selling a 90kg bag of maize at Sh2,000 per while that of wheat is Sh2,300,” he said. Kameto said they want Sh3,600 per bag for both maize and wheat if they are to continue planting crops. He said the high cost of farm input has forced many farmers to reduce acreage. Kameto said farmers have been selling maize at throwaway prices to millers for fear that if they deliver to the National Cereals and Produce Board, their payment will be delayed. The NCPB still owes farmers Sh2.1 billion for maize delivered.
