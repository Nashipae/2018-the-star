Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet yesterday directed his officers to intensify the crackdown of illicit brews and traffic chaos. He warned that those flouting the ‘Michuki rules’ must be punished. MPs Chris Wamalwa (Kimini) and Caleb Amisi (Saboti) had urged the police to go slow on illicit brews during circumcision ceremonies by the Bukusu and Sabaot. “The Constitution acknowledges the presence of diverse cultures. It’s, therefore, sensible that observing cultural practices is not limited by law,” Wamalwa said. They said boda boda riders have borne the brunt of the enforcement and their businesses are on the line. But Boinnet said the law cannot be violated to favour individuals or communities. “We have no apologies to make when it comes to enforcement of the law. Even MPs Wamalwa and Amisi know we have to enforce the laws they pass,” he said during the burial of Robson Ndiema in Kinyoro, Saboti North. The two MPs attended. Ndiema was a police commissioner.
