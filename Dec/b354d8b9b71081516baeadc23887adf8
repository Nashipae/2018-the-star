Mandera senator Mohamed Mohamud has praised the newfound unity between the Executive and the legislature. The two arms of government had for several months been entangled in constant disagreement and fights after the general election. Discord spread to the assembly as MCAs split between Jubilee and the Economic Freedom Party. The EFP has the majority of members. A few months after the election, the MCAs walked out on Mohamud, a Jubilee Party member, when addressed the House. They later rejected Governor Ali Roba’s nominees for the executive committee but he stood his ground, promising to present the same list in the House. The two arms have since held meetings and ironed out issues. Addressing the press in Mandera on Friday, Mohamud said “the spirit of the handshake” has been demonstrated by both the assembly and the Executive by working together to ensure harmony. “The experiences of the last general election were unique. The outcome was no doubt an expression of the sovereign will of each voter. It is time now to work for the electorate,” the senator said.
