Inspector general Joseph Boinnet has vowed to take stern action against officers who assigned over eight police vehicles to self-proclaimed prophet David Owuor. Owuor made a grand entry on Friday escorted by a convoy of more than 40 sleek cars and two police motorcycle riders with sirens. Boinett in a statement on Saturday said that though the law allows hire of police motorcade, his case was extreme. "The law allows hire of police but not of the scale depicted in the video. Action is being taken and misuse of public resources is not permitted," he said. Owuor's motorcade caused a massive gridlock along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway with transport being paralysed for hours. Some of the streets within the town were also blocked to give way for his entry. This is not the first time Owuor has been escorted by a heavy security detail. On July 8, he was receivedÂ  by thousands of his followers at a grand reception at Uhuru Park for a crusade. The leader of the Repentance and Holiness ministry is in Nakuru for a three day healing service at Menengai grounds conference. Click here for the latest political news
