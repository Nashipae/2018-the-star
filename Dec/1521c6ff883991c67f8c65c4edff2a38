Controversial Blogger Cyprian Nyakundi has been ordered to bring down all articles published on his sites about former parliamentary aspirant Steve Mbogo and his wife. In his ruling, Justice Jacky Kamau further issued an injunction further barring Nyakundi from publishing any other defamatory words or articles against Mbogo and his wife. “Remove the articles published in the website twitter account and Facebook on November 28 2018” the order reads in part. Mbogo moved to court early this month in a bid to stop the blogger from publishing defamatory articles about his marriage. Even though Nyakundi was served with the petition, he had not filed any responses to it by the time the orders were issued. The flamboyant businessman wants Nyakundi to pay him Sh 20 Million as damages for the defamatory stories. In a defamation suit filed at the Milimani law courts, Mbogo further wants the blogger to be barred from further publishing any news concerning him and his family. “The defendant published and caused to be written and published a series of defamatory words against the plaintiffs on several dates commencing on November 28,” the petition reads.
