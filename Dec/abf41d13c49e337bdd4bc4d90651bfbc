Nigerian music star Swazzi says working with Davido is one of the greatest achievements he has had. "Davido listened to one of my songs and requested to work with me. It was a great experience," he told Word Is. "Music is something I have always wanted to do in life." Although his parents wanted him to finish schooling first, the number one African Boy still followed his dreams of becoming an artiste. Swazzi is looking forward to working with Kenyan artistes like Sauti Sol, Khaligraph and Nyashinski. "I want my music to be timeless and everyone will remember me for that," he said. He is promoting his new jam, Salome, inspired by African women. "As an artiste, it is my duty to portray the real African picture with my music, so that my audience will fit in. The song is a way to appreciate African women with their beauty," he said. And what legacy does he want to be remembered for? "Music is a way of passing strong messages. I like even when I'm gone, my music is listened to by the young people because of the message. I want to be remembered for the impact I've made," he said. "To all emerging artistes, one thing you should achieve is education. It is very important. Know what you want and go for it."
