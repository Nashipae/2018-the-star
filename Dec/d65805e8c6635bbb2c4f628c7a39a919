Lamu has achieved a major milestone in its healthcare programme after it successfully conducted its first-ever dialysis treatment and CT scans on five renal patients from the Coast. The treatment took place at the recently launched Dialysis and CT scan centre at the Lamu King Fahad Hospital. The equipment procured by the national government was officially commissioned two weeks ago by Health CS Sicily Kariuki. Speaking to the Star yesterday, county Health services director David Mulewa said the patients are responding well to treatment. The dialysis and CT scan treatment will ease the burden on patients in the area as they previously had to travel as far as Mombasa and Nairobi to be attended. This has proven to be a costly and strenuous affair for the patients and their families. Mulewa said the hospital is now able to effectively deal with all dialysis patients at the facility without having to refer a case outside the county. He said the centre receives at least five renal patients a day, some of whom are treated and allowed to leave while the most serious ones are admitted at the facility. He said the fully furnished renal and CT scan centre was a big milestone in the provision of healthcare.
