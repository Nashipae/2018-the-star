President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday told off MPs planning to increase their already hefty perks. The president said he will not sign a bill into law that allows MPs to draw huge salaries at the expense of taxpayers. “Our people are yearning for more development that benefits them directly and solutions that will help them progress,” Uhuru said. The President was speaking during his tour of Kiambu county where he launched a number of development projects. “We must stop politicking everyday and come together as leaders to build our nation and to ensure we deliver to our people whom we promised them they elected us,” he said. Uhuru told leaders to stop pushing for selfish interests and instead prioritise the needs of the voters. “Every leader has a responsibility to uplift the lives of the millions of Kenyans who look up to us as their leaders,” he said. The President endorsed his handshake with opposition leader Raila Odinga on March 9 that ended political hostility. He said it has brought peace in the country. “God never brought us 42 tribes here to fight. He brought us together to live in peace, happiness, and harmony,” he said. The Parliamentary Service Bill, 2018, passed through the Second Reading last week. MPs are expected to take the vote on Thursday and all indications are that they will pass it overwhelmingly. The lawmakers have accused the media of misleading the public, President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga, on the worthiness of their resolve. The bill will see all the 349 MPs enjoy rent-free housing, a government vehicle, an expanded medical cover among other benefits.
