I drove towards the forest near the KWS workshops section. I noticed many birds ahead of me, drinking from a small puddle in the road. When nearing the puddle, I turned my vehicle at a slight angle to allow for an unobstructed view of the puddle and also not to block the road for any passing vehicles. Not long after I stopped, a number of drivers stopped next to me and asked what I was looking at. They seemed to be somewhat disappointed that I was just watching birds. Interestingly the shape of the puddle looked almost like a miniature map of Africa. I noticed that the longer the intervals between passing cars, the more birds emerged from the thick forest bushes next to the puddle, and flew down to drink and bathe themselves. In reality the puddle looked very muddy to me. Surely the birds could have found a fresher puddle? But they seemed to love this muddy water; maybe the mix was like a good mineral soup for them? I sat there and watched and took photos for almost two hours and saw over 20 species of birds at the puddle, plus others nearby. When watching birds, it is always useful to have a good pair of binoculars, and if possible, a good camera. A bird identification book for East African species is also useful to keep in the car when driving. The park has a great variety of birds — over 500 different species at certain times. The park is looking very lush and green at the moment due to the recent rains and many bird species are thriving at the moment. I always find it a joy to see birds when driving in the park. God has created such amazing diversity.  The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00.
