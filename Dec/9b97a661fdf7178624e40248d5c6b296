There is more to Tanzanian artist Mussa Ramadhani, better known as Chin Bees, than his hard-hitting tunes and explosive raps. In his realest form, he is a master creator who has managed to cultivate his own distinctive sound. He knows how to get the hits effortlessly without going against his strengths. About a year ago, he shot into the limelight with the remix of his fascinating hit Kababaye, which featured Kenya's very own Khaligraph Jones. This hot single helped him to penetrate the Kenyan music scene. He has created music that allows him to bounce around, hyping his fans with captivating ad-libs. It’s a thing these days for rappers to insist that their work transcends genre and they are not limited to any basic guidelines when it comes to creating music. It is all about making the hits and staying relevant, an art Chin Bees has perfected. He has owned the trap-drum beat and somehow localised it with his idiosyncratic approach. At his best, the artist signed under Wanene Entertainment releases tunes so catchy and relaxed enough to have pop appeal. Chin Bees doesn't seem to go wrong when it comes to chasing hits. He understands the blueprint laid out for his hit and just like that he is able to release instant bangers like his latest Inogire. The same effect is brought out in his 2018 full-length LP Ladha. Now his style, too, greatly complements his contemporary sound. What makes Chin Bees music his own is that instead of a one-off assessment, he thrives on every track he releases. As much as he is a talented emcee, he is a creative with a vision. He is among the endless stars coming out of the Tanzanian music scene and dominating the Africa music scene. He is truly worth listening to; you will be likely to find a good number of party tracks.
