The ministry of energy hopes a new strategy aimed at cutting the cost of infrastructure and land prices will help bring down electricity costs. Under the Kenya National Electrification Strategy, the government is seeking a Public Private partnership in rolling out electricity projects. Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter said  the programme which is being supported by the World Bank will provide a broad spectrum for policy direction, investments and collaboration. The strategy will also enable government connect the remaining 25 per cent households across the country. “The cost of power is a combination of many factors. The tariffs cannot come down in a day but will take a process,” said Keter during the Achieving Universal Access to Electricity by 2022 Conference yesterday. KNES will provide integration of off-grid stations which encompass mini-grids and stand-alone grids and the main national grid to increase delivery. He said the plan, under an independent regulation, will enable coverage in rural areas which do not have  transformers and mini-grids. It will also be self-sustainable in terms of its implementation. Total electricity connection now stands at 75 per cent representing 6.9 million households achieved mainly through the Last Mile Connectivity programme. “The last-mile programme is still progressing but has had contractual issues in all the four phases that are so far cleared,” Keter said. The ministry has had to deal with challenges such as high connection charges, high costs of supplying electricity to rural and peri-urban households and inappropriate technical standards and nature of settlements. Others are difficulties and delays in obtaining way leave consents and rights of way as well as demands for high compensation.
