The World Bank will fund projects worth Sh270 million in Kitui town under the Kenya Urban Support Programme. The projects will change the face of the town, which has been upgraded to a municipality, Governor Charity Ngilu said. She met World Bank officials to discuss the details of the upgrade on Monday. Ngilu said the grant will boost the county’s economy. Kitui town’s economic growth will spur growth in other towns within the county and uplift the lives of every resident, Ngilu said. She thanked the World Bank for the support. The programme’s leader, Hellen Carlson, said the instution is committed to supporting the initiative to improve lives. “We are happy to have such a partnership with the county government of Kitui,” she said. “We are ready for further engagement since the leadership has convinced us beyond reasonable doubt that change is inevitable and the governor is so passionate about serving her people and developing Kitui.” Senior programme leader Abdu Muwonge said such partnerships will attract more World Bank input.
