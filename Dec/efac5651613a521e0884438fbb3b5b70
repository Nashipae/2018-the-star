A family in Kiserian, Kajiado County is mourning their son who committed suicide for failing to score an A in the 2018 Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exam. Edgar Mokua, 19, is said to have taken the step at their home minutes before Education CS Amina Mohamed released the results. His father Elijah Nyabuto, who was away at the time, said Mokua had been sent out to collect hay from a boda boda rider at the gate minutes before the results were announced. He said Mokua collected the hay to the store and removed a rope that was used to tie it and disappeared. "Her mother wondered where he had gone and yet the family was ready to watch the results being released on TV. She went out to search for him but could not find him," Nyabuto said. The Lenana School candidate was later found dangling in an upstairs family room which is still under construction within the main building. Kiserian police boss Lucy Karimi confirmed the suicide report and said investigations to determine the cause of death has begun. Karimi said the Mokua got a C plain. "We are suspecting the boy must have been under pressure to perform like his elders and sensed he could not have made it. We have gathered that his other three older brothers had obtained A, A- and A in their examination," Karimi said. The motive behind the alleged suicide is yet to be established as the police did not find any suicide note or any suspicions from the family members. The body was moved to Montezuma mortuary.
