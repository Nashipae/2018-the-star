Kenya Airports has received a Privately Initiated Investment Proposal (PIIP) from Kenya Airways over Jomo Kenyatta International Airport maintenance and development. In a statement on Friday, Kenya Airways wants to be granted a concession to operate, maintain and develop the airport. KAA managing director Johnny Anderson said the authority has appointed transaction advisers to assist and guide a comprehensive due diligence and evaluation process of the PIIP. "The evaluation is structured in line with the requirements steps and milestones," he added. Since the beginning of the year, KQ has been pushing for the public-private partnership that will see it take over all the staff and operations of the KAA. This includes ground handling, maintenance, catering, warehousing, and cargo. Other carriers, such as Emirates, Ethiopian Airways, and Qatar Airways are fully owned by their respective governments. This makes it easy for them to interact with their home airports. Click here for the latest political news
