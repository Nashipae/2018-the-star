Residents of Umoja One have complained of stray dogs in the estate, posing a security threat to their children. They said for two months, untamed dogs — almost certainly not vaccinated against rabies — have been wandering in the estate. “We don’t know where these dogs came from. They are everywhere,” Justin Ouko said. The dogs chase after people heading to work and those walking in early morning hours. The residents said they are worried that the dogs might hurt their children when schools open. “Schools are set to open in a week and we are concerned about our children’s safety, especially those who walk to school,” Mary Nduta said. Residents suspect the dogs belong to the street urchins who have also increased in the estate. Umoja One MCA Mark Mugambi said he has sought help from the county government, but he is not satisfied with the response. “These dogs have bitten a few residents and we fear they will spread rabies,” Mugambi told the Star yesterday. Agriculture executive Peter Wachira said the county has problems impounding the stray dogs. The pound currently has 150 dogs and the facility is in bad shape. There are plans to rehabilitate it soon. Wachira said shooting the dogs was opposed by the Security Compliance chief officer. The county can’t acquire free bullets and guns due to the firearm ban imposed by Interior CS Fred Matiang’i. He said the county is buying dog and cat traps to end the problem.
