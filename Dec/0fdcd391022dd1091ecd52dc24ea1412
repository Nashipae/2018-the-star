A traffic police officer is nursing injuries after she was thrown out of a moving vehicle in Bungoma on Thursday. Sergeant Emelda Machuko was on duty at a roadblock in Masese where she stopped two men in a Probox. The vehicle had worn out tyres and the officer told the occupants to drive to the police station. Bungoma East police boss Zacheus Ng'eno told the Star the two men agreed to go with the officer to the station in their car. However, they sped off with the officer in a different direction towards Misemwa and attempted to snatch her gun. "They struggled as one of them tried to take the pistol, but they did not manage," he said. The men pushed the officer out of the vehicle. "Members of the public took her to Lugulu Mission Hospital where she is recovering," Ng'eno said. The suspects have since surrendered to the police. Their vehicle was towed to the Bungoma police station. Click here for the latest political news
