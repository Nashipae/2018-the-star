The Ministry of Education will close informal schools from next week over violation of its rules. It says the schools are operating illegally, as most of them are unregistered. The directive might lead to a row between the ministry and the institutions. The ministry has in two years declined to register hundreds of schools as alternative providers for basic education and training (APBET), citing lack of required criteria. In a circular to county education boards, the ministry seeks to have the institutions registered as private schools. About 3,000,000 children in these institutions might have to seek alternative schools. Currently, Bridge International Academies is the biggest provider of informal education and has, in the past three years, been in a push and pull tussle with the ministry. The World Gank and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation-funded chain of schools operates more than 400 schools across the country. Previously, the government provided capitation of Sh700 to each student in the institution for tuition fee, while parents were required to pay a minimal fee of about Sh500 to cater for other services. Director of quality assurance at the Education ministry Pius Mutisya said the institutions have overstepped regulations by opening schools past zones they are required to operate.
