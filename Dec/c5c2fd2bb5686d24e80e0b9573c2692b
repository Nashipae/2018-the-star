A businessman yesterday was charged with obtaining Sh1.6 million from a trader by deceiving him that he could offer a tender to supply 116 computers to State House. Fredrick Muhanji, alias Douglas Simiyu, is accused of obtaining the cash from Beatrice Mainga in Kilimani, Nairobi,  between September 1 and October 8. Muhanji identified himself as a senior National Intelligence Service officer based at State House and had a tender to supply HP computers worth Sh9 million. Mainga was introduced to him by a friend and later met at a city hotel. Muhanji demanded the cash as commission. He is alleged to have conspired with a person who is claimed to be a  former Kenya Airforce man  “attached to defence.” Mainga deposited Sh300,000 to an account given by Muhanji and later deposited a second batch of Sh1 million and continued to give the cash to secure the tender. Muhanji yesterday denied the charges before senior principal magistrate Martha Mutuku. His lawyer unsuccessfully sought to have the plea taking deferred to Friday because Muhanji was required at Kiambu law courts and his file had been placed aside as the court waited for him. But Mutuku declined. In Kiambu, Muhanji was to appear for bail  application ruling where he is charged with similar case. Were said his client has complied with court after was released on bond after being charged with a more serious case. Read: Detectives recover laptops supplied in Sh230m fake tender Click here for
