More Meru musicians need to come out and be recognised nationally, Meru governor Kiraitu Murungi has said. “Kamanu only is not enough. I want single L and others to rise to a national audience and show the country that Meru’s can also sing,” he said. Kiraitu said the county will set up an annual Meru cultural festival early next year. He spoke at his county offices, where he unveiled the Meru Cultural Festival Board that will support cultural activities and artists. Several Meru artists attended the event. The board, which has nine members, will be led Mwirigi Amanja. Local musician Phenius Gitonga, populary known as MC Laingo, was appointed a member of the board. Earlier in the week Kiraitu said ECDE pupils will be taught the Kimeru language. He said a good number of children cannot express themselves fluently in Kimeru because they do not know the language. Kiraitu urged ECDE teachers to offer Kimeru lessons so children learn Meru literature and relate well with their grandparents, parents and community. The county plans to partner with the Kenya Literature Bureau to publish a book on basic Kimeru for nursery school children. “There are many stories like Kamankura, Kiundu and the feast, and how the Meru originated from Mboa. These are basic Kimeru stories, but our children don’t know and can’t relate with them. They only know about other people’s culture, which they see on television,” Kiraitu said.
