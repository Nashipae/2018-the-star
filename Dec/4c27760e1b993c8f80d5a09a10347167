Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi has instructed the county attorney to ensure patents for commodities produced by communities through indigenous technologies. He said patents will protect them from individuals who might exploit their intellectual property. The governor was speaking on Monday during the two-day event at Rumuruti stadium where communities showcased their products. “Africa must arise and use these technologies that were used by our forefathers and commercialise our products,” he said. The governor encouraged youths to learn the technologies, saying it was an easy way to create wealth. The county held the technology exhibition to showcase cultural-based methods of production that can be boosted to modern technology. Muriithi was accompanied by his deputy John Mwaniki, County Assembly Speaker Patrick Waigwa, a number of his executives and MCAs.
