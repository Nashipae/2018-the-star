Deputy President William Ruto has added a 'Dr.' title to his name after graduating with a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Plant Ecology at the University of Nairobi. Ruto graduated in a ceremony attended by his wife, President Uhuru Kenyatta, and his relatives at the UoN grounds where over 9,000 other candidates were also conferred degrees. After being croweUhuru embraced the deputy president and congratulated him for a work well done. The two laughed and smiled as Ruto prepared to go back to his seat. Speaking after the ceremony, Uhuru urged the graduands to use the skills they have acquired to make Kenya better. "I hope that each and everyone of you with the knowledge that you have gained, you must strive to build and not destroy the society," he said. "An ignorant person is a s/he who doesn't have knowledge, who uses pettiness to divide rather than to build." Uhuru said he is looking forward to working with many of the graduands and to listening to their sound advice as to how Kenya can be a better place. It was a three-fold celebration for the DP whose birthday and wedding anniversary are marked in December 21. He was born to Daniel Cheruiyot and Sarah Cheruiyot in 1966 at Sambut village, Kamagut, Uasin Gishu.
